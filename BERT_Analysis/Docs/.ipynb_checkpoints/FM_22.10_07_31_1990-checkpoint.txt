MILITARY LEADERSHIP
Preface
A Trained and Ready Army has as its foundation, competent and
confident leaders. We develop such leaders through a dynamic process
consisting of three equally important pillars: institutional training,
operational assignments, and self-development. This approach is designed to provide the education, training, and experience that enable
leaders to develop the necessary skills, knowledge, and attitudes.
FM 22-100, Military Leadership, is the Army's basic manual on
leadership. It has two purposes: to provide an overview of Army
leadership doctrine, including the principles for applying leadership
theory at all organizational levels to meet operational requirements;
and to prescribe the leadership necessary to be effective in peace and
in war.
While this manual applies to all Army leaders, its principal focus is
on company grade officers, warrant officers, and noncommissioned
officers, the junior leaders of soldiers at battalion-squadron level and
below. FM 22-100 incorporates the professional military values, the
bedrock of our service, that all Army leaders must internalize in the
earliest years of their careers.

Army leaders must learn to fulfill expectations of all soldiers
including other leaders. FM 22-100 addresses fundamental
expectations:
• Demonstrate tactical and technical competence.

Know your business. Soldiers expect their leaders to be tactically
and technically competent. Soldiers want to follow those leaders
who are confident of their own abilities. To be confident a leader
must first be competent. Trust between soldiers and their leaders is
based on the secure knowledge that the leader is competent.
• Teach subordinates.

In training, leaders must move beyond managing programs or
directing the execution of operations. Our leaders must take the time
to share with subordinates the benefit of experience and expertise.
DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTION: Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.

*Thie publication supersedes FM 22-100. 31 October 1983.

• Be a good listener.

We must listen with equal attention to our superiors and our
subordinates. As leaders we can help solve any problem for a soldier
or a unit. However, we can only do so if we know about it. We won't
know about it if we don't listen.
• Treat soldiers with dignity and respect.

Leaders must show genuine concern and compassion for the soldiers
they lead. It is essential that leaders remain sensitive to family
members and include them in unit activities to the extent possible.
Remember, respect is a two-way street; a leader will be accorded the
same level of respect that he or she shows for others.
• Stress basics.

Leaders must demonstrate mastery of fundamental soldiering skills
such as marksmanship, first aid, and navigation, as well as the
requisite skills for their particular specialty, and be able to teach
them to their soldiers.
• Set the example.

Leaders abide consistently with the highest values of the military
profession and its institutions. They encourage within their soldiers
a commitment to the same values. Leaders take pride in selflessly
dedicating their service to ensure mission accomplishment. They are
aware that they are always on parade-24 hours a day, seven days
a week-and that all their actions set personal and professional
examples for subordinates to emulate.
• Set and enforce standards.

A leader must know, and always enforce, established Army
standards. Perhaps the most fundamental standard which must be
maintained is discipline. Our soldiers must promptly and effectively
perform their duty in response to orders, or in the absence of orders
take the correct action.
The fundamental mission of our Army is to deter war and win in
combat. The American people expect that officers and noncommissioned officers at all levels will lead, train, motivate, and inspire
their soldiers. Our soldiers and units perform difficult tasks, often
under dangerous, stressful circumstances. To achieve excellence in

these tasks, leaders must explain the importance of the mission, articulate priorities, and focus soldier and unit efforts to perform in an
efficient and disciplined manner. Well led, properly trained, motivated,
and inspired soldiers will accomplish any mission.
Leaders in our Army have a challenge. They must take care of
soldiers' needs; develop them into cohesive teams; train them under
tough, realistic conditions to demanding standards; assess their
performance; assist them with their personal and professional growth;
and reward them for their successes. To meet that challenge our
leaders must be competent, and confident in their ability to lead. Such
leaders will remain essential to our Trained and Ready Army, today
and tomorrow.

Introduction

The changing face of war poses special
challenges for our Army. Because of the
increasing complexity of the world
environment, we must prepare to respond
across the entire spectrum of conflict.Just as we
have changed our doctrine, weapons, and force
structure, so have our potential enemies. These
changes have dramatically altered the
characteristics and demands of modern combat.
More than ever, we need competent and
confident soldiers, leaders, and units to meet
these challenges.
We must work to strengthen our ability to
employ new equipment and to execute our
operations doctrine. We must also focus on
developing leaders at all levels who understand
the human dimension of war and are able to go
from theory to practice where its application is
required.
Understanding the human element will help
us win in situations where we may be
outnumbered or face an enemy with excellent
weapons and equipment. This understanding is
equally important in low-intensity conflicts
where we expect to have better equipment than
the enemy has, but face a struggle of competing
principles and ideologies. In either
environment, we can only succeed if we have
better-prepared leaders, soldiers, and units than
the enemy does.
Examining situations where soldiers are
likely to be called on to fight or to deter
aggression helps identify future leadership
challenges and focus on the kind of leaders
needed. The worst-case war may be a "come as
you are war," fought with little time for buildup
or preparation. Because of the speed and
devastation of modern warfare, battle success
may well depend on the effectiveness of existing
small units during the first weeks of battle.
Across the entire spectrum of conflict,
independent actions and operations within the
commander's intent will be necessary. In
limited and general war, the turbulent
intermixing of opposing units may blur
distinctions between rear and forward areas.

vi

Combat will occur throughout the entire length
and breadth of the battlefield. In the midst of
this fast-paced battlefield, leaders must take the
initiative, make rapid decisions, and motivate
their soldiers. They must effectively maneuver
their units, apply firepower, and protect and
sustain their force.
In low-intensity conflicts, leaders will also be
under great stress and have to display as much
or more discipline than in conventional war.
Short periods of intense fighting may interrupt
long periods of relative inaction. The signs
soldiers are trained to watch for may not help
them distinguish friend from enemy. To achieve
operational success, leaders may have to
restrict the amount of combat power used. These
restrictions can frustrate soldiers and leaders of
small units. The stress of this environment,
coupled with a possible lack of popular support
on the home front, will require leaders to
motivate their soldiers without many of the
traditional supports accorded soldiers in battle.
The nature of future operations places
significant demands on leaders. Specifically,
the Army needs leaders who• Understand the human dimension of
operations.
• Provide purpose, direction, and motivation to
their units.
• Show initiative.
• Are technically and tactically competent.
• Are willing to exploit opportunities and take
well-calculated risks within the commander's
intent.
• Have an aggressive will to fight and win.
• Build cohesive teams.
• Communicate effectively, both orally and in
writing.
• Are committed to the professional Army ethic.

LEADERSHIP
REQUIREMENTS
The Army's leadership doctrine lays out
principles that, when followed, provide the tools
to execute our operations doctrine. It suggests

that leaders must satisfy four leadership
requirements:
• Lead in peace to be prepared for war.
• Develop individual leaders.
• Develop leadership teams.
• Decentralize.
Lead in Peace to be
Prepared for War
The Army needs leaders who sustain their
ability to look beyond peacetime concerns and
who can execute their wartime missions even
after long periods of peace. Difficulties in
maintaining this focus in peace arise because
responsibilities and priorities may blur. Leaders
must guard against the natural peacetime
tendency to use "efficient" centralized methods
of training and "zero defects" approaches to
day-to-day operations. Administrative
activities are important, but they must not take
priority over realistic combat training.
The key to maintaining a proper perspective
is the ability to look beyond garrison concerns.
Leaders must develop units through their
wartime focus on all activities. They must
recognize that the fast pace of combat allows
little time to learn new skills, so they must
develop units that can respond rapidly to
changing situations. The way leaders train
their soldiers and organizations in peace is the
way these organizations will fight in war.
Develop Individual Leaders
The Army has made a total commitment to
develop leaders by providing the skills,
knowledge, and attitudes necessary for them to
exhibit the leadership characteristics and traits
discussed in this manual. This objective is
accomplished through a dynamic leader
development system consisting of three equally
important pillars:
• Schools. These institutions provide the formal
education and training that all soldiers
receive on a progressive and sequential basis
to prepare them for positions of greater
responsibility. The NCOES is a good
example.
• Experience. Operational experience through
duty assignments provides leaders the
opportunity to use and build upon what was
learned through the process of formal
education.
• Self-development. Individual initiative and
self-improvement are keys to training and
developing every leader. The formal

education system has limits to what it can
accomplish; the leader can and must continue
to expand that knowledge base whether
through Army correspondence courses,
civilian education, reading programs, or any
of a number of self-study programs.
• As a leader you have a responsibility to assist
your subordinates in implementing all three
of these leader development pillars: you must
help obtain school quotas for deserving
soldiers and then ensure prerequisites are met
before attendance; you must have a plan to
develop your subordinates while in your unit;
and you must encourage the self-discipline
required in your soldiers to want to learn more
about their profession.
At all levels, the next senior leader has the
responsibility to create leader development
programs that develop professional officer and
NCO leaders. Leaders train their subordinates
to plan training carefully, execute it
aggressively, and assess short-term
achievements in terms of desired long-term
results. Effective leader development programs
will continuously influence the Army as
younger leaders progress to higher levels of
responsibility.
The purpose of leader development is 'to
develop leaders capable of maintaining a
trained and ready Army in peacetime to deter
war, to fight and control wars that do start, and
to terminate wars on terms favorable to US and
allied interests.
The ethical development of self and
subordinates is a key component of leader
development. To succeed in upholding their
oath of office, leaders must make a personal
commitment to the professional Army ethic and
strive to develop this commitment throughout
the force.
Every leader must be a role model actively
working to make his subordinates sensitive to
ethical matters. Leaders must not tolerate
unethical behavior by subordinates, peers, or
superiors.
We must develop and nurture trust that
encourages leaders to delegate and empower
subordinates. Subordinate leaders may then

vii

begin to make the decisions that are properly
theirs to make and to develop the judgment and
thinking skills they will need in battle. This
approach requires leaders to recognize that
subordinates learn by doing and gives
subordinates a chance to try their own
solutions.

Develop Leadership Teams
The ability to develop a leadership team is
essential to success in war. While we have
traditionally viewed leadership as an
individual influence effort, today's operations
doctrine demands we also view it in terms of
leadership teams. A leadership team consists of
a leader and those subordinates necessary to
plan and execute operations. For example, a
platoon leader's leadership team usually
consists of a platoon sergeant and the squad
leaders. Developing leadership teams is even
more important in larger, more complex
organizations. Leaders must develop a team
that anticipates requirements and exercises
initiative within the commander's intent. Units
may fail because of a single leader's ineptness,
but units succeed in combat because of the
collective efforts of leadership teams. An
effective leadership team will provide
continuity in combat that is tied to a
commander's intent instead of to a specific
leader or person. Responsive teams react
quickly because of their common understanding

of mission requirements.
Decentralize
Decentralization is a peacetime objective
because you want to develop leaders capable of
making tough decisions in a combat situation.
To decentralize requires a more senior leader to
release authority for execution at a lower level.
Leaders must create a leadership climate where
decision making is decentralized to the
appropriate level. This climate is necessary for
subordinate leaders to learn and then to
demonstrate the mental flexibility, initiative,
innovation, :md risk-taking skills that our
training and operations doctrine require.
Army doctrine recognizes the high-quality
soldier of today. The leader is responsible to
develop each soldier's potential and to give
competent subordinates authority and
responsibility. Although leaders should not do
most things themselves if subordinates can and
should do them, they must be capable of

viii

performing those tasks. This requires the
judicious interplay of centralization and
decentralization. Leaders must tailor
decentralization to the ability, training, and
experience of subordinates who may need to be
coached and supported as well as empowered.
Although decentralization must allow for
subordinate initiative in matters of judgment
within the commander's intent, leaders must
hold subordinates strictly accountable for their
actions at their level of responsibility. When
honest mistakes are made, leaders must be
willing to coach, encourage, and train
subordinates. All must realize that
decentralization is not a cure-all and successful
implementation requires patience. The key is to
develop subordinates' ability to solve problems.
The leader must establish standards, decide
what needs to be done, and then let competent
subordinates decide how to accomplish the
mission.

KEY ELEMENTS OF OUR
LEADERSHIP DOCTRINE
The study of the skills, knowledge, and
attitudes of effective leaders of the past has
identified certain leadership factors, principles,
and competencies they have mastered. These
are the key elements of our leadership doctrine
and provide a framework at all levels for
developing self, subordinates, and units. The
leadership factors and principles are discussed
in Chapter 2; the competencies are discussed in
Appendix A.

LEVELS OF LEADERSHIP
There is general agreement that leaders lead
in different ways at different organizational
levels. Junior-level leaders accomplish missions
and build teams primarily by using the direct
face-to-face leadership mode. In larger
organizations, the scope of missions broadens
and leading is more complex. Senior-level
leaders and commanders provide vision,
influence indirectly through layers of large
units, build organizations, and create
conditions that enable junior-level leaders to
accomplish tasks and missions.
Two modes of leadership cut across all
levels-direct and indirect. All leaders use both
modes, but the following diagram shows how
the proportion of influence shifts from
predominantly the direct mode at junior levels
to predominantly the indirect mode at senior

THE STRUCTURE
levels. Do not try to use this diagram to put
yourself or others in a particular category. Its
value is only to show how the mix of the two
leadership modes can vary at different levels.
This manual focuses mainly on the direct
leadership mode.

SOURCES OF
LEADERSHIP DOCTRINE
Five manuals contain our leadership
doctrine. Each manual addresses specific
leadership needs, supports our operations
doctrine, and contributes to our Army's ability
to fight or to deter aggression:
• FM 22-100 tells leaders how to lead in a direct,
face-to-face mode.
• FM 22-101 tells leaders how to conduct
leadership counseling.
• FM 22-102 tells leaders how to develop soldier
teams at company level and below that can
meet the challenges of combat.
• FM 22-103 gives principles and a framework
for leading and commanding at senior levels.
• FM 25-100 provides expectations and
standards for leaders on training doctrine.

This manual presents a direct leadership
framework that complements our operations
doctrine. Where possible, it relates the concepts
to the experiences of leaders of our Army in past
conflicts.
Part One of the manual discusses doctrinal
factors and principles of leadership as they
relate to the leadership used from squad and
section through battalion and squadron levels.
Part Two of the manual discusses leadership in
action. It tells what a leader must BE, KNOW,
and DO by relating the concepts to past
conflicts and then discusses the payoff of
applying sound leadership. Part Three
discusses special considerations of leadership
in battle: stress, leadership in continuous
operations, and the effects of weather, terrain,
and high technology.
This manual presents the requirements for
leading and points for you to consider when
assessing and developing yourself, your
subordinates, and your unit. It is not intended to
tell you exactly how you should lead. You must
be yourself and apply this leadership doctrine in
the situations you will face.

LEADERSHIP IN PRINCIPLE
CHAPTER 1

A Concept of Leadership

The competence of our future leaders and their
leadership abilities are determined by our
ability to educate and train them using the
three pillars of leader development: institutional training; operational assignments; and
self-development.
General Carl E. Vuono - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Chief of Staff

Our operations doctrine is leadership
intensive. FM 100-5 states, "The most essential
element of combat power is competent and
confident leadership. Leadership provides
purpose, direction, and motivation in combat."
0

The mandate for competent military leadership
is simple and compelling; quality leadership
must exist throughout the force if the nation is
to have an army ready for combat. Just as
successful armies train as they intend to fight,

successful leaders lead in peace to be prepared
for war. The leadership doctrine in this manual
can help you• Identify the leadership challenges that exist
across the entire spectrum of conflict and
provide the means to meet those challenges.
• Learn what a leader must BE, KNOW, and
DO to lead soldiers, teams, and units that can
operate effectively in all operational
situations.
• Understand the special leadership
requirements of combat.
• Find other sources of leadership information
to help you develop your leadership skills.

THE BATTLEFIELD
CHALLENGE
In battle, you must inspire your soldiers to do
things against their natural will-possibly to
risk their lives-to carry out missions for the
greater good of the unit, the Army, and the
country. To lead soldiers in peace and in war,
there are certain things you must BE, KNOW
and DO.
Although some people seem to have a natural
ability to lead others, most leadership skills do
not come naturally. They are learned through
hard work and study. Studying and discussing
this manual and then putting the ideas into
practice can help you meet the challenge.
To make good decisions and take the right
actions under the stress of battle, you must
understand the demands that will be placed on
you, your superiors, and your subordinates.
Once you have a clear picture of the battlefield
challenges, you can set goals for yourself, your
subordinates, and your unit to prepare for
combat. Without actually being in combat, you
must get a realistic picture of what battle is like.
Studying military history can give you insight
into what combat has been like for past leaders
and troops and help you relate the leadership
challenges of the past to those of today.

THE BATTLEFIELD CHALLENGE:

ountry.

The armies of some of our potential enemies
outnumber us. They possess large numbers of
excellent tanks, personnel carriers, artillery
pieces, airplanes, and chemical and nuclear
weapons. Our Army needs competent and
confident leaders who are bold, innovative, and
willing to take well-calculated risks within the
commander's intent. Human nature has not
changed since man first engaged in war; leaders
and soldiers in future battles will experience the
same fears and emotions felt in past battles.
Leadership will continue to be the most
essential element of combat power, providing
the key to mission accomplishment, winning
battles, and protecting the ideals of our nation.
To help you understand the demands of
battle, this manual presen~ some actual cases
of soldiers in combat. These cases illustrate
what you must strive to BE, KNOW, and DO to
lead soldiers successfully in battle.

LEADERSHIP DEFINED
Leadership is the process of influencing
others to accomplish the mission by providing
purpose, direction, and motivation.

Providing Purpose
Purpose gives soldiers a reason why they
should do difficult things under dangerous,
stressful circumstances. You must establish
priorities, explain the importance of missions,
and focus soldiers on the task so that they will
function in an efficient and a disciplined.
manner.
Providing Direction
Direction gives soldiers an orientation of
tasks to be accomplished based on the priorities
set by the leader. The standards you establish
and enforce will give your soldiers order; tough
training will give them confidence in
themselves, their leaders, each other, and their
equipment.
Providing Motivation
Motivation gives soldiers the will to do
everything they are capable of doing to
accomplish a mission; it causes soldiers to use
their initiative when they see the need for
action. Motivate your soldiers by caring for
them, challenging them with interesting
training, developing them into a cohesive team,
rewarding successes, and giving them all the

responsibility they can handle. Effective
leaders use both direct and indirect influence to
lead. You will probably influence your soldiers
mainly in a direct manner, but others above you
in your chain of command will use more indirect
methods.

SUMMARY
Our operations doctrine is leadership
intensive. Leadership is the most essential
element of combat power. Leading effectively is
not a mystery and can be learned through selfstudy, education, training, and experience.
Successful leaders prepare for war by training

and leading as they intend to fight. To prepare
your soldiers to operate effectively across the

OF LEADERSHIP
The four major factors of leadership are
always present and affect the actions you should
take and when you should take them. They are
the led, the leader, the situation, and
comm uni cations.

The Led
The first major factor of leadership is those
soldiers you are responsible for leading. All
soldiers should not be led in the same way. For
example, a soldier with a new job or task
normally needs closer supervision than a soldier
who is experienced at that same job or task. A
soldier with low confidence needs·your support
and encouragement. A soldier who works hard
and does what you know must be done deserves
your praise; a soldier who intentionally fails to
follow your guidance or meet clear standards
may need to be reprimanded or punished. You
must correctly assess your soldiers' competence,
motivation, and commitment so that you can
take the proper leadership actions at the
correct time.

THE FOUR FACTORS OF LEADERSHIP

d

h
You must create a climate that encourages
your subordinates to actively participate and
want to help you accomplish the mission. Key
ingredients to develop this relationship are
mutual trust, respect, and confidence.

The Leader
The second major leadership factor is youthe leader. You must have an honest understanding of who you are, what you know, and
what you can do. You must know your strengths,
weaknesses, capabilities, and limitations so
that you can control and discipline yourself and
lead your soldiers effectively. You must continuously ensure that each soldier is treated
with dignity and respect.
Assessing others may be easier than looking
honestly at yourself. If you have difficulty
assessing yourself, ask your leader what he
would like to see you change about the way you
lead your soldiers or you support him. Do not put
him on the spot. Give him time to think of
specific suggestions and then meet with him to
talk about them. You can also seek the counsel
of your peers, or ask an experienced subordinate
how well he thinks you issue orders or provide
4

needed information. Consider all these points of
view and then work on improving yourself.

The Situation
The situation is the third major leadership
factor. All situations are different; leadership
actions that work in one situation may not work
in another. To determine the best leadership
action to take, first consider the available
resources and the factors of METT-T. Then
consider the subordinate's level of competence,
motivation, and commitment to perform the
task or mission. In one situation, you may have
to closely supervise and direct a subordinate's
work. Another situation may require you to
encourage and listen to ideas. In still another,
you may need to both direct and encourage a
soldier to ensure he can accomplish a task.
Appendix B discusses styles of leadership in
more detail.
The situation also includes the timing of
actions. For example, confronting a subordinate
may be the correct decision, but if the confrontation occurs too soon or too late, the results
may not be what you want. You must be skilled
in identifying and thinking through · the

situation so that you can take the right action at
the right time. Appendix C contains ideas to
consider when you assume a leadership
position.
What if you take the wrong action? It
happens. We all make mistakes. Analyze the
situation again, take quick corrective action,
and move on. Learn from your mistakes and
those of others.
Communications
Communications, the fourth major leadership
factor, is the exchange of information and ideas
from one person to another. Effective communications occurs when others understand exactly
what you are trying to tell them and when you
understand precisely what they are trying to tell
you. You may communicate what you want
orally, or in writing, through physical actions,
or through a combination of all of these. You
must recognize that you communicate
standards by your example and by what
behaviors you ignore, reward, and punish.
The way you communicate in different situations is important. Your choice of words, tone
of voice, and physical actions all combine to
affect soldiers. Leadership is more than setting
the example and bravely leading a charge. The
ability to say the correct thing, at the appropriate moment and in the right way, is also an
important part of leadership.
In peacetime you must create the kinds of
bonds that enable soldiers to follow you so that
they will conduct themselves properly in
combat. You must win their trust and confidence
before, rather than after, combat has
commenced. An important element is to convey
the facts and requirements accurately without
the added confusion of your personal bias. What
and how you communicate either builds or
harms the strength of the relationship between
you and your soldiers. Discipline and cohesion
in units come from these relationships.
Effective communications implies that your
soldiers listen and understand you. Since
soldiers listen to leaders who listen to them, you
must work hard at understanding exactly what
your soldiers are saying to you. Good listening is
hard work but you can learn. Do not interrupt
when others are speaking. Look at the person
speaking; listen to what is said and also to how
it is said since emotions are an important part of
communications. If you listen to your
subordinates, they will listen to you.

Interaction of the Factors
The four major leadership factors are always
present but, in every situation, they affect each
other differently. The most important factor in
one situation may have little importance in
another. You must constantly consider all four
factors of leadership and choose the best course
of action. Mistakes happen when leaders fail to
consider all four leadership factors and see how
they affect each other and mission accomplishment. Self-assessment, study, and experience
will improve your understanding of the four
major factors of leadership.

THE PRINCIPLES OF
LEADERSHIP
The 11 principles of Army leadership are
excellent guidelines and provide the cornerstone
for action. They are universal and represent
fundamental truths that have stood the test of
time. Developed in a 1948 leadership study, the
principles were first included in leadership
doctrine in 1951. Use these principles to assess
yourself and develop an action plan to improve
your ability to lead. Examples throughout this
manual give you ideas of how to apply these
principles. Here is an explanation of each of the
leadership principles.

PRI CIPLES OF LEADER HIP
Know yourself and seek self..
improvement.
• Be technically an tactically
proficient.
• See responsibility and take
responsibility for your actions.
Make sound and timely decisions.

Se the example.
• Know your soldiers and look out for
the·, well~ bemg.
Keep your subordinates informed.
• Develop a sense of responsbility in
your subordinate.
•Ensure the task is u derstood,
upervised, and accomplished.
• Build the team.
•Employ your nit in accordance
with its capab.lities.

5

Know Yourself and Seek SelfImprovement
To know yourself, you have to understand
who you are and to know what your preferences,
strengths, and weaknesses are. Knowing yourself allows you to take advantage of your
strengths and work to overcome your
weaknesses. Seeking self-improvement means
continually developing your strengths and
working on overcoming your weaknesses. This
will increase your competence and the
confidence your soldiers have in your ability to
train and lead.
Be Technically and
Tactically Proficient
You are expected to be technically and
tactically proficient at your job. This means that
you can accomplish all tasks to standard that
are required to accomplish the wartime mission.
In addition, you are responsible for training
your soldiers to do their jobs and for understudying your leader in the event you must
assume those duties. You develop technical and
tactical proficiency through a combination of
the tactics, techniques, and procedures you
learn while attending formal schools
(institutional training), in your day-to-day jobs
(operational assignments), and from
professional reading and personal study
(self-development).
Seek Responsibility and Take
Responsibility for Your Actions
Leading always involves responsibility. You
want subordinates who can handle responsibility and help you perform your mission.
Similarly, your leaders want you to take the
initiative within their stated intent. When you
see a problem or something that needs to be
fixed, do not wait for your leader to tell you to
act. The example you set, whether positive or
negative, helps develop your subordinates. Our
warfighting doctrine requires bold leaders at all
levels who exercise initiative, are resourceful,
and take advantage of opportunities on the
battlefield that will lead to victory. When you
make mistakes, accept just criticism and take
corrective action. You must avoid evading
responsibility by placing the blame on someone
else. Your objective should be to build trust
between you and your leaders as well as between
you and those you lead by seeking and accepting
responsibility.
Make Sound and Timely Decisions
You must be able to rapidly assess situations
and make sound decisions. If you delay or try to

6

avoid making a decision, you may cause unnecessary casualties and fail to accomplish the
mission. Indecisive leaders create hesitancy,
loss of confidence, and confusion. You must be
able to anticipate and reason under the most
trying conditions and quickly decide what
actions to take. Here are some guidelines to help
you lead effectively:
• Gather essential information before making
your decisions.
• Announce decisions in time for your soldiers
to react. Good decisions made at the right time
are better than the best decisions made too
late.
• Consider the short- and long-term effects of
your decisions.

Set the Example
Your soldiers want and need you to be a role
model. This is a heavy responsibility, but you
have no choice. No aspect ofleadership is more
powerful. If you expect courage, competence,
candor, commitment, and integrity from your
soldiers, you must demonstrate them. Your
soldiers will imitate your behavior.You must set
high, but attainable, standards, be willing to do
what you require of your soldiers, and share
dangers and hardships with your soldiers. Your
personal example affects your soldiers more
than any amount of instruction or form of
discipline. You are their role model.
Know Your Soldiers and
Look Out for Their Well-Being
You must know andcareforyoursoldiers. It is
not enough to know their names and hometowns. You need to understand what makes
them "tick" and learn what is important to them
in life. You need to commit time and effort to
listen to and learn about your soldiers. When
you show genuine concern for your troops, they
trust and respect you as a leader. Telling your
subordinates you care about them has no
meaning unless they see you demonstrating
care. They assume that if you fail to care for
them in training, you will put little value on
their lives in combat. Although slow to build,
trust and respect can be destroyed quickly.
If your soldiers trust you, they will willingly
work to help you accomplish missions. They will
never want to let you down. You must care for
them by training them for the rigors of combat,
taking care of their physical and safety needs
when possible, and disciplining and rewarding

fairly. The bonding that comes from caring for
your soldiers will sustain them and the unit
during the stress and chaos of combat.

Keep Your Subordinates Informed
American soldiers do best when they know
why they are doing something. Individual
soldiers have changed the outcome of battle
using initiative in the absence of orders.
Keeping your subordinates informed helps
them make decisions and execute plans within
your intent, encourages initiative, improves
teamwork, and enhances morale. Your subordinates look for logic in your orders and
question things that do not make sense. They
expect you to keep them informed and, when
possible, explain reasons for your orders.
Develop A Sense of Responsibility
in Your Subordinates
Your subordinates will feel a sense of pride
and responsibility when they successfully
accomplish a new task you have given them.
Delegation indicates you trust your subordinates and will make them want even more
responsibility. As a leader, you are a teacher
and responsible for developing your
subordinates. Give them challenges and
opportunities you feel they can handle. Give
them more responsibility when they show you
they are ready. Their initiative will amaze you.
Ensure the Task is Understood,
Supervised, and Accomplished
Your soldiers must understand what you
expect from them. They need to know what you
want done, what the standard is, and when you
want it done. They need to know if you want a
task accomplished in a specific way. Supervising lets you know if your soldiers understand
your orders; it shows your interest in them and
in mission accomplishment. Oversupervision
causes resentment and undersupervision
causes frustration.
When soldiers are learning new tasks, tell
them what you want done and show how you
want it done. Let them try. Watch their
performance. Accept performance that meets
your standards; reward performance that
exceeds your standards; correct performance
that does not meet your standards. Determine

I

the cause of the poor performance and take
appropriate action. 1 When you hold subordinates
accountable to you for their performance, they
realize they are responsible for accomplishing
missions as individuals and as teams.

Build the Team
Warfighting is a team activity. You must
develop a team spirit among your soldiers that
motivates them to go willingly and confidently
into combat in a quick transition from peace to
war. Your soldiers need confidence in your
abilities to lead them and in their abilities to
perform as members of the team. You must train
and cross train your soldiers until they are
confident in the team's technical and tactical
abilities. Your unit becomes a team only when
your soldiers trust and respect you and each
other as trained professionals and see the
importance of their contributions to the unit.
Employ Your Unit in Accordance
with Its Capabilities
Your unit has capabilities and limitations.
You are responsible to recognize both of these
factors. Your soldiers will gain satisfaction
from performing tasks that are reasonable and
challenging but will be frustrated if tasks are
too easy, unrealistic, or unattainable. Although
the available resources may constrain the
program you would like to implement, you must
continually ensure your soldiers' training is
demanding. Apply the battle focus process to
narrow the training program and reduce the
number of vital tasks essential to mission
accomplishment. Talk to your leader; decide
which tasks are essential to accomplish your
warfighting mission and ensure your unit
achieves Army standards on those selected.
Battle focus is a recognition that a unit cannot
attain proficiency to standard on every task,
whether due to time or other resource constraints. Do your best in other areas to include
using innovative training techniques and
relooking the conditions under which the
training is being conducted, but do not lower
standards simply because your unit appears
unable to meet them. Your challenge as a leader
is to attain, sustain, and enforce high standards
of combat readiness through tough, realistic
multiechelon combined arms training designed
to develop and challenge each soldier and unit.

SUMMARY
The factors and principles of leadership will
help you accomplish missions and care for
soldiers. They are the foundation for leadership
action.
The factors of leadership are always present
and affect what you should do and when you
should do it. Soldiers should not all be led in the
same way. You must correctly assess soldiers'
competence, commitment, and motivation so
that you can take the right leadership actions.
As a leader, you must know who you are, what
you know, and what you can do so that you can
discipline yourself and lead soldiers effectively.
Every leadership situation is unique. What

8

worked in one situation may not work in
another. You must be able to look at every
situation and determine what action to take.
You influence by what you say, write, and, most
importantly, do. What and how you communicate will either strengthen or weaken the
relationship between you and your subordinates.
The principles of leadership were developed
by leaders many years ago to train and develop
their subordinates. The principles have stood
the test of time and the foremost test-the battlefield. Use the principles to assess how you
measure up in each area and then develop a plan
to improve your ability to lead soldiers.

LEADERSHIP IN ACTION
CHAPTER 3

B. H. Liddell Hart (1895-1970) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - English Military Writer and Strategist

You can learn about the human dimension of
warfighting by studying past battles. To lead in
combat, you must be competent and courageous,
demonstrate initiative, understand human
nature, consistently set the example, and inspire
others. This chapter provides examples of
effective combat leaders who demonstrated
these characteristics.

during combat engagements. As you read each
account, think about answers to these questions:

PAST BATTLES

• How did the leader accomplish the mission?
• How did the leader in each case inspire
soldiers to willingly face the stress and
danger of battle?
• What was the key factor that led to victory?
• What did the leader do prior to battle to
prepare himself and his soldiers?

The following selected accounts of history
illustrate the human side of warfighting by
describing how leaders led their subordinates

• How do the actions of these leaders
demonstrate the leadership factors and
principles discussed in Chapter 2?

SUMMARY
Colonel Chamberlain, Lieutenant Chandler,
Staff Sergeant Savage, and Captain Fincher
understood the human dimension of
warfighting. Each demonstrated his tactical
and technical proficiency and used initiative to
exploit opportunities for success by taking wellcalculated risks within his commander's intent.
The orders these men issued were effectively
communicated and influenced their
subordinates to accomplish the mission by
providing purpose, direction, and motivation.
The historical records are full of combat
actions that cite examples of superb leadership
and soldiers rising well above the normal call of
duty to accomplish the assigned mission. In
each of the accounts selected for this chapter,

the leader led by example from the front, not by
coercion and fear. We need leaders like the ones
who were highlighted and we can develop them
in our schools and units. You can become
leaders like those discussed, and you can train
your subordinates in similar fashion. This is
your challenge and responsibility.
These accounts of history should have raised
many questions in your mind about the human
dimension of warfighting. How can you develop
yourself as a leader? Why do soldiers fight?
What builds cohesion and discipline and
motivates soldiers to fight bravely against great
odds? What beliefs, values, character,
knowledge, and skills must you have to lead
soldiers successfully in combat?

21

CHAPTER 4

What A Leader Must Be
•..•..

The American people rightly look to their
military leaders not only to be skilled in the
technical aspects of the profession of arms, but
to be men of integrity.
General Joseph Lawton Collins (1896-1987) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Division and Corps Commander. WW II

As a leader, you are responsible for under..
standing and directly transmitting the Army's
values to your soldiers. These values are the
foundation for service to the nation. Since the
Army's purpose is to protect the nation and its
values, the Army's ethic must beconsistentwith
national will and values. The oath you took
pledged you "to support and defend the Constitution of the United States." Taken without
reservation and regardless of personal sacrifice,
this oath is formal and public recognition of
your commitment to a professional ethic.
22

This chapter describes what a leader must BE
by discussing beliefs, values, and norms;
character; and the professional Army ethic. It
also discusses ethical responsibilities and an
ethical decision-making process.

BELIEFS, VALUES,
AND NORMS
Beliefs
Beliefs are assumptions or convictions you
hold as true about some thing, concept, or
person. They can range from the very deep-

seated beliefs you hold concerning such things
as religion and the fundamentals upon which
this country was established to recent experiences which hav~ affected your perception
of a particular person, concept, or thing. One
soldier may believe that duty simply means
putting in time from "8 to 5." Another may
believe that duty is selflessly serving your
country, your unit, and the soldiers of your unit.
You have beliefs about human nature-what
makes people tick. We usually cannot prove our
beliefs, but we think and feel that they are true.
For example, some people believe that a car is
simply a means of transportation. Others
believe a car is a flJtatus symbol. There are
leaders who believe that rewards and punishment are the only way to motivate soldiers. In
contrast, other leaders believe that rewards and
punishment should be used only in exceptional
cases.
The important point to recognize is that
people generally behave in accord with their
beliefs. The beliefs of a leader impact directly on
the leadership climate, cohesion, discipline,
training, and combat effectiveness of a unit. ·

Values
Values are attitudes about the worth or
importance of people, concepts, or things.
Values influence your behavior because you use
them to decide between alternatives. For
example, you may place value on such things as
truth, money, friendships, justice, human
right.s, or selflessness.
Your values will influence your priorities.
Strong values are what you put first, defend
most, and want least to give up. Individual
values can and will conflict at times. If you incorrectly reported patrol checkpoint, do you
have the moral courage to correct the report
even if you know your leader will never discover
you sent the incorrect report? In this situation,
your values on truth and self-interest will
collide. What you value the most will guide your
actions. In this example, the proper course of
action is obvious. There are times, however,
when the right course of action is not so clear.
The four individual values that all soldiers
(leaders and led) are expected to possess are
courage, candor, competence, and commitment.
These four values are considered essential for
building the trust which must exist for a unit to
operate at peak efficiency.

a

·Courage comes in two forms. Physical
courage is overcoming fears of bodily harm and
doing your duty. Moral courage is overcoming
fears of other than bodily harm while doing
what ought to be done.
Moral courage is as important as physical
courage. It is the courage to stand firm on your
values, your moral principles, and your convictions. You show moral courage when you do
something based on one of your values or moral
principles, knowing that the action may not be
in your best interest. It takes special courage to
support unpopular decisions and to make it
difficult for others to do the wrong thing. Others
may encourage you to embrace a "slightly"
unethical solution as the easiest or most
convenient method. Do not ease the way for
others to do wrong; stand up for your beliefs and
what you know is right. Donotcompromiseyour
professional ethic or your individual values and
moral principles. If you believe you are right
after sober and considered judgment, hold your
position.
Candor is being frank, · open, honest, and
sincere with your soldiers, seniors, and peers. It
is an expression of personal integrity. If handled
properly, disagreeing with others and
presenting your point of view are not wrong.
Remember these three important points:
(1) select the right time and place to offer your
criticism or advice; (2) do not criticize a plan
without giving a constructive alternative;
(3) recognize that when your leader has made the
final decision, you must end your discussion and
support legal and proper orders even if you do
not personally agree with them. There is often
no time in com bat to verify reports or to question
the accuracy of information. Consequences are
too important, and time is too short to
communicate anything but the truth. Candor is
equally important in peacetime. Demand it from
your subordinates and expect it from your peers
and superiors. Candor expresses personal
integrity.

The beliefs of a leader impact
dtrectly on the leader hi climate,
cohesion .. discipl ne, tra1mng, nd
combat effectiveness of a unit.

23

Competence is proficiency in required
professional knowledge, judgment, and skills.
Each leader must have it to train and to develop
a cohesive, disciplined unit with all the required
individual and collective skills to win on the
battlefield. Competence builds confidence in
one's self and one's unit; both are crucial
elements of morale, courage, and, ultimately,
success on the battlefield.
Commitment means the dedication to carry
out all unit missions and to serve the values of
the country, the Army, and the unit. This is
shown by doing your best to contribute to the
Army, to train and develop your unit, and to
help your soldiers develop professionally and
personally.

Norms
Norms are the rules or laws normally based
on agreed-upon beliefs and values that members
of a group follow to live in harmony. Norms can
fall in to one of two categories.
Formal norms are official standards or laws
that govern behavior. Traffic signals, the
Uniform Code of Military Justice, and the
Geneva Conventions are formal norms that
direct the behavior of American soldiers. They
dictate what actions are required or forbidden.
Uniform regulations, safety codes, and unit
SOPs are also formal norms.
Informal norms are unwritten rules or
standards that govern the behavior of group
members. In the Korean Com bat Patrol account,
Lieutenant Chandler stressed the informal
norm that casualties were never left by the rest
of the patrol. At the root of this norm was a
shared value about the importance of caring for
each other. The soldiers found comfort in
knowing they would be cared for if they became
casualties.
Importance of
Beliefs, Values, and Norms
Beliefs, values, and norms guide the actions of
individuals and groups. They are like a traffic
control system; they are signals giving
direction, meaning, and purpose to our lives.
Examples abound of soldiers throughout
history who sacrificed their lives to save friends
or help their unit accomplish a mission. These
brave, selfless actions include blocking exploding grenades, personally taking out enemy
fighting positions, and manning key positions
24

to protect a withdrawal. Beliefs and values
motivate this kind of heroic self-sacrifice. The
motivating force may be the soldier's belief in
the importance of retaining his personal honor,
of saving a buddy, of helping the unit, of serving
a cause, or a combination of these.
Your soldiers will fight for you if they believe
that the best chance for survival for themselves
and their buddies is to do their job as part of a
team. They will be more effective if they believe
in themselves, in the unit, in you, and in the
cause they are fighting for.
Individual values,· beliefs, and attitudes are
shaped by past experiences involving such
things as family, school, work, and social
relationships. Leaders must understand the
importance of nurturing and shaping beliefs
and values in their subordinates because they
are fundamental motivating factors.

Influencing
Beliefs, Values, and Norms
As a leader, you have the power to influence
the beliefs and values of your soldiers by setting
the example; by recognizing behavior that
supports professional beliefs, values, and
norms; and by planning, executing, and
assessing tough, realistic individual and
collective training.
Tough training does not mean training in
which leaders haze or yell at troops in an effort
to cause artificial stress. This merely creates an
antagonistic atmosphere of "us against them."
This kind of leadership does not succeed in
combat, so why practice bad habits. Tough
training occurs when leaders and soldiers
mutually experience realistic, exhausting
conditions that prepare both, as a team, for the
stress of combat.
Captain Herren, B Company commander,
was concerned about the operation in the la
Drang Valley because his men had gone without
sleep the night before while performing another
mission. He could only trust that the training
his unit had received would enable them to overcome the lack of rest and that their fatigue
would have little effect on their fighting ability.
Training that simulates such conditions is
tough.
During a field exercise, you could plan for an
all night road march, a few hours rest, then a
simulated battle that is demanding on leaders

and soldiers. This kind of training builds
cohesion-positive respect and trust among
soldiers and between leaders and soldiers. It
builds a feeling of shared hardships and
teamwork. It contributes to the respect and
comradeship that help you influence beliefs and
values of soldiers.
Tough training conducted to standards will
teach your soldiers to do things as individuals
and as a team that they did not believe possible.
It will give your soldiers confidence in themselves, in each other, and in you. If properly
explained, it will help each soldier understand
the linkage and the importance of his ability to
perform individual tasks properly in support of
the unit's collective mission.
As a leader, you must respect your soldiers
and must earn their respect if you are to influence their beliefs and values. Subordinates
will always respect your rank, but they will base
their genuine respect on your demonstrated
character, knowledge, and professional skills.
Once your soldiers respect you and want your
approval, you can guide them to demonstrate
unselfish concern for the unit and for other
soldiers. They will become concerned with
excellence in everything that relates to combat
readiness if this is the value you demonstrate. If
your soldiers respect and admire you, they want
to be like you, and they naturally tend to adopt
your professional beliefs and values as their
own. You can reinforce this behavior with
positive feedback and by praising them for
things they do that support duty, cohesiveness,
discipline, good training, and good maintenance. Praise, however, can be cheapened,
either by overuse or when it is not sincere.

CHARACTER
Character describes a person's inner strength
and is the link between values and behaviors. A
soldier of character does what he believes right,
regardless of the danger or circumstances. A
soldier's behavior shows his character. In tough
situations, leadership takes self-discipline,
determination, initiative, compassion, and
courage.
There is no simple formula for success in all
the situations you may face. The key is to
remain flexible and attempt to gather as many
facts as the circumstances will allow before you

must make a decision. When dealing with
others, every situation has two sides; listen to
both. The way you handle problems depends on
the interaction of the factors of leadership (the
led, the leader, the situation, and
communications).
Character can be strong or weak. A person
with strong character recognizes what he wants
and has the drive, energy, self-discipline,
willpower, and courage to get it. A person with
weak character does not know what is needed
and lacks purpose, willpower, self-discipline,
and courage.
A person who can admit when he is wrong is
exhibiting strong character. Some believe that
apologizing is a sign of weakness and causes a
leader to lose power. Quite the contrary,
admitting when you have made a mistake takes
humility and moral courage. We are all human
and make mistakes. Although placing blame on
someone or something else when a mistake is
made may be tempting, it indicates weak
character, which your soldiers will readily
recognize.
We need leaders of strong and honorable
character who support the values of loyalty to
the nation, the Army, and the unit; duty; selfless
service; and integrity. In this manual a soldier
of character means a person with strong and
honorable character.
Importance of Character
Your soldiers assess your character as they
watch your day-to-day actions. They know if
you are open and honest with them. They see
whether you are indecisive, lazy, or selfish.
They will quickly determine whether you know
and enforce the Army standards. Your soldiers'
perceptions of your actions combine to form a
continuing assessment of your character.
Soldiers want to be led by leaders who provide
strength, inspiration, and guidance and will
help them become winners. Whether or not they
are willing to trust their Ii ves to a leader depends
on their assessment of that leader's courage,
competence, and commitment.
Future wars will be won by leaders with
strong and honorable character. When mentally
preparing for the stress of combat, it is good to
know that ordinary people in past wars have
shown that kind of character. An inspiring
example of such a soldier follows.

If we go to war again, many of our soldiers and
units may find themselves in situations similar
to York's. How will they behave? Will they rise
to the occasion as York did? Will they have the
necessary character and skills? The answers to
these questions will depend on whether leaders
have developed in their soldiers the required
beliefs, values, character, knowledge, and skills.

Today's soldiers have as much potential as
Sergeant York did. They too can serve
courageously under stressful circumstances if
they are trained and led properly. Base your
training program on building the motivation,
confidence, and competence your subordinates
will need on the battlefield.

Character Building
Building character demands the honesty to
determine your own character weaknesses.
Have you demonstrated the self-discipline and
will on which strong and honorable character is
based? How have you handled the tough
situations? Sometimes you are the best judge of
your strengths and weaknesses. Other times
you may have blind spots that keep you from
seeing your own weaknesses.
You must be open to feedback and advice.
However, you must take the responsibility for
continually building and strengthening your
character. Others can help, but they cannot do it
for you. To build strong and honorable
character, you should• Assess the present strength of your values
and character.
• Determine what values you want to promote.
• Seek out missions and situations that support
developing such character.
• Select a role model who d€monstrates the
values and character you are trying to develop.
You build strong and honorable character by
hard work, study, and challenging experiences.
You must develop habits that force you to
continually develop your mind and character.
The better you understand yourself, the easier it
is to exercise your will and self-discipline, and
the more you strengthen your character.
The character you want to instill in your
soldiers, and should attempt to exhibit in the
daily example you set, should be consistent with
the values of courage, candor, competence, and
commitment. For this reason, leading and
training soldiers well must begin with their

28

induction into the service. When they begin
their Army training, individuals are prepared
for change, and since most want to do well, they
are willing to adopt the stressed Army values.
All leaders need a good program for integrating
new soldiers into their unit. As a leader, you
must teach and demonstrate the right values
and norms of working, training, and living.

Changing Character
of Problem Soldiers
How much can you change the character of a
problem soldier? What if a soldier comes from
an environment where the parents themselves
set a bad example or the soldier received little
education? What about a soldier from a
neighborhood where accepted conduct is lying
and stealing. These norms became instilled as
values while he was growing up. Lying to
authority, "getting over," "shamming," and
taking advantage of "the system" are normal
behavior to this soldier. He is undependable and
irresponsible; he lacks self-discipline. Can this
soldier change? What is your responsibility to
this soldier?
You must understand human nature. There is
good and bad in everyone. A leader must bring
out the good in each soldier. You may be able to
eliminate counterproductive beliefs, values, and
behaviors and help a soldier develop character
if he wants to change. Many soldiers want to
improve, but they need discipline, organization,
a good role model, and a positive set of beliefs,
values, and habits to pattern themselves after.
You, as a leader, must both demonstrate by
example and assist in establishing the
conditions for that individual which will
encourage the change.
You will not be able to influence the beliefs,
values, and character of all your soldiers, but
you can influence most soldiers. Your job is to
make good soldiers out of all the people in your
unit, even the problem soldiers.
Gaining the respect of soldiers is important. A
respected leader influences soldiers by teaching,
coaching, counseling, training, disciplining,
and setting a good example. If a soldier does not
adopt soldierly values and behavior after you
and the rest of the chain of command have done
your best, eliminate him from the Army so that
he cannot disrupt discipline and cohesion in
your unit. Respected and successful leaders
create a leadership climate that causes most

soldiers to develop the right professional values
and character. Leaders can often change
soldiers' motivation from self-interest to selfless
service to their unit and nation.
You have another major responsibility in
developing character. You must give your
soldiers confidence that they can develop their
character. Convince your soldiers that you are
on their side, helping them. Their belief that you
sincerely care about them and want them to
develop the correct values and behavior
(because that is right for them) helps give them
confidence to become able soldiers with strong
and honorable character.

THE PROFESSIONAL
ARMY ETHIC
The doctrinal statement of the professional
Army ethic is in FM 100-1. The ethic sets the
moral context for service to the nation and
inspires the sense of purpose necessary to
preserve the nation, even by using military force.
From the ideals of the Constitution to the harsh
realities of the battlefield, the four elements of
the professional Army ethic contain the values
that guide the way you must lead.

Loyalty to the Nation,
the Army, and the Unit
The oath every soldier takes requires loyalty
to the nation and involves an obligation to
support and defend the Constitution. Loyalty to
the Army means supporting the military and
civilian chain of command. Loyalty to unit
expresses both the obligation between those
who lead and the led and the shared
commitment among soldiers for one another.
American military professionals do not fight
to force our political system on others or to gain
power or wealth. Professional soldiers are
protectors of the ideals of America, willing to
fight for these ideals so that others can live in a
free and just society. To do this, they must be
experts at leading soldiers in battle. The military
leader who deeply values loyalty to the nation
sees himself as a person who will always do his
best to defend American ideals.
Your unit is your piece of the Army's action,
your day-to-day part of the Army. By contributing to your unit's mission and combat
readiness, you contribute to the defense of the
nation. The unit is your family, your team.
Loyalty to the unit means that you place the
unit's needs and goals ahead of your own.

Lieutenant Herrick demonstrated his total
dedication and loyalty to his nation, Army, and
unit as he continued to direct his perimeter
defense in the Ia Drang Valley until he died of
his wounds. Similarly, Staff Sergeant Savage,
in this same engagement, continued to place his
soldiers' needs ahead of his personal safety as
he called in supporting fires and directed the
perimeter defense until friendly relief was able
to link up.
Duty

A duty is a legal or moral obligation to do
what should be done without being told to do it.
Duty means accomplishing all assigned tasks
to the fullest of your ability.
Duty requires willingness to accept full
responsibility for your actions and for your
soldiers' performance. It also requires a leader
to take the initiative and anticipate
requirements based on the situation. Captain
Fincher superbly demonstrated these qualities
when he alerted his platoons in anticipation of a
new mission and provided timely guidance on
actions to be taken. As a professional, your
responsibility is to do your duty to the best of
your ability.
If you lie or tell a half-truth to make your unit
look good, you may think you are doing your
duty and being loyal to your leader and unit. In
fact, you are being dishonorable and unethical,
neglecting your duty to the Army and the nation.
A leader cannot truly do his duty without being
honorable.

Selfless Service
You may have to put the nation's welfare and
mission accomplishment ahead of the personal
safety of you and your troops. You must resist
the temptation to put self-gain, personal
advantage, and self-interests ahead of what is

FOUR ELEMENTS OF
THE PROFESSIONAL A MY ETHICS

best for the nation, the Army, or your unit.
Selfless service is necessary to develop
teamwork, and military service demands the
willingness to sacrifice.
As a leader, you must be the greatest servant
in your unit. Your rank and position are not
personal rewards. You earn them so that you
can serve your subordinates, your unit, and your
nation.
Lieutenant Chandler and the men selected for
the com bat patrol in Korea recognized the
inherent dangers in the mission they were about
to undertake. His soldiers were ready to be led
into combat by him because he had earned their
confidence in earlier actions. He prepared a
detailed plan, ensured the tasks were understood,
and personally supervised preparation.
Throughout the conduct of the patrol, he put the
mission and welfare of his soldiers ahead of his
personal safety.

Integrity
Integrity is woven through the fabric of the
professional Army ethic. It means being honest
and upright, avoiding deception, and living the
values you suggest for your subordinates.
Integrity demands that you act according to the
other values of the Army ethic. You must be
absolutely sincere, honest, and candid and
avoid deceptive behavior. Integrity is the basis
for the trust and confidence that must exist
among members of the Army. Further, you must
demonstrate integrity in your personal life. If
y-ou compromise your personal integrity, you
break the bonds of trust between you, your
soldiers, and your leaders.

ETHICAL
RESPONSIBILITIES
Ethics are principles or standards that guide
professionals to do the moral or right thingwhat ought to be done.
As a leader, you have three general ethical
responsibilities. First, you must be a good role
model. Second, you must develop your
subordinates ethically. Finally, you must lead
in such a way that you avoid putting your
subordinates into ethical dilemmas.

Be A Role Model
Whether you like it or not, you are on display
at all times. Your actions say much more than
your words. Subordinates will watch you
'
30

carefully and imitate your behavior. You must
accept the obligation to be a worthy role model
and you cannot ignore the ~ffect your behavior
has on others. You must be willing to do what
you require of your soldiers and share the
dangers and hardships.
Colonel Chamberlain was a respected role
model who inspired his soldiers. His selflessness,
kindness, compassion, and respect for others
were evident in the way he led.

Develop Your Subordinates
Ethically
You must shape the values and beliefs of your
soldiers to support the values of the nation, the
Army, and the unit. You develop your
subordinates by personal contact and by
teaching them how to reason clearly about
ethical matters. You need to be honest with
them and talk through possible solutions to
difficult problems. When you make a decision
that has an ethical component, share your
thought process with your subordinates when
time permits. They will respect you for caring
enough to discuss your personal thoughts with
them, and they will learn from you. Being
sensitive to the ethical elements of soldiering is
a big part of developing your soldiers.
Your goal is to develop a shared ethical
perspective so that your soldiers will act
properly in the confusion and uncertainty of
combat. Unless they have learned how to think
clearly through ethical situations, they may not
have the moral strength to do what is right.
A void Creating Ethical Dilemmas
for Your Subordinates
Since your soldiers will want to please you, do
not ask them to do things that will cause them to
behave unethically to please you. Here are some
examples that can get you in trouble:
• I don't care how you get it done-just do it!
• There is no excuse for failure!
•Can do!
• Zero Defects.
• Covering up errors to look good.
• Telling superiors what they want to hear.
• Making reports saywhatyourleaderwantsto
see.
• Setting goals that are impossible to reach
(missions without resources).
• Loyalty up-not down.

These examples may seem as though they
would never be a problem for you. Do not
assume this is true for others. Learn to give
orders and lead without creating these kinds of
dilemmas for your soldiers.

AN ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING
PROCESS
Regardless of the source of pressure to act
unethically, you usually know in your heart the
right thing to do. The real question is whether
you have the character to live by sound
professional values when under pressure. If you
have the right beliefs and values, the thing to do
in most situations will be clear and you will do it.
Sometimes you will find yourself in complex
situations where the right ethical choice is
unclear. True ethical dilemmas exist when two
or more deeply held values collide. In such
situations, using a decision-making process can
help you identify the course of action that will
result in the greatest moral good.

.NOTE-----------.. .
The Geneva Conventions prohibit captors from
using enemy prisoners of war or civilians under
military .control as hostages. You must not
violate this prohibition even though doing so
might ensure the immediate safety of yourself
and your troops or ease accomplishing your
mission. By signing and ratifying the Geneva
Conventions. the United States declared that it
is never acceptable to hold a hostage. regardless
of what may happen as a result.

Following are the steps of an ethical decisionmaking process to help you think through
ethical dilemmas:
Step 1. Interpret the situation. What is the
ethical dilemma?
Step 2. Analyze all the factors and forces that
relate to the dilemma.
Step 3. Choose the course of action you believe
will best serve the nation.
Step 4. Implement the course of action you have
chosen.

The ethical decision-making process starts
when you confront a problem and continues
until you develop and implement a solution. The
process helps you analyze the problem, identify
influencing forces, develop possible courses of
action, assess them, and decide on a course of
action.

Forces that Influence
Decision Making
A variety of forces influence the ethical
decision-making process. The factors and forces
you should consider will depend on the
dilemma. Here are some probable ones:
• Laws, orders, and regulations-formal
standards contained in laws, policies,
regulations, and legal and proper orders that
guide behavior and decision making.
• Basic national values-values established in
documents, such as the Constitution and
Declaration of Independence, and in
traditions that provide the foundation for
required behavior of all Americans.
• Traditional Army values-values the Army
establishes as standards of required behavior
for all soldiers. They are loyalty to the nation,
the Army, and the unit; duty; selfless service;
integrity; courage; competence; candor; and
commitment.
• Unit operating values-values actually
functioning in your unit that produce the
standards governing day-to-day behavior.
Unit operating values are often the same as
traditional Army values. There are times,

however, when they are not. Consider
situations involving careerism, altered
training and maintenance records,
equipment borrowed from another unit for an
inspection, or "eyewash" instead of truth.
• Your values-your ideas and beliefs that
influence your behavior.
• Institutional pressures-elements of Army
policies, procedures, and operations, and
other aspects which influence your behavior.
These six forces may not be the only
important forces that you should identify and
consider. Since ethics is a part of leadership,
your decision-making process should also
consider the four factors of leadership (the led,
the leader, the situation, and communications).
The ethical decision-making process can help
you think through an ethical dilemma and
arrive at a course of action. Once you have
analyzed all the factors and forces involved,
look at the values in conflict and determine the
course of action that seems best for the nation.

Complex Ethical Dilemmas
It may seem that the ethical decision-making
process is too mechanical. You may think you do
not need it if you have strong will and moral
courage. Normally, the "right" alternative is
clear. The ethical decision-making process is for
the complex dilemmas that haunt leaders when
no clear best choice is evident. Here is an
example of one leader's ethical dilemma in
combat.

33

This situation was a true ethical dilemma for
this leader. He felt bound to be loyal to both his
leaders and his followers. There is no "right"
answer or "school solution" to this situation.
Different leaders would come to different
conclusions after analyzing all the factors and
forces that relate to the situation. The important
point is that using the ethical decision-making
process can help you identify all the options and
then eliminate ones that will not serve the
nation well. If you ever find yourself in an
ethical dilemma, think through the ethical
decision-making process and the concept of the
highest moral good.
Tough leadership decisions do not always
have happy endings. Some may praise your
decision while others find fault with your logic.
You may not always be rewarded for integrity
and candor. The point is that you have to live
with yourself. Before you can gain the respect of
others, you must respect yourself. You gain
honor and keep it by doing your duty in an
ethical way, having the character to act by the
professional Army ethic.

· SUMMARY
Your ability to lead flows from your individual
beliefs, values, and character. Your ability to
inspire soldiers to do the brave and right thingthings they may not think they are capable of

34

performing-is influenced by the example you
set.
Beliefs, values, and norms have great
motivating power. Respected leaders of strong
and honorable character are able to influence
the beliefs, values, and norms of their soldiers.
As a professional, you are sworn to use your
power for the good of the country, the Army, and
those you lead.
The professional Army ethic contains the
values that guide the way leaders should carry
out their professional responsibilities. The
elements of the professional Army ethic are
loyalty to the nation, the Army, and the unit;
duty; selfless service; and integrity.
As a leader, you have ethical responsibilities.
You must be a worthy role model, develop
subordinates ethically, and avoid creating
ethical dilemmas for subordinates.
When faced with a situation where the right
ethical choice is unclear, consider all the forces
and factors that relate to the situation and then
select a course of action that best serves the
ideals of the nation. The ethical decisionmaking process is a way to resolve those
dilemmas.
Fundamental to whatleaders must BE are the
moral strength and courage necessary to make
hard decisions and to give soldiers the will to
fight and the ability to win.

CHAPTER 5

The American soldier is a proud one and he
demands professional competence in his leaders.
In battle, he wants to know that the job is
going to be done right, with no unnecessary_
casualties. The noncommissioned officer
wearing the chevron is supposed to be the best
soldier in the platoon, and he is supposed to
know how to perform all the duties expected of
him. The American soldier expects his sergeant
to be able to teach him how to do his job. And
he expects even more from his officers.
General Omar N. Bradley(1893-1981)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Commander. 12th U.S. Army Group. WW II

A leader must learn before he leads. You need
to KNOW (understand) standards, yourself,
human nature, your job, anltyour unit to be an
effective leader. This knowledge will give you a
strong foundation for what you must BE and
what you must DO. Keep in mind as you read
this chapt.er that knowledge is far more than
memorizing information. Knowledge is the
understanding of information.

---

-·

KNOW STANDARDS
You will need to meet and enforce the
standards of behavior you expect from your
soldiers. The Army has already established

standards in many areas. Regulations, laws,
ARTEP mission training plans, soldier training
publications, field and training manuals,
general defense plans, and SOPs all contain
standards. Your role is often to take existing
standards and translate them into goals that
your soldiers understand and believe in.
Standards define acceptable performance,
control behavior, and influence actions. You
must communicate standards clearly and
ensure they are understood and attained.
You must set and enforce high standards in
all areas that relat.e to specific training missions

35

and tasks critic al to wartime mission
accomplishment. Here is a word of caution,
however. Sometimes leaders have a particular
area of interest or expertise into which they put
so much of the unit's energy that other
standards are not met. You and your soldiers
have only so much time and energy; use this
time and energy to meet the standards in all
areas.
If your soldiers do not meet your standards,
analyze the situation and decide on a course of
action for handling the situation. Decide if your
standards are realistic. What are the demands
of combat? What makes good common sense?
Ask your leaders and respected peers; listen to
their ideas. Adjust your standards if necessary,
but do not change them if they are correct. Ask
yourself these questions:
• Did your subordinates understand what was
expected?
• Did you provide the resources, authority,
training, and direction your subordinates
needed?
• Did your subordinates know how to do what
was expected?
• Were your subordinates motivated to do what
was expected?
The answers to these questions will guide
your actions. Your subordinates may need more
training, supervision, or counseling. You may

need to explain the standard better so that your
subordinates understand it and its importance.
If standards are not met and counseling is
appropriate, do not become arrogant or abusive.
When you counsel, explain what the
subordinate did wrong and why it is
unacceptable in terms of standards. Explain
how to improve performance. Focus on the
specific behavior you want to change. Do not
degrade his feelings of self-worth. How you
counsel affects the future behavior and attitude
of your soldiers. Your manner can increase
respect for you, or it can cause deep feelings of
resentment, hostility, and injustice. FM 22-101
is devoted entirely to leadership counseling.
All leaders want their soldiers to do well.
Soldiers also want to do well. Poor performance
frustrates soldiers and leaders and may cause
anger. In these situations, you may be tempted
to work off your frustrations by yelling at
soldiers, threatening them, or otherwise
verbally abusing them. You are in an official
position of authority over soldiers and must
keep yourself in check while reprimanding or
counseling. You must maintain the right
balance of military firmness and appreciation
of human dignity.

combat set standards and ensured they were
met.

YOU MUST REALIZE YOU
ARE THREE PEOPLE

I

KNOW YOURSELF
"Know thyself." 1 To lead others successfully,
you must know about people and human nature.
Before you can understand other people,
however, you must know yourself.
Using Chapter 4 as a guide to self-evaluation,
you can better understand yourself, your
personality, and your strengths and
weaknesses. Are you an analytical person who
likes to work objectively with facts or are you
intuitive, preferring to rely on your instincts
and feelings as you gather information to make
decisions? How sensitive are you to the feelings
of other people? Do you tend to be a loner or are
you outgo\ng and able to relate easily to other
people? Do you like a planned, orderly way of
life or a flexible, spontaneous one?
Everyone has preferences, strengths, and
weaknesses. Crucial to your development as
a leader is knowing yourself so that you can
maximize your strengths and work to improve
your weaknesses.
As a leader, you must realize you are three
people: who you are, who you think you are, and
who others think you are. In some cases, there is
a close relationship between and among the
three "you's." In other cases, the relationship is
not close at all .. Here are some questions you can
ask yourself:
• How do I establish priorities?
• Am I reliable?
• How well do I listen to others?
• Do soldiers fear me, or trust, like, and respect
me?·
• Do I show others I enjoy what I am doing?
• Am I a delegator or a "micromanager"?
• Am I an optimist or a pessimist?
• Am I selfless or self-serving?
• Am I a decision maker or a "decision ducker"?
• Am I competent at my job?2
• Do I lead by example?
• Do I allow standards to slip when I am tired?
Your seniors, peers, and subordinates will
give you honest feedback if you ask for it and are
open to it. Candid feedback can help you better
understand yourself. If you know yourself and
try to improve, you have a foundation for
knowing your job and your soldiers.

• Who you are.
• Who you think you are.
• Who others think you are.

KNOW HUMAN NATURE
S. L. A. Marshall said that the starting point
for understanding war is the understanding of
human nature. This is a fundamental truth. As
a leader, you need the support of followers,
peers, seniors, and other people outside of your
organization to accomplish your mission. You
must be able to motivate all these people to
support you. To understand and motivate troops
and to develop a cohesive, disciplined, welltrained unit, you must understand human
nature.
People behave according to certain principles
of human nature that govern behavior in war
just as in peace. The stresses of war may
unleash certain fears that have been suppressed
in peace. War, however, does not change human
nature. Since all humans react according to
these principles, it is important that you
understand the human dimension of
warfighting.
Human nature is the common set of qualities
shared by all human beings. Chapter 4
examined some of these qualities-beliefs,
values, and character-of individuals. The
following discusses some basic aspects of
human nature that you should consider as a
leader. You must understand how these aspects
affect the behavior of people under stress before
you can become a skilled, inspirational leader.
Potential for Good
and Bad Behavior
All people have the potential for good and bad
behavior. One of your most important jobs is to
suppress the bad, bring out the good, and direct
that good behavior toward accomplishing the
unit's mission. Most people want to do the right
thing, but unfortunately, many lack the moral
fiber or character to do the right thing under
temptation or stress. You must realize this and
know the conditions that bring out the good and
the bad in people. You can then encourage the
good and suppress the bad. The following
example illustrates this point.

lnscription over the entrance to Plato's Academy.

:zperry M. Smith, Taking Charge, A Practical Guide for Leaders, pp 95-111.

War can bring out the worst in human nature.
There are examples in war of people committing
horrible atrocities, such as murdering disarmed
prisoners and innocent civilians. You must
exercise self-discipline to bring out the good and
suppress the bad in your subordinates.
Why do such war crimes occur? Most
Americans despise crime, violence, and
especially killing. However, on the battlefield,
soldier's desire for safety and survival will
increase their willingness to kill. Most soldiers
do not want to cause unnecessary suffering, but
the stress of war and the emotion and anger that
come with fatigue, fear, or loss of comrades can

reduce their inhibitions against war crimes.
Your task is to understand the effect stress can
have on behavior and lead your soldiers by your
example so that they know you will never
approve or tolerate behavior that is a war crime.
Every war has taught us that the leader's
behavior is the single most important factor in
preventing war crimes.
Some people believe atrocities are inevitable
in war and nothing can be done about them. It is
true that human nature, allowed to run its
course under certain conditions of war, can
produce atrocities. However, it is also true that
leaders can prevent atrocities. In nearly every

39

case in past wars where atrocities have
occurred, a competent leader could have
prevented them. If the leader had controlled his
own emotions, set the correct example, and
given appropriate orders, the atrocities would
not have been committed. A leader who values
the American ideals of truth, justice, freedom,
and human dignity does not condone atrocities.
You must control yourself and your soldiers, no
matter how difficult the situation. You must
never forget that you are responsible for your
subordinate's performance and accountable
with them for their actions.

Fear
Fear is a natural human emotion caused by
anticipation or awareness of danger. Interviews
with seasoned World War II combat veterans
indicated they primarily feared death and
maiming; veterans with little combat
experience were usually more afraid of letting
their buddies down or being thought a coward.
Over half of the combat veterans admitted to
being "paralyzed" by fear at least once. It will be
natural for you and your soldiers to feel fear if
placed in a dangerous situation. If you feel fear
and know your soldiers are experiencing it as
well, let them know how you feel and that you
are confident in the unit's ability.
Earlier in this manual you read how the
unexpected bayonet charge and devastating
surprise fire by the 20th Maine caused Colonel
Oates' Alabama regiments to panic at Little
Round Top. The following illustrates soldiers'
fear in war.
During operations following the Battle of
Antietam, the men of the 20th Maine felt the
fear of battle for the first time. On 20 September
1862, the Union Army began following
Confederate units across the Potomac River. As
the men heard the sounds of fighting across the
river, "the imminence of personal death began
to develop its involuntary, uncontrollable
physiological reactions-the too-fast, too·hard
pounding of the heart, the dry knotting of the
stomach, and a general shakiness."a Before the
fight at Little Round Top, the men of the 20th
Maine felt "blood beating harder and faster
through the arteries; lungs seeming to dilate
deep down, reaching for more oxygen; stomach
:iJ ohn J. Pullen, The Twentieth Maine, p 27.

Pullen, p 115.

40

and intestines shrinking and stopping all
movement, and tension rising to the point where
it could shake a man like the passage of a
powerful electric current." 4
Fear causes definite physical reactions. You
can see it in the eyes and sense it in the
shakiness of a person. Fear is an emotion that
occurs naturally before or during battle. What is
important is how a person handles fear, and this
depends on courage, competence, confidence,
and strength of character.
Courage is not the absence of fear. It is the
ability to put fear aside and act as you believe
you should. · Courage is strength of will
overcoming instincts and fear. Competence and
belief in one's ability to succeed are powerful
agents in counteracting fear. A soldier feels fear
in direct proportion to his beliefs that he may
fail. As a leader, you can counteract fear by
building competence, motivation, and
confidence in your soldiers.

Train your soldiers and teams in peacetime as
they will fight in wartime. Tough, realistic, and
challenging training will build courage and
confidence, bolster morale, and instill the will to
fight and win.
Prepare your soldiers for the fears of battle.
Learn about the carnage and confusion of the
battlefield by reading books about war and by
discussing the details of past battles. Talk about
why some units panic and other cohesive units
have the discipline to overcome fear and hold
together. Discuss the isolation soldiers feel on
the battlefield when under fire. Without proper
training and confidence, this isolation can
cause paralyzing fear.
Keep your soldiers active be{ore battle if they
do not need rest. Positive action conquers fear.
You and your troops can overcome fear; soldiers
have been doing it for centuries. Get your
soldiers to think about the mission, each other,
how to perform their duties, and what to do in
various situations. If they force themselves to
keep their minds on the task at hand, on their
comrades, and on the unit, fear will not have a
chance to take over. They must think positively
and take positive action.

Do not push your soldiers unnecessarily
because fatigue drains courage. Try to give
them adequate food, water, rest, and protection
from the weather. In the words of S. L. A.
Marshall:
In battle, whatever wears out the
muscles reacts on the mind and
whatever impairs the mind drains
physical strength. Tired men take fright
more easily. Frightened men swihly
tire . ... Half of control during battle
comes from the commander's avoiding
useless expenditure of the physical
resources of his men while taking
action to break the hold of fear. . . . As
a man becomes dehydrated during
summer fighting, his courage flows out
through his pores, along with his
muscular strength. He loses the will to
fight or to take constructive action. 5

Keep your soldiers informed of any
information you have that will give them peace
of mind. Do not allow rumors to start or spread.
Get the facts and talk straight with your
subordinates. Use the chain of command and
the NCO support channel and quickly pass on
information your soldiers need. This is one of
the time-tested principles of leadership; it is
fundamental to building trust and reducing
fear.
Emotions That Contribute to Fear
Depression, sadness, and feelings of
hopelessness and lack of self-worth are
dangerous emotions that breed fear and lead to
combat ineffectiveness and panic. You can have
an important influence on these emotions.
Control them in yourself by exercising selfdiscipline. Sense these emotions in your
soldiers, and take actions to control them.
Attack the emotions that contribute to fear by
setting a positive, cheerful example and by
talking with soldiers. Give your soldiers a sense
of confidence, purpose, meaning, and selfrespect. Often, sitting down and talking with a
soldier who is depressed or scared is enough. If
you have a soldier's confidence, he will tell you
the causes of his fear. Sometimes, all it takes is

for you to say "I understand. It is natural to
doubt yourself and have the emotions that you
are feeling. But you're a good soldier .. I know
you; you will do fine. I have confidence in you."
Words like these inspire confidence and show
that you sincerely care about the soldier.

KNOW YOUR JOB
Technical Knowledge
Technical knowledge is the knowledge
required to perform all tasks and functions
related to your position, including the ability to
operate and maintain all assigned equipment.
You should strive to learn how to use your
equipment in the most effective manner to
support your mission accomplishment.
Additionally, you must be able to train your
subordinates on all job tasks and items of
equipment.
To obtain this knowledge, study and work
hard in schools and in your unit. Individual
study of Army manuals and publications is also
invaluable for acquiring such expertise. Do not
be afraid to ask your seniors, peers, and
subordinates to help you learn. If your technical
knowledge is deficient on a particular system,
admit it and take immediate action to correct
the deficiency. Any attempt to bluff your way
through a situation will only result in your loss
of personal credibility and could result in an
accident or injury, if a soldier follows bad
advice.
Specialist Lose, the medical aidman
supporting Sergeant Savage's platoon in
Vietnam, used his technical competence and
professionalism to save at least six lives. He
calmly reassured wounded soldiers,
administered competent first air to the
wounded, and demonstrated initiative by using
toilet tissue packets to bandage wounds after
running out of first-aid packets.
Tactical Knowledge
Tactical knowledge is the ability to employ
your soldiers and their equipment. Combat
arms leaders work directly to gain an
advantage over the enemy while combat
support and combat service support leaders
provide the necessary support for that
employment. The Army recognizes nine
principles of war. You must understand these

"S.L.A. Marshall, The Soldier's Load and the Mobility of a Nation, pp 46-47.

41

principles and consider their applicability to
your situation:
• Objective. Direct every military operation
towards a clearly defined, decisive, and
attainable objective.
• Offensive. Seize, retain, and exploit the
initiative.
• Mass. Concentrate combat power at the
decisive place and time.
• Economy of force. Allocate minim um
essential combat power to secondary efforts.
• Maneuver. Place the enemy in a position of
disadvantage through the flexible
application of combat power.
• Unity of command. For every objective,
ensure unity of effort under one responsible
commander.
• Security. Never permit the enemy to acquire
an unexpected advantage.
• Surprise. Strike the enemy at a time, at a
place, or in a manner for which he is
unprepared.
• Simplicity. Prepare clear, uncomplicated
plans and clear, concise orders to ensure
thorough understanding.
Today's technology and warfighting doctrine
have made tactics more complex than in the
past, yet the fundamental principles continue to
apply at all levels. In addition to understanding
the Army's warfighting doctrine and tactics,
your tactical knowledge will not be complete
unless you also understand the doctrine and

tactics of potential enemies.

KNOW YOUR UNIT
Tactical and technical knowledge is crucial
but, by itself, will not make you an effective
leader. You must couple it with knowledge of
yourself and your unit-your team. General
Omar Bradley said:
The greatest leader in the world could
never win a campaign unless he
understood the men he had to lead.

To build a disciplined, cohesive team, you
must know your unit. What are your unit's
limitations and capabilities? You must clearly
understand discipline and cohesion. In effective
units, soldiers know themselves and each other
well. They care about each other; share mutual
trust, respect, confidence, and understanding;
and work as a disciplined team.
42

Discipline
Disciplined soldiers are orderly, obedient,
controlled, and dependable. They do their duty
promptly and effectively in response to orders,
or even in the absence of orders. The forces that
drive a disciplined unit come from within that
unit. These forces are the values, character, and
will of the leaders and troops.
A unit's character reflects the character of its
leaders and its troops. If the soldiers have
discipline, courage, and initiative and think
creatively, the unit develops a personality-a
character-with these elements as its
foundation.
Self-discipline means forcing yourself to do
your duty-what you ought to do-regardless of
stress, exhaustion, or other conditions. A
disciplined unit forces itself to do its duty in
every situation. In a disciplined unit, soldiers
have the self-confidence and initiative needed to
take decisive actions, at the right time, that will
help the unit accomplish the mission.
Your soldiers will take pride in being a
member of a unit with disciplined proficiency.
Disciplined proficiency is more than just
competency. It comes from realistic training
and cross training, and from leaders who care
enough to coach and teach their soldiers. It
occurs when soldiers are so proficient and
motivated that they want to focus all their
energy on the mission. They willingly give of
themselves to make the unit better. Morale is
high because each soldier knows that what he is
doing is important and contributes to
accomplishing an important mission.
Recall from Chapter 4 that beliefs and values
influence soldiers' behavior. That is why a
leader must understand how to influence the
development of beliefs and values.

Cohesion
Cohesion represents the commitment of
soldiers of all ranks to each other and
strengthens their willingness to fight and
sacrifice personal safety. It is a product of the
bonding of soldiers with each other and the
bonding of leaders and subordinates. Cohesion
requires strong bonds of mutual respect, trust,
confidence, and understanding within units.
Cohesive uni ts function smoothly and perform
missions well under stress.
Battle data from four divisions in World War
II show that battle fatigue rates were much
lower in cohesive units than in noncohesive

units. Early in the North African Campaign,
battle fatigue casualties from noncohesive units
totaled 40 to 45 percent of those wounded in
action. The conclusion is evident. You need to
develop cohesion prior to combat and maintain
it during combat. 6
Caring is essential to cohesion among all
soldiers and leaders in a unit. A soldier's belief
that his leaders and buddies care for him, and
will always do their best to help him, increases
his desire to fight to protect his fellow soldiers.
This bonding is the basis for the cohesion
needed on the battlefield.
The following quotations by Ardantdu Picq, a
French military writer, give some perspective
on cohesion:
A wise organization [or leader] ensures
that the personnel of combat groups
changes as little as possible, so that
comrades in peacetime maneuvers shall
be comrades in war. 7
Four brave men who do not know each
other will not dare to attack a lion. Four
less brave, but knowing each other
well, sure of their reliability and
consequently of mutual aid, will attack
resolutely. 8

do not believe they can do as individuals or as
a unit. As they go through the training, they
must help each other learn and develop
through the after-action review process.
• Resolve interpersonal conflicts to restore
respect, confidence, and candid
communications between soldiers. Broken
bonds between unit members cause the unit to
deteriorate and become unable to function
under stress.
• Make garrison training interesting and as
realistic as possible so that it does not become
monotonous and destroy morale.
• Keep unit mem hers working as a team toward
a common purpose that supports the mission.
This principle applies to all training-details,
maintenance, and administration.
Unit cohesion is an important factor in
peacetime and in combat. Cohesive units under
good leadership will work together to ensure
that training is properly planned, executed, and
assessed with the objective of maintaining the
highest possible readiness standarqs.

In other words, cohesion actually builds
soldiers' confidence, morale, courage, and will
to fight. This has the following implications for

Unit cohesion is an important factor in peacetime and in combat. Cohesive units under good
leadership will work together to ensure that
training is properly planned, executed, and

Unit cohesion cannot be developed and
maintained without strong leadership, and
small-unit leadership is the key. Good leadership

• Do not continually reassign subordinate
leaders and soldiers to different jobs and
squads simply because one squad temporarily
has fewer members than the other squads. Do
not continually reassign drivers or they will
not take pride in their vehicles. Do not rotate
more experienced people into "softer" jobs as
a reward for good service. Assign units
(squads or platoons), not collections of
individuals, to accomplish tasks. Bonds of
respect, trust, confidence, and understanding
take time to develop. When people or leaders
are shifted, bonds are broken and new ones
must be built.
• Put your soldiers through tough and realistic
training that requires them to do things they

used effectively and efficiently toward accomplishing unit objectives. FM 22-102 is an
excellent source of additional information on
developing and maintaining unit cohesion.

There are also many cases in history where
forces inferior in physical quantitative or
qualitative measures but superior in moral
qualities achieved success. In such cases, the
skill of leaders in using the environment to
take advantage, applying sound tactical or
operational methods, and providing purpose,
direction, and motivation to their soldiers and
subordinate leaders was always critical.
FM100-5 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Operations

Leaders can lose battles, but only soldiers can
win them. Having the right values, beliefs,
character, ethics, and knowledge is necessary
but does not ensure success on the battlefield.
Soldiers must be properly trained, equipped,
and employed (led) by their leaders to enhance

their probability of winning. Leaders must also
provide purpose, direction, and motivation to
meet the demands of combat. The requirements
are the same whether you lead a combat unit, a
combat support unit, or a combat service
support unit.

45

I

PROVIDING PURPOSE

PROVIDING DIRECTION

Purpose gives soldiers a reason why they
should do dangerous things under stressful
circumstances. It focuses soldiers' attention and
effort on the task or mission at hand, enabling
them to operate in a disciplined manner in your
absence. Soldiers can best relate to a task or
mission if they know the ultimate purpose of
their actions. Baron Friedrich von Steuben
came to the United States in 1778, at General
Washington's request. His mission was to help
develop organization, control, discipline, and
teamwork in the revolutionary force. He said
that American soldiers do best when they know
why they are doing something. This
observation of over 200 years ago remains valid.

Your thinking skills are often referred to as
directional skills because you set the direction or
orientation of actions when you stare what must
be done in an established priority. Direction
also establishes the relationship between
officers and NCOs (see Appendix D). The
direction you give your soldiers is often based on
guidance from your leader. The key point to
remember is that you must listen to your leader,
support your leader, and help your leader
accomplish the mission, recognizing that your
mission is normally a subset of your leader's
mission. Leaders provide direction by• Knowing and maintaining standards.
• Setting goals.
•Planning.
• Making decisions and solving problems.
• Supervising and evaluating.
• Teaching, coaching, and counseling.
• Training.
Knowing and
Maintaining Standards
The Army has established standards for all
military activities. You as a leader have two
responsibilities: first is to know the standards;·
and second, to enforce the established standard.
You must assist subordinate leaders by
explaining the standards that apply to your
organization, giving them the authority to
enforce the standards, and hold them
accountable for ensuring they and their soldiers
achieve the standards. Your soldiers will
quickly recognize whether you know and
enforce standards; it set.s the direction for your
unit.

The likely violence of modem war could result
in mass casualties. Small groups of soldiers are
likely to be isolated from their units. They will
experience great stress from continuous day
and night operations and from violent
engagements with enemy forces. More than
ever, success on the battlefield will depend on
individual soldiers' determination and personal
initiative. The nature both of the battlefield and
of American soldiers demands that your
subordinates understand the significance of
each mission.
You must teach your subordinates how to
think creatively and solve problems while under
stress. On the battlefield, soldiers must have a
clear concept of the objective; they must clearly
understand your intent. They must have the
critical information that the next higher
headquarters can supply about the mission,
enemy, terrain, troops, and the time available.
Then, when you are not available or
communications with headquarters is cut off,
your soldiers will be able to use their
understanding of your intent and their
initiative to accomplish the mission. To prepare
for combat, train in situations where your
subordinates must take actions without your
help or direction. Follow up with an after-action
review. Discuss the results and make this a
learning experience for both you and your
subordinates.
You must communicate your intent so that
your soldiers are able to understand the desired
outcome clearly. Keep in mind that this can only
happen if you explain what you want to happen
in clear, concise, and complete terms.
Communications are only effective if your
soldiers listen and understand your intent.
46

Setting Goals
Goal setting is a critical part of leadership.
The ultimate goal is to ensure that every soldier
and unit is properly trained, motivated, and
prepared to win in war. Achieving this objective
will normally require that you and your
subordinates jointly establish and develop
goals. When developing goals for your unit,
remember several key points:
• Goals should be realistic and attainable.
• Goals should lead to improved combat
readiness.
• Subordinaoos should be involved in the goalsetting process.
• You must develop a program to achieve each
goal.

•

Planning
Planning is as essential for success in
peacetime training as it is for combat
operations. Planning is usually based on
guidance or a mission you receive from your
leader or higher headquarters. With this
guidance or mission, you can start planning
using the backward planning process. First
determine what the end result of the training or
combat operations must be; then work
backward, step by step. If you use common
sense ai;id experience, this process will help you
eliminate problems, organize time, and identify
details. Backward planning is a skill, and like
other skills, you can develop it with practice.
The steps in backward planning are• Determine the basics: what, how, and when.
• Identify tasks you want to accomplish and
establish a sequence for them.
• Develop a schedule to accomplish the tasks
you have identified. Start with the last task to
be accomplished and work back to the present
time.
When time allows, soliciting help from your
subordinates is useful. If handled properly, you
can accomplish several objectives
simultaneously, to include: improve
communications which can be beneficial in
improving cohesion and discipline; provide
motivation for the soldiers involved; and
'provide a clearer picture of the broader
perspective of unit goals and objectives.
Involving your subordinates in planning
shows that you recognize and appreciate their
abilities. Recognition and appreciation from a
respected leader are powerful motivating forces.
Your subordinates' ideas can help you develop a
better plan; their participation in the planning
process gives them a personal interest in seeing
the plan succeed.
Making Decisions and
Solving Problems
In combat and in training, you will face
complicated problems and have to make
decisions with less information than you would
like. Here is a problem-solving process that can
help you:
• Recognize and define the problem.
• Gather facts and make assumptions.
• Develop possible solutions.
• Analyze and compare the possible solutions.
• Select the best solution.

The problem-solving process is continuous.
Time available, urgency of the situation, and
your judgment will affect your approach to
decision making. When time is scarce, you must
take actions to ensure a timely decision. A good
decision made in time to implement is better
than the best decision made too late.
After you have objectively and logically
analyzed the possible courses of action in a
situation using all available information,
consider your intuitions and emotions. The
problem-solving process is not a purely
objective, rational mathematical formula. The
human mind does not work that way, especially
under stress. The mind is both rational and
intuitive. Your intuition tells you what "feels"
right or wrong. Your intuition flows from your
instincts and your experience.
Since the problem-solving process is a
thought process, it is both rational and
intuitive. However, do not make the mistake of
making decisions guided totally by emotions or
intuitions and immediately doing what feels
right. This is a prescription for disaster. First,
follow the problem-solving process as rationally
and objectively as possible. Gather information;
then develop, analyze, and compare courses of
action. Consider your intuition or hunches, your
emotions, and your values. Try to identify a
"best" course of action that is logical and likely
to succeed and that also feels right in terms of
your intuition, values, and character.
Finally, make your decision, plan, and take
action. If you expect success, you must make
high-quality decisions that your troops accept
and support. When time permits, involve your
soldiers in decision making if they have
information or experience that will lead to the
best decision or plan. This develops your
subordinates and creates an open, trusting bond
between you and them.

Supervising and Evaluating
Supervising means keeping a grasp on the
situation and ensuring that plans and policies
are implemented properly. Supervision includes
giving instructions and continuously
inspecting the accomplishment of a task. There
is a narrow band of proper supervision. On one
side of the band lies oversupervision; on the
other side, undersupervision. Oversupervision
stifles initiative, breeds resentment, and lowers
morale and motivation. Undersupervision,
47

however, can lead to frustration,
miscommunications, lack of coordination,
disorganization, and the perception that you do
not care. This perception can lead to
resentment, low morale, and poor motivation.
The right level of supervision will depend on
the task being performed and the person doing
it. Here are some questions to ask yourself:
• What is the experience level of the
subordinate?
• How competent is the subordinate at this
task?
• How confident is the subordinate about his
ability to do this task?
• How motivated is the subordinate to perform
this task?
All soldiers benefit from appropriate
supervision by leaders with more knowledge
and experience.
Supervision has a major effect on building
trust within your unit. Ensure your subordinates
understand how and why you intend to supervise
as part of ym,ir leadership or command
philosophy. They can adjust to many styles of
supervision once they understand that you are
checking to ensure tasks are understood, to keep
communications open, to teach, and to learn
yourself.
Evaluating is part of supervising and
includes looking at the way soldiers accomplish
a task, checking firsthand, and inspecting. You
need a routine system for checking the things
that are important to mission accomplishment,
cohesion, discipline, morale, and unit effectiveness. Checking is such a simple word and
concept. It is obvious that leaders must check,
but human nature can cause us to fail to check
the most simple things that can lead to big
disasters. You will hear some people say "Worry
about the little things and the big things will
take care of themselves." Others say "Worry
about the big, important things and don't sweat
the small stuff." Both are poor guides. First, be
concerned about the big things; that is where
you exercise your thinking or directional skills.
Next, check the little things that make the major
things happen. Use your judgment and
experience to ensure you do not undersupervise
or oversupervise.

Teaching, Coaching, and Counseling
Teaching and counseling are fundamental
responsibilities of every leader. Counseling
48

alone is so important that FM 22-101 is devoted
entirely to the subject. Use it. Study it. Learn
how to fulfill your teaching and counseling
responsibilities.
Teaching involves creating the conditions so
that someone can learn and develop. To
influence the competence and confidence of
your subordinates, you must be a skilled
teacher. Coaching, counseling, rewarding, and
taking appropriate disciplinary measures are
all parts of teaching. You must be a good teacher
if you are going to plan and conduct effective
training and help your subordinates develop
professionally and personally.
Understanding how people learn is
fundamental to being a good teacher. People
learn• By the example of others.
• By forming a picture in their minds of what
they are trying to learn.
• By gaining and understanding necessary
information.
• By application or practice.
Learning requires certain important
conditions. One condition is that the person be
motivated to learn. It is difficult to teach
someone who has no motivation to learn or feels
no need to learn what you are teaching.
How do you convince the person he needs
what you want to teach? You show the person
that what you are trying to teach will make him
a more competent soldier, better able to do his
duty and survive on the battlefield. Use
examples to show the person the importance of
what you are teaching. The next condition of
learning is to involve the student in the process.
Keep your soldiers' attention by actively
involving their minds and emotions in the
learning process. Have your subordinates
participate, either through discussion or
through active practice of skill.
Hand in hand with your responsibilities as a
teacher are your responsibilities as a coach and
counselor. It is critically important that you
counsel all your soldiers frequently on their
strengths and weaknesses and on any problems
you may be able to help them with.
Developmental leadership assessment (see
Appendix E) can help you improve your
subordinates' leadership effectiveness.
Soldiers often think counseling is negative,
equating it to getting chewed out or being told

.e

they are doing something wrong. This is not a
full picture of what counseling means. Learn
how you can use counseling as a positive tool to
help your soldiers prepare for future
responsibilities.
Counseling is talking with a person in a way
which helps that person solve a problem, correct
performance, or improve good performance.
Counseling is a leadership skill that is a
particular form of coaching and teaching. It
requires thinking skills, such as identifying the
problem, analyzing the factors and forces
influencing the behavior of the soldier being
counseled, and planning and organizing the
counseling session. It requires understanding
human nature-what causes a soldier to behave
in a certain way and what is required to change
his behavior. Counseling requires listening
skills to learn about the situation and the
soldier. It also requires judgment about when to
let the soldier make his own decisions and when
you should make them for him, and when to be
flexible and when to be unyielding.
Just as there are no easy answers for exactly
what to do in leadership situations, there are no
easy answers for exactly what to do in specific
counseling situations. When you see that a
subordinate needs counseling, prepare yourself
by reviewing the problem-solving process and
studying FM 22-101.
As a leader you want to teach soldiers new
values, knowledge, or skills that will change
behavior. You also want to help them become
better soldiers through your counseling.
Training
Quality training must be your top priority-it
is the cornerstone of total Army readiness.
Lieutenant General A. S. Collins, Jr., in his book
Common Sense Training, said:
The essential characteristics of a good
army are that it be well trained and well
disciplined These two characteristics are
apparent in every unit achievement,
whether in peace or war. Discipline
derives and flows from training and
serves to emphasize a fundamental point
essential to a philosophy of training; that
training is all encompassing. Training
permeates everything a military
organization does.

Training must develop soldiers who are
disciplined, physically tough, and highly
motivated. Because soldiers spend the majority
of their time in training, you play an especially
important role in developing soldiers who are
skilled in their jobs. The standards that guide
training must reflect the requirements of the
battlefield. Train your soldiers on every task
critical to wartime mission accomplishment.
Effective training is the key to sustaining a
combat-ready Army and reducing human-error
accidents. Training to standard produces
skilled, disciplined soldiers who accept
responsibility for the safety of themselves and
others and for the protection of Army
equipment. Good training• Strengthens the morale of each soldier.
• Builds mutual trust and respect between the
leader and the led.
• Concentrates on warfighting skills.
• Is performance-oriented and has realistic
objective~.

• Follows Army doctrine and standardizes
actions.
• Means learning from mistakes and allowing
for growth.
• Means strong subordinate development.
You must plan training so that your soldiers
are challenged and learn. Some leaders find
conducting training is threatening and
embarrassing. When they present boring
instruction, their soldiers balk at repetitive
training on skills they have already mastered.
When the leader discovers he has nothing else to
teach, he reacts with defensiveness and reverts
back to using his position power. He accuses
good soldiers of having poor attitudes and tries
to order soldiers to act interested in monotonous
training. The result of this scenario is strong
unity among soldiers but disrespect for the
leader.

PROVIDING MOTIVATION
Motivation is the cause of action. It gives
soldiers the will to do what you know must be
done to accomplish the mission.
If your subordinates have confidence in
themselves, each other, the unit, and you, and
support the cause, they will be sincerely
motivated. Training them to fight and win as a
cohesive, disciplined team will have a valuable
motivating effect. Knowledge and skill combat
fear and increase confidence. Confidence is a
49

potent motivating force. It gives rise to morale,
courage, and the will to fight.
You must keep a broad point of view on human
nature and motivation. Do not allow yourself to
hold the narrow view that soldiers are only
motivated by fear of their leaders. It is equally
dangerous to believe the opposite-that all
soldiers are motivated to work hard and do the
right thing.
You can motivate your subordinates by• Serving as the ethical standard bearer.
• Developing cohesive soldier teams.
• Rewarding and punishing.

Ethical Standard Bearer
Your soldiers need you to be the example they
can compare to their own behavior. They want
to have a leader to look up to. They want to
depend on you to provide the moral force the
values of our society demand. Your soldiers
want you to be good at your job, but they also
want you to be decent and honorable. By being
the ethical standard bearer, you motivate your
soldiers and help them to develop the selfdiscipline and will to fight courageously and to
do the right and brave thing, regardless of
danger.
Cohesive Soldier Teams
Caring for your soldiers, and working hard to
make soldiering meaningful for them, develop
cohesive soldier teams. It takes a lot of work to
properly teach, coach, counsel, and train your
subordinates, but this creates the bonds that
lead to cohesion, trust, and mutual respect. A
soldier in a cohesive soldier team is confident in
his peers, his leaders, and his eqyipment and
training. He will willingly fight to destroy the
enemy and keep himself and his buddies alive.
Rewards and Punishment
The hope of reward and the fear of punishment
greatly affect soldiers' behavior. If you have
been rewarded with a pat on the back for doing
something well or punished with a reprimand
for unsatisfactory performance, you know how
it felt and how it changed your future behavior.
Rewards and punishments have different
purposes. Rewards promote desired behavior;
punishments reduce undesired behavior. If used
properly, rewards and punishments can change
the behavior of your soldiers.
50

Praise, recognition, a medal, a certificate, or a
letter of commendation means a great deal to a
soldier. Napoleon marveled at the motivational
power of a small piece of ribbon. He once said
that if he had enough ribbon, he could conquer
the world. Rewards are visible evidence to the
soldier that his leader, his unit, and his country
appreciate his courage or hard work. Wellchosen rewards normally increase motivation
to keep working for more recognition. Here
are some ideas on applying this principle:
• Obtain recommendations from the chain of
command and NCO support channel on
rewards, awards, and schooling.
• Choose a reward valued by the person
receiving it.
• Use the established a wards system of
certificates, medals, letters of commendation,
driver and mechanic badges, and safety
awards.
• Choose rewards that appeal to a soldier's
personal pride; they will have the most
motivational power. Praise before peers is
often more powerful than a three-day pass.
• Present awards at an appropriate unit
ceremony so that others can see hard work is
rewarded.
• Reward promptly the desired behavior of an
individual or group.
• Stand up for your good soldiers when they
need help.
• Give lots of verbal praise. If a soldier is trying
to learn the right values, character,
knowledge, and skills, encourage him-even
if he is still falling short. Do not reward his
failure, but reward his honest diligent effort to
do the right thing. That recognition will
reinforce his efforts and motivate him to do
even b~tter. Be aware, however, that giving
too much praise, or giving it when
undeserved, cheapens its motivating value.
• Develop awards and ways of recognizing
good performance that motivate the large
group of average people who make up the
majority of your unit. There is nothing wrong
with rewarding the majority of your soldiers if
they exceed a standard.
• Promote people who work and study hard,
influence others to achieve unit standards,
and show the capability for increased
responsibility.
• Recognize soldiers who meet standards and
improve their performance. Every soldier
does not have the ability to be the "soldier of
the quarter" or earn a perfect score on the
APFT.

At the same time, you must also punish
soldiers who just do not try or intentionally fail
to meet your standards or follow your guidance.
You do this because you want to change
behavior and show others what they can expect
if they choose to perform in a similar manner.
Soldiers learn from the results of others'
mistakes. Seeing what happens to a person who
is unwilling or unmotivated to meet standards
can have the same influence on behavior as
firsthand experience.
Here are some principles you should
understand about punishing:
• Let the soldier know you are upset about the
behavior and not about him. Let him know
you care about him as a person but expect
more from him.
• Make sure your soldiers know you will tell
them how they are doing.
• Do not punish soldiers who are unable to
perform a task. Punish those unwilling or
unmotivated to succeed.
• Punish in private as soon as possible after the
undesirable behavior. Do not humiliate a
soldier in front of others.
• Ensure that soldiers being punished
understand exactly what behavior led to the
punishment.

Provide purpose.

Provide direction.

Provide motivation.

• Ensure that punishment is neither excessive
nor unreasonable. It is not only the severity of
punishment that restrains soldiers but also
the certainty of it.
• Do not hold a grudge after punishing. When a
punishment is over ... it is over.
• Never lose control of your temper.

SUMMARY
You must provide purpose, direction, and
motivation to meet the demands of combat.
Purpose gives soldiers a reason why they should
do difficult things under dangerous, stressful
circumstances. Direction shows what must be
done. Motivation gives soldiers the will to do
everything they are capable of doing to
accomplish a mission.
Some people say "behavior is believable."
Your behavior sets the example for your
subordinates. Saying all the right words and
having all.the right values and knowledge will
have no meaning to others if not reinforced by
your actions. Your actions are what soldiers,
peers, and leaders see. Actions give life to
purpose, direction, and motivation to see units
through the tough demands of combat. Actions
tell what must be done and why it is important;
actions inspire others to follow and fight
bravely.

• Explain the "why" of
missions.

• Communicate your intent.

• Plan.
• Maintain standards.
• Set goals.
• Make decisions and solve
problems.

• Supervise, evaluate, teach,
coach, and counsel.
• Train soldiers and soldier
teams.

• Take care of soldiers.
• Serve as the ethical standard
bearer.
• Develop cohesive soldier
teams.
• Make soldiering meaningful.

• Reward performance that
exceeds standards.
• Correct performance not
meeting standards.
• Punish soldiers who
intentionally fail to meet
standards or follow orders.

Napoleon Bonaparte(1769-1821) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This chapter discusses the payoff for
applying the fundamentals discussed in this
manual. That payoff is in leaders and soldiers
who are prepared for war. It is in an Army that
has the competence, confidence, motivation,
and will to win on the battlefield.

RESULTS OF EFFECTIVE
LEADERSHIP
If you apply the principles discussed in this
manual and strive to BE the kind of leader
described in Chapter 4, KNOW the things
discussed in Chapter 5, and DO the things
discussed in Chapter 6, you can develop
ordinary soldiers who are willing and capable of
doing extraordinary things in combat.
52

The chart that follows gives some examples of
what a leader must BE, KNOW, and DO. When
developing your subordinates, identify the skill,
knowledge, or attitude you want to change. If
performance does not meet standards, use your
experience to develop an appropriate action
plan to close the gap. Use the BE, KNOW, DO
framework to help you determine if you want to
change a skill, a knowledge, or an attitude.
Your success as a leader in combat will
depend on your ability to get soldiers to do
things that are against their nature. Soldiers
are used to certain creature comforts, such as
being well fed, warm, dry, and safe. They expect
these things and depend on leaders to take care
of them. In training and in combat, soldiers

have to sacrifice most creature comforts and
some or all assurances of personal safety. In
training you must motivate your soldiers to do
physically demanding tasks with little sleep
and in all weather conditions to prepare them
for the rigors of combat. You owe it to them and
to the nation to mentally and physically prepare
them for the hardships they will have to endure
on the battlefield. This requires expert
leadership; it is what you, as a leader, have been
charged to do.

WILL AND WINNING IN
BATTLE
Will is normally used in the leadership
context to express determination or persistence.
The normal manifestation of will is an
individual demonstrating extraordinary
mental discipline to accomplish an exceptional
physical feat. We often use expressions such as
"gutting it out" when referring to a particularly
difficult task.
Your job as a leader goes beyond teaching
your soldiers how to fight and survive; you must
also develop their will to fight and win. Some
people call this the "winning spirit" or "warrior
spirit." It is the ability to forge victory out of the
chaos of battle-to overcome fear, hunger,
deprivation, and fatigue. The soldier who can
overcome these physical factors and continue to

54

apply his skill and knowledge learned in training
will ultimately have the ability to bvercome any
opponent in combat. AB a leader, your ability to
give your soldiers this will to win starts with the
example you set, the attitudes you express, the
expectations you establish, and the standards
you enforce.
You can, and must, develop this kind of will in
yourself and your soldiers. It takes personal
commitment from you to take this responsibility
seriously and to lead with determination and
will. Building strength of will in yourself and
your soldiers is not something that is just good
to do; success on the battlefield demands it!

SUMMARY
The value of the fundamental leadership
doctrine found in this manual is to help you
prepare yourself and your soldiers for war.
Success as a combat leader hinges on your
ability to get soldiers to do things that are
against their nature. This is your challenge and
it requires expert leadership.
The ultimate test of a leader's or soldier's will
may be in a combat situation with the outcome
resulting in who wins or loses-who lives or
dies. Building strength of will or the "winning
spirit" is not a frivolous training phrase, but an
absolute requirement for success in war.

PART THREE

LEADERSHIP IN BATTLE
CHAPTER 8

Stress in Combat

...

All men are frightened. The more intelligent
they are, the more they are frightened. The
courageous man is the man who forces himself,
in spite of his fear, to carry on.

-'-"- ... - -

Gener~·George S. Patton,J~ (1885-1945)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Corp§' and Army Commander, WW II

The intensity of war is so demanding that
stress in combat requires special attention. This
chapter will tell you about stress in combathow it affects you and your soldiers and what
you can do to prepare for and treat it.

THE HUMAN SIDE OF
WARFIGHTING
In World War II and Korea, the average
casualty ratio was one battle fatigue victim for
every four or five WIA. In extremely difficult

battles, the ratio commonly reached 1 to 3 and
occasionally 1 to 2. At battalion and company
levels, units in desperate situations have had as
many casualties from battle fatigue as from
enemy weapons. Stress in Army operations is so
critical that FM 26-2 is devoted entirely to this
subject.
The old saying "everybody is afraid in
combat" seems obvious, but the concept is worth
considering. Here is one past leader's
descriptions of the human side of warfighting.
55

Here is another combat veteran's account of the intensity of combat.

57

STRESS IN BATTLE
Stress is the body's response to a demand
placed on it. The demands may be physical
(cold, injury, disease) or mental (fear, conflict,
pressure). Stress also occurs when soldiers think
they cannot meet the demands they expect to
face. Sometimes soldiers overestimate the
difficulty of a task or mission and sometimes
they underestimate their abilities. Use your
experience and influence to give your
subordinates a better appreciation of the
mission requirements and confidence in their
actual abilities.
Stress is usually thought of as a destructive
force that harms performance. This is only
partially correct. If the level of stress is not too
high, it can be positive and enhance
performance. It can actually help soldiers meet
and overcome unpleasant or painful situations.
It can also be the positive force that motivates
soldiers to act selflessly and heroically in
combat.
Stress can reduce soldier performance,
however, if its intensity is great enough. For
you, stress is only a problem when it adversely
affects performance. High stress reduces
com hat strength by lowering soldier
performance and increasing battlefield stress
casualties.
It is just as normal for leaders to experience
fear as it is for younger soldiers, so do not feel
you must hide it from your subordinates. Tell
your subordinates that you also experience fear
when you think about what you may see or have
to do, but do not let fear keep you from
performing your leadership duties. You must
discipline yourself and be the example of what
to do when one is afraid. Leaders who cannot
control themselves or become indecisive cause
their soldiers to lose confidence. Your soldiers
must be confident in your leadership to succeed
in com bat. Soldiers who lack confidence in their
leaders are reluctant to respond promptly and
appropriately to orders. Loss of trust is
devastating to morale, reducing performance on
the battlefield and further increasing stress.

BATTLE FATIGUE
Battle fatigue is a psychoneurotic reaction
that can develop in an individual from stress in
a combat environment. Every individual has a
different capacity to cope personally with
traumatic stress whether it is a result of an
external physical factor such as an enemy
58

threat or an internal factor such as guilt. Mental
and physical fitness helps soldiers endure
stress, but fear and other unpleasant feelings
will naturally be present before, during, and
after combat. It is impossible for you as a leader
to determine in advance either your personal
resistance or that of your soldiers to succumb to
battle fatigue. There are indicators of battle
fatigue that you as a leader must recognize.

Indicators of Battle Fatigue
Indicators of battle fatigue may differ from
soldier to soldier.You must constantly watch for
these indicators and take steps to help
individuals before they become combat
ineffective. Recognize that while most soldiers
exhibit some of these signs during periods of
extreme stress, they ca~ remain effective. The
indicators of battle fatigue include• Tension: aches, pains, trembling, and fidgeting.
• Jumpiness at sudden sounds or movement.
• Cold sweat: dry mouth, pale skin, eyes hard to
focus.
• Pounding heart: may feel dizzy or light·headed.
• Feeling out of breath.
• Upset stomach: may throw up.
• Diarrhea or constipation: frequent urination.
• Fatigue: feel tired, drained; takes an effort to
move.
• Distant, haunted ("1000-yard") stare.
• Anxiety: keyed up, worrying, expecting the
worst.
• Irritability: swearing, complaining, easily
bothered.
• Difficulty paying attention, remembering
details.
• Difficulty thinking, speaking, communicating.
• Trouble sleeping, awakened by bad dreams.
• Grief: tearful, crying for dead or wounded
buddies.
• Feeling bad about mistakes or what had to be
done.
• Anger: feeling let down by leaders or others in
unit.
• Beginning to lose confidence in self and unit.

Protection From Battle Fatigue
There are actions you can take to protect you
and your soldiers from battle fatigue. Ensure
your soldiers know what they are capable of
doing. Tough, demanding, realistic training
will increase their confidence in self, the unit,

their leadership, and equipment. Keep your
subordinates informed on the situation and do
not allow your soldiers to exaggerate the
enemy's capabilities or the difficulty of
upcoming missions. Use the after-action review
process after every mission to learn things that
will help the unit in the future and to keep your
soldiers informed and involved. Help your
soldiers talk through their problems when
things are tough at home or in the unit. Develop
and enforce a sleep plan to provide each
individual opportunity to rest. Remember that
leaders too need sleep so that they can make
sound, timely decisions.
The sustained stress of fighting and waiting
to fight wears soldiers down mentally and
physically; it can lead to battle fatigue. Though
less visible, but equally dangerous, soldiers'
ethical sensitivities may degenerate. Past war
crimes are a frightening reminder of the need for
our soldiers to sustain the ethical norms of our
society. "Stand downs," such as moving a unit
to an area of lower risk or resting the unit for
about 48 hours, can significantly reduce the
most serious effects of sustained stress.
Although you may lack the authority to decide
when your unit will stand down, you have a
moral responsibility to advise your leader when
your unit needs this rest.
Casualties will be sustained during combat
operations which will require replacement
soldiers. You must welcome new members into
your unit and get to know them quickly. New
soldiers have the added stress of being
unfamiliar with you as a leader and the other
soldiers in the unit. It is your responsibility to
teach them as quickly as possible how the unit
operates and to help them feel a part of the team.

Treating Battle Fatigue
Perhaps the most powerful thing you can do
for your soldiers in tough situations is to look
calm and in control. Your soldiers will key on
your behavior and focus on the unit's immediate
mission. Your soldiers should expect to continue
their duties. Have them focus on a well-learned
task or drill and follow the SOP. Think of
yourselves succeeding; talk about it. Take a deep
breath and shrug your shoulders to reduce
tension; have your soldiers do the same.
Remember that battle fatigue is normal. Talk
about it; make sure your soldiers understand it
and are able to recognize it in themselves and

others. Stay in touch with your soldiers; keep
talking to them. When there are rumors, get the
facts; do not jump to conclusions. Reduce your
soldiers' anxiety and increase their peace of
mind by keeping them informed.
When the tactical situation and safety permit,
ensure you and your soldiers• Sleep.
• Drink plenty of fluids.
• Continue to eat normal portions of food.
• Continue to conduct training.
• Clean up (wash, shave, change).
• Talk about what happened; put things in
perspective; clear up misunderstandings; talk
about lessons learned.
• Share grief; talk out personal worries; talk
with the chaplain.
• Keep busy when not resting (do recreational
activities, equipment maintenance, et cetera).
If you have a soldier whose battle fatigue
signs do not improve after resting, tell your
leader or medic.
Sometimes you may have to send a soldier to
the rear or to a medical unit to get more rest. If
this happens, let the soldier know the team is
counting on him to come back quickly. Do not let
him feel ashamed about his need for rest or time
to recover from battle fatigue. Welcome him
back and expect him to do his full share when he
returns.
Don't be surprised or worried if some battle
fatigue signs (as jumpiness and bad dreams)
continue awhile after soldiers come out of
combat. Help yotir soldiers understand this is
normal human behavior.

SUMMARY
The intensity of combat is so demanding that
even the most fit can temporarily become
unable to function because of stress. Stress is
the body's response to a demand placed on it. It
is usually thought of as destructive, but it can be
positive and enhance performance if its
intensity is not too high.
Negative reactions to the extreme stresses of
the battlefield are called battle fatigue. Battle
fatigue is entirely normal and may be
recognized by leaders who know the indicators
to watch for.
Since soldiers watch their leaders closely for
signs of panic or loss of confidence, you must
59

look and sound as calm as possible. Talk about
battle fatigue and teach your soldiers what
symptoms to watch for in themselves and
others. The symptoms of battle fatigue will
usually go away after rest but medical units
that are located in the rear may have to treat
severe cases.

60

You can protect soldiers from battle fatigue by
keeping them in good physical condition and by
ensuring they have adequate sleep, food, water,
shelter, hygiene, and sanitation. Leaders can
also suffer from battle fatigue; you must
take care of yourself the same way you take
care of your subordinates.

Weather, terrain, and the day-night cycle
form the basic setting for all military
operations. This setting, coupled with hightechnology equipment, affects the firepower,
maneuver, protection, and leadership of units in
battle. You must also recognize the effects
combat itself has on soldiers and units. The
danger, destruction, and confusion of combat;
the effects weapons and obstacles have on
terrain; and the chaos associated with the
unexpected all cause simple things to become

difficult. This chapter will help you understand
the effect of the combat environment on
soldiers, equipment, and weapons.

WEATHER AND TERRAIN
Weather affects soldiers, equipment,
operations, and the ability to maneuver on
terrain. Temperature extremes, wind, rain,
snow, fog, mud, and dust all combine in various
ways to affect soldier efficiency and limit the
use of weapons and equipment.
61

.. ·

Leading soldiers is more difficult in bad
weather and in difficult terrain. The time and
effort you need to care for soldiers increase in
bad weather. You must think about cold and hot
weather injuries. Security of positions and
fighting formations are harder to maintain and
successful operations require more planning.
You must rehearse simple plans when possible
and then execute aggressively.

CONTINUOUS OPERATIONS
Continuous land combat is a reality. Our
potential enemy's doctrine calls for rapid
advance, deep penetration, relentless attack,
and the bypassing of strongly defended points.
The battlefield may not have a clearly defined
forward line and could reach a depth exceeding
100 kilometers. The demands of continuous
operations compound the normal battle stresses
soldiers must cope with. The expected effects of
these demands are so significant that FM 22-9 is
devoted entirely to soldier performance in
continuous operations.
FM 22-9 points out that the adverse conditions
associated with continuous operations will
degrade the fighting performance of you and
your soldiers. These conditions do not respect
military rank or position. Because of your
leadership responsibilities, performing
continuously without rest will exhaust you
sooner than it will your troops. You may be the
first battle fatigue casualty. Force yourself to
rest.
Soldier Performance
Continuous operations can reduce critical
human abilities as a result of sleep loss. Many
predictable effects occur as a result of
insufficient sleep which you must be aware of
and take into consideration. You and your
soldiers will• Be less alert.
• Be slow to make sense of things you see or
hear.
• Start to see things that are not there.
• Be unable to concentrate, perform complex
operations, or readily understand
instructions.
• Be unable to remember events clearly.
• Begin to skip routine tasks.
• Have difficulty deciding what to say, and how
to say it.
• Experience mood changes and become
irritable, depressed, or apathetic.

62

Leadership
Expectations about future warfare point to a
tremendous challenge during the first few days
or weeks. Extended periods of continuous
ground combat operations reduce soldier
performance, adding to the problems caused by
casualties and illness. There are actions you can
take to slow down the rate of performance
decline. You cannot use these actions
haphazardly or selectively; their effectiveness
in wartime depends on sound planning,
execution, and assessment of training prior to
commencing com bat operations.

Lead Your Unit. The single most important
element to sustained unit excellence is the
leadership you provide. Successful preparation
depends on applying the kind of fundamental
leadership described in this manual. You must
plan for the well-being of your soldiers and your
unit and know when and how to shift your
leadership style to meet the situation. The
directions you give should be simple, clear, and
complete. Recognize that if your soldiers are
tired you may have to repeat orders and
directions, double-check yourself and others,
and be prepared to spend more time reassuring
soldiers to restore their confidence.
All soldiers must learn to cope with the
adverse conditions of continuous operations. In
all training and combat plans, consider the
human need for you and your soldiers to sleep.
Encourage, not discourage, sleeping when the
opportunity arises. Severe problems develop
after several days if you and your soldiers
cannot get at least three hours of sleep every
day. Ideally, these three hours should be
continuous; however, the tactical situation may
make this impossible. Taking catnaps at every
opportunity, even for brief periods, is the best
technique for reducing the effects of sleep loss.
Falling asleep quickly and waking up quickly
and alert are skills that improve with practice.
Build Cohesion. Although enduring the strain
of combat builds cohesive soldier teams, you
must build cohesion before battle so that your
unit can fight, defeat the enemy, and stand the
strain of prolonged com bat. One of your
primary peacetime responsibilities is to create
the trust and strong bonds with and among
soldiers that will sustain them, and you, in
battle. You must constantly stress bonding,
learning, training, teaching, coaching, caring,
and teamwork because they lead to cohesion.

Your goal is to develop the full potential of every
soldier in your unit so that individually or
collectively they could continue and complete
the mission in your absence.

Develop Confidence. Withstanding the
adverse conditions of continuous operations is
easier when soldiers are optimistic and
confident. Confidence gives your soldiers the
deep-seated belief the unit can and will
accomplish the mission, no matter how
unfavorable the odds. Confident, cohesive units
withstand adverse conditions far better than
other units do.
You cannot order confidence. Soldiers develop
confidence through realistic training and
simulated com bat experiences that make them
optimistic about themselves, their equipment,
their unit, and their leaders.

Train Your Unit. Effectivetrainingimproves
the performance of soldiers and units. Welltrained soldiers and units can better resist the
adverse effects of continuous operations.
Training also improves soldiers' ability to
maintain self-control and to think when
exhausted. Therefore, preparing for continuous
operations requires carefully designed training
plans and vigorous assessment of progress
toward standards. Practicing continuous
operations helps everyone recognize the
problems that arise and learn how to cope. As
training progresses, the unit demonstrates its
ability to achieve extraordinary results. Making
a reasonable sleep plan is easier if you have
cross trained your subordinates. You will
probably never have enough people to set up two
full shifts for every job, so cross training will
allow a person to sleep a few hours while
someone else performs his job. Tough training
experiences furnish convincing evidence the
unit is combat ready and help develop a
winning attitude.

Develop a Physically Fit Unit. You must
develop the physical fitness of your soldiers.
Physical strength and endurance improve their
ability to "bounce back" from exhaustion. Fit
soldiers can call upon their minds and bodies to
perform strenuous activity for extended periods
and return to normal effectiveness after a
relatively short period of rest.
Develop a Winning Attitude. Finding better
and easier ways to perform important tasks in

continuous operations is a leadership challenge.
You must reassure your soldiers that they, their
unit, and their country will prevail. Remind
soldiers they must depend on one another.
Winning depends on all soldiers working
together to perform beyond what they believe
possible until the mission has been
accomplished.

SIX ACTIONS A LEADER MUST
TAKE TO DEFEAT BATTLE
STRESSES ARE·
• Lead your unit.
• Build cohesion.

• Develop confidence.
• Train your unit.
• Develop a physically fit unit.
• Develop a winning attitude.

HIGH TECHNOLOGY
Technology has brought great change to
waging war. With night vision devices, armies
can now fight in darkness and fog, conditions
that have traditionally forced lulls in battle.
Further, violence and confusion on the
battlefield will be greater than ever because of
the potential to fight under NBC conditions, the
sophistication of electronic warfare
capabilities, and the increased use of smoke as
an obscurant. Every one of these advances in
technology has an accompanying effect on
soldiers-the human side of warfighting.

Electronic Warfare
Since our command and control systems
depend heavily on radios and radar, the enemy
will certainly try to destroy them or disrupt their
use at critical times. Because tactical radios
produce electronic signals that can be detected,
the enemy may identify the location of radio
transmissions coming from tactical operations
centers and then attack with air strikes,
artillery, or land forces. Our tactics and SOP
will help cope with the enemy's electronic
warfare efforts, but you must recognize the
effect on soldiers and leaders. Disrupted
communications will make it more difficult to
transmit or receive battlefield intelligence,

63

process calls for fire, or request resupply and
medical evacuation. These restraints will cause
a feeling of isolation on the battlefield that can
lead to panic. You must recognize this as fact
and make your tactical training in electronic
warfare as realistic as possible. Train under
electronic warfare conditions so that your
soldiers will know what to expect. Teach your
soldiers how to defend your unit from electronic
warfare, and ensure they are confident in your
ability to lead them. Follow up with an afteraction review. Discuss the results and make this
a learning experience for you and your
subordinates.

New Weapons on The Battlefield
Emerging technology may develop weapons
for the future battlefield that are more
devastating than any used in previous wars.
Directed-energy weapons could become an
entirely new class of tactical weapons using
powerful energy beams to detonate
ammunition, destroy vehicle electronic
systems, and disrupt communications.
Exposure to directed-energy weapons could also
lead to disorientation, blindness, brain damage,
or even death. Because the technology is still
being developed, it is too early to predict their
use or exact destructive power. One thing is
certain. If directed-energy weapons are used,
they will have an impact on the human side of
warfighting and make the demands on leaders
even greater.
NBC Warfare
The threat of NBC warfare will be a major
source of stress. Fear of the unknown and
knowledge of the lethality of NBC weapons
cause significant psychological stress. Since
unsupported rumors aggravate this stress, you
must ensure accurate information passes
through the chain of command to every soldier.
You cannot wait for war to prepare. Likewise,
you cannot wait for the enemy to use NBC
weapons to prepare to defend yourselves. You
must be a leader of strong will and prepare
yourself and your troops to operate under NBC
conditions. To prepare for NBC warfare, you
must• Talk with your soldiers. Tell them what to
expect from you and their equipment. Tell
them what you expect from them.
• Develop procedures so that you can recognize
each other while in MOPP gear. For example,
64

have soldiers wear name tags or colored tape
marking that will not damage the protective
suit.
• Keep plans simple. Follow SOPs and wellrehearsed drills.
• Enforce a sleep and rest program to protect
from exhaustion.
• Ensure soldiers drink plenty of water to
protect from dehydration.
• Learn to pace yourself and to delegate. Do not
allow you or your troops to become casualties
of physical exhaustion.
• Discipline yourself to give calm patient
leadership. Your troops will certainly panic if
they sense panic in your voice or actions.
• Promote physical fitness for endurance to
protect you and your soldiers from early
exhaustion.
• Train in MOPP gear to gain confidence and
experience.

Command and Control. Command and
control suffers significantly under NBC
conditions because activities, such as directing
fire, maneuvering, operating equipment, and
reading maps, take longer and are more
difficult. Because MOPP gear impairs
navigational abilities, leaders can easily
become disoriented. The result of these factors
and the increased physical exhaustion that
accompanies extended wear of the MOPP gear
can cause irritability and frustration in leaders;
simultaneously, the soldiers' confidence in their
leaders can deteriorate rapidly.
Communications. Protective masks make
face-to-face communications difficult; facial
expressions, voice tone, and physical actions
can be misunderstood. Soldiers and leaders
even have difficulty recognizing one another
since everybody looks about the same in MOPP
gear. When radio operators are wearing
protective masks, the number and length of
radio transmissions increase and
transmissions are difficult to understand.
Combat Power. The nature of battle changes
dramatically under NBC conditions.
Operations take longer or require more troops to
complete successfully. Firing rates decrease for
individual and crew-served weapons. Soldiers
and crews often use terrain less effectively for
cover and concealment, and the possibility
increases of soldiers accidentally firing at
friendly personnel.

Units rely more on indirect fire. Calls for fire
take longer, and locating targets accurately is
more difficult. The time required to process fire
missions and deliver effective indirect fires
increases accordingly.

Human and Physiological Considerations.
In MOPP gear, soldiers tend to omit, or poorly
complete, tasks such as camouflage and
maintenance. This is especially true after six
hours in MOPP4. Every task requires more time
and effort to complete. Fatigue, frustration,
dehydration, and less effective leadership
contribute to lower overall performance under
NBC conditions. Soldiers in MOPP gear
dehydrate without realizing it and fail to drink
adequate fluids to rehydrate their bodies.
Eating is not possible while in protective masks
and physical endurance suffers.

SUMMARY
The environment of future combat operations
will probably place greater stress on soldiers
than in past wars. Our potential enemy's
doctrine and equipment indicate an intent to
fight around the clock and advance rapidly.
Technology has also created the capability to
disrupt radio and radar use and locate
command posts where radio transmissions
originate. Future technology will create other
offensive weapons that are more devastating

than any used in previous wars. The effects of
this technology on soldiers can be great.
After long periods of continuous operations
and sleep loss, the ability to think and reason
suffers. You must take actions to reduce the rate
of performance decline. You will need to repeat
instructions, give simple directions, and doublecheck yourself and others. You must develop
soldiers' confidence through tough training
that simulates combat conditions. Ensure you
and your subordinates get as much sleep as the
tactical situation permits; severe problems
develop after several days if soldiers get
less than three hours of sleep each day.
Since the enemy may use NBC weapons, you
must train your soldiers to perform the mission
under simulated NBC conditions. Command
and control suffers significantly because of
exhaustion and leader behavior changes.
Communicating is difficult when wearing
MOPP gear and soldiers and leaders have
difficulty recognizing each other. Soldiers and
crews use terrain much less effectively for cover
and concealment, and land navigation and
orientation are more difficult.
In peacetime, you must train under simulated
combat conditions, develop SOP, and practice
sleep discipline. Talk with your soldiers and let
them know what they can expect from their
equipment and what you will expect from them.

APPENDIX A

Leadership Competencies

The leadership factors and principles addressed
in Chapter 2 are the basis for the Army's
leadership education and training framework.
This education and training must take place in
a logical order, build on past experience and
training, and have a warfighting focus. The
nine leadership competencies provide a
framework for leadership development and
assessment. They establish broad categories of
skills, knowledge, and attitudes that define
leader behavior. They are areas where leaders
must be competent.

The leadership competencies were developed
in 1976 from a study ofleaders from the rank of
corporal to that of general officer. The study
identified nine functions all leaders must
perform if an organization is to operate
effectively. Although all leaders exercise the
competencies, their application depends on the
leader's position in the organization. For
example, the amount and detail of supervision a
squad leader normally gives to his soldiers
would be inappropriate for a battalion
commander to give to his company

A

commanders. Like the principles of leadership,
the competencies are not simply a list to
memorize. Use them to assess yourself and your
subordinates and develop an action plan to
improve your ability to lead.

COMMUNICATIONS
Communications is the exchange of
information and ideas from one person to
another. Effective communications occurs
when others understand exactly what you are
trying to tell them and when you understand
exactly what they are trying to tell you. You
communicate to direct, influence, coordinate,
encourage, supervise, train, teach, coach, and
counsel. You need to be able to understand and
think through a problem and translate that idea
in a clear, concise, measured fashion. Your
message should be easy to understand, serve the
purpose, and be appropriate for your audience.
This competency is addressed further in
Chapter 2 of this manual.

SUPERVISION
You must control, direct, evaluate, coordinate,
and plan the efforts of subordinates so that you
can ensure the task is accomplished.
Supervision ensures the efficient use of materiel
and equipment and the effectiveness of
operational procedures. It includes establishing
goals and evaluating skills. Supervising lets
you know if your orders are understood and
shows your interest in soldiers and the mission.
Remember that oversupervision causes
resentment and undersupervision causes
frustration. By considering your soldiers'
competence, motivation, and commitment to
perform a task, you can judge the amount of
supervision needed. This competency is
discussed further in Chapters 5 and 6 of this
manual.

TEACHING AND COUNSELING
Teaching and counseling refer to improving
performance by overcoming problems,
increasing knowledge, or gaining new
perspectives and skills. Teaching your soldiers
is the only way you can truly prepare them to
succeed and survive in combat. You must take a
direct hand in your soldiers' professional and
personal development. Counseling is especially
important in the Army. Because of the Army's
mission, leaders must be concerned with the
entire scope of soldiers' well-being. Personal

counseling should adopt a problem-solving,
rather than an advising, approach. You also
need the judgment to refer a situation to your
leader, the chaplain, or a service agency if it is
beyond your ability to handle. You will, of
course, follow up on this action. Performance
counseling focuses on soldiers' behavior as it
relates to duty performance. Military
counseling is discussed further in Chapter 6 of
this manual, and FM 22-101 is devoted entirely
to the subject.

SOLDIER TEAM
DEVELOPMENT
You must create strong bonds between you
and your soldiers so that your unit functions as
a team. Since combat is a team activity,
cohesive soldier teams are a battlefield
requirement. You must take care of your soldiers
and conserve and build their spirit, endurance,
skill, and confidence to face the inevitable
hardships and sacrifices of combat. The
effectiveness of a cohesive, disciplined unit is
built on bonds of mutual trust, respect, and
confidence. Good leaders recognize how peers,
seniors, and subordinates work together to
produce successes. Soldier team development is
significant in training and orienting soldiers to
new tasks and units. You can help new soldiers
become committed members of the organization
if you work hard at making them members of
your team. This competency is discussed further
in FM 22-102 and Chapter 6 of this manual.

TECHNICAL AND TACTICAL
PROFICIENCY
You must know your job. You must be able to
train your soldiers, maintain and employ your
equipment, and provide combat power to help
win battles. You will gain technical proficiency
in formal Army training programs, self-study,
and on-the-job experience. You have to know
your job so that you can train your soldiers,
employ your weapons systems, and help your
leader employ your unit. Tactical competence
requires you to know warfighting doctrine so
that you can understand your leader's intent
and help win battles by understanding the
mission, enemy, terrain, troops, and time
available. Technical proficiency and tactical
proficiency are difficult to separate. This
competency is discussed in detail in Chapter 5 of
this manual.
67

DECISION MAKING

USE OF AVAILABLE SYSTEMS

Decision making refers to skills you need to
make choices and solve problems. Your goal is
to make high-quality decisions your soldiers
accept and execute quickly. Further, it is
important that decisions be made at the lowest
organizational level where information is
sufficient. Like planning, decision making is an
excellent way for you to develop your leadership
team. Include subordinates in the decisionmaking process if time is available and if they
share your goals and have information that will
help produce high-quality decisions. Decision
making is discussed further in Chapter 6 of this
manual.

You must be familiar with techniques,
methods, and tools that will give you and your
soldiers the edge. Use of available systems
literally means that you know how to use
computers, analytical techniques, and other
modem technological means that are available
to manage information and to help you and your
soldiers better perform the mission. This
competency may vary dependent upon your
leadership position. You must recognize,
however, that understanding computer
technological advances is important. You must
use every available system or technique that
will benefit the planning, execution, and
assessment of training.

PLANNING
Planning is intended to support a course of
action so that an organization can meet an
objective. It involves forecasting, setting goals
and objectives, developing strategies,
establishing priorities, delegating, sequencing
and timing, organizing, budgeting, and
standardizing procedures. Soldiers like to have
order in their lives, so they depend on you to
keep them informed and to plan training and
operations to ensure success. Including your
subordinate leaders in the planning process is
an excellent way for you to develop your leadership team. Remember, one of your tasks is to
prepare your subordinates to replace you, if
necessary. Planning is discussed further in
Chapter 6 of this manual.

68

PROFESSIONAL ETHICS
Military ethics includes loyalty to the nation,
the Army, and your unit; duty; selfless service;
and integrity. This leadership competency
relates to your responsibility to behave in a
manner consistent with the professional Army
ethic and to set the example for your
subordinates.
As a leader, you must learn to be sensitive to
the ethical elements of situations you face, as
well as to your orders, plans, and policies. You
must learn to use an informed, rational decisionmaking process to reason through and resolve
ethical dilemmas and then teach your
subordinates to do the same. Professional ethics
is discussed further in Chapter 4 of this manual.

APPENDIX B

Leadership Styles

Leadership style is the personal manner and
approach of leading (providing purpose,
direction, and motivation). It is the way leaders
directly interact with their subordinates.
Effective leaders are flexible in the way they
interact with subordinates. They deal with
subordinates differently, changing the way
they interact as a subordinate develops or as the
situation or mission changes. Your manner and
.approach of leading will obviously depend on
your training, education, experience, and view
of the world. You have to be yourself, yet flexible
enough to adjust to the people you lead and to
the missions you are assigned.
Some say they admire a certain leader
because he always seems to know exactly what
to do in a particular situation. Or they admire a
leader who knows just the right words to say at
the right time to ensure the mission is
accomplished and soldiers are cared for.
Experience has taught you that you should not
deal with all people the same. For example, you
know it is not effective to deal with a new soldier
the same as you would deal with an experienced
tank commander or section chief.
For years, when people talked about
leadership styles, they thought about two
extremes-an autocratic style and a democratic
style. Autocratic leaders used their legitimate
authority and the power of their position to get
results while democratic leaders used their
personality to persuade, and involved
subordinates in solving problems and making
decisions. Thinking like this fails to c'onsider
the possibility of a leader using different styles
and being flexible enough to be autocratic at
times and democratic at other times, or to
combine the two extreme styles at still other
times.
There are three basic styles of military
leadership-directing, participating, and
delegating.

DIRECTING STYLE
A leader is using the directing leadership style
when he tells subordinates what he wants done,
how he wants it done, where he wants it done,

and when he wants it done and then supervises
closely to ensure they follow his directions. This
style is clearly appropriate in many situations.
When time is short and you alone know what
needs to be done and how to do it, this style is the
best way to accomplish the mission. When
leading subordinates who lack experience or
competence at a task, you need to direct their
behavior using this style. They will not resent
your close supervision. You will be giving them
what they need and want. In fact, asking
inexperienced subordinates to help you solve
complex problems or plan an operation would be
frustrating for them.
If a leader announces that the unit will
conduct day andnightlandnavigation training
over an 8-kilometer course in full field uniform,
he is using the directing style of leadership. He
did not ask for any information or
recommendations before making and
announcing the decision.
Some people think that a leader is using the
directing style when he yells, uses demeaning
language, or threatens and intimidates
subordinates. This is not the directing style. It is
simply an abusive, unprofessional way to treat
subordinates.

PARTICIPATING STYLE
A leader is using the participating style when
he involves subordinates in determining what
to do and how to do it. The leader asks for
information and recommendations; however,
he still makes the decisions. He simply gets
advice from subordinates before making the
decision. This style is appropriate for many
leadership situations. If your subordinates have
some competence and support your goals,
allowing them to participate can be a powerful
team-building process. It will build their
confidence and increase their support for the
final plan if they help develop it.
If a leader asks subordinates to recommend
the location and course layout for the land
navigation training before making his final
plans, he is using the participating style of
leadership. He still makes the decision but
69

considers information and recommendations
from his subordinates first.
Do not be concerned that asking a
subordinate for advice or using a subordinate's
good plan or idea shows weakness. The opposite
is true; it is a sign of strength that your
subordinates will respect. On the other hand,
you are responsible for the quality of your plans
and decisions. If you believe an idea one of your
subordinates offers is not a good one, you must
reject the idea and do what you believe is right,
regardless of pressure to do otherwise.

DELEGATING STYLE
A leader is using the delegating style when he
delegates problem-solving and decision-making
authority to a subordinate or to a group of
subordinates. This style is appropriate when
dealing with mature subordinates who support
your goals and are competent and motivated to
perform the task delegated. While you are
always accountable to your leader for the results
of any task you delegate, you must hold your
subordinates accountable to you for their
actions and performance.
If a leader tasks an experienced and
motivated subordinate to plan, organfae, and
run the land navigation training, he is using the
delegating style of leadership.
Some things are appropriate to delegate;
others are not. The key is to release your
subordinates' problem-solving potential while
you determine what problems they should solve
and help them learn to solve them.

CHOOSING A STYLE
Choosing the correct style of leadership
requires you to understand the four factors of
leadership (Chapter 2). You (the leader) must
size up every situation and subordinate (the led)
carefully to choose the right style. Consider how
competent, motivated, and committed those you
lead are at the task (the situation) you want
performed. Have they done it before? Were they
successful? Will they need your supervision,
direction, or encouragement to accomplish the
mission to standards? The answers to these
questions will help you choose the best
leadership style and manner to communicate so
that your soldiers will understand your intent
and want to help you accomplish the mission.
As a leader you want to develop and train your
subordinates so that you can confidently

70

delegate tasks to them. The delegating style is
the most efficient of the three leadership styles.
It requires the least amount of your time and
energy to interact, direct, and communicate
with your subordinates. Because it is the most
efficient style, it is in your best interest to use the
delegating style with as many of your
subordinates and as much of the time as
possible. But before you can use the delegating
leadership style, you must train and develop
your subordinates.
An inexperienced subordinate needs your
direction. You must tell him what needs to be
done and how to do it. After he gains some
competence, and if he is motivated and shares
your goals, you can reduce the amount of
supe~sion you give to him. Encourage him,
ask him for advice, and allow him to participate
in helping you make plans and decisions. With
time, experience, and your skillful leadership,
this person will gain even more competence and
become even more motivated and committed to
helping the unit accomplish its missions. When
you have trained and developed a subordinate
to this level of competence and commitment, use
the delegating style of leadership.
As missions change or as new tasks are
assigned, you will need to continue to be flexible
in the leadership style you use. Even though you
have successfully used the delegating
leadership style with a subordinate, you may
need to temporarily return to the directing style
ofleadership if you give him an unfamiliar, ora
new, task. Because the soldier is unfamiliar
with the task, you will need totellhim what to do
and how to do it. As the subordinate gains
competence, confidence, and motivation in this
new task, you can gradually shift your style
again to the participating or delegating style.
By assessing the leadership needs of your
subordinates, you can determine what
leadership style to use.
Do not confuse emotion or anger with styles of
leadership. A company commander frustrated
with a poor maintenance program in his unit
might angrily say to his platoon leaders, "The
state of maintenance in this unit is terrible! I do
not have the answers, but you are going to
develop a plan to fix it. Nobody is leaving this
office until you all develop a plan and agree on
it!" He is using a delegating style because
after he identifies the problem, he gives
his platoon leaders complete freedom to develop
the plan.

Another leader might announce that the unit
will observe the unit's organization day with a
barbecue followed by three hours of athletics
and recreation. This is an example of the
directing style since the leader makes the
decision without asking for advice or
recommendations.

There is no one best leadership style. What
works in one situation may not work in another.
You must develop the flexibility to use all three
styles; further, you must develop the judgment
to choose the style that best meets the situation
and the needs of the subordinate.

APPENDIX C

Assuming A Leadership Position

Assuming a leadership position is one of the
special leadership situations you will face.
Everything discussed in this manual about
what you must BE, KNOW, and DO is relevant
to assuming a leadership position.

DIRECTING INITIAL EFFORTS
When assuming a leadership position, you
should consider the four factors of leadership
(Chapter 2). Direct your initial efforts• To determine what is expected of your
organization.
• To determine who your immediate leader is
and what he expects of you.
• To determine the level of compet.ence and the
strengths and weaknesses of your
subordinates.
• To identify the key people outside of your
organization whose willing support you need
to accomplish the mission.

CHOOSING THE BEST
LEADERSHIP STYLE
Do not fall into the trap of believing that some
techniques always work, such as observing for a
week or two and then making changes or going
into an organization "like a lion" and then
becoming "like a lamb." Such beliefs will cause
you to miss the benefits of the thought process
used to select the appropriate leadership style
(directing, participating, or delegating). The
best strategy in one situation can be exactly the
wrong strat.egy in another situation. For
example, you would use a different leadership
style when taking over a well-trained and
proficient organization than when replacing a
leader relieved for inefficiency or inability to
discipline or train.
As a leader, you must always establish and
enforce standards and provide purpose,
direction, and motivation for your soldiers.
When assuming a leadership position, you must
assess the readiness of the organization to
perform its mission and then develop a strategy
to provide what the organization needs. You
should use the leadership style that your
72

experience tells you is most appropriate after
you have assessed the unit's level of
competence, motivation, and commitment to
accomplish the mission. In fact, you will
probably use all three styles with different
subordinates or in different situations. Your
style will need to change when new missions are
received, new soldiers and leaders are assigned,
or the compet.ence, motivation, or commitment
of your soldiers changes.
When you assume a leadership position, talk
to your leader, your peers, and key people such
as the chaplain and the sergeant major. Seek
clear answers to the following questions:
• What is the organization's mission?
• How does this mission fit in with the mission
of the next higher organization?
• What functions am I responsible for, such as
training, maintenance, and administration?
• What are the standards the organization
must meet?
• What resources are available to help the
organization accomplish the mission?
• What is the current state of morale?
• Who reports directly to me?
• What are the strengths and weaknesses of my
key subordinates and the unit?
• Who are the key people outside of the
organization who support mission
accomplishment? What are their strengths
and weaknesses?
Be sure you ask these questions at the right
time, of the right person, and in the right
manner. Answers to these questions, and others
that flow from them, should give you the
information you need to correctly assess the
situation and select the right leadership
strategy. You must also remain flexible enough
to adapt your leadership style as you
continually assess the competence, motivation,
and commitment of your subordinates and the
organization.
Sharing your leadership or command
philosophy with your subordinates will make

your transition more efficient. Your
subordinates will appreciate the chance to see
how you intend to lead and welcome the chance
to ask questions. Your leadership philosophy is

your promise of how you intend to lead and
interact with your subordinates. Command
philosophies at company level and higher are
often written when the situation permits.

APPENDIX D

Officer and Noncommissioned
Officer Relationships

An important part of effective leadership is
the ability of commissioned and warrant
officers to work together with NCOs. To develop
effective working relationships, both must
know the similarities and differences in their
respective roles, duties, and responsibilities.
Since officers and NCOs share the same
goal-to accomplish their unit's mission-it is
evident their responsibilities overlap and must
be shared. Much discussion, however, concerns
who is really responsible for what. What is
"officer business," and what is "NCO
business"?

TRADITIONS AND LAWS
The complementary relationship and mutual
respect between officers and NCOs are
traditions in the US Army. Since the Army's
beginning in 1775, officer and NCO duties have
been separate but necessarily related.
Traditions, functions, and laws determine the
particular duties of officers and NCOs.
Commissions are legal instruments by which
the President appoints and exercises direct
control over qualified people to act as his legal
agents and help him carry out his duties. The
Army retains this "direct-agent" relationship
with the President through its commissioned
officers. It is the basis for commissioned
officers' legal authority and placement in
positions of authority in Army organizations.
Warrant officers are appointed by the Secretary
of the Army. Public Law provides for
commissioning chief warrant officers, and their
authority comes from the same source as other
commissioned officers. NCOs do not derive
authority from commissions. Rather, officers
delegate the authority NCOs need to get the
mission accomplished. NCOs serve as agents
for officers.

OFFICER AND NCO
RESPONSIBILITIES
No sharp, definitive lines separate officer and
NCO responsibilities. In general, commanders
set the overall policies and standards. Officers
74

lead NCOs and help them carry out their
responsibilities. Officers cannot simply say,
"That's sergeants' business," nor should they
do NCOs' work for them. Officers must give
NCOs the guidance, resources, assistance, and
supervision necessary for them to do their
duties. By the same token, NCOs are
responsible for assisting and advising officers
in carrying out their duties. Missions demand
that officers and NCOs work together and
advise, assist, and learn from one another.
In a unit, officers and NCOs must determine
the best division of responsibilities and tasks of
each by considering the mission, the situation,
and individual abilities and personalities. The
following chart has general responsibilities for
officers and NCOs.

COMMUNICATIONS
The Army has but one chain of command. The
NCO support channel parallels and reinforces
it. Both are means of communication and
control. For the chain of command to work
efficiently, the NCO support channel must
operate effectively.
The battalion or higher-level NCO support
channel begins with the CSM and ends with
section chiefs, squad leaders, or team leaders.
Between these points are intermediate levels
such as first sergeants and platoon sergeants.
NCOs use the support channel to pass
information, issue orders, and accomplish
routine, but important, missions. Most often,
they use it to put policies and procedures into
effect and to enforce standards of performance,
training, appearance, and conduct.
In addition to conducting normal operations,
NCOs advise commanders on individual soldier
proficiency and training needed to ensure unit
readiness. Commanders are then free to plan,
make decisions, and program future training
and operations. Although a commander usually
consults with his first sergeant or CSM before
giving orders to the chain of command, this does
not mean these NCOs are in the chain of

command. Senior NCOs must know what
instructions are being issued in order to
supervise the NCO support channel effectively.
Officers and NCOs at all levels must
continually communicate with one another.
Whether the information or tasks begin in the
chain of command or in the NCO support
channel, informing counterparts prevents
duplicating, or issuing conflicting, orders.
Besides the chain of command and the NCO
support channel, most units at battalion level
and above have staff and technical channels.
For example, a battalion staff has Sl, S2, S3,
and S4 sections.

AUTHORITY
Authority is the legitimate power ofleaders to
direct subordinates or to take action within the
scope of their responsibility. Legal authority
begins with the Constitution. It divides
authority for the military between Congress
and the President. Congress has the authority
to make laws to govern the Army; the President
has the authority to command the Army as
Commander in Chief.
Command Authority
Command authority can come from
regulations or laws, but it primarily originates
with the President. Leaders have command

authority when they fill positions requiring the
direction and control of other members of the
Army. That authority is restricted, however, to
the soldiers and facilities in their own units.
Command authority is not limited to
commissioned and warrant officers.
Commanders are leaders who direct and control
soldiers as an official part of their duties. Such
leaders have the inherent authority to issue
orders, carry out the unit mission, and care for
soldiers, unless contrary to law or regulation.
Enlisted soldiers · can have command
authority. Tank commanders, squad leaders,
platoon sergeants, and dining facility
managers all use command authority to direct
and control.
General Military Authority
General military authority is the authority
extended to all soldiers to take action. It originates
in oaths of office, law, rank structure, tradition,
and regulation. For example, the UCMJ gives
authority to "commissioned officers, warrant
officers, petty officers, and noncommissioned
officers to quell quarrels, frays, disorders . . .
and to apprehend personnel ... who take part."
Leaders may exercise general military authority
over soldiers from different units. When an
NCO of one battalion stops a soldier from
another to give instruction on military courtesy,
he is exercising general military authority.
75

Delegation of Authority
Just as it is impossible for Congress and the
President to participate in every facet of the
armed forces, it is impractical for commissioned
officers to handle every action directly. To meet
the organization's goals, they must delegate
authority to NCOs.
Accountability
When you are responsible for something, you
are liable, or accountable, for the outcome. You
must answer for either an action or an omission.
Responsibilities fall into two categories:
individual and command.

76

Soldiers have individual responsibilities.
They are responsible for their own actions.
Nobody gives or delegates individual
responsibilities. Soldiers assume them when
they take their oath of enlistment.
Command responsibilities refer to collective
or organizational accountability and include
how well units perform their missions. For
example, the platoon sergeant is responsible for
all the tasks and missions assigned to his
platoon, as directed by the platoon leader. The
sergeant of the guard is responsible for all
activities related to guard duty.

APPENDIX E

Developmental Leadership Ass.e ssment

Developmental leadership assessment is a
process used to improve a person's ability to
lead. It involves comparing performance to a
standard or performance indicator, giving
feedback, and developing a plan to improve
leadership performance. It is an essential
element of your leader development
responsibilities. Just as you need your leaders'
coaching, your subordinates need your help to
improve their leadership performance.
You have two leadership assessment
responsibilities. First, assess your own
leadership performance. Identify your
strengths and weaknesses and work to improve
yourself. Second, assess your subordinates'
leadership performance, give them feedback,
and help them overcome their weaknesses.

THE LEADERSHIP
ASSESSMENT PROCESS
The goal of leadership assessment is to
develop competent and confident leaders.
Leadership assessment should be a positive,
useful experience that does not confuse,
intimidate, or negatively impact on leaders. It
should be conducted as follows:
• Decide what leadership skill, knowledge, or
attitude you want to assess.
• Make a plan to observe the leadership
performance.
• Observe the leadership performance and
record your observations.
• Compare the leadership performance you
observed to a standard or performance
in di ca tor. (Performance standards or
indicators must be based on the nine
leadership competencies discussed in
Appendix A.)
• Decide if the leadership performance you
observed exceeds, meets, or is below the
standard or performance indicator.
• Give the person leadership performance
feedback. (FM 22-101 can help you learn to
give useful and accurate feedback your
subordinates will accept.)

• Help the person develop an action plan to
improve leadership performance.
Normally, leadership assessment will not
lead to improved performance unless it includes
an action plan designed to change undesirable
performance and reinforce desirable
performance. The leader and the subordinate
must• Design the action plan together.
• Agree on the actions necessary to improve
leadership performance.
• Review the action plan frequently to see if the
subordinate is making progress and to
determine if the plan needs to be changed.
Naturally, when assessing your own
leadership performance you have to modify the
steps. First, examine your performance in a
particular situation. Then, compare your
performance to a leadership standard or
performance indicator. Finally, decide how you
can improve your leadership performance, if
appropriate. You may want to discuss your selfassessmen t with your leaders, peers,
subordinates, and others.

FEEDBACK SOURCES
A complete and accurate leadership
assessment includes feedback from these six
sources:
• The person himself.
•Leaders.
•Peers.
• Subordinates.
• Close friends and family members.
• Trained leadership assessors. Some service
school instructors have received special
leadership assessment training.
It will not always be possible to get feedback
from all of these sources, but each of them can
give valuable information about a person's
leadership performance. If you can get feed back
from all six sources, you will have a complete
picture of the person's leadership performance.
