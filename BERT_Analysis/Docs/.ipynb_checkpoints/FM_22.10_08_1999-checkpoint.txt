FOREWORD

Soldiers represent what's best about our Army. Day in and day out, in the dark and in the
mud and in faraway places, they execute tough missions whenever and wherever the
Nation calls. They deserve our very best--leaders of character and competence who act
to achieve excellence. That theme resounds throughout FM 22-100, Army Leadership,
and echoes our time-honored principle of BE, KNOW, DO.
This leadership manual lays out a framework that applies to all Army leaders-officer
and NCO, military and civilian, active and reserve component. At the core of our
leadership doctrine are the same Army Values embedded in our force : loyalty, duty,
respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage (LDRSHIP). The
framework also outlines physical, mental, and emotional attributes that together with
values form character-what a leader must BE.
Being a person of character is fundamental to our Army. What makes Army leaders of
competence are skills with people, ideas, things, and warfighting. We refer to those four
sets of skills as interpersonal, conceptual, technical, and tactical. Many are common to
leaders in all situations; some additional skills are required for those who gain increasing
responsibility. Leaders of character and competence are those with the appropriate skills,
leaders who KNOW their people, their equipment, and their profession.
All that is still not enough. We call on our leaders to translate character and competence
into leader actions. Army leaders influence people-by providing purpose, direction, and
motivation-while operating to accomplish the mission and improving the organization.
Leaders inspire others toward common goals and never lose sight of the future even as
they labor tirelessly for the demands of today. That is what we expect our leaders to DO.
Unlike the previous editions, this leadership manual covers three levels of leadership-direct, organizational, and strategic. While the skills and actions necessary for leadership
success at the direct level continue to be important at higher levels, organizational and
strategic leaders need additional skills to perform in their more complex roles.
I urge Army leaders to read this manual thoroughly, study it carefully, and teach it
faithfully. But above all, I challenge you to be leaders of character and competence who
lead others to excellence. Whether supporting, training, or fighting, America looks to you
to BE, KNOW, and DO what is right.

FM 22-100

Preface
The Army consists of the active component, Army National Guard, Army Reserve,
and Department of the Army (DA) civilians. It’s the world’s premier land combat
force—a full-spectrum force trained and ready to answer the nation’s call. The
Army’s foundation is confident and competent leaders of character. This manual is
addressed to them and to those who train and develop them.

PURPOSE
FM 22-100 is a single-source reference for all Army leaders. Its purpose is threefold:

• To provide leadership doctrine for meeting mission requirements under all conditions.

• To establish a unified leadership theory for all Army leaders: military and civilian,
active and reserve, officer and enlisted.

• To provide a comprehensive and adaptable leadership resource for the Army of the
21st century.

As the capstone leadership manual for the Army, FM 22-100 establishes the Army’s
leadership doctrine, the fundamental principles by which Army leaders act to accomplish the mission and take care of their people. The doctrine discusses how Army values form the basis of character. In addition, it links a suite of instruments,
publications, and initiatives that the Army uses to develop leaders. Among these
are—

• AR 600-100, which establishes the basis for leader development doctrine and
training.

• DA Pam 350-58, which describes the Army’s leader development model.
• DA Pam 600-3, which discusses qualification criteria and outlines development
and career management programs for commissioned officers.

• DA Pam 600-11, which discusses qualification criteria and outlines development
and career management programs for warrant officers.

• DA Pam 600-25, which discusses noncommissioned officer (NCO) career development.

• DA Pam 690-46, which discusses mentoring of DA civilians.
• The TRADOC Common Core, which lists tasks that military and DA civilian leaders must perform and establishes who is responsible for training leaders to perform them.

• Officer, NCO, and DA civilian evaluation reports.
FM 22-100 also serves as the basis for future leadership and leader development initiatives associated with the three pillars of the Army’s leader development model.
Specifically, FM 22-100 serves as—

• The basis for leadership assessment.

Army Leadership

vii

Preface

• The basis for developmental counseling and leader development.
• The basis for leadership evaluation.
• A reference for leadership development in operational assignments.
• A guide for institutional instruction at proponent schools.
• A resource for individual leaders’ self-development goals and initiatives.
FM 22-100 directly supports the Army’s keystone manuals, FM 100-1 and FM 100-5,
which describe the Army and its missions. It contains principles all Army leaders use
when they apply the doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures established in the
following types of doctrinal publications:

• Combined arms publications, which describe the tactics and techniques of combined arms forces.

• Proponency publications, which describe doctrinal principles, tactics, techniques,
and collective training tasks for branch-oriented or functional units.

• Employment procedure publications, which address the operation, employment,
and maintenance of specific systems.
• Soldier publications, which address soldier duties.
• Reference publications, which focus on procedures (as opposed to doctrine, tactics,
or techniques) for managing training, operating in special environments or
against specific threats, providing leadership, and performing fundamental tasks.
This edition of FM 22-100 establishes a unified leadership theory for all Army leaders
based on the Army leadership framework and three leadership levels. Specifically,
it—

• Defines and discusses Army values and leader attributes.
• Discusses character-based leadership.
• Establishes leader attributes as part of character.
• Focuses on improving people and organizations for the long term.
• Outlines three levels of leadership—direct, organizational, and strategic.
• Identifies four skill domains that apply at all levels.
• Specifies leadership actions for each level.
The Army leadership framework brings together many existing leadership concepts
by establishing leadership dimensions and showing how they relate to each other.
Solidly based on BE, KNOW, DO—that is, character, competence, and action—the
Army leadership framework provides a single instrument for leader development.
Individuals can use it for self-development. Leaders can use it to develop subordinates. Commanders can use it to focus their programs. By establishing leadership dimensions grouped under the skill domains of values, attributes, skills, and actions,
the Army leadership framework provides a simple way to think about and discuss
leadership.
The Army is a values-based institution. FM 22-100 establishes and clarifies those
values. Army leaders must set high standards, lead by example, do what is legally and
morally right, and influence other people to do the same. They must establish and
sustain a climate that ensures people are treated with dignity and respect and create
an environment in which people are challenged and motivated to be all they can be.
FM 22-100 discusses these aspects of leadership and how they contribute to developing leaders of character and competence. These are the leaders who make the Army a
trained and ready force prepared to fight and win the nation’s wars.

FM 22-100

Preface

The three leadership levels—direct, organizational, and strategic—reflect the
different challenges facing leaders as they move into positions of increasing
responsibility. Direct leaders lead face to face: they are the Army’s first-line leaders.
Organizational leaders lead large organizations, usually brigade-sized and larger.
Strategic leaders are the Army’s most senior leaders. They lead at the major
command and national levels.
Unlike previous editions of FM 22-100—which focused exclusively on leadership by
uniformed leaders at battalion level and below—this edition addresses leadership at
all levels and is addressed to all Army leaders, military and DA civilian. It supersedes
four publications—FM 22-101, Leadership Counseling; FM 22-102, Soldier Team
Development; FM 22-103, Leadership and Command at Senior Levels; and DA Pam
600-80 Executive Leadership—as well as the previous edition of FM 22-100. A comprehensive reference, this manual shows how leader skills, actions, and concerns at
the different levels are linked and allows direct leaders to read about issues that affect organizational and strategic leaders. This information can assist leaders serving
in positions supporting organizational and strategic leaders and to other leaders who
must work with members of organizational- and strategic-level staffs.
FM 22-100 emphasizes self-development and development of subordinates. It includes performance indicators to help leaders assess the values, attributes, skills,
and actions that the rest of the manual discusses. It discusses developmental counseling, a skill all Army leaders must perfect so they can mentor their subordinates
and leave their organization and people better than they found them. FM 22-100 prescribes DA Form 4856-E (Developmental Counseling Form), which supersedes DA
Form 4856 (General Counseling Form). DA Form 4856-E is designed to support
leader development. Its format follows the counseling steps outlined in Appendix C.
FM 22-100 offers a framework for how to lead and provides points for Army leaders
to consider when assessing and developing themselves, their people, and their organizations. It doesn’t presume to tell Army leaders exactly how they should lead
every step of the way. They must be themselves and apply this leadership doctrine as
appropriate to the situations they face.

SCOPE
FM 22-100 is divided into three parts. Part I (Chapters 1, 2, and 3) discusses leadership aspects common to all Army leaders. Part II (Chapters 4 and 5) addresses the
skills and actions required of direct leaders. Part III (Chapters 6 and 7) discusses the
skills and actions required of organizational and strategic leaders. The manual also
includes six appendixes.
Chapter 1 defines Army leadership, establishes the Army leadership framework, and
describes the three Army leadership levels. It addresses the characteristics of an
Army leader (BE, KNOW, DO), the importance of being a good subordinate, and how
all Army leaders lead other leaders. Chapter 1 concludes with a discussion of moral
and collective excellence.
Chapter 2 examines character, competence, and leadership—what an Army leader
must BE, KNOW, and DO. The chapter addresses character in terms of Army values
and leader attributes. In addition, it describes character development and how character is related to ethics, orders—to include illegal orders—and beliefs. Chapter 2
concludes by introducing the categories of leader skills—interpersonal, conceptual,

Preface

technical, and tactical—and the categories of leader actions—influencing, operating,
and improving.
Chapter 3 covers the human dimension of leadership. The chapter begins by discussing discipline, morale, and care of subordinates. It then addresses stress, both combat- and change-related. Discussions of organizational climate, institutional culture,
and leadership styles follow. Chapter 3 concludes by examining intended and unintended consequences of decisions and leader actions.
Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the skills and actions required of direct leaders. The skills
and actions are grouped under the categories introduced at the end of Chapter 2.
Chapters 6 and 7 provide an overview of the skills and actions required of organizational and strategic leaders. These chapters introduce direct leaders to the concerns
faced by leaders and staffs operating at the organizational and strategic levels. Like
Chapters 4 and 5, Chapters 6 and 7 group skills and actions under the categories introduced in Chapter 2.
Appendix A outlines the roles and relationships of commissioned, warrant, and noncommissioned officers. It includes discussions of authority, responsibility, the chain
of command, the NCO support channel, and DA civilian support.
Appendix B lists performance indicators for Army values and leader attributes,
skills, and actions. It provides general examples of what Army leaders must BE,
KNOW, and DO.
Appendix C addresses developmental counseling in detail. It begins with a discussion
of the characteristics of a good counselor, the skills a counselor requires, and the
limitations leaders face when they counsel subordinates. The appendix then examines the types of developmental counseling, counseling approaches, and counseling
techniques. Appendix C concludes by describing the counseling process and explaining how to use DA Form 4856-E, the Developmental Counseling Form.
Appendix D explains how to prepare a leader plan of action and provides an example
of a direct leader preparing a leader plan of action based on information gathered using an ethical climate assessment survey (ECAS). The example explains how to conduct an ECAS.
Appendix E discusses how Army values contribute to character development and the
importance of developing the character of subordinates.
Appendix F contains a copy of the Constitution of the United States. All members of
the Army take an oath to “support and defend the Constitution of the United
States.” It is included so it will be immediately available for Army leaders.

The Army Leadership Framework

This manual is a tool to help you answer these questions, to begin or continue
becoming a leader of character and competence, an Army leader. Chapter 1 starts
with an overview of what the Army requires of you as an Army leader. This is the Army
leadership framework; it forms the structure of the Army’s leadership doctrine.
Chapter 1 also discusses the three levels of Army leadership: direct, organizational,
and strategic. Chapter 2 discusses character, competence, and leadership—what you
must BE, KNOW, and DO as an Army leader. Chapter 3 talks about the human
dimension, the many factors that affect the people and teams that you lead and the
institution of which you and they are a part.

CHAPTER 1

The Army Leadership Framework
Just as the diamond requires three properties for its formation—carbon, heat, and
pressure—successful leaders require the interaction of three properties—character,
knowledge, and application. Like carbon to the diamond, character is the basic quality of the leader.…But as carbon alone does not create a diamond, neither can character alone create a leader. The diamond needs heat. Man needs knowledge, study, and
preparation.…The third property, pressure—acting in conjunction with carbon and
heat—forms the diamond. Similarly, one’s character, attended by knowledge, blooms
through application to produce a leader.

General Edward C. Meyer
Former Army Chief of Staff

1-1. The Army’s ultimate responsibility is to
win the nation’s wars. For you as an Army
leader, leadership in combat is your primary
mission and most important challenge. To meet
this challenge, you must develop character and
competence while achieving excellence. This
manual is about leadership. It focuses on character, competence, and excellence. It’s about accomplishing the mission and taking care of
people. It’s about living up to your ultimate responsibility, leading your soldiers in combat
and winning our nation’s wars.

1-3. Leadership starts at the top, with the character of the leader, with your character. In order to lead others, you must first make sure
your own house is in order. For example, the
first line of The Creed of the Noncommissioned
Officer states, “No one is more professional
than I.” But it takes a remarkable person to
move from memorizing a creed to actually

1-2. Figure 1-1 shows the Army leadership
framework. The top of the figure shows the four
categories of things leaders must BE, KNOW,
and DO. The bottom of the figure lists dimensions of Army leadership, grouped under these
four categories. The dimensions consist of
Army values and subcategories under attributes, skills, and actions.

living that creed; a true leader is that remarkable person.
1-4. Army leadership begins with what the
leader must BE, the values and attributes that
shape a leader’s character. It may be helpful to

think of these as internal qualities: you possess
them all the time, alone and with others. They
define who you are; they give you a solid footing. These values and attributes are the same
for all leaders, regardless of position, although

you certainly refine your understanding of
them as you become more experienced and assume positions of greater responsibility. For example, a sergeant major with combat
experience has a deeper understanding of selfless service and personal courage than a new
soldier does.
1-5. Your skills are those things you KNOW
how to do, your competence in everything from
the technical side of your job to the people skills
a leader requires. The skill categories of the
Army leadership framework apply to all leaders. However, as you assume positions of
greater responsibility, you must master
additional skills in each category. Army

leadership positions fall into one of three levels:
direct, organizational, and strategic. These levels are described later in this chapter. Chapters
4, 6, and 7 describe the skills leaders at each
level require.
1-6. But character and knowledge—while
absolutely necessary—are not enough. You
cannot be effective, you cannot be a leader, until you apply what you know, until you act and
DO what you must. As with skills, you will
learn more leadership actions as you serve in
different positions. Because actions are the essence of leadership, the discussion begins with
them.

LEADERSHIP DEFINED
Leadership is influencing people—by providing purpose, direction, and motivation—while
operating to accomplish the mission and improving the organization.
INFLUENCING
1-7. Influencing means getting people to do
what you want them to do. It is the means or
method to achieve two ends: operating and improving. But there’s more to influencing than
simply passing along orders. The example you
set is just as important as the words you speak.
And you set an example—good or bad—with
every action you take and word you utter, on or
off duty. Through your words and example, you
must communicate purpose, direction, and
motivation.
Purpose
1-8. Purpose gives people a reason to do things.
This does not mean that as a leader you must
explain every decision to the satisfaction of
your subordinates. It does mean you must earn
their trust: they must know from experience
that you care about them and would not ask
them to do something—particularly something
dangerous—unless there was a good reason,
unless the task was essential to mission
accomplishment.

1-4

1-9. Look, for example, at a battalion
maintenance section. Its motor sergeant always
takes the time—and has the patience—to explain to the mechanics what is required of
them. Nothing fancy; the motor sergeant usually just calls them together for a few minutes
to talk about the workload and the time crunch.
The soldiers may get tired of hearing “And, of
course, unless we get the work finished, this
unit doesn’t roll and the mission doesn’t get
done,” but they know it’s true. And every time
he passes information this way, the motor
sergeant sends this signal to the soldiers: that
he cares about their time and work and what
they think, that they are members of a team,
not cogs in the “green machine.”
1-10. Then one day the unit is alerted for an
emergency deployment. Things are happening
at breakneck speed; there is no time to pause,
and everything and everyone is under stress.
The motor sergeant cannot stop to explain
things, pat people on the back, or talk them up.
But the soldiers will work themselves to exhaustion, if need be, because the motor sergeant has earned their trust. They know and

FM 22-100

Leadership Defined

appreciate their leader’s normal way of operating, and they will assume there is a good reason
the leader is doing things differently this time.
And should the deployment lead to a combat
mission, the team will be better prepared to accomplish their mission under fire. Trust is a basic bond of leadership, and it must be developed
over time.
Direction
1-11. When providing direction, you communicate the way you want the mission accomplished.
You
prioritize
tasks,
assign
responsibility for completing them (delegating
authority when necessary), and make sure your
people understand the standard. In short, you
figure out how to get the work done right with
the available people, time, and other resources;
then you communicate that information to your
subordinates: “We’ll do these things first. You
people work here; you people work there.” As
you think the job through, you can better aim
your effort and resources at the right targets.
1-12. People want direction. They want to be
given challenging tasks, training in how to accomplish them, and the resources necessary to
do them well. Then they want to be left alone to
do the job.
Motivation
1-13. Motivation gives subordinates the will to
do everything they can to accomplish a mission.
It results in their acting on their own initiative
when they see something needs to be done.

notices and gives them credit (with something
more than the offhand comment “good job”),
they will be ready to take on even more next
time.
1-16. But Army leaders motivate their people
by more than words. The example you set is at
least as important as what you say and how well
you manage the work. As the unit prepares for
the rollout, the motor sergeant you just read
about is in the motor pool with the mechanics
on Friday night and Saturday morning. If his
people are working in the rain, the NCO’s uniform will be wet too. If they have missed breakfast, the leader’s stomach will be growling just
as loudly. The best leaders lead from the front.
Don’t underestimate the importance of being
where the action is.
OPERATING
1-17. Actions taken to influence others serve to
accomplish operating actions, those actions you
take to achieve the short-term goal of accomplishing the mission. The motor sergeant will
make sure the vehicles roll out, on time and
combat ready, through planning and preparing
(laying out the work and making the necessary
arrangements), executing (doing the job), and
assessing (learning how to work smarter next
time). The motor sergeant provides an example
of how direct leaders perform operating actions.
All leaders execute these operating actions,
which become more complex as they assume positions of increasing responsibility.
IMPROVING

1-14. To motivate your people, give them
missions that challenge them. After all, they did
not join the Army to be bored. Get to know your
people and their capabilities; that way you can
tell just how far to push each one. Give them as
much responsibility as they can handle; then let
them do the work without looking over their
shoulders and nagging them. When they succeed, praise them. When they fall short, give
them credit for what they have done and coach
or counsel them on how to do better next time.

1-18. The motor sergeant’s job is not complete
when the last vehicle clears the gate. While getting the job done is key, the Army also expects
him to do far more than just accomplish the
day’s work. Army leaders also strive to improve
everything entrusted to them: their people, facilities, equipment, training, and resources.
There will be a new mission, of course, but part
of finishing the old one is improving the
organization.

1-15. People who are trained this way will
accomplish the mission, even when no one is
watching. They will work harder than they
thought they could. And when their leader

1-19. After checking to be sure the tools are repaired, cleaned, accounted for, and put away,
the motor sergeant conducts an informal afteraction review (AAR) with the section. (An AAR

Army Leadership

1-5

The Army Leadership Framework

is a professional discussion of an event, focused
on performance standards, that allows participants to discover for themselves what happened, why it happened, and how to sustain
strengths and improve on weaknesses. Chapter
5 discusses AARs.) The motor sergeant is selfconfident enough to ask subordinates for their
ideas on how to make things work better (always a key goal). He then acts based on his own
and team members’ observations. The motor
sergeant looks for strong areas to sustain and
praises team members as appropriate; however
if the motor sergeant saw the team members
spend too much time on some tasks and not
enough on others, he changes the section standing operating procedures (SOP) or counsels the
people involved. (Developmental counseling is
not an adverse action; it is a skill you use to help
your subordinates become better team members, improve performance, and prepare for the
future. Counseling should address strong areas
as well as weak ones and successes as well as

failures. Appendix C discusses developmental
counseling.) If the motor sergeant discovers
gaps in individual or collective skills, he plans
and conducts the training necessary to fill
them. If something the motor sergeant did or a
decision he made didn’t turn out quite right, he
will not make the same error again. More than
that, the motor sergeant lets his people know
what went wrong, finds out their impressions of
why it happened, and determines how they will
make it work next time.
1-20. By doing these things, the motor sergeant
is creating a better organization, one that will
work smarter the next time. His example sends
an important message. The soldiers see their
leader look at his own and the organization’s
performance, evaluate it, identify strong areas
to sustain as well as mistakes and shortcomings, and commit to a better way of doing
things. These actions are more powerful than
any lecture on leadership.

BE, KNOW, DO
1-21. BE, KNOW, DO clearly and concisely
state the characteristics of an Army leader.
You have just read about leader actions, the
DO of BE, KNOW, DO. Leadership is about
taking action, but there’s more to being a
leader than just what you do. Character and
competence, the BE and the KNOW, underlie
everything a leader does. So becoming a
leader involves developing all aspects of
yourself. This includes adopting and living
Army values. It means developing the attributes and learning the skills of an Army
leader. Only by this self-development will
you become a confident and competent
leader of character. Being an Army leader is
not easy. There are no cookie-cutter solutions to leadership challenges, and there are
no shortcuts to success. However, the tools
are available to every leader. It is up to you to
master and use them.
BE
1-22. Character describes a person’s inner
strength, the BE of BE, KNOW, DO. Your
character helps you know what is right;

1-6

more than that, it links that knowledge to
action. Character gives you the courage to
do what is right regardless of the circumstances or the consequences. (Appendix E
discusses character development.)
1-23. You demonstrate character through
your behavior. One of your key responsibilities as a leader is to teach Army values to
your subordinates. The old saying that actions speak louder than words has never
been more true than here. Leaders who talk
about honor, loyalty, and selfless service but
do not live these values—both on and off
duty—send the wrong message, that this
“values stuff” is all just talk.
1-24. Understanding Army values and
leader attributes (which Chapter 2 discusses) is only the first step. You also must
embrace Army values and develop leader attributes, living them until they become
habit. You must teach Army values to your
subordinates through action and example
and help them develop leader attributes in
themselves.

FM 22-100

BE, KNOW, DO

KNOW
1-25. A leader must have a certain level of
knowledge to be competent. That knowledge
is spread across four skill domains. You must
develop interpersonal skills, knowledge of
your people and how to work with them. You
must have conceptual skills, the ability to
understand and apply the doctrine and other
ideas required to do your job. You must learn
technical skills, how to use your equipment. Finally, warrior leaders must master
tactical skills, the ability to make the right
decisions concerning employment of units in
combat. Tactical skills include mastery of the
art of tactics appropriate to the leader’s level
of responsibility and unit type. They’re amplified by the other skills—interpersonal,
conceptual, and technical—and are the most
important skills for warfighters. (FM 100-40
discusses the art of tactics.)
1-26. Mastery of different skills in these
domains is essential to the Army’s success in
peace and war. But a true leader is not
satisfied with knowing only how to do what
will get the organization through today; you
must also be concerned about what it will
need tomorrow. You must strive to master
your job and prepare to take over your boss’s
job. In addition, as you move to jobs of increasing responsibility, you’ll face new
equipment, new ideas, and new ways of
thinking and doing things. You must learn to
apply all these to accomplish your mission.
1-27. Army schools teach you basic job skills,
but they are only part of the learning picture.
You’ll learn even more on the job. Good
leaders add to their knowledge and skills
every day. True leaders seek out opportunities; they’re always looking for ways to increase their professional knowledge and
skills. Dedicated squad leaders jump at the
chance to fill in as acting platoon sergeant,
not because they’ve mastered the platoon
sergeant’s job but because they know the
best place to learn about it is in the thick of
the action. Those squad leaders challenge

Army Leadership

themselves and will learn through doing;
what’s more, with coaching, they’ll learn as
much from their mistakes as from their
successes.
DO
1-28. You read about leader actions, the DO of
Army leadership doctrine, at the beginning of
this chapter. Leader actions include—

· Influencing: making decisions, com-

municating those decisions, and motivating
people.

· Operating:

the things you do to
accomplish your organization’s immediate
mission.

· Improving: the things you do to increase

the organization’s capability to accomplish
current or future missions.

1-29. Earlier in this chapter, you read about a
motor sergeant who lives Army values, has developed leader attributes, and routinely performs leader actions. But that was an example,
and a garrison example at that. What about reality? What about combat? Trained soldiers
know what they are supposed to do, but under
stress, their instincts might tell them to do
something different. The exhausted, hungry,
cold, wet, disoriented, and frightened soldier is
more likely to do the wrong thing—stop moving, lie down, retreat—than one not under that
kind of stress. This is when the leader must step
in—when things are falling apart, when there
seems to be no hope—and get the job done.
1-30. The fight between the 20th Regiment of
Maine Volunteers and the 15th and 47th Regiments of Alabama Infantry during the Civil
War illustrates what can happen when a leader
acts decisively. It shows how the actions of one
leader, in a situation that looked hopeless, not
only saved his unit, but allowed the entire Union Army to maintain its position and defeat the
Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania. The story’s hero is a colonel—but it could have been a
captain, or a sergeant, or a corporal. At other
times and in other places it has been.

The Army Leadership Framework

COL Chamberlain at Gettysburg
In late June 1863 GEN Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia passed through western
Maryland and invaded Pennsylvania. For five days, the Army of the Potomac hurried to get between
the Confederates and the national capital. On 1 July the 20th Maine received word to press on to
Gettysburg. The Union Army had engaged the Confederates there, and Union commanders were
hurrying all available forces to the hills south of the little town.
The 20th Maine arrived at Gettysburg near midday on 2 July, after marching more than one
hundred miles in five days. They had had only two hours sleep and no hot food during the previous 24
hours. The regiment was preparing to go into a defensive position as part of the brigade commanded
by COL Strong Vincent when a staff officer rode up to COL Vincent and began gesturing towards a
little hill at the extreme southern end of the Union line. The hill, Little Round Top, dominated the Union
position and, at that moment, was unoccupied. If the Confederates placed artillery on it, they could
force the entire Union Army to withdraw. The hill had been left unprotected through a series of
mistakes—wrong assumptions, the failure to communicate clearly, and the failure to check—and the
situation was critical.
Realizing the danger, COL Vincent ordered his brigade to occupy Little Round Top. He positioned
the 20th Maine, commanded by COL Joshua L. Chamberlain, on his brigade’s left flank, the extreme
left of the Union line. COL Vincent told COL Chamberlain to “hold at all hazards.”
On Little Round Top, COL Chamberlain told his company commanders the purpose and
importance of their mission. He ordered the right flank company to tie in with the 83d Pennsylvania
and the left flank company to anchor on a large boulder. His thoughts turned to his left flank. There was
nothing there except a small hollow and the rising slope of Big Round Top. The 20th Maine was
literally at the end of the line.
COL Chamberlain then showed a skill common to good tactical leaders. He imagined threats to
his unit, did what he could to guard against them, and considered what he would do to meet other
possible threats. Since his left flank was open, COL Chamberlain sent B Company, commanded by
CPT Walter G. Morrill, off to guard it and “act as the necessities of battle required.” The captain
positioned his men behind a stone wall that would face the flank of any Confederate advance. There,
fourteen soldiers from the 2d US Sharpshooters, who had been separated from their unit, joined
them.
The 20th Maine had been in position only a few minutes when the soldiers of the 15th and 47th
Alabama attacked. The Confederates had also marched all night and were tired and thirsty. Even so,
they attacked ferociously.
The Maine men held their ground, but then one of COL Chamberlain’s officers reported seeing a
large body of Confederate soldiers moving laterally behind the attacking force. COL Chamberlain
climbed on a rock—exposing himself to enemy fire—and saw a Confederate unit moving around his
exposed left flank. If they outflanked him, his unit would be pushed off its position and destroyed. He
would have failed his mission.
COL Chamberlain had to think fast. The tactical manuals he had so diligently studied called for a
maneuver that would not work on this terrain. The colonel had to create a new maneuver, one that his
soldiers could execute, and execute now.
The 20th Maine was in a defensive line, two ranks deep. It was threatened by an attack around its left
flank. So the colonel ordered his company commanders to stretch the line to the left and bend it back to
form an angle, concealing the maneuver by keeping up a steady rate of fire. The corner of the angle would
be the large boulder he had pointed out earlier. The sidestep maneuver was tricky, but it was a
combination of other battle drills his soldiers knew. In spite of the terrible noise that made voice
commands useless, in spite of the blinding smoke, the cries of the wounded, and the continuing
Confederate attack, the Maine men were able to pull it off. Now COL Chamberlain’s thin line was only

1-8

FM 22-100

BE, KNOW, DO

COL Chamberlain at Gettysburg (continued)
one rank deep. His units, covering twice their normal frontage, were bent back into an L shape.
Minutes after COL Chamberlain repositioned his force, the Confederate infantry, moving up what they
thought was an open flank, were thrown back by the redeployed left wing of the 20th Maine. Surprised
and angry, they nonetheless attacked again.
The Maine men rallied and held; the Confederates regrouped and attacked. “The Alabamians
drove the Maine men from their positions five times. Five times they fought their way back again. At
some places, the muzzles of the opposing guns almost touched.” After these assaults, the Maine men
were down to one or two rounds per man, and the determined Confederates were regrouping for
another try. COL Chamberlain saw that he could not stay where he was and could not withdraw. So he
decided to counterattack. His men would have the advantage of attacking down the steep hill, he
reasoned, and the Confederates would not be expecting it. Clearly he was risking his entire unit, but
the fate of the Union Army depended on his men.
The decision left COL Chamberlain with another problem: there was nothing in the tactics book
about how to get his unit from their L-shaped position into a line of advance. Under tremendous fire
and in the midst of the battle, COL Chamberlain again called his commanders together. He explained
that the regiment’s left wing would swing around “like a barn door on a hinge” until it was even with the
right wing. Then the entire regiment, bayonets fixed, would charge downhill, staying anchored to the
83d Pennsylvania on its right. The explanation was clear and the situation clearly desperate.
When COL Chamberlain gave the order, 1LT Holman Melcher of F Company leaped forward and
led the left wing downhill toward the surprised Confederates. COL Chamberlain had positioned
himself at the boulder at the center of the L. When the left wing was abreast of the right wing, he
jumped off the rock and led the right wing down the hill. The entire regiment was now charging on line,
swinging like a great barn door—just as its commander had intended.
The Alabama soldiers, stunned at the sight of the charging Union troops, fell back on the positions
behind them. There the 20th Maine’s charge might have failed if not for a surprise resulting from COL
Chamberlain’s foresight. Just then CPT Morrill’s B Company and the sharpshooters opened fire on
the Confederate flank and rear. The exhausted and shattered Alabama regiments thought they were
surrounded. They broke and ran, not realizing that one more attack would have carried the hill.
The slopes of Little Round Top were littered with bodies. Saplings halfway up the hill had been
sawed in half by weapons fire. A third of the 20th Maine had fallen, 130 men out of 386. Nonetheless,
the farmers, woodsmen, and fishermen from Maine—under the command of a brave and creative
leader who had anticipated enemy actions, improvised under fire, and applied disciplined initiative in
the heat of battle—had fought through to victory.
1-31. COL Joshua Chamberlain was awarded
the Medal of Honor for his actions on 2 July
1863. After surviving terrible wounds at
Petersburg, Virginia, he and his command were
chosen to receive the surrender of Confederate
units at Appomattox in April 1865. His actions
there contributed to national reconciliation
and are described in Chapter 7.

must do, it’s easy to get lost in particulars. The
Army leadership framework is a tool that allows you to step back and think about leadership as a whole. It is a canopy that covers the
hundreds of things you do every day. The Army
leadership framework gives you the big picture
and can help you put your job, your people, and
your organization in perspective.

PUTTING
IT TOGETHER

1-33. The dimensions of the Army leadership
framework shown in Figure 1-1—the values, attributes, skills, and actions that support BE,
KNOW, and DO—each contain components. All
are interrelated; none stands alone. For example, will is very important, as you saw in the

is the Army’s common basis for thinking about
leadership. With all the day-to-day tasks you

case of COL Chamberlain. It’s discussed in
Chapter 2 under mental attributes. Yet will
cannot stand by itself. Left unchecked and
without moral boundaries, will can be dangerous. The case of Adolf Hitler shows this fact.
Will misapplied can also produce disastrous results. Early in World War I, French forces attacked German machine gun positions across
open fields, believing their élan (unit morale
and will to win) would overcome a technologically advanced weapon. The cost in lives was
catastrophic. Nevertheless, the will of leaders of
character and competence—like the small unit
leaders at Normandy that you’ll read about
later in this chapter—can make the difference
between victory and defeat.
1-34. This is how you should think about the
Army leadership framework: all its pieces work

in combination to produce something bigger
and better than the sum of the parts. BE the
leader of character: embrace Army values and
demonstrate leader attributes. Study and practice so that you have the skills to KNOW your
job. Then act, DO what’s right to achieve
excellence.
1-35. The Army leadership framework applies
to all Army leaders. However, as you assume
positions of increasing responsibility, you’ll
need to develop additional attributes and
master more skills and actions. Part of this
knowledge includes understanding what your
bosses are doing—the factors that affect their
decisions and the environment in which they
work. To help you do this, Army leadership positions are divided into three levels—direct, organizational, and strategic.

LEVELS OF LEADERSHIP
NCOs like to make a decision right away and move on to the next thing…so the higher up the
flagpole you go, the more you have to learn a very different style of leadership.

Command Sergeant Major Douglas E. Murray
United States Army Reserve

Figure 1-2. Army Leadership Levels
1-36. Figure 1-2 shows the perspectives of the
three levels of Army leadership: direct, organizational, and strategic. Factors that determine
a position’s leadership level can include the position’s span of control, its headquarters level,

1-10

and the extent of the influence the leader holding the position exerts. Other factors include
the size of the unit or organization, the type of
operations it conducts, the number of people assigned, and its planning horizon.

FM 22-100

Levels of Leadership

1-37. Sometimes the rank or grade of the
leader holding a position does not indicate the
position’s leadership level. That’s why Figure
1-2 does not show rank. A sergeant first class
serving as a platoon sergeant works at the
direct leadership level. If the same NCO holds a
headquarters job dealing with issues and policy
affecting a brigade-sized or larger organization,
the NCO works at the organizational leadership level. However, if the NCO’s primary duty
is running a staff section that supports the leaders who run the organization, the NCO is a direct leader. In fact, most leadership positions
are direct leadership positions, and every leader
at every level acts as a direct leader when dealing with immediate subordinates.
1-38. The headquarters echelon alone
doesn’t determine a position’s leadership
level. Soldiers and DA civilians of all ranks
and grades serve in strategic-level headquarters, but they are not all strategic-level leaders. The responsibilities of a duty position,
together with the other factors paragraph
1-36 lists, determine its leadership level. For
example, a DA civilian at a training area
range control with a dozen subordinates
works at the direct leadership level while a
DA civilian deputy garrison commander with
a span of influence over several thousand
people works at the organizational leadership
level. Most NCOs, company grade officers,
field grade officers, and DA civilian leaders
serve at the direct leadership level. Some senior NCOs, field grade officers, and highergrade DA civilians serve at the organizational
leadership level. Most general officers and
equivalent Senior Executive Service DA civilians serve at the organizational or strategic
leadership levels.
DIRECT LEADERSHIP
1-39. Direct leadership is face-to-face, first-line
leadership. It takes place in those organizations
where subordinates are used to seeing their
leaders all the time: teams and squads, sections
and platoons, companies, batteries, and
troops—even squadrons and battalions. The direct leader’s span of influence, those whose
lives he can reach out and touch, may range
from a handful to several hundred people.

Army Leadership

1-40. Direct leaders develop their subordinates
one-on-one; however, they also influence their
organization through their subordinates. For
instance, a cavalry squadron commander is
close enough to his soldiers to have a direct influence on them. They’re used to seeing him
regularly, even if it is only once a week in garrison; they expect to see him from time to time in
the field. Still, during daily operations, the commander guides the organization primarily
through his subordinate officers and NCOs.
1-41. For direct leaders there is more certainty
and less complexity than for organizational and
strategic leaders. Direct leaders are close
enough to see—very quickly—how things work,
how things don’t work, and how to address any
problems. (Chapter 4 discusses direct leader
skills. Chapter 5 discusses direct leader actions.)
ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP
1-42. Organizational leaders influence several
hundred to several thousand people. They do
this indirectly, generally through more levels of
subordinates than do direct leaders. The additional levels of subordinates can make it more
difficult for them to see results. Organizational
leaders have staffs to help them lead their people and manage their organizations’ resources.
They establish policies and the organizational
climate that support their subordinate leaders.
(Chapter 3 introduces climate and culture and
explains the role of direct leaders in setting the
organizational climate. Chapters 6 and 7 discuss the roles of organizational and strategic
leaders in establishing and maintaining the organizational climate and institutional culture.)
1-43. Organizational leadership skills differ
from direct leadership skills in degree, but not
in kind. That is, the skill domains are the same,
but organizational leaders must deal with more
complexity, more people, greater uncertainty,
and a greater number of unintended consequences. They find themselves influencing people more through policymaking and systems
integration than through face-to-face contact.
1-44. Organizational leaders include military
leaders at the brigade through corps levels,
military and DA civilian leaders at directorate

1-11

The Army Leadership Framework

through installation levels, and DA civilians at
the assistant through undersecretary of the
Army levels. They focus on planning and
mission accomplishment over the next two to
ten years.
1-45. Getting out of their offices and visiting
the parts of their organizations where the work
is done is especially important for organizational leaders. They must make time to get to
the field to compare the reports their staff gives
them with the actual conditions their people
face and the perceptions of the organization
and mission they hold. Because of their lessfrequent presence among their soldiers and DA
civilians, organizational leaders must use those
visits they are able to make to assess how well
the commander’s intent is understood and to
reinforce the organization’s priorities.
STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP

transportation to all services. (JP 0-2, JP 3-0,
and FM 100-7 discuss combatant commands.)
Although civilian leaders make national policy,
decisions a CINC makes while carrying out that
policy may affect whether or not a national objective is achieved. Strategic leaders apply
many of the same leadership skills and actions
they mastered as direct and organizational
leaders; however, strategic leadership requires
others that are more complex and indirectly
applied.
1-48. Strategic leaders concern themselves
with the total environment in which the Army
functions; their decisions take into account
such things as congressional hearings, Army
budgetary constraints, new systems acquisition, civilian programs, research, development,
and interservice cooperation—just to name a
few.

1-46. Strategic leaders include military and DA
civilian leaders at the major command through
Department of Defense levels. Strategic leaders
are responsible for large organizations and influence several thousand to hundreds of thousands of people. They establish force structure,
allocate resources, communicate strategic vision, and prepare their commands and the
Army as a whole for their future roles.

1-49. Strategic leaders, like direct and
organizational leaders, process information
quickly, assess alternatives based on incomplete data, make decisions, and generate support. However, strategic leaders’ decisions
affect more people, commit more resources, and
have wider-ranging consequences in both space
and time than do decisions of organizational
and direct leaders.

1-47. Strategic leaders work in an uncertain
environment on highly complex problems that
affect and are affected by events and organizations outside the Army. Actions of a theater
commander in chief (CINC), for example, may
even have an impact on global politics. (CINCs
command combatant commands, very large,
joint organizations assigned broad, continuing
missions. Theater CINCs are assigned responsibilities for a geographic area (a theater); for
example, the CINC of the US Central Command is responsible for most of southwestern
Asia and part of eastern Africa. Functional
CINCs are assigned responsibilities not
bounded by geography; for example, the CINC
of the US Transportation Command is responsible for providing integrated land, sea, and air

1-50. Strategic leaders often do not see their
ideas come to fruition during their “watch”;
their initiatives may take years to plan,
prepare, and execute. In-process reviews (IPRs)
might not even begin until after the leader has
left the job. This has important implications for
long-range planning. On the other hand, some
strategic decisions may become a front-page
headline of the next morning’s newspaper.
Strategic leaders have very few opportunities to
visit the lowest-level organizations of their
commands; thus, their sense of when and where
to visit is crucial. Because they exert influence
primarily through subordinates, strategic leaders must develop strong skills in picking and developing good ones. This is an important
improving skill, which Chapter 7 discusses.

More than anything else, I had confidence in my soldiers, junior leaders, and staff. They were

trusted them. I think in Just Cause, which was a company commander’s war, being a
decentralized commander paid big dividends because I wasn’t in the knickers of my company
commanders all the time. I gave them the mission and let them do it. I couldn’t do it for them.

1-51. At any level, anyone responsible for supervising people or accomplishing a mission
that involves other people is a leader. Anyone
who influences others, motivating them to action or influencing their thinking or decision
making, is a leader. It’s not a function only of
position; it’s also a function of role. In addition, everyone in the Army—including every
leader—fits somewhere in a chain of command. Everyone in the Army is also a follower
or subordinate. There are, obviously, many
leaders in an organization, and it’s important
to understand that you don’t just lead subordinates—you lead other leaders. Even at the lowest level, you are a leader of leaders.

leadership levels: the company commander

leaders through squad leaders, and the squad
leaders through team leaders. At each level,
the leader must let subordinate leaders do
their jobs. Practicing this kind of decentralized
execution based on mission orders in peacetime trains subordinates who will, in battle,
exercise disciplined initiative in the absence of
orders. They’ll continue to fight when the radios are jammed, when the plan falls apart,
when the enemy does something unexpected.
(Appendix A discusses leader roles and relationships. FM 100-34 discusses mission orders
and initiative.)
1-53. This decentralization does not mean that
a commander never steps in and takes direct
control. There will be times when a leader has
to stop leading through subordinates, step forward, and say, “Follow me!” A situation like
this may occur in combat, when things are falling apart and, like BG Thomas J. Jackson,
you’ll need to “stand like a stone wall” and

Army Leadership

save victory. (You’ll read about BG Jackson in
Chapter 2.) Or it may occur during training,
when a subordinate is about to make a mistake
that could result in serious injury or death and
you must act to prevent disaster.
1-54. More often, however, you should
empower your subordinate leaders: give them
a task, delegate the necessary authority, and
let them do the work. Of course you need to
check periodically. How else will you be able to
critique, coach, and evaluate them? But the
point is to “power down without powering off.”
Give your subordinate leaders the authority
they need to get the job done. Then check on
them frequently enough to keep track of what
is going on but not so often that you get in their
way. You can develop this skill through
experience.
1-55. It takes personal courage to operate this
way. But a leader must let subordinate leaders
learn by doing. Is there a risk that, for instance,
a squad leader—especially an inexperienced
one—will make mistakes? Of course there is.
But if your subordinate leaders are to grow, you
must let them take risks. This means you must
let go of some control and let your subordinate
leaders do things on their own—within bounds
established by mission orders and your expressed intent.
1-56. A company commander who routinely
steps in and gives orders directly to squad leaders weakens the whole chain of command, denies squad leaders valuable learning
experiences, and sends a signal to the whole
company that the chain of command and NCO
support channel can be bypassed at any time.
On the other hand, successful accomplishment
of specified and implied missions results from
subordinate leaders at all levels exercising

1-13

The Army Leadership Framework

disciplined initiative within the commander’s
intent. Effective leaders strive to create an environment of trust and understanding that encourages their subordinates to seize the
initiative and act. (Appendix A discusses authority, the chain of command, and the NCO support
channel. FM 100-34 contains information about
building trust up and down the chain of command.)
1-57. Weak leaders who have not trained their
subordinates sometimes say, “My organization
can’t do it without me.” Many people, used to
being at the center of the action, begin to feel as
if they’re indispensable. You have heard them:
“I can’t take a day off. I have to be here all the
time. I must watch my subordinates’ every
move, or who knows what will happen?” But no
one is irreplaceable. The Army is not going to
stop functioning because one leader—no matter how senior, no matter how central—steps
aside. In combat, the loss of a leader is a shock
to a unit, but the unit must continue its mission. If leaders train their subordinates properly, one of them will take charge.

1-58. Strong commanders—those with personal courage—realize their subordinate leaders need room to work. This doesn’t mean that
you should let your subordinates make the
same mistake over and over. Part of your responsibility as a leader is to help your subordinates succeed. You can achieve this through
empowering and coaching. Train your subordinates to plan, prepare, execute, and assess well
enough to operate independently. Provide sufficient purpose, direction, and motivation for
them to operate in support of the overall plan.
1-59. Finally, check and make corrections.
Take time to help your subordinates sort out
what happened and why. Conduct AARs so your
people don’t just make mistakes, but learn from
them. There is not a soldier out there, from private to general, who has not slipped up from
time to time. Good soldiers, and especially good
leaders, learn from those mistakes. Good leaders help their subordinates grow by teaching,
coaching, and counseling.

LEADERSHIP AND COMMAND
When you are commanding, leading [soldiers] under conditions where physical exhaustion
and privations must be ignored, where the lives of [soldiers] may be sacrificed, then, the
efficiency of your leadership will depend only to a minor degree on your tactical ability. It will
primarily be determined by your character, your reputation, not much for courage—which
will be accepted as a matter of course—but by the previous reputation you have established for
fairness, for that high-minded patriotic purpose, that quality of unswerving determination to
carry through any military task assigned to you.

General of the Army George C. Marshall
Speaking to officer candidates in September, 1941

1-60. Command is a specific and legal position
unique to the military. It’s where the buck
stops. Like all leaders, commanders are
responsible for the success of their organizations, but commanders have special accountability to their superiors, the institution, and
the nation. Commanders must think deeply
and creatively, for their concerns encompass

1-14

yesterday’s heritage, today’s mission, and tomorrow’s force. To maintain their balance
among all the demands on them, they must exemplify Army values. The nation, as well as the
members of the Army, hold commanders accountable for accomplishing the mission, keeping the institution sound, and caring for its
people.

FM 22-100

Leadership and Command

1-61. Command is a sacred trust. The legal and
moral responsibilities of commanders exceed
those of any other leader of similar position or
authority. Nowhere else does a boss have to answer for how subordinates live and what they
do after work. Our society and the institution
look to commanders to make sure that missions
succeed, that people receive the proper training
and care, that values survive. On the one hand,
the nation grants commanders special authority to be good stewards of its most precious resources: freedom and people. On the other
hand, those citizens serving in the Army also
trust their commanders to lead them well.
NCOs probably have a more immediate impact

on their people, but commanders set the
policies that reward superior performance and
personally punish misconduct. It’s no wonder
that organizations take on the personal stamp
of their commanders. Those selected to command offer something beyond their formal
authority: their personal example and public
actions have tremendous moral force. Because
of that powerful aspect of their position, people
inside and outside the Army see a commander
as the human face of “the system”—the person
who embodies the commitment of the Army to
operational readiness and care of its people.

SUBORDINATES
To our subordinates we owe everything we are or hope to be. For it is our subordinates, not our
superiors, who raise us to the dizziest of professional heights, and it is our subordinates who
can and will, if we deserve it, bury us in the deepest mire of disgrace. When the chips are down
and our subordinates have accepted us as their leader, we don’t need any superior to tell us; we
see it in their eyes and in their faces, in the barracks, on the field, and on the battle line. And on
that final day when we must be ruthlessly demanding, cruel and heartless, they will rise as
one to do our bidding, knowing full well that it may be their last act in this life.

Colonel Albert G. Jenkins, CSA
8th Virginia Cavalry
1-62. No one is only a leader; each of you is also
a subordinate, and all members of the Army
are part of a team. A technical supervisor leading a team of DA civilian specialists, for instance, isn’t just the leader of that group. The
team chief also works for someone else, and the
team has a place in a larger organization.

the old one. The team will spend a lot of time installing the new system, all the while keeping
up with their regular workload. Then they’ll
have to spend more time undoing the work once
the new system fails. And the team chief believes it will fail—all his experience points to
that.

1-63. Part of being a good subordinate is
supporting your chain of command. And it’s
your responsibility to make sure your team
supports the larger organization. Consider a
leader whose team is responsible for handling
the pay administration of a large organization.
The chief knows that when the team makes a
mistake or falls behind in its work, its
customers—soldiers and DA civilians—pay the
price in terms of late pay actions. One day a
message from the boss introducing a new computer system for handling payroll changes arrives. The team chief looks hard at the new
system and decides it will not work as well as

1-64. But the team chief cannot simply say,
“We’ll let these actions pile up; that’ll send a
signal to the commander about just how bad the
new system is and how important we are down
here.” The team does not exist in a vacuum; it’s
part of a larger organization that serves soldiers and DA civilians. For the good of the organization and the people in it, the team chief
must make sure the job gets done.

Army Leadership

1-65. Since the team chief disagrees with the
boss’s order and it affects both the team’s
mission and the welfare of its members, the
team chief must tell the boss; he must have
the moral courage to make his opinions

1-15

The Army Leadership Framework

known. Of course, the team chief must also
have the right attitude; disagreement doesn’t
mean it’s okay to be disrespectful. He must
choose the time and place—usually in private—to explain his concerns to the boss fully
and clearly. In addition, the team chief must
go into the meeting knowing that, at some
point, the discussion will be over and he must
execute the boss’s decision, whatever it is.
1-66. Once the boss has listened to all the arguments and made a decision, the team chief must
support that decision as if it were his own. If he
goes to the team and says, “I still don’t think
this is a good idea, but we’re going to do it anyway,” the team chief undermines the chain of
command and teaches his people a bad lesson.
Imagine what it would do to an organization’s
effectiveness if subordinates chose which orders to pursue vigorously and which ones to
half step.
1-67. Such an action would also damage the
team chief himself: in the future the team may
treat his orders as he treated the boss’s. And

there is no great leap between people thinking
their leader is disloyal to the boss to the same
people thinking their leader will be disloyal to
them as well. The good leader executes the
boss’s decision with energy and enthusiasm;
looking at their leader, subordinates will
believe the leader thinks it’s absolutely the best
possible solution. The only exception to this involves your duty to disobey obviously illegal orders. This is not a privilege you can claim, but a
duty you must perform. (Chapter 2 discusses
character and illegal orders. Chapter 4 discusses ethical reasoning.)
1-68. Loyalty to superiors and subordinates
does more than ensure smooth-running peacetime organizations. It prepares units for combat by building soldiers’ trust in leaders and
leaders’ faith in soldiers. The success of the airborne assault prior to the 1944 Normandy invasion is one example of how well-trained
subordinate leaders can make the difference between victory and defeat.

Small Unit Leaders’ Initiative in Normandy
The amphibious landings in Normandy on D-Day, 1944, were preceded by a corps-sized, night
parachute assault by American and British airborne units. Many of the thousands of aircraft that
delivered the 82d and 101st (US) Airborne Divisions to Normandy on the night of 5-6 June 1944 were
blown off course. Some wound up in the wrong place because of enemy fire; others were simply lost.
Thousands of paratroopers, the spearhead of the Allied invasion of Western Europe, found
themselves scattered across unfamiliar countryside, many of them miles from their drop zones. They
wandered about in the night, searching for their units, their buddies, their leaders, and their
objectives. In those first few hours, the fate of the invasion hung in the balance; if the airborne forces
did not cut the roads leading to the beaches, the Germans could counterattack the landing forces at
the water’s edge, crushing the invasion before it even began.
Fortunately for the Allies and the soldiers in the landing craft, the leaders in these airborne forces
had trained their subordinate leaders well, encouraging their initiative, allowing them to do their jobs.
Small unit leaders scattered around the darkened, unfamiliar countryside knew they were part of a
larger effort, and they knew its success was up to them. They had been trained to act instead of
waiting to be told what to do; they knew that if the invasion was to succeed, their small units had to
accomplish their individual missions.
Among these leaders were men like CPT Sam Gibbons of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment.
He gathered a group of 12 soldiers—from different commands—and liberated a tiny village—which
turned out to be outside the division area of operations—before heading south toward his original objective, the Douve River bridges. CPT Gibbons set off with a dozen people he had never seen before and
no demolition equipment to destroy a bridge nearly 15 kilometers away. Later, he remarked,

1-16

FM 22-100

Subordinates

Small Unit Leaders’ Initiative in Normandy (continued)
“This certainly wasn’t the way I had thought the invasion would go, nor had we ever rehearsed it in this
manner.” But he was moving out to accomplish the mission. Throughout the Cotentin Peninsula,
small unit leaders from both divisions were doing the same.
This was the payoff for hard training and leaders who valued soldiers, communicated the
importance of the mission, and trusted their subordinate leaders to accomplish it. As they trained their
commands for the invasion, organizational leaders focused downward as well as upward. They took
care of their soldiers’ needs while providing the most realistic training possible. This freed their
subordinate leaders to focus upward as well as downward. Because they knew their units were
well-trained and their leaders would do everything in their power to support them, small unit leaders
were able to focus on the force’s overall mission. They knew and understood the commander’s intent.
They believed that if they exercised disciplined initiative within that intent, things would turn out right.
Events proved them correct.

1-69. You read earlier about how COL Joshua
Chamberlain accomplished his mission and
took care of his soldiers at Little Round Top.
Empower subordinates to take initiative and be
the subordinate leader who stands up and
makes a difference. That lesson applies in peace
and in combat, from the smallest organization
to the largest. Consider the words of GEN Edward C. Meyer, former Army Chief of Staff:
When I became chief of staff, I set two personal
goals for myself. The first was to ensure that the
Army was continually prepared to go to war,
and the second was to create a climate in which
each member could find personal meaning and
fulfillment. It is my belief that only by attainment of the second goal will we ensure the first.
1-70. GEN Meyer’s words and COL Chamberlain’s actions both say the same thing: leaders
must accomplish the mission and take care of
their soldiers. For COL Chamberlain, this

meant he had to personally lead his men in a
bayonet charge and show he believed they could
do what he asked of them. For GEN Meyer the
challenge was on a larger scale: his task was to
make sure the entire Army was ready to fight
and win. He knew—and he tells us—that the
only way to accomplish such a huge goal is to
pay attention to the smallest parts of the machine, the individual soldiers and DA civilians.
Through his subordinate leaders, GEN Meyer
offered challenges and guidance and set the example so that every member of the Army felt a
part of the team and knew that the team was
doing important work.
1-71. Both leaders understood the path to
excellence: disciplined leaders with strong values produce disciplined soldiers with strong values. Together they become disciplined, cohesive
units that train hard, fight honorably, and win
decisively.

their units. It is a cohesive organization of
high-performing units characterized by the
warrior ethos.
1-73. Army leaders get the job done. Sometimes it’s on a large scale, such as GEN Meyer’s
role in making sure the Army was ready to
fight. Other times it may be amid the terror of
combat, as with COL Chamberlain at Gettysburg. However, most of you will not become
Army Chief of Staff. Not all of you will face the
challenge of combat. So it would be a mistake to
think that the only time mission accomplishment and leadership are important is with the
obvious examples—the general officer, the combat leader. The Army cannot accomplish its
mission unless all Army leaders, soldiers, and
DA civilians accomplish theirs—whether that
means filling out a status report, repairing a vehicle, planning a budget, packing a parachute,
maintaining pay records, or walking guard
duty. The Army isn’t a single general or a handful of combat heroes; it’s hundreds of thousands of soldiers and DA civilians, tens of
thousands of leaders, all striving to do the right
things. Every soldier, every DA civilian, is important to the success of the Army.

CHARACTER

George Bush
41st President of the United States

1-74 The ultimate end of war, at least as America fights it, is to restore peace. For this reason
the Army must accomplish its mission honorably. The Army fights to win, but with one eye on
the kind of peace that will follow the war. The
actions of Ulysses S. Grant, general in chief of
the Union Army at the end of the Civil War,
provide an example of balancing fighting to win
with restoring the peace.
1-75. In combat GEN Grant had been a relentless and determined commander. During the final days of campaigning in Virginia, he

1-18

hounded his exhausted foes and pushed his own
troops on forced marches of 30 and 40 miles to
end the war quickly. GEN Grant’s approach to
war was best summed up by President Lincoln,
who said simply, “He fights.”
1-76. Yet even before the surrender was
signed, GEN Grant had shifted his focus to the
peace. Although some of his subordinates
wanted the Confederates to submit to the
humiliation of an unconditional surrender,
GEN Grant treated his former enemies with respect and considered the long-term effects of
his decisions. Rather than demanding an
unconditional surrender, GEN Grant negotiated terms with GEN Lee. One of those was
allowing his former enemies to keep their
horses because they needed them for spring
plowing. GEN Grant reasoned that peace would
best be served if the Southerners got back to a
normal existence as quickly as possible. GEN
Grant’s decisions and actions sent a message to
every man in the Union Army: that it was time
to move on, to get back to peacetime concerns.
1-77. At the same time, the Union commander
insisted on a formal surrender. He realized that
for a true peace to prevail, the Confederates had
to publicly acknowledge that organized hostility to the Union had ended. GEN Grant knew
that true peace would come about only if both
victors and vanquished put the war behind
them—a timeless lesson.
1-78. The Army must accomplish its mission
honorably. FM 27-10 discusses the law of war
and reminds you of the importance of restoring
peace. The Army minimizes collateral damage
and avoids harming noncombatants for practical as well as honorable reasons. No matter
what, though, soldiers fight to win, to live or die
with honor for the benefit of our country and its
citizens.
1-79. Army leaders often make decisions amid
uncertainty, without guidance or precedent, in
situations dominated by fear and risk, and
sometimes under the threat of sudden, violent
death. At those times leaders fall back on their
values and Army values and ask, What is right?
The question is simple; the answer, often, is
not. Having made the decision, the leader depends on self-discipline to see it through.

FM 22-100

The Payoff: Excellence

ACHIEVING COLLECTIVE
EXCELLENCE
1-80. Some examples of excellence are obvious:
COL Chamberlain’s imaginative defense of Little Round Top, GA Dwight Eisenhower drafting
his D-Day message (you’ll read about it in
Chapter 2), MSG Gary Gordon and SFC Randall Shughart putting their lives on the line to
save other soldiers in Somalia (their story is in
Chapter 3). Those examples of excellence shine,
and good leaders teach these stories; soldiers
must know they are part of a long tradition of
excellence and valor.
1-81. But good leaders see excellence wherever
and whenever it happens. Excellent leaders
make certain all subordinates know the important roles they play. Look for everyday examples that occur under ordinary circumstances:
the way a soldier digs a fighting position, prepares for guard duty, fixes a radio, lays an artillery battery; the way a DA civilian handles an
action, takes care of customers, meets a deadline on short notice. Good leaders know that
each of these people is contributing in a small
but important way to the business of the Army.
An excellent Army is the collection of small
tasks done to standard, day in and day out. At
the end of the day, at the end of a career, those
leaders, soldiers and DA civilians—the ones
whose excellent work created an excellent
Army—can look back confidently. Whether
they commanded an invasion armada of
thousands of soldiers or supervised a technical
section of three people, they know they did the
job well and made a difference.

1-82. Excellence in leadership does not mean
perfection; on the contrary, an excellent leader
allows subordinates room to learn from their
mistakes as well as their successes. In such a climate, people work to improve and take the risks
necessary to learn. They know that when they
fall short—as they will—their leader will pick
them up, give them new or more detailed instructions, and send them on their way again.
This is the only way to improve the force, the
only way to train leaders.
1-83. A leader who sets a standard of “zero defects, no mistakes” is also saying “Don’t take
any chances. Don’t try anything you can’t already do perfectly, and for heaven’s sake, don’t
try anything new.” That organization will not
improve; in fact, its ability to perform the mission will deteriorate rapidly. Accomplishing the
Army’s mission requires leaders who are imaginative, flexible, and daring. Improving the
Army for future missions requires leaders who
are thoughtful and reflective. These qualities
are incompatible with a “zero-defects” attitude.
1-84. Competent, confident leaders tolerate
honest mistakes that do not result from
negligence. The pursuit of excellence is not a
game to achieve perfection; it involves trying,
learning, trying again, and getting better each
time. This in no way justifies or excuses failure.
Even the best efforts and good intentions cannot take away an individual’s responsibility for
his actions.

SUMMARY
1-85. Leadership in combat is your primary
and most important challenge. It requires you
to accept a set of values that contributes to a
core of motivation and will. If you fail to accept
and live these Army values, your soldiers may
die unnecessarily. Army leaders of character
and competence act to achieve excellence by
developing a force that can fight and win the
nation’s wars and serve the common defense of
the United States. The Army leadership
framework identifies the dimensions of Army

Army Leadership

leadership: what the Army expects you, as one
of its leaders, to BE, KNOW, and DO.
1-86. Leadership positions fall into one of three
leadership levels: direct, organizational, and
strategic. The perspective and focus of leaders
change and the actions they must DO become
more complex with greater consequences as
they assume positions of greater responsibility.
Nonetheless, they must still live Army values
and possess leader attributes.

1-19

The Army Leadership Framework

1-87. Being a good subordinate is part of being
a good leader. Everyone is part of a team, and
all members have responsibilities that go with
belonging to that team. But every soldier and
DA civilian who is responsible for supervising
people or accomplishing a mission that involves
other people is a leader. All soldiers and DA civilians at one time or another must act as
leaders.
1-88. Values and attributes make up a leader’s
character, the BE of Army leadership. Character embodies self-discipline and the will to win,
among other things. It contributes to the motivation to persevere. From this motivation

1-20

comes the lifelong work of mastering the skills
that define competence, the KNOW of Army
leadership. As you reflect on Army values and
leadership attributes and develop the skills your
position and experience require, you become a
leader of character and competence, one who
can act to achieve excellence, who can DO what
is necessary to accomplish the mission and take
care of your people. That is leadership—influencing people by providing purpose, direction,
and motivation while operating to accomplish
the mission and improving the organization.
That is what makes a successful leader, one who
lives the principles of BE, KNOW, DO.

shown in Figure 1-1, 30 words spell out your job
as a leader: Leaders of character and competence act to achieve excellence by
developing a force that can fight and win
the nation’s wars and serve the common

in that sentence. This chapter looks at it in
detail.
2-2. Army leadership doctrine addresses what
makes leaders of character and competence and
what makes leadership. Figure 2-1 highlights
these values and attributes. Remember from
Chapter 1 that character describes what leaders
must BE; competence refers to what leaders
must KNOW; and action is what leaders must
DO. Although this chapter discusses these concepts one at a time, they don’t stand alone; they
are closely connected and together make up
who you seek to be (a leader of character and
competence) and what you need to do (leadership).

2-3. Character—who you are—contributes significantly to how you act. Character helps you
know what’s right and do what’s right, all the
time and at whatever the cost. Character is
made up of two interacting parts: values and attributes. Stephen Ambrose, speaking about the
Civil War, says that “at the pivotal point in the

war it was always the character of individuals
that made the difference.” Army leaders must
be those critical individuals of character themselves and in turn develop character in those
they lead. (Appendix E discusses character development.)

2-4. Your attitudes about the worth of people,
concepts, and other things describe your values.
Everything begins there. Your subordinates enter the Army with their own values, developed
in childhood and nurtured through experience.
All people are all shaped by what they’ve seen,
what they’ve learned, and whom they’ve met.

2-2

But when soldiers and DA civilians take the
oath, they enter an institution guided by Army
values. These are more than a system of rules.
They’re not just a code tucked away in a drawer
or a list in a dusty book. These values tell you
what you need to be, every day, in every action
you take. Army values form the very identity of
the Army, the solid rock upon which everything
else stands, especially in combat. They are the
glue that binds together the members of a noble
profession. As a result, the whole is much
greater than the sum of its parts. Army values
are nonnegotiable: they apply to everyone and
in every situation throughout the Army.
2-5. Army values remind us and tell the rest of
the world—the civilian government we serve,
the nation we protect, even our enemies—who
we are and what we stand for. The trust soldiers
and DA civilians have for each other and the
trust the American people have in us depends
on how well we live up to Army values. They are
the fundamental building blocks that enable us
to discern right from wrong in any situation.
Army values are consistent; they support one
another. You can’t follow one value and ignore
another.
2-6. Here are the Army values that guide you,
the leader, and the rest of the Army. They form
the acronym LDRSHIP:

2-7. The following discussions can help you understand Army values, but understanding is
only the first step. As a leader, you must not
only understand them; you must believe in
them, model them in your own actions, and
teach others to accept and live by them.
LOYALTY
Bear true faith and allegiance to the US
Constitution, the Army, your unit,
and other soldiers.
Loyalty is the big thing, the greatest battle asset
of all. But no man ever wins the loyalty of troops
by preaching loyalty. It is given to him as he
proves his possession of the other virtues.
Brigadier General S. L. A. Marshall
Men Against Fire

2-8. Since before the founding of the republic,
the Army has respected its subordination to its
civilian political leaders. This subordination is
fundamental to preserving the liberty of all
Americans. You began your Army career by
swearing allegiance to the Constitution, the basis of our government and laws. If you’ve never

read it or if it has been a while, the Constitution
is in Appendix F. Pay particular attention to Article I, Section 8, which outlines congressional
responsibilities regarding the armed forces, and
Article II, Section 2, which designates the president as commander in chief. Beyond your allegiance to the Constitution, you have an
obligation to be faithful to the Army—the institution and its people—and to your unit or organization. Few examples illustrate loyalty to
country and institution as well as the example
of GEN George Washington in 1782.
2-9. GEN Washington’s example shows how
the obligation to subordinates and peers fits in
the context of loyalty to the chain of command
and the institution at large. As commander of
the Continental Army, GEN Washington was
obligated to see that his soldiers were taken
care of. However, he also was obligated to
ensure that the new nation remained secure
and that the Continental Army remained able
to fight if necessary. If the Continental Army
had marched on the seat of government, it may
well have destroyed the nation by undermining
the law that held it together. It also would have
destroyed the Army as an institution by destroying the basis for the authority under
which it served. GEN Washington realized
these things and acted based on his knowledge.
Had he done nothing else, this single act would
have been enough to establish GEN George
Washington as the father of his country.

GEN Washington at Newburgh
Following its victory at Yorktown in 1781, the Continental Army set up camp at Newburgh, New
York, to wait for peace with Great Britain. The central government formed under the Articles of
Confederation proved weak and unwilling to supply the Army properly or even pay the soldiers who
had won the war for independence. After months of waiting many officers, angry and impatient,
suggested that the Army march on the seat of government in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and force
Congress to meet the Army’s demands. One colonel even suggested that GEN Washington become
King George I.
Upon hearing this, GEN Washington assembled his officers and publicly and emphatically rejected
the suggestion. He believed that seizing power by force would have destroyed everything for which the
Revolutionary War had been fought. By this action, GEN Washington firmly established an enduring
precedent: America’s armed forces are subordinate to civilian authority and serve the democratic
principles that are now enshrined in the Constitution. GEN Washington’s action demonstrated the
loyalty to country that the Army must maintain in order to protect the freedom enjoyed by all Americans.

Army Leadership

2-3

What the Leader Must Be, Know, and Do

2-10. Loyalty is a two-way street: you should
not expect loyalty without being prepared to
give it as well. Leaders can neither demand loyalty nor win it from their people by talking
about it. The loyalty of your people is a gift they
give you when, and only when, you deserve
it—when you train them well, treat them fairly,
and live by the concepts you talk about. Leaders
who are loyal to their subordinates never let
them be misused.
2-11. Soldiers fight for each other—loyalty is
commitment. Some of you will encounter the
most important way of earning this loyalty:
leading your soldiers well in combat. There’s no
loyalty fiercer than that of soldiers who trust
their leader to take them through the dangers
of combat. However, loyalty extends to all members of an organization—to your superiors and
subordinates, as well as your peers.
2-12. Loyalty extends to all members of all
components of the Army. The reserve components—Army National Guard and Army Reserve—play an increasingly active role in the
Army’s mission. Most DA civilians will not be
called upon to serve in combat theaters, but
their contributions to mission accomplishment
are nonetheless vital. As an Army leader, you’ll
serve throughout your career with soldiers of
the active and reserve components as well as

DA civilians. All are members of the same team,
loyal to one another.
DUTY
Fulfill your obligations.
The essence of duty is acting in the absence of
orders or direction from others, based on an
inner sense of what is morally and
professionally right....

General John A. Wickham Jr.
Former Army Chief of Staff
2-13. Duty begins with everything required of
you by law, regulation, and orders; but it
includes much more than that. Professionals do
their work not just to the minimum standard,
but to the very best of their ability. Soldiers and
DA civilians commit to excellence in all aspects
of their professional responsibility so that when
the job is done they can look back and say, “I
couldn’t have given any more.”
2-14. Army leaders take the initiative, figuring
out what needs to be done before being told
what to do. What’s more, they take full responsibility for their actions and those of their subordinates. Army leaders never shade the truth to
make the unit look good—or even to make their
subordinates feel good. Instead, they follow their
higher duty to the Army and the nation.

Duty in Korea
CPT Viola B. McConnell was the only Army nurse on duty in Korea in July of 1950. When
hostilities broke out, she escorted nearly 700 American evacuees from Seoul to Japan aboard a
freighter designed to accommodate only 12 passengers. CPT McConnell assessed priorities for care
of the evacuees and worked exhaustively with a medical team to care for them. Once in Japan, she
requested reassignment back to Korea. After all she had already done, CPT McConnell returned to
Taejon to care for and evacuate wounded soldiers of the 24th Infantry Division.

2-15. CPT McConnell understood and fulfilled
her duty to the Army and to the soldiers she
supported in ways that went beyond her medical training. A leader’s duty is to take charge,
even in unfamiliar circumstances. But duty
isn’t reserved for special occasions. When a platoon sergeant tells a squad leader to inspect
weapons, the squad leader has fulfilled his

2-4

minimum obligation when he has checked the
weapons. He’s done what he was told to do. But
if the squad leader finds weapons that are not
clean or serviced, his sense of duty tells him to
go beyond the platoon sergeant’s instructions.
The squad leader does his duty when he corrects the problem and ensures the weapons are
up to standard.

FM 22-100

Army Values

2-16. In extremely rare cases, you may receive
an illegal order. Duty requires that you refuse
to obey it. You have no choice but to do what’s
ethically and legally correct. Paragraphs 2-97
through 2-99 discuss illegal orders.
RESPECT
Treat people as they should be treated.
The discipline which makes the soldiers of a free
country reliable in battle is not to be gained by
harsh or tyrannical treatment. On the contrary,
such treatment is far more likely to destroy than
to make an army. It is possible to impart
instruction and to give commands in such
manner and such a tone of voice to inspire in the
soldier no feeling but an intense desire to obey,
while the opposite manner and tone of voice
cannot fail to excite strong resentment and a
desire to disobey. The one mode or the other of
dealing with subordinates springs from a
corresponding spirit in the breast of the
commander. He who feels the respect which is
due to others cannot fail to inspire in them
regard for himself, while he who feels, and
hence manifests, disrespect toward others,
especially his inferiors, cannot fail to inspire
hatred against himself.

Major General John M. Schofield
Address to the United States Corps of Cadets
11 August 1879

differences. Actively seeking to learn about people and cultures different from your own can
help you do this. Being sensitive to other cultures can also aid you in counseling your people
more effectively. You show respect when you
seek to understand your people’s background,
see things from their perspective, and appreciate what’s important to them.
2-19. As an Army leader, you must also foster
a climate in which everyone is treated with
dignity and respect regardless of race, gender,
creed, or religious belief. Fostering this climate begins with your example: how you live
Army values shows your people how they
should live them. However, values training is
another major contributor. Effective training
helps create a common understanding of
Army values and the standards you expect.
When you conduct it as part of your regular
routine—such as during developmental counseling sessions—you reinforce the message
that respect for others is part of the character
of every soldier and DA civilian. Combined
with your example, such training creates an
organizational climate that promotes consideration for others, fairness in all dealings, and
equal opportunity. In essence, Army leaders
treat others as they wish to be treated.

2-17. Respect for the individual forms the basis
for the rule of law, the very essence of what
makes America. In the Army, respect means
recognizing and appreciating the inherent dignity and worth of all people. This value reminds
you that your people are your greatest resource.
Army leaders honor everyone’s individual
worth by treating all people with dignity and
respect.

2-20. As part of this consideration, leaders create an environment in which subordinates are
challenged, where they can reach their full potential and be all they can be. Providing tough
training doesn’t demean subordinates; in fact,
building their capabilities and showing faith in
their potential is the essence of respect. Effective
leaders take the time to learn what their subordinates want to accomplish. They advise their
people on how they can grow, personally and
professionally. Not all of your subordinates will
succeed equally, but they all deserve respect.

2-18. As America becomes more culturally
diverse, Army leaders must be aware that they
will deal with people from a wider range of ethnic, racial, and religious backgrounds. Effective
leaders are tolerant of beliefs different from
their own as long as those beliefs don’t conflict
with Army values, are not illegal, and are not
unethical. As an Army leader, you need to avoid
misunderstandings arising from cultural

2-21. Respect is also an essential component
for the development of disciplined, cohesive,
and effective warfighting teams. In the deadly
confusion of combat, soldiers often overcome
incredible odds to accomplish the mission and
protect the lives of their comrades. This spirit of
selfless service and duty is built on a soldier’s
personal trust and regard for fellow soldiers. A
leader’s willingness to tolerate discrimination

Army Leadership

2-5

What the Leader Must Be, Know, and Do

or harassment on any basis, or a failure to cultivate a climate of respect, eats away at this trust
and erodes unit cohesion. But respect goes beyond issues of discrimination and harassment;
it includes the broader issue of civility, the way
people treat each other and those they come in
contact with. It involves being sensitive to diversity and one’s own behaviors that others
may find insensitive, offensive, or abusive. Soldiers and DA civilians, like their leaders, treat
everyone with dignity and respect.
SELFLESS SERVICE
Put the welfare of the nation, the Army,
and subordinates before your own.
The nation today needs men who think in terms
of service to their country and not in terms of
their country’s debt to them.
General of the Army Omar N. Bradley
2-22. You have often heard the military
referred to as “the service.” As a member of the
Army, you serve the United States. Selfless
service means doing what’s right for the nation,
the Army, your organization, and your people—and putting these responsibilities above
your own interests. The needs of the Army and
the nation come first. This doesn’t mean that
you neglect your family or yourself; in fact, such
neglect weakens a leader and can cause the
Army more harm than good. Selfless service
doesn’t mean that you can’t have a strong ego,
high self-esteem, or even healthy ambition.
Rather, selfless service means that you don’t
make decisions or take actions that help your
image or your career but hurt others or sabotage the mission. The selfish superior claims

credit for work his subordinates do; the selfless
leader gives credit to those who earned it. The
Army can’t function except as a team, and for a
team to work, the individual has to give up selfinterest for the good of the whole.
2-23. Soldiers are not the only members of the
Army who display selfless service. DA civilians
display this value as well. Then Army Chief of
Staff, Gordon R. Sullivan assessed the DA civilian contribution to Operation Desert Storm
this way:
Not surprisingly, most of the civilians deployed
to Southwest Asia volunteered to serve there.
But the civilian presence in the Gulf region
meant more than moral support and filling in
for soldiers. Gulf War veterans say that many of
the combat soldiers could owe their lives to the
DA civilians who helped maintain equipment by
speeding up the process of getting parts and
other support from 60 logistics agencies
Army-wide.
2-24. As GEN Sullivan’s comment indicates,
selfless service is an essential component of
teamwork. Team members give of themselves
so that the team may succeed. In combat some
soldiers give themselves completely so that
their comrades can live and the mission can be
accomplished. But the need for selflessness
isn’t limited to combat situations. Requirements for individuals to place their own
needs below those of their organization can occur during peacetime as well. And the requirement for selflessness doesn’t decrease
with one’s rank; it increases. Consider this example of a soldier of long service and high rank
who demonstrated the value of selfless service.

GA Marshall Continues to Serve
GA George C. Marshall served as Army Chief of Staff from 1939 until 1945. He led the Army
through the buildup, deployment, and worldwide operations of World War II. Chapter 7 outlines some
of his contributions to the Allied victory. In November 1945 he retired to a well-deserved rest at his
home in Leesburg, Virginia. Just six days later President Harry S Truman called on him to serve as
Special Ambassador to China. From the White House President Truman telephoned GA Marshall at
his home: “General, I want you to go to China for me,” the president said. “Yes, Mr. President,” GA
Marshall replied. He then hung up the telephone, informed his wife of the president’s request and his
reply, and prepared to return to government service.

2-6

FM 22-100

Army Values

GA Marshall Continues to Serve (continued)
President Truman didn’t appoint GA Marshall a special ambassador to reward his faithful service;
he appointed GA Marshall because there was a tough job in China that needed to be done. The
Chinese communists under Mao Tse-tung were battling the Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek, who
had been America’s ally against the Japanese; GA Marshall’s job was to mediate peace between
them. In the end, he was unsuccessful in spite of a year of frustrating work; the scale of the problem
was more than any one person could handle. However, in January 1947 President Truman appointed
GA Marshall Secretary of State. The Cold War had begun and the president needed a leader
Americans trusted. GA Marshall’s reputation made him the one; his selflessness led him to continue
to serve.
2-25. When faced with a request to solve a difficult problem in an overseas theater after six
years of demanding work, GA Marshall didn’t
say, “I’ve been in uniform for over thirty years,
we just won a world war, and I think I’ve done
enough.” Instead, he responded to his commander in chief the only way a professional
could. He said yes, took care of his family, and
prepared to accomplish the mission. After a
year overseas, when faced with a similar question, he gave the same answer. GA Marshall always placed his country’s interests first and his
own second. Army leaders who follow his example do the same.
HONOR
Live up to all the Army values.
What is life without honor? Degradation is
worse than death.
Lieutenant General Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson

2-26. Honor provides the “moral compass” for
character and personal conduct in the Army.
Though many people struggle to define the
term, most recognize instinctively those with a
keen sense of right and wrong, those who live
such that their words and deeds are above reproach. The expression “honorable person,”
therefore, refers to both the character traits an
individual actually possesses and the fact that
the community recognizes and respects them.
2-27. Honor holds Army values together while
at the same time being a value itself. Together,
Army values describe the foundation essential
to develop leaders of character. Honor means
demonstrating an understanding of what’s
right and taking pride in the community’s

Army Leadership

acknowledgment of that reputation. Military
ceremonies recognizing individual and unit
achievement demonstrate and reinforce the importance the Army places on honor.
2-28. For you as an Army leader, demonstrating an understanding of what’s right and
taking pride in that reputation means this:
Live up to all the Army values. Implicitly,
that’s what you promised when you took your
oath of office or enlistment. You made this
promise publicly, and the standards—Army
values—are also public. To be an honorable person, you must be true to your oath and live
Army values in all you do. Living honorably
strengthens Army values, not only for yourself
but for others as well: all members of an organization contribute to the organization’s climate
(which you’ll read about in Chapter 3). By what
they do, people living out Army values contribute to a climate that encourages all members of
the Army to do the same.
2-29. How you conduct yourself and meet your
obligations defines who you are as a person;
how the Army meets the nation’s commitments
defines the Army as an institution. For you as
an Army leader, honor means putting Army
values above self-interest, above career and
comfort. For all soldiers, it means putting Army
values above self-preservation as well. This
honor is essential for creating a bond of trust
among members of the Army and between the
Army and the nation it serves. Army leaders
have the strength of will to live according to
Army values, even though the temptations to
do otherwise are strong, especially in the face of
personal danger. The military’s highest award
is the Medal of Honor. Its recipients didn’t do

2-7

What the Leader Must Be, Know, and Do

just what was required of them; they went beyond the expected, above and beyond the call of
duty. Some gave their own lives so that others

could live. It’s fitting that the word we use to
describe their achievements is “honor.”

MSG Gordon and SFC Shughart in Somalia
During a raid in Mogadishu in October 1993, MSG Gary Gordon and SFC Randall Shughart,
leader and member of a sniper team with Task Force Ranger in Somalia, were providing precision
and suppressive fires from helicopters above two helicopter crash sites. Learning that no ground
forces were available to rescue one of the downed aircrews and aware that a growing number of
enemy were closing in on the site, MSG Gordon and SFC Shughart volunteered to be inserted to
protect their critically wounded comrades. Their initial request was turned down because of the
danger of the situation. They asked a second time; permission was denied. Only after their third
request were they inserted.
MSG Gordon and SFC Shughart were inserted one hundred meters south of the downed
chopper. Armed only with their personal weapons, the two NCOs fought their way to the downed fliers
through intense small arms fire, a maze of shanties and shacks, and the enemy converging on the
site. After MSG Gordon and SFC Shughart pulled the wounded from the wreckage, they established a
perimeter, put themselves in the most dangerous position, and fought off a series of attacks. The two
NCOs continued to protect their comrades until they had depleted their ammunition and were
themselves fatally wounded. Their actions saved the life of an Army pilot.
2-30. No one will ever know what was running
through the minds of MSG Gordon and SFC
Shughart as they left the comparative safety of
their helicopter to go to the aid of the downed
aircrew. The two NCOs knew there was no
ground rescue force available, and they
certainly knew there was no going back to their
helicopter. They may have suspected that
things would turn out as they did; nonetheless,
they did what they believed to be the right
thing. They acted based on Army values, which
they had clearly made their own: loyalty to their
fellow soldiers; the duty to stand by them, regardless of the circumstances; the personal
courage to act, even in the face of great danger;
selfless service, the willingness to give their all.
MSG Gary I. Gordon and SFC Randall D.
Shughart lived Army values to the end; they
were posthumously awarded Medals of Honor.
INTEGRITY
Do what’s right—legally and morally.
The American people rightly look to their
military leaders not only to be skilled in the

2-8

technical aspects of the profession of arms, but
also to be men of integrity.
General J. Lawton Collins
Former Army Chief of Staff

2-31. People of integrity consistently act
according to principles—not just what might
work at the moment. Leaders of integrity make
their principles known and consistently act in
accordance with them. The Army requires leaders of integrity who possess high moral standards and are honest in word and deed. Being
honest means being truthful and upright all the
time, despite pressures to do otherwise. Having
integrity means being both morally complete
and true to yourself. As an Army leader, you’re
honest to yourself by committing to and consistently living Army values; you’re honest to others by not presenting yourself or your actions as
anything other than what they are. Army leaders say what they mean and do what they say. If
you can’t accomplish a mission, inform your
chain of command. If you inadvertently pass on
bad information, correct it as soon as you find
out it’s wrong. People of integrity do the right
thing not because it’s convenient or because

Army Values

they have no choice. They choose the right
thing because their character permits no less.
Conducting yourself with integrity has three
parts:

far they can go. It also means being willing to
tell the boss when he’s wrong.

· Separating what’s right from what’s wrong.
· Always acting according to what you know

2-34. Personal courage isn’t the absence of
fear; rather, it’s the ability to put fear aside and
do what’s necessary. It takes two forms, physical and moral. Good leaders demonstrate both.

to be right, even at personal cost.

· Saying openly that you’re acting on your
understanding of right versus wrong.

2-32. Leaders can’t hide what they do: that’s
why you must carefully decide how you act. As
an Army leader, you’re always on display. If you
want to instill Army values in others, you must
internalize and demonstrate them yourself.
Your personal values may and probably do extend beyond the Army values, to include such
things as political, cultural, or religious beliefs.
However, if you’re to be an Army leader and a
person of integrity, these values must reinforce,
not contradict, Army values.
2-33. Any conflict between your personal
values and Army values must be resolved before
you can become a morally complete Army
leader. You may need to consult with someone
whose values and judgment you respect. You
would not be the first person to face this issue,
and as a leader, you can expect others to come
to you, too. Chapter 5 contains the story of how
SGT Alvin York and his leaders confronted and
resolved a conflict between SGT York’s personal values and Army values. Read it and reflect on it. If one of your subordinates asks you
to help resolve a similar conflict, you must be
prepared by being sure your own values align
with Army values. Resolving such conflicts is
necessary to become a leader of integrity.
PERSONAL COURAGE
Face fear, danger, or adversity
(physical or moral).
The concept of professional courage does not
always mean being as tough as nails either. It
also suggests a willingness to listen to the
soldiers’ problems, to go to bat for them in a
tough situation, and it means knowing just how

Army Leadership

Former Sergeant Major of the Army William Connelly

2-35. Physical courage means overcoming fears
of bodily harm and doing your duty. It’s the
bravery that allows a soldier to take risks in
combat in spite of the fear of wounds or death.
Physical courage is what gets the soldier at Airborne School out the aircraft door. It’s what allows an infantryman to assault a bunker to save
his buddies.
2-36. In contrast, moral courage is the willingness to stand firm on your values, principles, and
convictions—even when threatened. It enables
leaders to stand up for what they believe is right,
regardless of the consequences. Leaders who
take responsibility for their decisions and actions, even when things go wrong, display moral
courage. Courageous leaders are willing to look
critically inside themselves, consider new ideas,
and change what needs changing.
2-37. Moral courage is sometimes overlooked,
both in discussions of personal courage and in
the everyday rush of business. A DA civilian at a
meeting heard courage mentioned several times
in the context of combat. The DA civilian pointed
out that consistent moral courage is every bit as
important as momentary physical courage.
Situations requiring physical courage are rare;
situations requiring moral courage can occur frequently. Moral courage is essential to living the
Army values of integrity and honor every day.
2-38. Moral courage often expresses itself as
candor. Candor means being frank, honest, and
sincere with others while keeping your words
free from bias, prejudice, or malice. Candor
means calling things as you see them, even
when it’s uncomfortable or you think it might
be better for you to just keep quiet. It means
not allowing your feelings to affect what you
say about a person or situation. A candid company commander calmly points out the first
sergeant’s mistake. Likewise, the candid first

2-9

What the Leader Must Be, Know, and Do

sergeant respectfully points out when the company commander’s pet project isn’t working
and they need to do something different. For
trust to exist between leaders and subordinates, candor is essential. Without it, subordinates won’t know if they’ve met the standard
and leaders won’t know what’s going on.

2-39. In combat physical and moral courage
may blend together. The right thing to do may
not only be unpopular, but dangerous as well.
Situations of that sort reveal who’s a leader of
character and who’s not. Consider this
example.

WO1 Thompson at My Lai
Personal courage—whether physical, moral, or a combination of the two—may be manifested in
a variety of ways, both on and off the battlefield. On March 16, 1968 Warrant Officer (WO1) Hugh C.
Thompson Jr. and his two-man crew were on a reconnaissance mission over the village of My Lai,
Republic of Vietnam. WO1 Thompson watched in horror as he saw an American soldier shoot an
injured Vietnamese child. Minutes later, when he observed American soldiers advancing on a number
of civilians in a ditch, WO1 Thompson landed his helicopter and questioned a young officer about
what was happening on the ground. Told that the ground action was none of his business, WO1
Thompson took off and continued to circle the area.
When it became apparent that the American soldiers were now firing on civilians, WO1
Thompson landed his helicopter between the soldiers and a group of 10 villagers who were headed
for a homemade bomb shelter. He ordered his gunner to train his weapon on the approaching
American soldiers and to fire if necessary. Then he personally coaxed the civilians out of the shelter
and airlifted them to safety. WO1 Thompson’s radio reports of what was happening were instrumental
in bringing about the cease-fire order that saved the lives of more civilians. His willingness to place
himself in physical danger in order to do the morally right thing is a sterling example of personal
courage.

must BE; the other side of what a leader must
BE are the attributes listed in Figure 2-2.
Leader attributes influence leader actions;
leader actions, in turn, always influence the
unit or organization. As an example, if you’re

subordinates to be physically fit.
2-41. Attributes are a person’s fundamental
qualities and characteristics. People are born
with some attributes; for instance, a person’s
genetic code determines eye, hair, and skin
color. However, other attributes—including
leader attributes—are learned and can be
changed. Leader attributes can be characterized
as mental, physical, and emotional. Successful
leaders work to improve those attributes.

FM 22-100

Leader Attributes

Colonel Dandridge M. Mike Malone

2-44. Will is an attribute essential to all members of the Army. Work conditions vary among
branches and components, between those deployed and those closer to home. In the Army,
personal attitude must prevail over any adverse
external conditions. All members of the
Army—active, reserve, and DA civilian—will
experience situations when it would be easier to
quit rather than finish the task at hand. At
those times, everyone needs that inner drive to
press on to mission completion.

2-43. Will is the inner drive that compels soldiers and leaders to keep going when they are
exhausted, hungry, afraid, cold, and
wet—when it would be easier to quit. Will enables soldiers to press the fight to its conclusion. Yet will without competence is useless.
It’s not enough that soldiers are willing, or
even eager, to fight; they must know how to
fight. Likewise, soldiers who have competence but no will don’t fight. The leader’s
task is to develop a winning spirit by building
their subordinates’ will as well as their skill.
That begins with hard, realistic training.

2-45. It’s easy to talk about will when things go
well. But the test of your will comes when
things go badly— when events seem to be out of
control, when you think your bosses have
forgotten you, when the plan doesn’t seem to
work and it looks like you’re going to lose. It’s
then that you must draw on your inner reserves
to persevere—to do your job until there’s
nothing left to do it with and then to remain
faithful to your people, your organization, and
your country. The story of the American and
Filipino stand on the Bataan Peninsula and
their subsequent captivity is one of individuals,
leaders, and units deciding to remain true to
the end—and living and dying by that decision.

MENTAL ATTRIBUTES
2-42. The mental attributes of an Army leader
include will, self-discipline, initiative, judgment, self-confidence, intelligence, and cultural
awareness.
Will
The will of soldiers is three times more
important than their weapons.
Small Unit Leadership: A Commonsense Approach

The Will to Persevere
On 8 December 1941, hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese forces attacked the
American and Filipino forces defending the Philippines. With insufficient combat power to launch a
counterattack, GEN Douglas MacArthur, the American commander, ordered his force to consolidate
on the Bataan Peninsula and hold as long as possible. Among his units was the 12th Quartermaster
(QM) Regiment, which had the mission of supporting the force.
Completely cut off from outside support, the Allies held against an overwhelming Japanese army
for the next three and a half months. Soldiers of the 12th QM Regiment worked in the debris of
warehouses and repair shops under merciless shelling and bombing, fighting to make the meager
supplies last. They slaughtered water buffaloes for meat, caught fish with traps they built themselves,
and distilled salt from sea water. In coffeepots made from oil drums they boiled and reboiled the tiny
coffee supply until the grounds were white. As long as an ounce of food existed, it was used. In the
last desperate days, they resorted to killing horses and pack mules. More important, these supporters
delivered rations to the foxholes on the front lines—fighting their way in when necessary. After Bataan
and Corregidor fell, members of the 12th QM Regiment were prominent among the 7,000 Americans
and Filipinos who died on the infamous Bataan Death March.
Though captured, the soldiers of the 12th QM Regiment maintained their will to resist. 1LT
Beulah Greenwalt, a nurse assigned to the 12th QM Regiment, personified this will. Realizing the
regimental colors represent the soul of a regiment and that they could serve as a symbol for
resistance, 1LT Greenwalt assumed the mission of protecting the colors from the Japanese. She
carried the colors to the prisoner of war (PW) camp in Manila by wrapping them around her

shoulders and convincing her Japanese captors that they were “only a shawl.” For the next 33 months
1LT Greenwalt and the remains of the regiment remained PWs, living on starvation diets and denied
all comforts. But through it all, 1LT Greenwalt held onto the flag. The regimental colors were
safeguarded: the soul of the regiment remained with the regiment, and its soldiers continued to resist.
When the war ended in 1945 and the surviving PWs were released, 1LT Greenwalt presented the
colors to the regimental commander. She and her fellow PWs had persevered. They had resisted on
Bataan until they had no more means to resist. They continued to resist through three long years of
captivity. They decided on Bataan to carry on, and they renewed that decision daily until they were
liberated. The 12th QM Regiment—and the other units that had fought and resisted with
them—remained true to themselves, the Army, and their country. Their will allowed them to see
events through to the end.

Self-Discipline
The core of a soldier is moral discipline. It is
intertwined with the discipline of physical and
mental achievement. Total discipline overcomes
adversity, and physical stamina draws on an
inner strength that says “drive on.”

Former Sergeant Major of the Army
William G. Bainbridge
2-46. Self-disciplined people are masters of
their impulses. This mastery comes from the
habit of doing the right thing. Self-discipline allows Army leaders to do the right thing regardless of the consequences for them or their
subordinates. Under the extreme stress of combat, you and your team might be cut off and
alone, fearing for your lives, and having to act
without guidance or knowledge of what’s going
on around you. Still, you—the leader—must
think clearly and act reasonably. Self-discipline
is the key to this kind of behavior.
2-47. In peacetime, self-discipline gets the unit
out for the hard training. Self-discipline makes
the tank commander demand another runthrough of a battle drill if the performance
doesn’t meet the standard—even though everyone is long past ready to quit. Self-discipline
doesn’t mean that you never get tired or discouraged—after all, you’re only human. It does
mean that you do what needs to be done regardless of your feelings.
Initiative
The leader must be an aggressive
thinker—always anticipating and analyzing.

2-12

He must be able to make good assessments and
solid tactical judgments.

Brigadier General John. T. Nelson II

2-48. Initiative is the ability to be a selfstarter—to act when there are no clear instructions, to act when the situation changes or
when the plan falls apart. In the operational
context, it means setting and dictating the
terms of action throughout the battle or operation. An individual leader with initiative is willing to decide and initiate independent actions
when the concept of operations no longer applies or when an unanticipated opportunity
leading to accomplishment of the commander’s
intent presents itself. Initiative drives the
Army leader to seek a better method, anticipate
what must be done, and perform without waiting for instructions. Balanced with good judgment, it becomes disciplined initiative, an
essential leader attribute. (FM 100-5 discusses
initiative as it relates to military actions at the
operational level. FM 100-34 discusses the relationship of initiative to command and control.
FM 100-40 discusses the place of initiative in
the art of tactics.)
2-49. As an Army leader, you can’t just give orders: you must make clear the intent of those
orders, the final goal of the mission. In combat,
it’s critically important for subordinates to understand their commander’s intent. When they
are cut off or enemy actions derail the original
plan, well-trained soldiers who understand the
commander’s intent will apply disciplined initiative to accomplish the mission.

FM 22-100

Leader Attributes

2-50. Disciplined initiative doesn’t just appear;
you must develop it within your subordinates.
Your leadership style and the organizational
climate you establish can either encourage or
discourage initiative: you can instill initiative
in your subordinates or you can drive it out. If

you underwrite honest mistakes, your subordinates will be more likely to develop initiative. If
you set a “zero defects” standard, you risk
strangling initiative in its cradle, the hearts of
your subordinates. (Chapter 5 discusses “zero
defects” and learning.)

The Quick Reaction Platoon
On 26 December 1994 a group of armed and disgruntled members of the Haitian Army entered the
Haitian Army Headquarters in Port-au-Prince demanding back pay. A gunfight ensued less than 150
meters from the grounds of the Haitian Palace, seat of the new government. American soldiers from C
Company, 1-22 Infantry, who had deployed to Haiti as part of Operation Uphold Democracy, were
guarding the palace grounds. The quick reaction platoon leader deployed and immediately
maneuvered his platoon towards the gunfire. The platoon attacked, inflicting at least four casualties
and causing the rest of the hostile soldiers to flee. The platoon quelled a potentially explosive situation
by responding correctly and aggressively to the orders of their leader, who knew his mission and the
commander’s intent.

Judgment
I learned that good judgment comes from
experience and that experience grows out of
mistakes.

General of the Army Omar N. Bradley

2-51. Leaders must often juggle hard facts,
questionable data, and gut-level intuition to arrive at a decision. Good judgment means making the best decision for the situation. It’s a key
attribute of the art of command and the transformation of knowledge into understanding.
(FM 100-34 discusses how leaders convert data
and information into knowledge and understanding.)
2-52. Good judgment is the ability to size up a
situation quickly, determine what’s important,
and decide what needs to be done. Given a problem, you should consider a range of alternatives
before you act. You need to think through the
consequences of what you’re about to do before
you do it. In addition to considering the consequences, you should also think methodically.
Some sources that aid judgment are the boss’s
intent, the desired goal, rules, laws, regulations,
experience, and values. Good judgment also includes the ability to size up subordinates, peers,
and the enemy for strengths, weaknesses, and
potential actions. It’s a critical part of problem

Army Leadership

solving and decision making. (Chapter 5 discusses problem solving and decision making).
2-53. Judgment and initiative go hand in hand.
As an Army leader, you must weigh what you
know and make decisions in situations where
others do nothing. There will be times when
you’ll have to make decisions under severe time
constraints. In all cases, however, you must take
responsibility for your actions. In addition, you
must encourage disciplined initiative in, and
teach good judgment to, your subordinates. Help
your subordinates learn from mistakes by coaching and mentoring them along the way. (Chapter
5 discusses mentoring.)
Self-Confidence
2-54. Self-confidence is the faith that you’ll act
correctly and properly in any situation, even
one in which you’re under stress and don’t have
all the information you want. Self-confidence
comes from competence: it’s based on mastering
skills, which takes hard work and dedication.
Leaders who know their own capabilities and
believe in themselves are self-confident. Don’t
mistake bluster—loudmouthed bragging or
self-promotion—for self-confidence. Truly selfconfident leaders don’t need to advertise; their
actions say it all.

2-13

What the Leader Must Be, Know, and Do

2-55. Self-confidence is important for leaders
and teams. People want self-confident leaders,
leaders who understand the situation, know
what needs to be done, and demonstrate that
understanding and knowledge. Self-confident
leaders instill self-confidence in their people. In
combat, self-confidence helps soldiers control
doubt and reduce anxiety. Together with will
and self-discipline, self-confidence helps leaders
act—do what must be done in circumstances
where it would be easier to do nothing—and to
convince their people to act as well.

factors without apparent rational thought or inference). Remember COL Chamberlain at Little
Round Top. To his soldiers, it sometimes appeared that he could “see through forests and
hillsandknowwhatwascoming.”Butthiswasno
magical ability. Through study and reflection,
the colonel had learned how to analyze terrain
and imagine how the enemy might attempt to use
it to his advantage. He had applied his intelligence and developed his intellectual capabilities.
Good leaders follow COL Chamberlain’s
example.

Intelligence

Cultural Awareness

2-56. Intelligent leaders think, learn, and reflect; then they apply what they learn. Intelligence is more than knowledge, and the ability to
think isn’t the same as book learning. All people
have some intellectual ability that, when developed, allows them to analyze and understand a
situation. And although some people are
smarter than others, all people can develop the
capabilities they have. Napoleon himself observed how a leader’s intellectual development
applies directly to battlefield success:

2-59. Culture is a group’s shared set of beliefs,
values, and assumptions about what’s important. As an Army leader, you must be aware of
cultural factors in three contexts:

It is not genius which reveals to me suddenly
and secretly what I should do in circumstances
unexpected by others; it is thought and
meditation.
2-57. Knowledge is only part of the equation.
Smart decisions result when you combine professional skills (which you learn through study)
with experience (which you gain on the job) and
your ability to reason through a problem based
on the information available. Reflection is also
important. From time to time, you find yourself
carefully and thoughtfully considering how
leadership, values, and other military principles apply to you and your job. When things
don’t go quite the way they intended, intelligent leaders are confident enough to step back
and ask, “Why did things turn out that way?”
Then they are smart enough to build on their
strengths and avoid making the same mistake
again.
2-58. Reflection also contributes to your originality (the ability to innovate, rather than only
adopt others’ methods) and intuition (direct, immediate insight or understanding of important

grounds of your people.
You must be aware of the culture of the
country in which your organization is operating.
You must take into account your partners’
customs and traditions when you’re working with forces of another nation.

2-60. Within the Army, people come from
widely different backgrounds: they are shaped
by their schooling, race, gender, and religion as
well as a host of other influences. Although they
share Army values, an African-American man
from rural Texas may look at many things differently from, say, a third-generation IrishAmerican man who grew up in Philadelphia or
a Native American woman from the Pacific
Northwest. But be aware that perspectives vary
within groups as well. That’s why you should
try to understand individuals based on their
own ideas, qualifications, and contributions
and not jump to conclusions based on
stereotypes.
2-61. Army values are part of the Army’s institutional culture, a starting point for how you as
a member of the Army should think and act. Beyond that, Army leaders not only recognize that
people are different; they value them because of
their differences, because they are people. Your
job as a leader isn’t to make everyone the same.

FM 22-100

Leader Attributes

Instead, your job is to take advantage of the fact
that everyone is different and build a cohesive
team. (Chapter 7 discusses the role strategic
leaders play in establishing and maintaining
the Army’s institutional culture.)
2-62. There’s great diversity in the Army—religious, ethnic, and social—and people of different backgrounds bring different talents to the
table. By joining the Army, these people have
agreed to adopt the Army culture. Army leaders
make this easier by embracing and making use
of everyone’s talents. What’s more, they create
a team where subordinates know they are valuable and their talents are important.
2-63. You never know how the talents of an individual or group will contribute to mission accomplishment. For example, during World War
II US Marines from the Navajo nation formed a
group of radio communications specialists
dubbed the Navajo Code Talkers. The code talkers used their native language—a unique talent—to handle command radio traffic. Not even
the best Japanese code breakers could decipher
what was being said.
2-64. Understanding the culture of your adversaries and of the country in which your organization is operating is just as important as
understanding the culture of your own country
and organization. This aspect of cultural awareness has always been important, but today’s operational environment of frequent

deployments—often conducted by small units
under constant media coverage—makes it even
more so. As an Army leader, you need to remain
aware of current events—particularly those in
areas where America has national interests.
You may have to deal with people who live in
those areas, either as partners, neutrals, or adversaries. The more you know about them, the
better prepared you’ll be.
2-65. You may think that understanding other
cultures applies mostly to stability operations
and support operations. However, it’s critical to
planning offensive and defensive operations as
well. For example, you may employ different
tactics against an adversary who considers surrender a dishonor worse than death than against
those for whom surrender is an honorable option.
Likewise, if your organization is operating as part
of a multinational team, how well you understand your partners will affect how well the
team accomplishes its mission.
2-66. Cultural awareness is crucial to the success of multinational operations. In such situations Army leaders take the time to learn the
customs and traditions of the partners’ cultures.
They learn how and why others think and act as
they do. In multinational forces, effective leaders
createa“thirdculture,”whichisthebridgeorthe
compromise among partners. This is what GA
Eisenhower did in the following example.

GA Eisenhower Forms SHAEF
During World War II, one of GA Eisenhower’s duties as Supreme Allied Commander in the
European Theater of Operations (ETO) was to form his theater headquarters, the Supreme
Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). GA Eisenhower had to create an environment in
this multinational headquarters in which staff members from the different Allied armies could work
together harmoniously. It was one of GA Eisenhower’s toughest jobs.
The forces under his command—American, British, French, Canadian, and Polish—brought not
only different languages, but different ways of thinking, different ideas about what was important, and
different strategies. GA Eisenhower could have tried to bend everyone to his will and his way of
thinking; he was the boss, after all. But it’s doubtful the Allies would have fought as well for a bullying
commander or that a bullying commander would have survived politically. Instead, he created a
positive organizational climate that made best use of the various capabilities of his subordinates. This
kind of work takes tact, patience, and trust. It doesn’t destroy existing cultures but creates a new one.
(Chapter 7 discusses how building this coalition contributed to the Allied victory in the ETO.)

Army Leadership

2-15

What the Leader Must Be, Know, and Do

PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES
2-67. Physical
attributes—health
fitness,
physical fitness, and military and professional
bearing—can be developed. Army leaders maintain the appropriate level of physical fitness
and military bearing.
Health Fitness
Disease was the chief killer in the [American
Civil] war. Two soldiers died of it for every one
killed in battle…In one year, 995 of every
thousand men in the Union army contracted
diarrhea and dysentery.
Geoffrey C. Ward
The Civil War

2-68. Health fitness is everything you do to
maintain good health, things such as undergoing routine physical exams, practicing good
dental hygiene, maintaining deployability standards, and even personal grooming and cleanliness. A soldier unable to fight because of
dysentery is as much a loss as one who’s
wounded. Healthy soldiers can perform under
extremes in temperature, humidity, and other
conditions better than unhealthy ones. Health
fitness also includes avoiding things that
degrade your health, such as substance abuse,
obesity, and smoking.
Physical Fitness
Fatigue makes cowards of us all.
General George S. Patton Jr.
Commanding General, Third Army, World War II

2-69. Unit readiness begins with physically fit
soldiers and leaders. Combat drains soldiers
physically, mentally, and emotionally. To minimize those effects, Army leaders are physically
fit, and they make sure their subordinates are
fit as well. Physically fit soldiers perform better
in all areas, and physically fit leaders are better
able to think, decide, and act appropriately under pressure. Physical readiness provides a
foundation for combat readiness, and it’s up to
you, the leader, to get your soldiers ready.
2-70. Although physical fitness is a crucial element of success in battle, it’s not just for frontline soldiers. Wherever they are, people who are

2-16

physically fit feel more competent and confident. That attitude reassures and inspires
those around them. Physically fit soldiers and
DA civilians can handle stress better, work
longer and harder, and recover faster than ones
who are not fit. These payoffs are valuable in
both peace and war.
2-71. The physical demands of leadership positions, prolonged deployments, and continuous
operations can erode more than just physical attributes. Soldiers must show up ready for deprivations because it’s difficult to maintain high
levels of fitness during deployments and demanding operations. Trying to get fit under
those conditions is even harder. If a person isn’t
physically fit, the effects of additional stress
snowball until their mental and emotional fitness are compromised as well. Army leaders’
physical fitness has significance beyond their
personal performance and well-being. Since
leaders’ decisions affect their organizations’
combat effectiveness, health, and safety and
not just their own, maintaining physical fitness
is an ethical as well as a practical imperative.
2-72. The Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT)
measures a baseline level of physical fitness. As
an Army leader, you’re required to develop a
physical fitness program that enhances your
soldiers’ ability to complete soldier and leader
tasks that support the unit’s mission essential
task list (METL). (FM 25-101 discusses
METL-based integration of soldier, leader, and
collective training.) Fitness programs that emphasize training specifically for the APFT are
boring and don’t prepare soldiers for the varied
stresses of combat. Make every effort to design
a physical fitness program that prepares your
people for what you expect them to do in combat. Readiness should be your program’s primary focus; preparation for the APFT itself is
secondary. (FM 21-20 is your primary physical
fitness resource.)

Professionals are competent as well; the Army

General of the Army George C. Marshall
Army Chief of Staff, World War II

Anyone can become angry—that is easy. But to
be angry with the right person, to the right
degree, at the right time, for the right purpose,
and in the right way—that is not easy.

Military and Professional Bearing
Our…soldiers should look as good as they are.
Sergeant Major of the Army Julius W. Gates

2-73. As an Army leader, you’re expected to
look like a soldier. Know how to wear the uniform and wear it with pride at all times. Meet
height and weight standards. By the way you
carry yourself and through your military courtesy and appearance, you send a signal: I am
proud of my uniform, my unit, and myself.
Skillful use of your professional bearing—fitness, courtesy, and military appearance—can
often help you manage difficult situations. A
professional—DA civilian or soldier—presents

EMOTIONAL ATTRIBUTES

Aristotle
Greek philosopher and tutor to Alexander the Great

2-74. As an Army leader, your emotional attributes—self-control, balance, and stability—contribute to how you feel and therefore to how you
interact with others. Your people are human
beings with hopes, fears, concerns, and dreams.
When you understand that will and endurance
come from emotional energy, you possess a
powerful leadership tool. The feedback you give
can help your subordinates use their emotional
energy to accomplish amazing feats in tough
times.

Self-Control in Combat
An American infantry company in Vietnam had been taking a lot of casualties from booby traps.
The soldiers were frustrated because they could not fight back. One night, snipers ambushed the
company near a village, killing two soldiers. The rest of the company—scared, anguished, and
frustrated—wanted to enter the village, but the commander—who was just as angry—knew that the
snipers were long gone. Further, he knew that there was a danger his soldiers would let their emotions
get the upper hand, that they might injure or kill some villagers out of a desire to strike back at
something. Besides being criminal, such killings would drive more villagers to the Viet Cong. The
commander maintained control of his emotions, and the company avoided the village.

2-75. Self-control, balance, and stability also
help you make the right ethical choices.
Chapter 4 discusses the steps of ethical reasoning. However, in order to follow those steps, you
must remain in control of yourself; you can’t be
at the mercy of your impulses. You must remain
calm under pressure, “watch your lane,” and
expend energy on things you can fix. Inform
your boss of things you can’t fix and don’t
worry about things you can’t affect.

Army Leadership

2-76. Leaders who are emotionally mature also
have a better awareness of their own strengths
and weaknesses. Mature leaders spend their energy on self-improvement; immature leaders
spend their energy denying there’s anything
wrong. Mature, less defensive leaders benefit
from constructive criticism in ways that immature people cannot.

2-17

What the Leader Must Be, Know, and Do

Self-Control
Sure I was scared, but under the circumstances,
I’d have been crazy not to be scared.…There’s
nothing wrong with fear. Without fear, you can’t
have acts of courage.
Sergeant Theresa Kristek
Operation Just Cause, Panama

2-77. Leaders control their emotions. No one
wants to work for a hysterical leader who might
lose control in a tough situation. This doesn’t
mean you never show emotion. Instead, you
must display the proper amount of emotion and
passion—somewhere between too much and
too little—required to tap into your subordinates’ emotions. Maintaining self-control inspires calm confidence in subordinates, the
coolness under fire so essential to a successful
unit. It also encourages feedback from your
subordinates that can expand your sense of
what’s really going on.
Balance
An officer or noncommissioned officer who loses
his temper and flies into a tantrum has failed to
obtain his first triumph in discipline.
Noncommissioned Officer’s Manual, 1917

2-78. Emotionally balanced leaders display the
right emotion for the situation and can also
read others’ emotional state. They draw on

their experience and provide their subordinates
the proper perspective on events. They have a
range of attitudes—from relaxed to intense—with which to approach situations and
can choose the one appropriate to the circumstances. Such leaders know when it’s time to
send a message that things are urgent and how
to do that without throwing the organization
into chaos. They also know how to encourage
people at the toughest moments and keep them
driving on.
Stability
Never let yourself be driven by impatience or
anger. One always regrets having followed the
first dictates of his emotions.
Marshal de Belle-Isle
French Minister of War, 1757-1760

2-79. Effective leaders are steady, levelheaded
under pressure and fatigue, and calm in the
face of danger. These characteristics calm their
subordinates, who are always looking to their
leader’s example. Display the emotions you
want your people to display; don’t give in to the
temptation to do what feels good for you. If
you’re under great stress, it might feel better to
vent—scream, throw things, kick furniture—but that will not help the organization. If
you want your subordinates to be calm and rational under pressure, you must be also.

BG Jackson at First Bull Run
At a crucial juncture in the First Battle of Bull Run, the Confederate line was being beaten back from
Matthews Hill by Union forces. Confederate BG Thomas J. Jackson and his 2,000-man brigade of
Virginians, hearing the sounds of battle to the left of their position, pressed on to the action. Despite a
painful shrapnel wound, BG Jackson calmly placed his men in a defensive position on Henry Hill and
assured them that all was well.
As men of the broken regiments flowed past, one of their officers, BG Barnard E. Bee, exclaimed
to BG Jackson, “General, they are driving us!” Looking toward the direction of the enemy, BG Jackson
replied, “Sir, we will give them the bayonet.” Impressed by BG Jackson’s confidence and self-control,
BG Bee rode off towards what was left of the officers and men of his brigade. As he rode into the
throng he gestured with his sword toward Henry Hill and shouted, “Look, men! There is Jackson
standing like a stone wall! Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer! Follow me!”
BG Bee would later be mortally wounded, but the Confederate line stiffened and the nickname he
gave to BG Jackson would live on in American military history. This example shows how one leader’s
self-control under fire can turn the tide of battle by influencing not only the leader’s own soldiers, but
the leaders and soldiers of other units as well.

Focus on Character

FOCUS ON CHARACTER
Just as fire tempers iron into fine steel, so does adversity temper one’s character into firmness,
tolerance, and determination.
Margaret Chase Smith
Lieutenant Colonel, US Air Force Reserve
and United States Senator

2-80. Earlier in this chapter, you read how
character is made up of two interacting sets of
characteristics: values and attributes. People
enter the Army with values and attributes
they’ve developed over the course of a lifetime,
but those are just the starting points for further
character development. Army leaders continuously develop in themselves and their subordinates the Army values and leader attributes
that this chapter discusses and Figure 1-1
shows. This isn’t just an academic exercise, another mandatory training topic to address once
a year. Your character shows through in your
actions—on and off duty.

2-81. Character helps you determine what’s
right and motivates you to do it, regardless of
the circumstances or the consequences. What’s
more, an informed ethical conscience consistent with Army values steels you for making the
right choices when faced with tough questions.
Since Army leaders seek to do what’s right and
inspire others to do the same, you must be concerned with character development. Examine
the actions in this example, taken from the
report of a platoon sergeant during Operation
Desert Storm. Consider the aspects of character
that contributed to them.

Character and Prisoners
The morning of [28 February 1991], about a half-hour prior to the cease-fire, we had a T-55 tank
in front of us and we were getting ready [to engage it with a TOW]. We had the TOW up and we
were tracking him and my wingman saw him just stop and a head pop up out of it. And Neil started
calling me saying, “Don’t shoot, don’t shoot, I think they’re getting off the tank.” And they did. Three
of them jumped off the tank and ran around a sand dune. I told my wingman, “I’ll cover the tank,
you go on down and check around the back side and see what’s down there.” He went down there
and found about 150 PWs….
[T]he only way we could handle that many was just to line them up and run them through…a little
gauntlet…[W]e had to check them for weapons and stuff and we lined them up and called for the PW
handlers to pick them up. It was just amazing.
We had to blow the tank up. My instructions were to destroy the tank, so I told them to go ahead
and move it around the back side of the berm a little bit to safeguard us, so we wouldn’t catch any
shrapnel or ammunition coming off. When the tank blew up, these guys started yelling and screaming
at my soldiers, “Don’t shoot us, don’t shoot us,” and one of my soldiers said, “Hey, we’re from America; we don’t shoot our prisoners.” That sort of stuck with me.
2-82. The soldier’s comment at the end of this
story captures the essence of character. He said,
“We’re from America…” He defined, in a very
simple way, the connection between who you
are—your character—and what you do. This
example illustrates character—shared values
and attributes—telling soldiers what to do and
what not to do. However, it’s interesting for
other reasons. Read it again: You can almost

feel the soldiers’ surprise when they realized
what the Iraqi PWs were afraid of. You can picture the young soldier, nervous, hands on his
weapon, but still managing to be a bit amused.
The right thing, the ethical choice, was so
deeply ingrained in those soldiers that it never
occurred to them to do anything other than
safeguard the PWs.

What the Leader Must Be, Know, and Do

The Battle of the Bulge
In December 1944 the German Army launched its last major offensive on the Western Front of the
ETO, sending massive infantry and armor formations into a lightly-held sector of the Allied line in Belgium.
American units were overrun. Thousands of green troops, sent to that sector because it was quiet, were
captured. For two desperate weeks the Allies fought to check the enemy advance. The 101st Airborne
Division was sent to the town of Bastogne. The Germans needed to control the crossroads there to move
equipment to the front; the 101st was there to stop them.
Outnumbered, surrounded, low on ammunition, out of medical supplies, and with wounded piling up,
the 101st, elements of the 9th and 10th Armored Divisions, and a tank destroyer battalion fought off
repeated attacks through some of the coldest weather Europe had seen in 50 years. Wounded men froze to
death in their foxholes. Paratroopers fought tanks. Nonetheless, when the German commander demanded
American surrender, BG Anthony C. McAuliffe, acting division commander, sent a one-word reply: “Nuts.”
The Americans held. By the time the Allies regained control of the area and pushed the Germans
back, Hitler’s “Thousand Year Reich” had fewer than four months remaining.

2-83. BG McAuliffe spoke based on what he
knew his soldiers were capable of, even in the
most extreme circumstances. This kind of courage and toughness didn’t develop overnight.

Every Allied soldier brought a lifetime’s worth
of character to that battle; that character was
the foundation for everything else that made
them successful.

GA Eisenhower’s Message
On 5 June 1944, the day before the D-Day invasion, with his hundreds of thousands of soldiers,
sailors and airmen poised to invade France, GA Dwight D. Eisenhower took a few minutes to draft
a message he hoped he would never deliver. It was a “statement he wrote out to have ready when
the invasion was repulsed, his troops torn apart for nothing, his planes ripped and smashed to no
end, his warships sunk, his reputation blasted.”
In his handwritten statement, GA Eisenhower began, “Our landings in the Cherbourg-Havre area
have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops.” Originally he had written,
the “troops have been withdrawn,” a use of the passive voice that conceals the actor. But he changed
the wording to reflect his acceptance of full personal accountability.
GA Eisenhower went on, “My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best
information available.” And after recognizing the courage and sacrifice of the troops he concluded, “If
any blame or fault attaches to this attempt, it is mine alone.”

2-84. GA Eisenhower, in command of the
largest invasion force ever assembled and
poised on the eve of a battle that would decide
the fate of millions of people, was guided by
the same values and attributes that shaped
the actions of the soldiers in the Desert Storm
example. His character allowed for nothing

2-20

less than acceptance of total personal responsibility. If things went badly, he was ready to
take the blame. When things went well, he
gave credit to his subordinates. The Army
values GA Eisenhower personified provide a
powerful example for all members of the
Army.

Focus on Character

CHARACTER AND THE WARRIOR
ETHOS
2-85. The warrior ethos refers to the professional attitudes and beliefs that characterize
the American soldier. At its core, the warrior
ethos grounds itself on the refusal to accept failure. The Army has forged the warrior ethos on
training grounds from Valley Forge to the
CTCs and honed it in battle from Bunker Hill to
San Juan Hill, from the Meuse-Argonne to
Omaha Beach, from Pork Chop Hill to the Ia
Drang Valley, from Salinas Airfield to the Battle of 73 Easting. It derives from the unique realities of battle. It echoes through the precepts
in the Code of Conduct. Developed through discipline, commitment to Army values, and
knowledge of the Army’s proud heritage, the
warrior ethos makes clear that military service
is much more than just another job: the purpose
of winning the nation’s wars calls for total
commitment.
2-86. America has a proud tradition of
winning. The ability to forge victory out of the
chaos of battle includes overcoming fear,
hunger, deprivation, and fatigue. The Army
wins because it fights hard; it fights hard
because it trains hard; and it trains hard because that’s the way to win. Thus, the warrior
ethos is about more than persevering under the
worst of conditions; it fuels the fire to fight
through those conditions to victory no matter
how long it takes, no matter how much effort is
required. It’s one thing to make a snap decision
to risk your life for a brief period of time. It’s
quite another to sustain the will to win when
the situation looks hopeless and doesn’t show
any indications of getting better, when being
away from home and family is a profound hardship. The soldier who jumps on a grenade to
save his comrades is courageous, without question. That action requires great physical courage, but pursuing victory over time also
requires a deep moral courage that concentrates on the mission.
2-87. The warrior ethos concerns character,
shaping who you are and what you do. In that
sense, it’s clearly linked to Army values such as
personal courage, loyalty to comrades, and

Army Leadership

dedication to duty. Both loyalty and duty
involve putting your life on the line, even when
there’s little chance of survival, for the good of a
cause larger than yourself. That’s the clearest
example of selfless service. American soldiers
never give up on their fellow soldiers, and they
never compromise on doing their duty. Integrity
underlies the character of the Army as well.
The warrior ethos requires unrelenting and
consistent determination to do what is right
and to do it with pride, both in war and military
operations other than war. Understanding
what is right requires respect for both your comrades and other people involved in such complex arenas as peace operations and nation
assistance. In such ambiguous situations, decisions to use lethal or nonlethal force severely
test judgment and discipline. In whatever conditions Army leaders find themselves, they turn
the personal warrior ethos into a collective
commitment to win with honor.
2-88. The warrior ethos is crucial—and perishable—so the Army must continually affirm, develop, and sustain it. Its martial ethic connects
American warriors today with those whose sacrifices have allowed our very existence. The
Army’s continuing drive to be the best, to triumph over all adversity, and to remain focused
on mission accomplishment does more than
preserve the Army’s institutional culture; it
sustains the nation.
2-89. Actions that safeguard the nation occur
everywhere you find soldiers. The warrior ethos
spurs the lead tank driver across a line of departure into uncertainty. It drives the bone-tired
medic continually to put others first. It pushes
the sweat-soaked gunner near muscle failure to
keep up the fire. It drives the heavily loaded infantry soldier into an icy wind, steadily uphill to
the objective. It presses the signaler through fatigue to provide communications. And the warrior ethos urges the truck driver across frozen
roads bounded by minefields because fellow soldiers at an isolated outpost need supplies. Such
tireless motivation comes in part from the comradeship that springs from the warrior ethos.
Soldiers fight for each other; they would rather
die than let their buddies down. That loyalty
runs front to rear as well as left to right: mutual

2-21

What the Leader Must Be, Know, and Do

support marks Army culture regardless of who
you are, where you are, or what you are doing.
2-90. That tight fabric of loyalty to one another and to collective victory reflects perhaps the noblest aspect of our American
warrior ethos: the military’s subordinate relationship to civilian authority. That subordination began in 1775, was reconfirmed at
Newburgh, New York, in 1782, and continues
to this day. It’s established in the Constitution and makes possible the freedom all
Americans enjoy. The Army sets out to
achieve national objectives, not its own, for
selfless service is an institutional as well as an
individual value. And in the end, the Army returns its people back to the nation. America’s
sons and daughters return with their experience as part of a winning team and share that
spirit as citizens. The traditions and values of
the service derive from a commitment to excellent performance and operational success.
They also point to the Army’s unwavering
commitment to the society we serve. Those
characteristics serve America and its citizens—both in and out of uniform—well.
CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
2-91. People come to the Army with a character formed by their background, religious or
philosophical beliefs, education, and experience. Your job as an Army leader would
be a great deal easier if you could check the
values of a new DA civilian or soldier the way
medics check teeth or run a blood test. You

could figure out what values were missing by
a quick glance at Figure 1-1 and administer
the right combination, maybe with an injection or magic pill.
2-92. But character development is a complex,
lifelong process. No scientist can point to a person and say, “This is when it all happens.”
However, there are a few things you can count
on. You build character in subordinates by creating organizations in which Army values are
not just words in a book but precepts for what
their members do. You help build subordinates’
character by acting the way you want them to
act. You teach by example, and coach along the
way. (Appendix E contains additional information on character development.) When you hold
yourself and your subordinates to the highest
standards, you reinforce the values those standards embody. They spread throughout the
team, unit, or organization—throughout the
Army—like the waves from a pebble dropped
into a pond.
CHARACTER AND ETHICS
2-93. When you talk about character, you help
your people answer the question, What kind of
person should I be? You must not only embrace
Army values and leader attributes but also use
them to think, reason, and—after reflection—act. Acting in a situation that tests your
character requires moral courage. Consider this
example.

The Qualification Report
A battalion in a newly activated division had just spent a great deal of time and effort on weapons
qualification. When the companies reported results, the battalion commander could not understand
why B and C Companies had reported all machine gunners fully qualified while A Company had not.
The A Company Commander said that he could not report his gunners qualified because they had
only fired on the 10-meter range and the manual for qualification clearly stated that the gunners had to
fire on the transition range as well. The battalion commander responded that since the transition
range was not built yet, the gunners should be reported as qualified: “They fired on the only range we
have. And besides, that’s how we did it at Fort Braxton.”
Some of the A Company NCOs, who had also been at Fort Braxton, tried to tell their company
commander the same thing. But the captain insisted the A Company gunners were not fully qualified,
and that’s how the report went to the brigade commander.

2-22

FM 22-100

Focus on Character

The Qualification Report (continued)
The brigade commander asked for an explanation of the qualification scores. After hearing the A
Company Commander’s story, he agreed that the brigade would be doing itself no favors by reporting
partially qualified gunners as fully qualified. The incident also sent a message to division: get that
transition range built.
The A Company Commander’s choice was not between loyalty to his battalion commander and
honesty; doing the right thing here meant being loyal and honest. And the company commander had
the moral courage to be both honest and loyal—loyal to the Army, loyal to his unit, and loyal to his
soldiers.

2-94. The A Company Commander made his
decision and submitted his report without
knowing how it would turn out. He didn’t know
the brigade commander would back him up, but
he reported his company’s status relative to the
published Army standard anyway. He insisted
on reporting the truth—which took character—
because it was the right thing to do.
2-95. Character is important in living a
consistent and moral life, but character doesn’t
always provide the final answer to the specific
question, What should I do now? Finding that
answer can be called ethical reasoning. Chapter
4 outlines a process for ethical reasoning. When
you read it, keep in mind that the process is
much more complex than the steps indicate and
that you must apply your own values, critical
reasoning skills, and imagination to the situation. There are no formulas that will serve
every time; sometimes you may not even come
up with an answer that completely satisfies
you. But if you embrace Army values and let
them govern your actions, if you learn from
your experiences and develop your skills over
time, you’re as prepared as you can be to face
the tough calls.
2-96. Some people try to set different Army
values against one another, saying a problem is
about loyalty versus honesty or duty versus respect. Leadership is more complicated than
that; the world isn’t always black and white. If
it were, leadership would be easy and anybody
could do it. However, in the vast majority of
cases, Army values are perfectly compatible; in
fact, they reinforce each other.

Army Leadership

CHARACTER AND ORDERS
2-97. Making the right choice and acting on it
when faced with an ethical question can be difficult. Sometimes it means standing your
ground. Sometimes it means telling your boss
you think the boss is wrong, like the finance supervisor in Chapter 1 did. Situations like these
test your character. But a situation in which
you think you’ve received an illegal order can be
even more difficult.
2-98. In Chapter 1 you read that a good leader
executes the boss’s decision with energy and enthusiasm. The only exception to this principle is
your duty to disobey illegal orders. This isn’t a
privilege you can conveniently claim, but a duty
you must perform. If you think an order is illegal, first be sure that you understand both the
details of the order and its original intent. Seek
clarification from the person who gave the order. This takes moral courage, but the question
will be straightforward: Did you really mean for
me to…steal the part…submit a false report…shoot the prisoners? If the question is
complex or time permits, always seek legal
counsel. However, if you must decide immediately—as may happen in the heat of combat
make the best judgment possible based on
Army values, your experience, and your previous study and reflection. You take a risk when
you disobey what you believe to be an illegal order. It may be the most difficult decision you’ll
ever make, but that’s what leaders do.
2-99. While you’ll never be completely prepared
for such a situation, spending time reflecting on
Army values and leader attributes may help.
Talk to your superiors, particularly those who

2-23

What the Leader Must Be, Know, and Do

have done what you aspire to do or what you
think you’ll be called on to do; providing counsel
of this sort is an important part of mentoring
(which Chapter 5 discusses). Obviously, you
need to make time to do this before you’re faced
with a tough call. When you’re in the middle of a
firefight, you don’t have time to reflect.
CHARACTER AND BELIEFS
2-100. What role do beliefs play in ethical matters? Beliefs are convictions people hold as true;
they are based on their upbringing, culture,
heritage, families, and traditions. As a result,
different moral beliefs have been and will continue to be shaped by diverse religious and
philosophical traditions. You serve a nation
that takes very seriously the notion that people
are free to choose their own beliefs and the basis for those beliefs. In fact, America’s strength
comes from that diversity. The Army respects
different moral backgrounds and personal convictions—as long as they don’t conflict with
Army values.
2-101. Beliefs matter because they are the way
people make sense of what they experience. Beliefs also provide the basis for personal values;
values are moral beliefs that shape a person’s
behavior. Effective leaders are careful not to require their people to violate their beliefs by ordering or encouraging any illegal or unethical
action.
2-102. The Constitution reflects our deepest national values. One of these values is the guarantee of freedom of religion. While religious beliefs

and practices are left to individual conscience,
Army leaders are responsible for ensuring their
soldiers’ right to freely practice their religion. Title 10 of the United States Code states, “Each
commanding officer shall furnish facilities, including necessary transportation, to any chaplain assigned to his command, to assist the
chaplain in performing his duties.” What does
this mean for Army leaders? The commander
delegates staff responsibility to the chaplain for
programs to enhance spiritual fitness since
many people draw moral fortitude and inner
strength from a spiritual foundation. At the
same time, no leader may apply undue influence
or coerce others in matters of religion—whether
to practice or not to practice specific religious beliefs. (The first ten amendments to the Constitution are called the Bill of Rights. Freedom of
religion is guaranteed by the First Amendment,
an indication of how important the Founders
considered it. You can read the Bill of Rights in
Appendix F.)
2-103. Army leaders also recognize the role beliefs play in preparing soldiers for battle. Soldiers often fight and win over tremendous odds
when they are convinced of the ideals (beliefs) for
which they are fighting. Commitment to such
beliefs as justice, liberty, freedom, and not letting down your fellow soldier can be essential ingredients in creating and sustaining the will to
fight and prevail. A common theme expressed by
American PWs during the Vietnam Conflict was
the importance of values instilled by a common
American culture. Those values helped them to
withstand torture and the hardships of captivity.

SECTION II
COMPETENCE: WHAT A LEADER MUST KNOW
The American soldier…demands professional competence in his leaders. In battle, he wants to
know that the job is going to be done right, with no unnecessary casualties. The
noncommissioned officer wearing the chevron is supposed to be the best soldier in the platoon
and he is supposed to know how to perform all the duties expected of him. The American
soldier expects his sergeant to be able to teach him how to do his job. And he expects even more
from his officers.
General of the Army Omar N. Bradley

2-104. Army values and leader attributes form
the foundation of the character of soldiers and

2-24

DA civilians. Character, in turn, serves as the
basis of knowing (competence) and doing

FM 22-100

Competence: What a Leader Must Know

(leadership). The self-discipline that leads to
teamwork is rooted in character. In the Army,
teamwork depends on the actions of competent leaders of proven character who know
their profession and act to improve their organizations. The best Army leaders constantly
strive to improve, to get better at what they
do. Their self-discipline focuses on learning
more about their profession and continually
getting the team to perform better. They build
competence in themselves and their subordinates. Leader skills increase in scope and complexity as one moves from direct leader
positions to organizational and strategic
leader positions. Chapters 4, 6, and 7 discuss
in detail the different skills direct, organizational, and strategic leaders require.

2-106. For you as an Army leader, competence
means much more than being well-trained.
Competence links character (knowing the
right thing to do) and leadership (doing or
influencing your people to do the right thing).
Leaders are responsible for being personally
competent, but even that isn’t enough: as a
leader, you’re responsible for your subordinates’ competence as well.

2-105. Competence results from hard, realistic
training. That’s why Basic Training starts with
simple skills, such as drill and marksmanship.
Soldiers who master these skills have a couple of
victories under their belts. The message from
the drill sergeants—explicit or not—is, “You’ve
learned how to do those things; now you’re
ready to take on something tougher.” When you
lead people through progressively more complex tasks this way, they develop the confidence
and will—the inner drive—to take on the next,
more difficult challenge.

ideas. They require sound judgment as well
as the ability to think creatively and reason

2-107. Figure 2-3 highlights the four categories
containing skills an Army leader must KNOW:

· Interpersonal skills affect how you deal
with people. They include coaching, teaching, counseling, motivating, and empowering.

· Conceptual skills enable you to handle

· Technical skills are job-related abilities. They include basic soldier skills. As
an Army leader, you must possess the expertise necessary to accomplish all tasks
and functions you’re assigned.

· Tactical skills apply to solving tactical

problems, that is, problems concerning
employment of units in combat. You enhance tactical skills when you combine
them with interpersonal, conceptual, and
technical skills to accomplish a mission.

2-108. Leaders in combat combine interpersonal,
conceptual, technical, and tactical skills to accomplish the mission. They use their interpersonal
skills to communicate their intent effectively
and motivate their soldiers. They apply their
conceptual skills to determine viable concepts
of operations, make the right decisions, and
execute the tactics the operational environment requires. They capitalize on their technical skills to properly employ the techniques,
procedures, fieldcraft, and equipment that fit
the situation. Finally, combat leaders employ
tactical skill, combining skills from the other
skill categories with knowledge of the art of tactics appropriate to their level of responsibility
and unit type to accomplish the mission. When
plans go wrong and leadership must turn the
tide, it is tactical skill, combined with

character, that enables an Army leader to seize
control of the situation and lead the unit to mission accomplishment.

post exercises, in combat drills, on firing
ranges, and even on the physical training (PT)
field.

2-109. The Army leadership framework draws
a distinction between developing skills and performing actions. Army leaders who take their
units to a combat training center (CTC) improve their skills by performing actions—by
doing their jobs on the ground in the midst of
intense simulated combat. But they don’t wait
until they arrive at the CTC to develop their
skills; they practice ahead of time in command

2-110. Your leader skills will improve as your
experience broadens. A platoon sergeant gains
valuable experience on the job that will help
him be a better first sergeant. Army leaders
take advantage of every chance to improve:
they look for new learning opportunities, ask
questions, seek training opportunities, and request performance critiques.

2-111. Leaders act. They bring together everything they are, everything they believe, and
everything they know how to do to provide purpose, direction, and motivation. Army leaders
work to influence people, operate to accomplish
the mission, and act to improve their organization. This section introduces leader actions.
Chapters 5, 6, and 7 discuss them more fully. As
with leader skills, leader actions increase in
scope and complexity as you move from direct
leader positions to organizational and strategic
leader positions.
2-112. Developing the right values, attributes,
and skills is only preparation to lead. Leadership
doesn’t begin until you act. Leaders who live up
to Army values, who display leader attributes,
who are competent, who act at all times as they
would have their people act, will succeed. Leaders who talk a good game but can’t back their
words with actions will fail in the long run.

Figure 2-4. Leader Actions

2-26

FM 22-100

Leadership: What a Leader Must Do

INFLUENCING
2-113. Army leaders use interpersonal skills to
guide others toward a goal. Direct leaders most
often influence subordinates face to face—such
as when a team leader gives instructions, recognizes achievement, and encourages hard work.
Organizational and strategic leaders also influence their immediate subordinates and staff
face to face; however, they guide their organizations primarily by indirect influence. Squad
leaders, for example, know what their division
commander wants, not because the general has
briefed each one personally, but because his

intent is passed through the chain of command.
Influencing actions fall into these categories:

· Communicating involves displaying good
·

·

oral, written, and listening skills for individuals and groups.
Decision making involves selecting the
line of action intended to be followed as the
one most favorable to the successful
accomplishment of the mission. This involves using sound judgment, reasoning
logically, and managing resources wisely.
Motivating involves inspiring and guiding
others toward mission accomplishment.

OPERATING
2-114. Operating is what you do to accomplish
the immediate mission, to get the job done on
time and to standard. Operating actions fall
into these categories:
·

Planning and preparing involve developing detailed, executable plans that are
feasible, acceptable, and suitable; arranging
unit support for the exercise or operation;
and conducting rehearsals. During tactical
operations, decision making and planning
are enhanced by two methodologies: the
military decision making process (MDMP)
and the troop leading procedures (TLP).
Battalion and higher echelons follow the

Army Leadership

·
·

MDMP. Company and lower echelons follow
the TLP. (FM 101-5 discusses the MDMP.)
Executing involves meeting mission
standards, taking care of people, and efficiently managing resources.
Assessing involves evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of any system or plan
in terms of its purpose and mission.

2-115. Leaders assess, or judge, performance so
they can determine what needs to be done to
sustain the strong areas and improve weak
ones. This kind of forward thinking is linked to
the last leader action, improving.

2-27

What the Leader Must Be, Know, and Do

IMPROVING
2-116. Good leaders strive to leave an organization better than they found it. A child
struggling to understand why it is better to put
money in a piggy bank is learning what leaders
know: plan and sacrifice now for the sake of the
future. All leaders are tempted to focus on the
short-term gain that makes them and their organizations look good today: “Why bother to fix
it now? By the time next year rolls around, it
will be someone else’s problem.” But that attitude doesn’t serve either your subordinates or
the Army well. When an organization sacrifices
important training with long-term effects—say, training that leads to true marksmanship skill—and focuses exclusively on
short-term appearances—such as qualification
scores—the organization’s capabilities suffers.

2-118. Army leaders set priorities and balance
competing demands. They focus their
organizations’ efforts on short- and long-term
goals while continuing to meet requirements
that may or may not contribute directly to
achieving those goals. In the case of weapons
proficiency, qualification is a requirement but
true marksmanship skill is the goal. For battlefield success, soldiers need training that leads
to understanding and mastery of technical and
tactical skills that hold up under the stress of
combat. Throw in all the other things vying for
an organization’s time and resources and your
job becomes even more difficult. Guidance from
higher headquarters may help, but you must
make the tough calls. Improving actions fall
into these categories:

2-117. The results of shortsighted priorities
may not appear immediately, but they will appear. Loyalty to your people as well as the Army
as an institution demands you consider the
long-term effects of your actions. Some of your
people will remain in the organization after
you’ve moved on. Some will still be in the Army
after you’re long gone. Soldiers and DA civilians tomorrow must live with problems leaders
don’t fix today.

time and effort to develop individual subordinates as leaders. It includes mentoring.
Building involves spending time and
resources to improve teams, groups, and
units and to foster an ethical climate.
Learning
involves
seeking
selfimprovement and organizational growth. It
includes envisioning, adapting, and leading
change.

SUMMARY
2-119. As an Army leader, leadership in combat
is your primary and most important challenge.
It requires you to accept a set of values that contributes to a core of motivation and will. If you
fail to accept and live these Army values, your
soldiers may die unnecessarily and you may fail
to accomplish your mission.
2-120. What must you, as an Army leader, BE,
KNOW, and DO? You must have character,
that combination of values and attributes that
underlie your ability to see what needs to be
done, decide to do it, and influence others to follow you. You must be competent, that is, possess the knowledge and skills required to do
your job right. And you must lead, take the
proper actions to accomplish the mission based

2-28

on what your character tells you is ethically
right and appropriate for the situation.
2-121. Leadership in combat, the greatest challenge, requires a basis for your motivation and
will. That foundation is Army values. In them
are rooted the basis for the character and selfdiscipline that generate the will to succeed and
the motivation to persevere. From this motivation derives the lifelong work of selfdevelopment in the skills that make a successful
Army leader, one who walks the talk of BE,
KNOW, DO. Chapter 3 examines the environment that surrounds your people and how what
you do as a leader affects it. Understanding the
human dimension is essential to mastering
leader skills and performing leader actions.

FM 22-100

Chapter 3

The Human Dimension
All soldiers are entitled to outstanding leadership; I will provide that leadership. I know my
soldiers and I will always place their needs above my own. I will communicate consistently
with my soldiers and never leave them uninformed.

Creed of the Noncommissioned Officer

3-1. Regardless of the level, keep in mind one
important aspect of leadership: you lead people.
In the words of former Army Chief of Staff
Creighton W. Abrams,
The Army is not made up of people; the Army is people…living, breathing, serving human beings. They
have needs and interests and desires. They have
spirit and will, strengths and abilities. They have
weaknesses and faults, and they have means. They
are the heart of our preparedness…and this
preparedness—as a nation and as an Army—depends upon the spirit of our soldiers. It is the spirit
that gives the Army…life. Without it we cannot
succeed.

3-2. GEN Abrams could not have been more
clear about what’s important. To fully appreciate the human dimension of leadership, you
must understand two key elements: leadership
itself and the people you lead. Leadership—what this manual is about—is far from
an exact science; every person and organization
is different. Not only that, the environment in
which you lead is shaped first by who you are
and what you know; second, by your people and
what they know; and third, by everything that
goes on around you.
3-3. This chapter examines this all-important
human dimension. Later chapters discuss the
levels of Army leadership and the skills and actions required of leaders at each level.

PEOPLE, THE TEAM, AND THE INSTITUTION
3-4. Former Army Chief of Staff John A. Wickham Jr. described the relationship between the
people who are the Army and the Army as an institution this way:
The Army is an institution, not an occupation.
Members take an oath of service to the nation
and the Army, rather than simply accept a
job…the Army has moral and ethical
obligations to those who serve and their families;
they, correspondingly, have responsibilities to
the Army.
3-5. The Army has obligations to soldiers, DA
civilians, and their families that most organizations don’t have; in return, soldiers and DA civilians have responsibilities to the Army that
far exceed those of an employee to most employers. This relationship, one of mutual obligation
and responsibility, is at the very center of what

Army Leadership

makes the Army a team, an institution rather
than an occupation.
3-6. Chapter 2 discussed how the Army can’t
function except as a team. This team identity
doesn’t come about just because people take an

oath or join an organization; you can’t force a
team to come together any more than you can
force a plant to grow. Rather, the team identity
comes out of mutual respect among its members and a trust between leaders and subordinates. That bond between leaders and
subordinates likewise springs from mutual respect as well as from discipline. The highest
form of discipline is the willing obedience of

subordinates who trust their leaders, understand and believe in the mission’s purpose,
value the team and their place in it, and have
the will to see the mission through. This form of
discipline produces individuals and teams
who—in the really tough moments—come up
with solutions themselves.

Soldiers Are Our Credentials
In September 1944 on the Cotentin Peninsula in France, the commander of a German stronghold
under siege by an American force sent word that he wanted to discuss surrender terms. German MG
Hermann Ramcke was in his bunker when his staff escorted the assistant division commander of the
US 8th Infantry Division down the concrete stairway to the underground headquarters. MG Ramcke
addressed BG Charles D. W. Canham through an interpreter: “I am to surrender to you. Let me see
your credentials.” Pointing to the dirty, tired, disheveled—but victorious—American infantrymen who
had accompanied him and were now crowding the dugout entrance, the American officer replied,
“These are my credentials.”
DISCIPLINE
I am confident that an army of strong individuals, held together by a sound discipline based on
respect for personal initiative and rights and
dignity of the individual, will never fail this nation in time of need.

General J. Lawton Collins
Former Army Chief of Staff
3-7. People are our most important resource;
soldiers are in fact our “credentials.” Part of
knowing how to use this most precious resource
is understanding the stresses and demands that
influence people.
3-8. One sergeant major has described
discipline as “a moral, mental, and physical
state in which all ranks respond to the will of
the [leader], whether he is there or not.”
Disciplined people take the right action, even if
they don’t feel like it. True discipline demands
habitual and reasoned obedience, an obedience
that preserves initiative and works, even when
the leader isn’t around. Soldiers and DA civilians who understand the purpose of the mission, trust the leader, and share Army values
will do the right thing because they’re truly
committed to the organization.

3-2

3-9. Discipline doesn’t just mean barking
orders and demanding an instant response—it’s more complex than that. You build
discipline by training to standard, using rewards and punishment judiciously, instilling
confidence in and building trust among team
members, and creating a knowledgeable collective will. The confidence, trust, and collective
will of a disciplined, cohesive unit is crucial in
combat.
3-10. You can see the importance of these three
characteristics in an example that occurred
during the 3 October 1993 American raid in Somalia. One soldier kept fighting despite his
wounds. His comrades remembered that he
seemed to stop caring about himself, that he
had to keep fighting because the other
guys—his buddies—were all that mattered.
When things go badly, soldiers draw strength
from their own and their unit’s discipline; they
know that other members of the team are depending on them.
3-11. Soldiers—like those of Task Force
Ranger in Somalia (which you’ll read about
later in this chapter) and SGT Alvin York
(whose story is in Chapter 5)—persevere in
tough situations. They fight through because

FM 22-100

People, the Team, and the Institution

they have confidence in themselves, their buddies, their leaders, their equipment, and their
training—and because they have discipline and
will. A young sergeant who participated in Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti in 1994 asserted this fact when interviewed by the media.
The soldier said that operations went well because his unit did things just the way they did
them in training and that his training never let
him down.
3-12. Even in the most complex operations, the
performance of the Army comes down to the
training and disciplined performance of individuals and teams on the ground. One example
of this fact occurred when a detachment of
American soldiers was sent to guard a television
tower in Udrigovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina.
3-13. After the soldiers had assumed their
posts, a crowd of about 100 people gathered,
grew to about 300, and began throwing rocks at
the Americans. However, the soldiers didn’t
overreact. They prevented damage to the tower
without creating an international incident.
There was no “Boston Massacre” in Udrigovo.
The discipline of American soldiers sent into
this and other highly volatile situations in Bosnia kept the lid on that operation. The bloody
guerrilla war predicted by some didn’t materialize. This is a testament to the professionalism
of today’s American soldiers—your soldiers—and the quality of their leaders—you.

3-14. When military historians discuss great
armies, they write about weapons and
equipment, training and the national cause.
They may mention sheer numbers (Voltaire
said, “God is always on the side of the heaviest
battalions”) and all sorts of other things that
can be analyzed, measured, and compared.
However, some also write about another factor
equally important to success in battle,
something that can’t be measured: the emotional element called morale.

Army Leadership

3-15. Morale is the human dimension’s most
important intangible element. It’s a measure of
how people feel about themselves, their team,
and their leaders. High morale comes from good
leadership, shared hardship, and mutual respect. It’s an emotional bond that springs from
common values like loyalty to fellow soldiers and
a belief that the organization will care for families. High morale results in a cohesive team that
enthusiastically strives to achieve common
goals. Leaders know that morale, the essential
human element, holds the team together and
keeps it going in the face of the terrifying and dispiriting things that occur in war.
You have a comradeship, a rapport that
you’ll never have again…There’s no competitiveness, no money values. You trust the man
on your left and your right with your life.

Medal of Honor recipient and most decorated
American soldier of World War II
TAKING CARE OF SOLDIERS

Readiness is the best way of truly taking care of
soldiers.

Former Sergeant Major of the Army
Richard A. Kidd

3-16. Sending soldiers in harm’s way, into
places where they may be killed or wounded,
might seem to contradict all the emphasis on
taking care of soldiers. Does it? How can you
truly care for your comrades and send them on
missions that might get them killed? Consider
this important and fundamental point as you
read the next few paragraphs.
3-17. Whenever the talk turns to what leaders do, you’ll almost certainly hear someone
say, “Take care of your soldiers.” And that’s
good advice. In fact, if you add one more
clause, “Accomplish the mission and take
care of your soldiers,” you have guidance for a
career. But “taking care of soldiers” is one of
those slippery phrases, like the word
“honor,” that lots of people talk about but
few take the trouble to explain. So what does
taking care of soldiers mean?

3-3

The Human Dimension

3-18. Taking care of soldiers means creating a
disciplined environment where they can learn
and grow. It means holding them to high standards, training them to do their jobs so they
can function in peace and win in war. You take
care of soldiers when you treat them fairly, refuse to cut corners, share their hardships, and
set the example. Taking care of soldiers encompasses everything from making sure a soldier
has time for an annual dental exam to visiting
off-post housing to make sure it’s adequate. It
also means providing the family support that
assures soldiers their families will be taken
care of, whether the soldier is home or deployed. Family support means ensuring there’s
a support group in place, that even the most
junior soldier and most inexperienced family
members know where to turn for help when
their soldier is deployed.
3-19. Taking care of soldiers also means
demanding that soldiers do their duty, even

at the risk of their lives. It doesn’t mean coddling them or making training easy or comfortable. In fact, that kind of training can get
soldiers killed. Training must be rigorous and
as much like combat as is possible while being
safe. Hard training is one way of preparing
soldiers for the rigors of combat. Take care of
soldiers by giving them the training, equipment, and support they need to keep them
alive in combat.
3-20. In war, soldiers’ comfort is important because it affects morale and combat effectiveness, but comfort takes a back seat to the
mission. Consider this account of the 1944
landings on the island of
Leyte in the
Philippines, written more than 50 years later
by Richard Gerhardt. Gerhardt, who was an
18-year-old rifleman in the 96th Infantry
Division, survived two amphibious landings
and months of close combat with the Japanese.

The 96th Division on Leyte
By the time we reached the beach, the smoke and dust created by the preparation fire had largely
dissipated and we could see the terrain surrounding the landing area, which was flat and covered with
some underbrush and palm trees. We were fortunate in that our sector of the beach was not heavily
defended, and in going ashore there were few casualties in our platoon. Our company was engaged
by small arms fire and a few mortar rounds, but we were able to move forward and secure the landing
area in short order. Inland from the beach, however, the terrain turned into swamps, and as we moved
ahead it was necessary to wade through muck and mud that was knee-deep at times.…Roads in this
part of the island were almost nonexistent, with the area being served by dirt trails around the
swamps, connecting the villages.…The Japanese had generally backed off the beaches and left them
lightly defended, setting up their defense around certain villages which were at the junctions of the
road system, as well as dug-in positions at points along the roads and trails. Our strategy was to…not
use the roads and trails, but instead to move through the swamps and rice paddies and attack the
enemy strong points from directions not as strongly defended. This was slow, dirty, and extremely
fatiguing, but by this tactic we reduced our exposure to the enemy defensive plan, and to heavy fire
from their strong points. It must be recognized that in combat the comfort of the front-line troops isn’t
part of the…planning process, but only what they can endure and still be effective. Conditions that
seriously [affect] the combat efficiency of the troops then become a factor.

3-4

FM 22-100

People, the Team, and the Institution

3-21. Gerhardt learned a lifetime’s worth of lessons on physical hardship in the Pacific. Mud,
tropical heat, monsoon rains, insects, malaria,
Japanese snipers, and infiltrators—the details
are still clear in his mind half a century later.
Yet he knows—and he tells you—that soldiers
must endure physical hardship when the best
plan calls for it. In the Leyte campaign, the best
plan was extremely difficult to execute, but it
was tactically sound and it saved lives.
3-22. This concept doesn’t mean that leaders
sit at some safe, dry headquarters and make
plans without seeing what their soldiers are

going through, counting on them to tough out
any situation. Leaders know that graphics on a
map symbolize soldiers going forward to fight.
Leaders get out with the soldiers to see and feel
what they’re experiencing as well as to influence the battle by their presence. (Gerhardt
and numerous other front-line writers refer to
the rear echelon as “anything behind my foxhole.”) Leaders who stay a safe distance from
the front jeopardize operations because they
don’t know what’s going on. They risk destroying their soldiers’ trust, not to mention their
unit.

The K Company Visit
1LT Harold Leinbaugh, commander of K Company, 333d Infantry Regiment, 84th Division,related
this experience from the ETO in January,1945, during the coldest winter in Europe in nearly 50 years:
On a front-line visit, the battalion commander criticized 1LT Leinbaugh and CPT Jay Prophet, the
A Company Commander, for their own and their men’s appearance. He said it looked like no one had
shaved for a week. 1LT Leinbaugh replied that there was no hot water. Sensing a teaching moment,
the colonel responded: “Now if you men would save some of your morning coffee it could be used for
shaving.” Stepping over to a snowbank, 1LT Leinbaugh picked up a five-gallon GI [general issue]
coffee can brought up that morning, and shook it in the colonel’s face. The frozen coffee produced a
thunk. 1LT Leinbaugh shook it again.
“That’s enough,” said the colonel,“…I can hear.”

3-23. This example illustrates three points:

· The importance of a leader going to where
the action is to see and feel what’s really going on.

· The importance of a first-line leader telling
the boss something he doesn’t want to hear.

· The importance of a leader accepting infor-

mation that doesn’t fit his preconceived notions.
3-24. Soldiers are extremely sensitive to
situations where their leaders are not at risk,
and they’re not likely to forget a mistake by a
leader they haven’t seen. Leaders who are out
with their soldiers—in the same rain or snow,
under the same blazing sun or in the same dark
night, under the same threat of enemy artillery

Army Leadership

or small arms fire—will not fall into the trap of
ignorance. Those who lead from the front can
better motivate their soldiers to carry on under
extreme conditions.
3-25. Taking care of soldiers is every leader’s
business. A DA civilian engineering team chief
volunteered to oversee the installation of six
Force Provider troop life support systems in the
vicinity of Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzogovina. Using
organizational skills, motivational techniques,
and careful supervision, the team chief ensured
that the sites were properly laid out, integrated,
and installed. As a result of thorough planning
and the teamwork the DA civilian leader
generated, the morale and quality of life of over
5,000 soldiers were significantly improved.

The Human Dimension

COMBAT STRESS
All men are frightened. The more intelligent they are, the more they are frightened. The
courageous man is the man who forces himself, in spite of his fear, to carry on.

General George S. Patton Jr.

War As I Knew It

3-26. Leaders
understand
the
human
dimension and anticipate soldiers’ reactions to
stress, especially to the tremendous stress of
combat. The answers may look simple as you
sit somewhere safe and read this manual, but
be sure easy answers don’t come in combat.
However, if you think about combat stress and
its effects on you and your soldiers ahead of
time, you’ll be less surprised and better

prepared to deal with and reduce its effects. It
takes mental discipline to imagine the unthinkable—the plan going wrong, your soldiers
wounded or dying, and the enemy coming after
YOU. But in combat all of these things can happen, and your soldiers expect you, their leader,
to have thought through each of them. Put
yourself in the position of the squad leader in
the following example.

Task Force Ranger in Somalia, 1993
“Sarge” was a company favorite, a big powerful kid from New Jersey who talked with his hands
and played up his “Joy-zee” accent. He loved practical jokes. One of his favorites was to put those tiny
charges in guys’ cigarettes, the kind that would explode with a loud “POP!” about halfway through a
smoke. If anyone else had done it, it would have been annoying; Sarge usually got everyone to
laugh—even the guy whose cigarette he destroyed.
During the 3 October 1993 raid in Mogadishu, Sarge was manning his Humvee’s .50 cal when he
was hit and killed. The driver and some of the guys in back screamed, “He’s dead! He’s dead!” They
panicked and were not responding as their squad leader tried to get someone else up and behind the
gun. The squad leader had to yell at them, “Just calm down! We’ve got to keep fighting or none of us
will get back alive.”
3-27. Consider carefully what the squad leader
did. First he told his squad to calm down. Then
he told them why it was important: they had to
continue the fight if they wanted to make it
back to their base alive. In this way he jerked
his soldiers back to a conditioned response, one
that had been drilled during training and that
took their minds off the loss. The squad leader
demonstrated the calm, reasoned leadership
under stress that’s critical to mission success.
In spite of the loss, the unit persevered.
WILL AND WINNING IN BATTLE
3-28. The Army’s ultimate responsibility is to
win the nation’s wars. And what is it that
carries soldiers through the terrible challenges
of combat? It’s the will to win, the ability to gut
it out when things get really tough, even when

3-6

things look hopeless. It’s the will not only to
persevere but also to find workable solutions to
the toughest problems. This drive is part of the
warrior ethos, the ability to forge victory out of
the chaos of battle—to overcome fear, hunger,
deprivation, and fatigue and accomplish the
mission. And the will to win serves you just as
well in peacetime, when it’s easy to become
discouraged, feel let down, and spend your
energy complaining instead of using your
talents to make things better. Discipline holds a
team together; the warrior ethos motivates its
members—you and your people—to continue
the mission.
3-29. All soldiers are warriors: all need to develop and display the will to win—the desire to do
their job well—to persevere, no matter what
the circumstances. The Army is a team, and all

FM 22-100

Combat Stress

members’ contributions are essential to mission accomplishment. As an Army leader,
you’re responsible for developing this sense of
belonging in your subordinates. Not only that;
it’s your job to inculcate in your people the winning spirit—the commitment to do their part to
accomplish the mission, no matter when, no
matter where, no matter what.
3-30. Army operations often involve danger
and therefore fear. Battling the effects of fear
has nothing to do with denying it and
everything to do with recognizing fear and handling it. Leaders let their subordinates know,
“You can expect to be afraid; here’s what we’ll
do about it.” The Army standard is to continue
your mission to successful completion, as GEN
Patton said, in spite of your fears. But saying
this isn’t going to make it happen. Army leaders
expect fear to take hold when things go poorly,
setbacks occur, the unit fails to complete a mission, or there are casualties. The sights and
sounds of the modern battlefield are terrifying.
So is fear of the unknown. Soldiers who see
their buddies killed or wounded suddenly have
a greater burden: they become aware of their
own mortality. On top of all these obvious
sources of fear is the insecurity before battle
that many veterans have written about: “Will I
perform well or will I let my buddies down?”
3-31. In the October 1993 fight in Somalia, one
soldier who made it back to the safety of the
American position was told to prepare to go
back out; there were other soldiers in trouble.
He had just run a gauntlet of fire, had just seen
his friends killed and wounded, and was understandably afraid. “I can’t go back out there,” he
told his sergeant. The leader reassured the soldier while reminding him of the mission and his
responsibility to the team: “I know you’re
scared…I’m scared…I’ve never been in a situation like this, either. But we’ve got to go. It’s
our job. The difference between being a coward

Army Leadership

and a man isn’t whether you’re scared; it’s
what you do while you’re scared.” That frightened soldier probably wasn’t any less afraid,
but he climbed back on the vehicle and went out
to rescue the other American soldiers.
3-32. Will and a winning spirit apply in more
situations than those requiring physical
courage; sometimes you’ll have to carry on for
long periods in very difficult situations. The
difficulties soldiers face may not be ones of
physical danger, but of great physical,
emotional, and mental strain. Physical courage
allowed the soldier in the situation described
above to return to the fight; will allowed his
leader to say the right thing, to influence his
frightened subordinate to do the right thing.
Physical courage causes soldiers to charge a
machine gun; will empowers them to fight on
when they’re hopelessly outnumbered, under
appalling conditions, and without basic
necessities.
STRESS IN TRAINING
When the bullets started flying…I never thought
about half the things I was doing. I simply
relied on my training and concentrated on the
mission.

Captain Marie Bezubic
Operation Just Cause, Panama

3-33. Leaders must inject stress into training to
prepare soldiers for stress in combat. However,
creating a problem for subordinates and having
them react to it doesn’t induce the kind of
stress required for combat training. A meaningful and productive mission, given with detailed
constraints and limitations plus high standards
of performance, does produce stress. Still, leaders must add unanticipated conditions to that
stress to create a real learning environment.
Sometimes, you don’t even have to add stress; it
just happens, as in this example.

3-7

The Human Dimension

Mix-up at the Crossroads
A young transportation section chief was leading a convoy of trucks on a night move to link up
with several rifle companies. He was to transport the infantry to a new assembly area. When a sudden
rainstorm dropped visibility to near zero, the section chief was especially glad that he had carefully
briefed his drivers, issued strip maps, and made contingency plans. At a road intersection, his
northbound convoy passed through an artillery battery moving east. When his convoy reached the
rendezvous and the section chief got out to check his vehicles, he found he was missing two of his
own trucks but had picked up three others towing howitzers. The tired and wet infantry commander
was concerned that his unit would be late crossing the line of departure and forcefully expressed that
concern to the section chief. The section chief now had to accomplish the same mission with fewer
resources as well as run down his lost trucks and soldiers. There was certainly enough stress to go
around.
After the section chief sent one of his most reliable soldiers with the artillery vehicles to find his
missing trucks, he started shuttling the infantrymen to their destination. Later, after the mission was
accomplished, the section chief and his drivers talked about what had happened. The leader admitted
that he needed to supervise a convoy more closely under difficult conditions, and his soldiers
recognized the need to follow the part of the unit SOP concerning reduced visibility operations.
3-34. The section chief fixed the immediate
problem by starting to shuttle the infantry soldiers in the available trucks. During the AAR
with the drivers, the leader admitted a mistake
and figured out how to prevent similar errors in

the future. The section chief also let the team
know that sometimes, in spite of the best plans,
things go wrong. A well-trained organization
doesn’t buckle under stress but deals with any
setbacks and continues the mission.

THE STRESS OF CHANGE
3-35. Since the end of the Cold War, the Army
has gone through tremendous change—dramatic decreases in the number of soldiers and
DA civilians in all components, changes in assignment policies, base closings, and a host of
other shifts that put stress on soldiers, DA civilians, and families. In those same years, the
number of deployments to support missions
such as peace operations and nation assistance
has increased. And these changes have occurred
in a peacetime Army. At the same time, Army
leaders have had to prepare their soldiers for the
stresses of combat, the ultimate crucible.

include warfighting technology, is changing.
Rapid advances in new technologies are forcing
the Army to change many aspects of the way it
operates and are creating new leadership
challenges.

3-36. The stresses of combat you read about
earlier in this chapter are classic: they’ve been
the same for centuries. However, there’s an aspect of the human dimension that has assumed
an increasing importance: the effect of technological advances on organizations and people.
Military leaders have always had to deal with
the effect of technological changes. What’s different today is the rate at which technology, to

· You need to learn the strengths and vulner-

3-8

TECHNOLOGY AND LEADERSHIP
3-37. Technology’s presence challenges all
Army leaders. Technology is here to stay and
you, as an Army leader, need to continually
learn how to manage it and make it work for
you. The challenges come from many
directions. Among them—
abilities of the different technologies that
support your team and its mission.

· You need to think through how your organi-

zation will operate with organizations that
are less or more technologically complex.
This situation may take the form of heavy
and light Army units working together, operating with elements of another service, or

FM 22-100

The Stress of Change

cooperating with elements of another nation’s armed forces.

· You need to consider the effect of

technology on the time you have to analyze
problems, make a decision, and act. Events
happen faster today, and the stress you encounter as an Army leader is correspondingly greater.
Technological advances have the potential to
permit better and more sustainable operations.
However, as an Army leader you must remember the limitations of your people. No matter
what technology you have or how it affects your
mission, it’s still your soldiers and DA civilians—their minds, hearts, courage, and talents—that will win the day.
3-38. Advances in electronic data processing let
you handle large amounts of information easily.
Today’s desktop computer can do more, and do
it faster, than the room-sized computers of only
20 years ago. Technology is a powerful tool—if
you understand its potential uses and limitations. The challenge for all Army leaders is to
overcome confusion on a fast-moving battlefield characterized by too much information
coming in too fast.
3-39. Army leaders and staffs have always
needed to determine mission-critical information, prioritize incoming reports, and process them quickly. The volume of information
that current technology makes available makes
this skill even more important than in the past.
Sometimes something low-tech can divert the
flood of technological help into channels the
leader and staff can manage. For example, a
well-understood commander’s intent and
thought-through commander’s critical information requirements (CCIR) can help free leaders from nonessential information while
pushing decisions to lower levels. As an Army
leader, you must work hard to overcome the attractiveness and potential pitfalls of centralized
decision making that access to information will
appear to make practical.
3-40. Technology is also changing the size of
the battlefield and the speed of battle. Instant
global communications are increasing the pace
of military actions. Global positioning systems
and night vision capabilities mean the Army

Army Leadership

can fight at night and during periods of limited
visibility—conditions that used to slow things
down. Continuous operations increase the mental and physical stress on soldiers and leaders.
Nonlinear operations make it more difficult for
commanders to determine critical points on the
battlefield. Effective leaders develop techniques to identify and manage stress well before actual conflict occurs. They also find ways
to overcome the soldier’s increased sense of isolation that comes with the greater breadth and
depth of the modern battlefield. (FM 100-34
discusses continuous operations. FM 22-51 discusses combat stress control.)
3-41. Modern technology has also increased the
number and complexity of skills the Army requires. Army leaders must carefully manage
low-density specialties. They need to ensure
that critical positions are filled and that their
people maintain perishable skills. Army leaders
must bring together leadership, personnel
management, and training management to ensure their organizations are assigned people
with the right specialties and that the entire organization is trained and ready. On top of this,
the speed and lethality of modern battle have
made mental agility and initiative even more
necessary for fighting and winning. As in the
past, Army leaders must develop these attributes in their subordinates.
3-42. To some, technology suggests a bloodless
battlefield that resembles a computer war game
more than the battlefields of the past. That
isn’t true now and it won’t be true in the immediate future. Technology is still directed at answering the same basic questions that Civil War
leaders tried to answer when they sent out a
line of skirmishers: Where am I? Where are my
buddies? Where is the enemy? How do I defeat
him? Armed with this information, the soldiers
and DA civilians of the Army will continue to
accomplish the mission with character, using
their technological edge to do the job better,
faster, and smarter.
3-43. Modern digital technology can contribute
a great deal to the Army leader’s understanding
of the battlefield; good leaders stay abreast of
advances that enhance their tactical abilities.
Digital technology has a lot to offer, but don’t be

3-9

The Human Dimension

fooled. A video image of a place, an action, or an
organization can never substitute for the leader’s getting down on the ground with the soldiers to find out what’s going on. Technology
can provide a great deal of information, but it
may not present a completely accurate picture.
The only way leaders can see the urgency in the
faces of their soldiers is to get out and see them.
As with any new weapon, the Army leader must
know how to use technology without being seduced by it. Technology may be invaluable; however, effective leaders understand its limits.

3-44. Whatever their feeling regarding technology, today’s leaders must contend more and
more with an increased information flow and operational tempo (OPTEMPO). Pressures to
make a decision increase, even as the time to verify and validate information decreases. Regardless of the crunch, Army leaders are responsible
for the consequences of their decisions, so they
gather, process, analyze, evaluate—and check
—information. If they don’t, the costs can be disastrous. (FM 100-34 discusses information management and decision making.)

“Superior Technology”
In the late fall of 1950, as United Nations (UN) forces pushed the North Korean People’s Army
northward, the People’s Republic of China prepared to enter the conflict in support of its ally. The UN
had air superiority, a marked advantage that had contributed significantly to the UN tactical and
operational successes of the summer and early fall. Nonetheless, daily reconnaissance missions
over the rugged North Korean interior failed to detect the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s
movement of nearly a quarter of a million ground troops across the border and into position in the
North Korean mountains.
When the first reports of Chinese soldiers in North Korea arrived at Far East Command in Tokyo,
intelligence analysts ignored them because they contradicted the information provided by the latest
technology—aerial surveillance. Tactical commanders failed to send ground patrols into the
mountains. They assumed the photos gave an accurate picture of the enemy situation when, in fact,
the Chinese were practicing strict camouflage discipline. When the Chinese attacked in late
November, UN forces were surprised, suffered heavy losses, and were driven from the Chinese
border back to the 38th parallel.
When GEN Matthew B. Ridgway took over the UN forces in Korea in December, he immediately
visited the headquarters of every regiment and many of the battalions on the front line. This gave GEN
Ridgway an unfiltered look at the situation, and it sent a message to all his commanders: get out on
the ground and find out what’s going on.

3-45. The Chinese counterattack undid the results of the previous summer’s campaign and
denied UN forces the opportunity for a decisive
victory that may have ended the war. The UN
forces, under US leadership, enjoyed significant
technological advantages over the Chinese.
However, failure to verify the information provided by aerial photography set this advantage
to zero. And this failure was one of leadership,
not technology. Questioning good news provided by the latest “gee-whiz” system and ordering reconnaissance patrols to go out in lousy
weather both require judgment and moral

3-10

courage: judgment as to when a doubt is reasonable and courage to order soldiers to risk their
lives in cold, miserable weather. But Army leaders must make those judgments and give those
orders. Technology has not changed that.
3-46. Technology and making the most of it will
become increasingly important. Today’s Army
leaders require systems understanding and
more technical and tactical skills. Technical
skill: What does this system do? What does it
not do? What are its strengths? What are its
weaknesses? What must I check? Tactical skill:

FM 22-100

The Stress of Change

How do this system’s capabilities support my
organization? How should I employ it to support this mission? What must I do if it fails?
There’s a fine line between a healthy questioning of new systems’ capabilities and an unreasoning hostility that rejects the advantages
technology offers. You, as an Army leader, must
stay on the right side of that line, the side that
allows you to maximize the advantages of technology. You need to remain aware of its capabilities and shortcomings, and you need to
make sure your people do as well.
LEADERSHIP AND THE CHANGING
THREAT
3-47. Another factor that will have a major
impact on Army leadership in the near future is
the changing nature of the threat. For the
Army, the twenty-first century began in 1989
with the fall of the Berlin Wall and subsequent
collapse of the Soviet Union. America no longer
defines its security interests in terms of a single, major threat. Instead, it faces numerous,
smaller threats and situations, any of which can
quickly mushroom into a major security
challenge.
3-48. The end of the Cold War has increased the
frequency and variety of Army missions. Since
1989, the Army has fought a large-scale land
war and been continually involved in many different kinds of stability operations and support
operations. There has been a greater demand
for special, joint, and multinational operations
as well. Initiative at all levels is becoming more
and more important. In many instances, Army
leaders on the ground have had to invent ways
of doing business for situations they could not
have anticipated.
3-49. Not only that, the importance of direct
leaders—NCOs and junior officers—making the
right decisions in stressful situations has increased. Actions by direct-level leaders—sergeants, warrant officers, lieutenants, and
captains—can have organizational- and

strategic-level implications. Earlier in this
chapter, you read about the disciplined soldiers
and leaders who accomplished their mission of
securing a television tower in Udrigovo,
Bosnia-Herzegovina. In that case, the local
population’s perception of how American soldiers secured the tower was just as important as
securing the tower itself. Had the American detachment created an international incident by
using what could have been interpreted as excessive force, maintaining order throughout
Bosnia Herzegovina would have become more
difficult. The Army’s organizational and strategic leaders count on direct leaders. It has always
been important to accomplish the mission the
right way the first time; today it’s more important than ever.
3-50. The Army has handled change in the
past. It will continue to do so in the future as
long as Army leaders emphasize the
constants—Army values, teamwork, and discipline—and help their people anticipate change
by seeking always to improve. Army leaders
explain, to the extent of their knowledge and in
clear terms, what may happen and how the organization can effectively react if it does.
Change is inevitable; trying to avoid it is futile.
The disciplined, cohesive organization rides out
the tough times and will emerge even better
than it started. Leadership, in a very real sense,
includes managing change and making it work
for you. To do that, you must know what to
change and what not to change.
3-51. FM 100-5 provides a doctrinal framework
for coping with these challenges while
executing operations. It gives Army leaders
clues as to what they will face and what will be
required of them, but as COL Chamberlain
found on Little Round Top, no manual can
cover all possibilities. The essence of leadership
remains the same: Army leaders create a vision
of what’s necessary, communicate it in a way
that makes their intent clear, and vigorously
execute it to achieve success.

CLIMATE AND CULTURE
3-52. Climate and culture describe the environment in which you lead your people. Culture refers to the environment of the Army as an
institution and of major elements or communities within it. Strategic leaders maintain the
Army’s institutional culture. (Chapter 7 discusses their role.) Climate refers to the environment of units and organizations. All
organizational and direct leaders establish
their organization’s climate, whether purposefully or unwittingly. (Chapters 5 and 6 discuss
their responsibilities.)

small it is or how large. Answering the following questions can help you describe an organization’s climate:

CLIMATE

· In the absence of orders, do junior leaders

3-53. Taking care of people and maximizing
their performance also depends on the climate a
leader creates in the organization. An organization’s climate is the way its members feel about
their organization. Climate comes from people’s shared perceptions and attitudes, what
they believe about the day-to-day functioning of
their outfit. These things have a great impact
on their motivation and the trust they feel for
their team and their leaders. Climate is generally short-term: it depends on a network of the
personalities in a small organization. As people
come and go, the climate changes. When a soldier says “My last platoon sergeant was pretty
good, but this new one is great,” the soldier is
talking about one of the many elements that affect organizational climate.
3-54. Although such a call seems subjective,
some very definite things determine climate.
The members’ collective sense of the organization—its organizational climat —is directly attributable to the leader’s values, skills, and
actions. As an Army leader, you establish the
climate of your organization, no matter how

3-12

· Does the leader set clear priorities and
·

goals?
Is there a system of recognition, rewards
and punishments? Does it work?

· Do the leaders know what they’re doing? Do
they admit when they’re wrong?

· Do leaders seek input from subordinates?
Do they act on the feedback they’re provided?

have authority to make decisions that are
consistent with the leader’s intent?

· Are there high levels of internal stress and
negative competition in the organization? If
so, what’s the leader doing to change that
situation?

· Do the leaders behave the way they talk? Is

that behavior consistent with Army values?
Are they good role models?

· Do the leaders lead from the front, sharing
hardship when things get tough?

· Do leaders talk to their organizations on a
regular basis? Do they keep their people
informed?

3-55. Army leaders who do the right things for
the right reasons—even when it would be easier
to do the wrong thing—create a healthy
organizational climate. In fact, it’s the leader’s
behavior that has the greatest effect on the
organizational climate. That behavior signals
to every member of the organization what the
leader will and will not tolerate. Consider this
example.

Changing a Unit Climate—The New Squad Leader
SSG Withers was having a tough week. He had just been promoted to squad leader in a different
company; he had new responsibilities, new leaders, and new soldiers. Then, on his second day, his
unit was alerted for a big inspection in two days. A quick check of the records let him know that the
squad leader before him had let maintenance slip; the records were sloppy and a lot of the scheduled
work had not been done. On top of that, SSG Withers was sure his new platoon sergeant didn’t like
him. SFC King was professional but gruff, a person of few words. The soldiers in SSG Withers’ squad
seemed a little afraid of the platoon sergeant.
After receiving the company commander’s guidance about the inspection, the squad leaders
briefed the platoon sergeant on their plans to get ready. SSG Withers had already determined that he
and his soldiers would have to work late. He could have complained about his predecessor, but he
thought it would be best just to stick to the facts and talk about what he had found in the squad. For all
he knew, the old squad leader might have been a favorite of SFC King.
SFC King scowled as he asked, “You’re going to work late?”
SSG Withers had checked his plan twice: “Yes, sergeant. I think it’s necessary.”
SFC King grunted, but the sound could have meant “okay” or it could have meant “You’re being
foolish.” SSG Withers wasn’t sure.
The next day SSG Withers told his soldiers what they would have to accomplish. One of the
soldiers said that the old squad leader would have just fudged the paperwork. “No kidding,” SSG
Withers thought. He wondered if SFC King knew about it. Of course, there was a good chance he
would fail the inspection if he didn’t fudge the paperwork—and wouldn’t that be a good introduction to
the new company? But he told his squad that they would do it right: “We’ll do the best we can. If we
don’t pass, we’ll do better next time.”
SSG Withers then asked his squad for their thoughts on how to get ready. He listened to their
ideas and offered some of his own. One soldier suggested that they could beat the other squads by
sneaking into the motor pool at night and lowering the oil levels in their vehicles. “SFC King gives a
half day off to whatever squad does best,” the soldier explained. SSG Withers didn’t want to
badmouth the previous squad leader; on the other hand, the squad was his responsibility now. “It’d be
nice to win,” SSG Withers said, “but we’re not going to cheat.”
The squad worked past 2200 hours the night before the inspection. At one point SSG Withers
found one of the soldiers sleeping under a vehicle. “Don’t you want to finish and go home to sleep?”
he asked the soldier.
“I…uh…I didn’t think you’d still be here,” the soldier answered.
“Where else would I be?” replied the squad leader.
The next day, SFC King asked SSG Withers if he thought his squad’s vehicle was going to pass
the inspection.
“Not a chance,” SSG Withers said.
SFC King gave another mysterious grunt.
Later, when the inspector was going over his vehicle, SSG Withers asked if his soldiers could
follow along. “I want them to see how to do a thorough inspection,” he told the inspector. As the
soldiers followed the inspector around and learned how to look closely at the vehicle, one of them
commented that the squad had never been around for any inspection up to that point. “We were
always told to stay away,” he said.
Later, when the company commander went over the results of the inspection, he looked up at
SSG Withers as he read the failing grade. SSG Withers was about to say, “We’ll try harder next time,
sir,” but he decided that sounded lame, so he said nothing. Then SFC King spoke up.
“First time that squad has ever failed an inspection,” the platoon sergeant said, “but they’re
already better off than they were the day before yesterday, failing grade and all.”

The Human Dimension

3-56. SFC King saw immediately that things
had changed for the better in SSG Withers’
squad. The failing grade was real; previous
passing grades had not been. The new squad
leader told the truth and expected his soldiers
to do the same. He was there when his people
were working late. He acted to improve the
squad’s ethical and performance standards (by
clearly stating and enforcing them). He moved
to teach his soldiers the skills and standards associated with vehicle maintenance (by asking
the inspector to show them how to look at a vehicle). And not once did SSG Withers whine
that the failing grade was not his fault; instead,
he focused on how to make things better. SSG
Withers knew how to motivate soldiers to perform to standard and had the strength of character to do the right thing. In addition, he
trusted the chain of command to take the longterm view. Because of his decisive actions,
based on his character and competence, SSG
Withers was well on his way to creating a much
healthier climate in his squad.
3-57. No matter how they complain about it,
soldiers and DA civilians expect to be held to
standard; in the long run they feel better about
themselves when they do hard work successfully. They gain confidence in leaders who help
them achieve standards and lose confidence in
leaders who don’t know the standards or who
fail to demand performance.
CULTURE
When you’re first sergeant, you’re a role model
whether you know it or not. You’re a role model
for the guy that will be in your job. Not next
month or next year, but ten years from now.
Every day soldiers are watching you and
deciding if you are the kind of first sergeant they
want to be.

3-58. Culture is a longer lasting, more complex
set of shared expectations than climate. While
climate is how people feel about their organization right now, culture consists of the shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that
characterize the larger institution. It’s deeply
rooted in long-held beliefs, customs, and

3-14

practices. For instance, the culture of the
armed forces is different from that of the business world, and the culture of the Army is different from that of the Navy. Leaders must
establish a climate consistent with the culture
of the larger institution. They also use the
culture to let their people know they’re part of
something bigger than just themselves, that
they have responsibilities not only to the people
around them but also to those who have gone
before and those who will come after.
3-59. Soldiers draw strength from knowing
they’re part of a tradition. Most meaningful
traditions have their roots in the institution’s
culture. Many of the Army’s everyday customs
and traditions are there to remind you that
you’re just the latest addition to a long line of
American soldiers. Think of how much of your
daily life connects you to the past and to American soldiers not yet born: the uniforms you
wear, the martial music that punctuates your
day, the way you salute, your title, your organization’s history, and Army values such as selfless service. Reminders of your place in history
surround you.
3-60. This sense of belonging is vitally
important. Visit the Vietnam Memorial in
Washington, DC, some Memorial Day weekend
and you’ll see dozens of veterans, many of them
wearing bush hats or campaign ribbons or fatigue jackets decorated with unit patches.
They’re paying tribute to their comrades in this
division or that company. They’re also acknowledging what for many of them was the most intense experience of their lives.
3-61. Young soldiers want to belong to
something bigger than themselves. Look at
them off duty, wearing tee shirts with names of
sports teams and famous athletes. It’s not as if
an 18-year-old who puts on a jacket with a professional sports team’s logo thinks anyone will
mistake him for a professional player; rather,
that soldier wants to be associated with a winner. Advertising and mass media make heroes
of rock stars, athletes, and actors. Unfortunately, it’s easier to let some magazine or TV
show tell you whom to admire than it is to dig
up an organization’s history and learn about
heroes.

FM 22-100

Climate and Culture

3-62. Soldiers want to have heroes. If they don’t
know about SGT Alvin York in World War I,
about COL Joshua Chamberlain’s 20th Maine
during the Civil War, about MSG Gary Gordon
and SFC Randall Shughart in the 1993 Somalia
fight, then it’s up to you, their leaders, to teach
them. (The bibliography lists works you can use
to learn more about your profession, its history,
and the people who made it.)

3-63. When soldiers join the Army, they become part of a history: the Big Red One, the
King of Battle, Sua Sponte. Teach them the
history behind unit crests, behind greetings,
behind decorations and badges. The Army’s culture isn’t something that exists apart from you;
it’s part of who you are, something you can use
to give your soldiers pride in themselves and in
what they’re doing with their lives.

LEADERSHIP STYLES
3-64. You read in Chapter 2 that all people are
shaped by what they’ve seen, what they’ve
learned, and whom they’ve met. Who you are determines the way you work with other people.
Some people are happy and smiling all the time;
others are serious. Some leaders can wade into a
room full of strangers and inside of five minutes
have everyone there thinking, “How have I lived
so long without meeting this person?” Other
very competent leaders are uncomfortable in social situations. Most of us are somewhere in between. Although Army leadership doctrine
describes at great length how you should interact with your subordinates and how you must
strive to learn and improve your leadership
skills, the Army recognizes that you must always
be yourself; anything else comes across as fake
and insincere.
3-65. Having said that, effective leaders are
flexible enough to adjust their leadership style
and techniques to the people they lead. Some
subordinates respond best to coaxing, suggestions, or gentle prodding; others need, and even
want at times, the verbal equivalent of a kick in
the pants. Treating people fairly doesn’t mean
treating people as if they were clones of one another. In fact, if you treat everyone the same
way, you’re probably being unfair, because different people need different things from you.
3-66. Think of it this way: Say you must teach
map reading to a large group of soldiers ranging
in rank from private to senior NCO. The senior
NCOs know a great deal about the subject,
while the privates know very little. To meet all
their needs, you must teach the privates more
than you teach the senior NCOs. If you train

Army Leadership

the privates only in the advanced skills the
NCOs need, the privates will be lost. If you
make the NCOs sit through training in the basic tasks the privates need, you’ll waste the
NCOs’ time. You must fit the training to the experience of those being trained. In the same
way, you must adjust your leadership style and
techniques to the experience of your people and
characteristics of your organization.
3-67. Obviously, you don’t lead senior NCOs the
same way you lead privates. But the easiest distinctions to make are those of rank and experience. You must also take into account
personalities, self-confidence, self-esteem—all
the elements of the complex mix of character
traits that makes dealing with people so difficult
and so rewarding. One of the many things that
makes your job tough is that, in order to get their
best performance, you must figure out what
your subordinates need and what they’re able to
do—even when they don’t know themselves.
3-68. When discussing leadership styles, many
people focus on the extremes: autocratic and
democratic. Autocratic leaders tell people what
to do with no explanation; their message is,
“I’m the boss; you’ll do it because I said so.”
Democratic leaders use their personalities to
persuade subordinates. There are many shades
in between; the following paragraphs discuss
five of them. However, bear in mind that competent leaders mix elements of all these styles
to match to the place, task, and people involved.
Using different leadership styles in different
situations or elements of different styles in the
same situation isn’t inconsistent. The opposite
is true: if you can use only one leadership style,

3-15

The Human Dimension

you’re inflexible and will have difficulty operating in situations where that style doesn’t fit.
DIRECTING LEADERSHIP STYLE
3-69. The directing style is leader-centered.
Leaders using this style don’t solicit input from
subordinates and give detailed instructions on
how, when, and where they want a task performed. They then supervise its execution very
closely.
3-70. The directing style may be appropriate
when time is short and leaders don’t have a
chance to explain things. They may simply give
orders: Do this. Go there. Move. In fast-paced
operations or in combat, leaders may revert to
the directing style, even with experienced subordinates. This is what the motor sergeant you
read about in Chapter 1 did. If the leader has
created a climate of trust, subordinates will assume the leader has switched to the directing
style because of the circumstances.
3-71. The directing style is also appropriate
when leading inexperienced teams or individuals who are not yet trained to operate on their
own. In this kind of situation, the leader will
probably remain close to the action to make
sure things go smoothly.
3-72. Some people mistakenly believe the
directing style means using abusive or demeaning language or includes threats and intimidation. This is wrong. If you’re ever tempted to be
abusive, whether because of pressure or stress
or what seems like improper behavior by a subordinate, ask yourself these questions: Would I
want to work for someone like me? Would I
want my boss to see and hear me treat subordinates this way? Would I want to be treated this
way?
PARTICIPATING LEADERSHIP STYLE
3-73. The participating style centers on both
the leader and the team. Given a mission, leaders ask subordinates for input, information,
and recommendations but make the final decision on what to do themselves. This style is especially appropriate for leaders who have time
for such consultations or who are dealing with
experienced subordinates.

3-16

3-74. The team-building approach lies behind
the participating leadership style. When subordinates help create a plan, it becomes—at least
in part—their plan. This ownership creates a
strong incentive to invest the effort necessary
to make the plan work. Asking for this kind of
input is a sign of a leader’s strength and selfconfidence. But asking for advice doesn’t mean
the leader is obligated to follow it; the leader
alone is always responsible for the quality of decisions and plans.
DELEGATING LEADERSHIP STYLE
3-75. The delegating style involves giving subordinates the authority to solve problems and
make decisions without clearing them through
the leader. Leaders with mature and experienced subordinates or who want to create a
learning experience for subordinates often need
only to give them authority to make decisions,
the necessary resources, and a clear understanding of the mission’s purpose. As always, the
leader is ultimately responsible for what does or
does not happen, but in the delegating leadership style, the leader holds subordinate leaders
accountable for their actions. This is the style
most often used by officers dealing with senior
NCOs and by organizational and strategic
leaders.
TRANSFORMATIONAL AND
TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP
STYLES
A man does not have himself killed for a few
halfpence a day or for a petty distinction. You
must speak to the soul in order to electrify the
man.

Napoleon Bonaparte

3-76. These words of a distinguished military
leader capture the distinction between the transformational leadership style, which focuses on inspiration and change, and the transactional
leadership style, which focuses on rewards and
punishments. Of course Napoleon understood
the importance of rewards and punishments.
Nonetheless, he also understood that carrots and
sticks alone don’t inspire individuals to
excellence.

FM 22-100

Leadership Styles

Transformational Leadership Style
3-77. As the name suggests, the transformational style “transforms” subordinates
by challenging them to rise above their immediate needs and self-interests. The transformational style is developmental: it emphasizes
individual growth (both professional and personal) and organizational enhancement. Key
features of the transformational style include
empowering and mentally stimulating subordinates: you consider and motivate them first
as individuals and then as a group. To use the
transformational style, you must have the
courage to communicate your intent and then
step back and let your subordinates work. You
must also be aware that immediate benefits
are often delayed until the mission is
accomplished.
3-78. The transformational style allows you to
take advantage of the skills and knowledge of
experienced subordinates who may have better
ideas on how to accomplish a mission. Leaders
who use this style communicate reasons for
their decisions or actions and, in the process,
build in subordinates a broader understanding
and ability to exercise initiative and operate effectively. However, not all situations lend themselves to the transformational leadership style.
The transformational style is most effective during periods that call for change or present new
opportunities. It also works well when organizations face a crisis, instability, mediocrity, or disenchantment. It may not be effective when
subordinates are inexperienced, when the mission allows little deviation from accepted procedures, or when subordinates are not motivated.
Leaders who use only the transformational leadership style limit their ability to influence individuals in these and similar situations.
Transactional Leadership Style
3-79. In contrast, some leaders employ only the
transactional leadership style. This style includes such techniques as—
· Motivating subordinates to work by offering
rewards or threatening punishment.
· Prescribing task assignments in writing.
· Outlining all the conditions of task
completion, the applicable rules and regula-

Army Leadership

·

tions, the benefits of success, and the consequences—to include possible disciplinary
actions—of failure.
“Management-by-exception,”where leaders
focus on their subordinates’failures, showing
up only when something goes wrong.

The leader who relies exclusively on the transactional style, rather than combining it with
the transformational style, evokes only shortterm commitment from his subordinates and
discourages risk-taking and innovation.
3-80. There are situations where the
transactional style is acceptable, if not preferred. For example, a leader who wants to emphasize safety could reward the organization
with a three-day pass if the organization prevents any serious safety-related incidents over
a two-month deployment. In this case, the leader’s intent appears clear: unsafe acts are not
tolerated and safe habits are rewarded.
3-81. However, using only the transactional
style can make the leader’s efforts appear selfserving. In this example, soldiers might interpret
the leader’s attempt to reward safe practices as
an effort to look good by focusing on something
that’s unimportant but that has the boss’s attention. Such perceptions can destroy the trust subordinates have in the leader. Using the
transactional style alone can also deprive subordinates of opportunities to grow, because it leaves
no room for honest mistakes.
3-82. The most effective leaders combine techniques from the transformational and transactional leadership styles to fit the situation. A
strong base of transactional understanding supplemented by charisma, inspiration and individualized concern for each subordinate, produces the
most enthusiastic and genuine response. Subordinates will be more committed, creative, and innovative. They will also be more likely to take
calculated risks to accomplish their mission.
Again referring to the safety example, leaders can
avoid any misunderstanding of their intent by
combining transformational techniques with
transactional techniques. They can explain why
safety is important (intellectual stimulation) and
encourage their subordinates to take care of each
other (individualized concern).

The Human Dimension

INTENDED AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES
3-83. The actions you take as a leader will most
likely have unintended as well as intended consequences. Like a chess player trying to anticipate an opponent’s moves three or four turns in
advance—if I do this, what will my opponent do;
then what will I do next?—leaders think
through what they can expect to happen as a result of a decision. Some decisions set off a chain
of events; as far as possible, leaders must anticipate the second- and third-order effects of their
actions. Even lower-level leaders’ actions may
have effects well beyond what they expect.
3-84. Consider the case of a sergeant whose
team is manning a roadblock as part of a peace
operation. The mission has received lots of media attention (Haiti and Bosnia come to mind),
and millions of people back home are watching.
Early one morning, a truckload of civilians appears, racing toward the roadblock. In the halflight, the sergeant can’t tell if the things in the
passengers’ hands are weapons or farm tools,
and the driver seems intent on smashing
through the barricade. In the space of a few seconds, the sergeant must decide whether or not
to order his team to fire on the truck.
3-85. If the sergeant orders his team to fire because he feels he and his soldiers are threatened, that decision will have international
consequences. If he kills any civilians, chances
are good that his chain of command from the
president on down—not to mention the entire
television
audience
of
the
developed
world—will know about the incident in a few
short hours. But the decision is tough for
another reason: if the sergeant doesn’t order
his team to fire and the civilians turn out to be
an armed gang, the team may take casualties
that could have been avoided. If the only factor
involved was avoiding civilian casualties, the
choice is simple: don’t shoot. But the sergeant
must also consider the requirement to protect
his force and accomplish the mission of preventing unauthorized traffic from passing the roadblock. So the sergeant must act; he’s the leader,
and he’s in charge. Leaders who have thought
through the consequences of possible actions,
talked with their own leaders about the

3-18

commander’s intent and mission priorities, and
trust their chain of command to support them
are less likely to be paralyzed by this kind of
pressure.
INTENDED CONSEQUENCES
3-86. Intended consequences are the anticipated results of a leader’s decisions and actions. When a squad leader shows a team leader
a better way to lead PT, that action will have intended consequences: the team leader will be
better equipped to do the job. When leaders
streamline procedures, help people work
smarter, and get the resources to the right place
at the right time, the intended consequences
are good.
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES
3-87. Unintended consequences are the results
of things a leader does that have an unplanned
impact on the organization or accomplishment
of the mission. Unintended consequences are
often more lasting and harder to anticipate
than intended consequences. Organizational
and strategic leaders spend a good deal of energy considering possible unintended consequences of their actions. Their organizations
are complex, so figuring out the effects today’s
decisions will have a few years in the future is
difficult.
3-88. Unintended consequences are best described with an example, such as setting the
morning PT formation time: Setting the formation time at 0600 hours results in soldiers
standing in formation at 0600 hours, an
intended consequence. To not be late, soldiers
living off post may have to depart their homes
at 0500 hours, a consequence that’s probably
also anticipated. However, since most junior
enlisted soldiers with families probably own
only one car, there will most likely be another
consequence: entire families rising at 0430
hours. Spouses must drive their soldiers to post
and children, who can’t be left at home unattended, must accompany them. This is an unintended consequence.

Summary

SUMMARY
3-89. The human dimension of leadership, how
the environment affects you and your people,
affects how you lead. Stress is a major part of
the environment, both in peace and war. Major
sources of stress include the rapid pace of
change and the increasing complexity of technology. As an Army leader, you must stay on top
of both. Your character and skills—how you
handle stress—and the morale and discipline
you develop and your team are more important
in establishing the climate in your organization
than any external circumstances.
3-90. The organizational climate and the
institutional culture define the environment in
which you and your people work. Direct, organizational, and strategic leaders all have different
responsibilities regarding climate and culture;
what’s important now is to realize that you, the
leader, establish the climate of your organization. By action or inaction, you determine the
environment in which your people work.
3-91. Leadership styles are different ways of
approaching the DO of BE, KNOW, DO—the
actual work of leading people. You’ve read
about five leadership styles: directing,
participating, delegating, transformational,
and transactional. But remember that you
must be able to adjust the leadership style you
use to the situation and the people you’re
leading. Remember also that you’re not limited

Army Leadership

to any one style in a given situation: you should
use techniques from different styles if that will
help you motivate your people to accomplish
the mission. Your leader attributes of
judgment, intelligence, cultural awareness, and
self-control all play major roles in helping you
choose the proper style and the appropriate
techniques for the task at hand. That said, you
must always be yourself.
3-92. All leader actions result in intended and
unintended consequences. Two points to
remember: think through your decisions and do
your duty. It might not seem that the actions of
one leader of one small unit matter in the big
picture. But they do. In the words of Confederate COL William C. Oats, who faced COL
Joshua Chamberlain at Little Round Top:
“Great events sometimes turn on comparatively small affairs.”
3-93. In spite of stress and changes, whether
social or technological, leadership always involves shaping human emotions and behaviors.
As they serve in more complex environments
with wider-ranging consequences, Army leaders
refine what they’ve known and done as well as
develop new styles, skills, and actions. Parts
Two and Three discuss the skills and actions required of leaders from team to Department of
the Army level.

3-19

PART TWO

Direct Leadership
The first three chapters of this manual cover the constants of leadership. They focus primarily
on what a leader must BE. Part Two examines what a direct leader must KNOW and DO. Note
the distinction between a skill, knowing something, and an action, doing something. The
reason for this distinction bears repeating: knowledge isn’t enough. You can’t be a leader until
you apply what you know, until you act and DO what you must.
Army leaders are grounded in the heritage, values, and tradition of the Army. They embody
the warrior ethos, value continuous learning, and demonstrate the ability to lead and train their
subordinates. Army leaders lead by example, train from experience, and maintain and enforce
standards. They do these things while taking care of their people and adapting to a changing
world. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss these subjects in detail.
The warrior ethos is the will to win with honor. Despite a thinking enemy, despite adverse
conditions, you accomplish your mission. You express your character— the BE of BE, KNOW,
DO—when you and your people confront a difficult mission and persevere. The warrior ethos
applies to all soldiers and DA civilians, not just those who close with and destroy the enemy.
It’s the will to meet mission demands no matter what, the drive to get the job done whatever
the cost.
Continuous learning requires dedication to improving your technical and tactical skills through
study and practice. It also includes learning about the world around you—mastering new
technology, studying other cultures, staying aware of current events at home and abroad. All
these things affect your job as a leader.
Continuous learning also means consciously developing your character through study and
reflection. It means reflecting on Army values and developing leader attributes. Broad
knowledge and strong character underlie the right decisions in hard times. Seek to learn as
much as you can about your job, your people, and yourself. That way you’ll be prepared when
the time comes for tough decisions. You’ll BE a leader of character, KNOW the necessary
skills, and DO the right thing.
Army leaders train and lead people. Part of this responsibility is maintaining and enforcing
standards. Your subordinates expect you to show them what the standard is and train them to
it: they expect you to lead by example. In addition, as an Army leader you’re required to take
care of your people. You may have to call on them to do things that seem impossible. You may
have to ask them to make extraordinary sacrifices to accomplish the mission. If you train your
people to standard, inspire the warrior ethos in them, and consistently look after their
interests, they’ll be prepared to accomplish the mission—anytime, anywhere.

Direct Leadership Skills
Never get so caught up in cutting wood that you forget to sharpen your ax.

First Sergeant James J. Karolchyk, 1986
4-1. The Army’s direct leaders perform a huge
array of functions in all kinds of places and under all kinds of conditions. Even as you read
these pages, someone is in the field in a cold
place, someone else in a hot place. There are
people headed to a training exercise and others
headed home. Somewhere a motor pool is buzzing, a medical ward operating, supplies moving.
Somewhere a duty NCO is conducting inspections and a sergeant of the guard is making the
rounds. In all these places, no matter what the
conditions or the mission, direct leaders are

guided by the same principles, using the same
skills, and performing the same actions.
4-2. This chapter discusses the skills a direct
leader must master and develop. It addresses
the KNOW of BE, KNOW, and DO for direct
leaders. The skills are organized under the four
skill groups Chapter 1 introduced: interpersonal, conceptual, technical, and tactical.
(Appendix B lists performance indicators for
leader skills.)

INTERPERSONAL SKILLS
4-3. A DA civilian supervisor was in a frenzy
because all the material needed for a project
wasn’t available. The branch chief took the supervisor aside and said, “You’re worrying about
things. Things are not important; things will or
won’t be there. Worry about working with the
people who will get the job done.”
4-4. Since leadership is about people, it’s not surprising to find interpersonal skills, what some call
“people skills,” at the top of the list of what an
Army leader must KNOW. Figure 4-1 (on page
4-3) identifies the direct leader interpersonal
skills. All these skills—communicating, team
building, supervising, and counseling—require
communication. They’re all closely related; you
can hardly use one without using the others.
COMMUNICATING
4-5. Since leadership is about getting other
people to do what you want them to do, it
follows that communicating—transmitting information so that it’s clearly understood—is an
important skill. After all, if people can’t understand you, how will you ever let them know
what you want? The other interpersonal

4-2

skills—supervising, team building, and
counseling—also depend on your ability to
communicate.
4-6. If you take a moment to think about all the
training you’ve received under the heading
“communication,” you’ll see that it probably
falls into four broad categories: speaking, reading, writing, and listening. You begin practicing
speech early; many children are using words by
the age of one. The heavy emphasis on reading
and writing begins in school, if not before. Yet
how many times have you been taught how to
listen? Of the four forms of communication,

Skills—Interpersonal

may have unanswered questions or even walk
away with the wrong concept of what has occurred. That’s why two-way communication is
preferred when time and resources permit.
Active Listening
4-8. An important form of two-way communication is active listening. When you practice active listening, you send signals to the speaker
that say, “I’m paying attention.” Nod your head
every once in a while, as if to say, “Yes, I understand.” When you agree with the speaker, you
might use an occasional “uh-huh.” Look the
speaker in the eye. Give the speaker your full
attention. Don’t allow yourself to be distracted
by looking out the window, checking your
watch, playing with something on your desk, or
trying to do more than one thing at a time.
Avoid interrupting the speaker; that’s the cardinal sin of active listening.

listening is the one in which most people receive
the least amount of formal training. Yet for an
Army leader, it’s every bit as important as the
others. It often comes first because you must
listen and understand before you can decide
what to say.

4-9. Be aware of barriers to listening. Don’t
form your response while the other person is
still talking. Don’t allow yourself to become distracted by the fact that you’re angry, or that
you have a problem with the speaker, or that
you have lots of other things you need to be
thinking about. If you give in to these temptations, you’ll miss most of what’s being said.

One-Way and Two-Way Communication

Nonverbal Communication

4-7. There are two common forms of one-way
communication that are not necessarily the
best way to exchange information: seeing and
hearing. The key difference between one-way
and two-way communication is that one-way
communication—hearing or seeing something
on television, reading a copy of a slide presentation, or even watching a training event unfold—may not give you a complete picture. You

4-10. In face-to-face communication, even in
the simplest conversation, there’s a great deal
going on that has almost nothing to do with the
words being used. Nonverbal communication
involves all the signals you send with your facial
expressions, tone of voice, and body language.
Effective leaders know that communication includes both verbal and nonverbal cues. Look for
them in this example.

The Checking Account
A young soldier named PVT Bell, new to the unit, approaches his team leader, SGT Adams, and
says, “I have a problem I’d like to talk to you about.”
The team leader makes time—right then if possible—to listen. Stopping, looking the soldier in the
eye, and asking, “What’s up?” sends many signals: I am concerned about your problem. You’re part
of the team, and we help each other. What can I do to help? All these signals, by the way, reinforce
Army values.

Army Leadership

Direct Leadership Skills

The Checking Account (continued)
PVT Bell sees the leader is paying attention and continues, “Well, I have this checking account,
see, and it’s the first time I’ve had one. I have lots of checks left, but for some reason the PX [post
exchange] is saying they’re no good.”
SGT Adams has seen this problem before: PVT Bell thinks that checks are like cash and has no
idea that there must be money in the bank to cover checks written against the account. SGT Adams,
no matter how tempted, doesn’t say anything that would make PVT Bell think that his difficulty was
anything other than the most important problem in the world. He is careful to make sure that PVT Bell
doesn’t think that he’s anyone other than the most important soldier in the world. Instead, SGT Adams
remembers life as a young soldier and how many things were new and strange. What may seem like
an obvious problem to an experienced person isn’t so obvious to an inexperienced one. Although the
soldier’s problem may seem funny, SGT Adams doesn’t laugh at the subordinate. And because
nonverbal cues are important, SGT Adams is careful that his tone of voice and facial expressions
don’t convey contempt or disregard for the subordinate.
Instead, the leader listens patiently as PVT Bell explains the problem; then SGT Adams
reassures PVT Bell that it can be fixed and carefully explains the solution. What’s more, SGT Adams
follows up later to make sure the soldier has straightened things out with the bank.
A few months later, a newly promoted PFC Bell realizes that this problem must have looked pretty
silly to someone with SGT Adams’ experience. But PFC Bell will always remember the example SGT
Adams set. Future leaders are groomed every day and reflect their past leaders. By the simple act of
listening and communicating, SGT Adams won the loyalty of PFC Bell. And when the next batch of
new soldiers arrives, PFC Bell, now the old-timer, will say to them, “Yeah, in all my experience, I’ve got
to say this is one of the best units in the Army. And SGT Adams is the best team leader around. Why, I
remember a time…”
4-11. SGT Adams performed crisis counseling,
a leader action Appendix C discusses. Look for
the communicating skills in this example. SGT
Adams listened actively and controlled his nonverbal communication. He gave PVT Bell his
full attention and was careful not to signal indifference or a lack of concern. SGT Adams’
ability to do this shows the mental attribute of
self-discipline and the emotional attribute of
self-control, which you read about in Chapter 2.
The leader also displayed empathy, that is, sensitivity to the feelings, thoughts, and experiences of another person. It’s an important
quality for a counselor.
SUPERVISING
If a squad leader doesn’t check, and the guy on
point has no batteries for his night vision
goggles, he has just degraded the effectiveness of
the entire unit.

A Company Commander, Desert Storm

4-12. Direct leaders check and recheck things.
Leaders strike a balance between checking too
much and not checking enough. Training subordinates to act independently is important;
that’s why direct leaders give instructions or
their intent and then allow subordinates to
work without constantly looking over their
shoulders. Accomplishing the mission is equally
important; that’s why leaders check things—
especially conditions critical to the mission
(fuel levels), details a soldier might forget
(spare batteries for night vision goggles), or
tasks at the limit of what a soldier has accomplished before (preparing a new version of a report).
4-13. Checking minimizes the chance of
oversights, mistakes, or other circumstances
that might derail a mission. Checking also gives
leaders a chance to see and recognize
subordinates who are doing things right or
make on-the-spot corrections when necessary.
Consider this example: A platoon sergeant
delegates to the platoon’s squad leaders the

FM 22-100

Interpersonal Skills

authority to get their squads ready for a tactical
road march. The platoon sergeant oversees the
activity but doesn’t intervene unless errors,
sloppy work, or lapses occur. The leader is there
to answer questions or resolve problems that

the squad leaders can’t handle. This
supervision ensures that the squads are
prepared to standard and demonstrates to the
squad leaders that the platoon sergeant cares
about them and their people.

The Rusty Rifles Incident
While serving in the Republic of Vietnam, SFC Jackson was transferred from platoon sergeant of
one platoon to platoon leader of another platoon in the same company. SFC Jackson quickly sized up
the existing standards in the platoon. He wasn’t pleased. One problem was that his soldiers were not
keeping their weapons cleaned properly: rifles were dirty and rusty. He put out the word: weapons
would be cleaned to standard each day, each squad leader would inspect each day, and he would
inspect a sample of the weapons each day. He gave this order three days before the platoon was to
go to the division rest and recuperation (R&R) area on the South China Sea.
The next day SFC Jackson checked several weapons in each squad. Most weapons were still
unacceptable. He called the squad leaders together and explained the policy and his reasons for
implementing it. SFC Jackson checked again the following day and still found dirty and rusty
weapons. He decided there were two causes for the problem. First, the squad leaders were not doing
their jobs. Second, the squad leaders and troops were bucking him—testing him to see who would
really make the rules in the platoon. He sensed that, because he was new, they resisted his
leadership. He knew he had a serious discipline problem he had to handle correctly. He called the
squad leaders together again. Once again, he explained his standards clearly. He then said,
“Tomorrow we are due to go on R&R for three days and I’ll be inspecting rifles. We won’t go on R&R
until each weapon in this platoon meets the standard.”
The next morning SFC Jackson inspected and found that most weapons in each squad were still
below standard. He called the squad leaders together. With a determined look and a firm voice, he
told them he would hold a formal in-ranks inspection at 1300 hours, even though the platoon was
scheduled to board helicopters for R&R then. If every weapon didn’t meet the standard, he would
conduct another in-ranks inspection for squad leaders and troops with substandard weapons. He
would continue inspections until all weapons met the standard.
At 1300 hours the platoon formed up, surly and angry with the new platoon leader, who was taking
their hard-earned R&R time. The soldiers could hardly believe it, but his message was starting to sink
in. This leader meant what he said. This time all weapons met the standard.

COUNSELING
Nothing will ever replace one person looking
another in the eyes and telling the soldier his
strengths and weaknesses. [Counseling] charts
a path to success and diverts soldiers from
heading down the wrong road.

Sergeant Major Randolph S. Hollingsworth
4-14. Counseling is subordinate-centered communication that produces a plan outlining actions necessary for subordinates to achieve
individual or organizational goals. Effective counseling takes time, patience, and practice. As with

Army Leadership

everything else you do, you must develop your
skills as a counselor. Seek feedback on how effective you are at counseling, study various
counseling techniques, and make efforts to improve. (Appendix C discusses developmental
counseling techniques.)
4-15. Proper counseling leads to a specific plan
of action that the subordinate can use as a road
map for improvement. Both parties, counselor
and counseled, prepare this plan of action. The
leader makes certain the subordinate understands and takes ownership of it. The best plan

4-5

Direct Leadership Skills

of action in the world does no good if the subordinate doesn’t understand it, follow it, and believe in it. And once the plan of action is agreed
upon, the leader must follow up with one-onone sessions to ensure the subordinate stays on
track.
4-16. Remember the Army values of loyalty,
duty, and selfless service require you to counsel
your subordinates. The values of honor, integrity, and personal courage require you to give
them straightforward feedback. And the Army
value of respect requires you to find the best
way to communicate that feedback so that your
subordinates understand it. These Army values

all point to the requirement for you to become a
proficient counselor. Effective counseling helps
your subordinates develop personally and
professionally.
4-17. One of the most important duties of all direct, organizational, and strategic leaders is to
develop subordinates. Mentoring, which links
the operating and improving leader actions,
plays a major part in developing competent and
confident future leaders. Counseling is an interpersonal skill essential to effective mentoring. (Chapters 5, 6, and 7 discuss the direct,
organizational, and strategic leader mentoring
actions.)

CONCEPTUAL SKILLS
4-18. Conceptual skills include competence in
handling ideas, thoughts, and concepts.
Figure 4-2 (on page 4-7) lists the direct leader
conceptual skills.
CRITICAL REASONING
4-19. Critical reasoning helps you think
through problems. It’s the key to understanding situations, finding causes, arriving at justifiable conclusions, making good judgments, and
learning from the experience—in short, solving
problems. Critical reasoning is an essential part
of effective counseling and underlies ethical
reasoning, another conceptual skill. It’s also a
central aspect of decision making, which Chapter 5 discusses.
4-20. The word “critical” here doesn’t mean
finding fault; it doesn’t have a negative meaning at all. It means getting past the surface of
the problem and thinking about it in depth. It
means looking at a problem from several points

of view instead of just being satisfied with the
first answer that comes to mind. Army leaders
need this ability because many of the choices
they face are complex and offer no easy
solution.
4-21. Sometime during your schooling you
probably ran across a multiple choice test, one
that required you to “choose answer a, b, c, or d”
or “choose one response from column a and two
from column b.” Your job as an Army leader
would be a lot easier if the problems you faced
were presented that way, but leadership is a lot
more complex than that. Sometimes just figuring out the real problem presents a huge hurdle;
at other times you have to sort through distracting multiple problems to get to the real difficulty. On some occasions you know what the
problem is but have no clue as to what an answer might be. On others you can come up with
two or three answers that all look pretty good.

Finding the Real Problem
A platoon sergeant directs the platoon’s squad leaders to counsel their soldiers every month and
keep written records. Three months later, the leader finds the records are sloppy or incomplete; in
many cases, there’s no record at all. The platoon sergeant’s first instinct is to chew out the squad
leaders for ignoring his instructions. It even occurs to him to write a counseling annex to the platoon
SOP so he can point to it the next time the squad leaders fail to follow instructions.

4-6

FM 22-100

Conceptual Skills

Finding the Real Problem (continued)
But those are just knee-jerk reactions and the platoon sergeant knows it. Instead of venting his
frustration, the leader does a little investigating and finds that two squad leaders have never really
been taught how to do formal, written counseling. The third one has no idea why counseling is
important. So what looked like a disciplinary problem—the squad leaders disobeying
instructions—turns out to be a training shortfall. By thinking beyond the surface and by checking, the
platoon sergeant was able to isolate the real problem: that the squad leaders had not been trained in
counseling. The next step is to begin training and motivating subordinates to do the tasks.

4-22. Sometimes you run into a problem that
you haven’t seen before or an old problem that
requires a new solution. Here you must apply
imagination; a radical departure from the old
way of doing things may be refreshing. Army
leaders prevent complacency by finding ways to
challenge subordinates with new approaches
and ideas. In these cases, rely on your intuition,
experience, and knowledge. Ask for input from
your subordinates. Reinforce team building by
making everybody responsible for, and
shareholders in, the accomplishment of difficult
tasks.
4-23. Creative thinking isn’t some mysterious
gift, nor does it have to be outlandish. It’s not reserved for senior officers; all leaders think creatively. You employ it every day to solve small
problems. A unit that deploys from a stateside
post on a peace operation, for instance, may find
itself in a small compound with limited athletic
facilities and no room to run. Its leaders must
devise new ways for their soldiers to maintain
physical fitness. These may include sports and
games, even games the local nationals play.

Pulling Dragons’ Teeth
As American forces approached the Siegfried Line between Germany and France at the end of
World War II, the armored advance was slowed by “dragons’ teeth,” concrete obstacles that looked
like large, tightly spaced traffic cones. Engineers predicted it would take many days and tons of
explosives to reduce the obstacles, which were heavily reinforced and deeply rooted. Then an NCO
suggested using bulldozers to push dirt on top of the spikes, creating an earthen ramp to allow tanks to
drive over the obstacles. This is but one example of the creative thinking by American soldiers of all
ranks that contributed to victory in the ETO.

Army Leadership

Direct Leadership Skills

ETHICAL REASONING
4-24. Ethical leaders do the right things for the
right reasons all the time, even when no one is
watching. But figuring out what’s the “right”
thing is often, to put it mildly, a most difficult
task. To fulfill your duty, maintain your
integrity, and serve honorably, you must be
able to reason ethically.
4-25. Occasionally, when there’s little or no
time, you’ll have to make a snap decision based
on your experience and intuition about what
feels right. For Army leaders, such decisions are
guided by Army values (discussed in Chapter 2),
the institutional culture, and the organizational climate (discussed in Chapter 3). These
shared values then serve as a basis for the
whole team’s buying into the leader’s decision.
But comfortable as this might be, you should
not make all decisions on intuition.
4-26. When there’s time to consider alternatives, ask for advice, and think things
through, you can make a deliberate decision.
First determine what’s legally right by law and
regulation. In gray areas requiring interpretation, apply Army values to the situation.
Inside those boundaries, determine the best
possible answer from among competing
solutions, make your decision, and act on it.
4-27. The distinction between snap and deliberate decisions is important. In many decisions,
you must think critically because your intuition—what feels right—may lead to the wrong
answer. In combat especially, the intuitive response won’t always work.
4-28. The moral application of force goes to the
heart of military ethics. S. L. A. Marshall, a
military historian as well as a brigadier general,
has written that the typical soldier is often at a
disadvantage in combat because he “comes
from a civilization in which aggression, connected with the taking of a human life, is prohibited and unacceptable.” Artist Jon Wolfe, an
infantryman in Vietnam, once said that the
first time he aimed his weapon at another human being, a “little voice” in the back of his
mind asked, “Who gave you permission to do
this?” That “little voice” comes, of course, from
a lifetime of living within the law. You can

4-8

determine the right thing to do in these very
unusual circumstances only when you apply
ethical as well as critical reasoning.
4-29. The right action in the situation you face
may not be in regulations or field manuals.
Even the most exhaustive regulations can’t predict every situation. They’re designed for the
routine, not the exceptional. One of the most
difficult tasks facing you as an Army leader is
determining when a rule or regulation simply
doesn’t apply because the situation you’re facing falls outside the set of conditions envisioned
by those who wrote the regulation. Remember
COL Chamberlain on Little Round Top. The
drill manuals he had studied didn’t contain the
solution to the tactical problem he faced; neither this nor any other manual contain “cookbook” solutions to ethical questions you will
confront. COL Chamberlain applied the doctrine he learned from the drill manuals. So you
should apply Army values, your knowledge, and
your experience to any decision you make and
be prepared to accept the consequences of your
actions. Study, reflection, and ethical reasoning
can help you do this.
4-30. Ethical reasoning takes you through these
steps:

·
·
·
·

Define the problem.
Know the relevant rules.
Develop and evaluate courses of action.
Choose the course of action that best represents Army values.

4-31. These steps correspond to some of the
steps of the decision making leadership action
in Chapter 5. Thus, ethical reasoning isn’t a
separate process you trot out only when you
think you’re facing an ethical question. It
should be part of the thought process you use to
make any decision. Your subordinates count on
you to do more than make tactically sound decisions. They rely on you to make decisions that
are ethically sound as well. You should always
consider ethical factors and, when necessary,
use Army values to gauge what’s right.
4-32. That said, not every decision is an ethical
problem. In fact, most decisions are ethically
neutral. But that doesn’t mean you don’t have

FM 22-100

Conceptual Skills

to think about the ethical consequences of your
actions. Only if you reflect on whether what
you’re asked to do or what you ask your people
to do accords with Army values will you develop
that sense of right and wrong that marks ethical people and great leaders. That sense of right
and wrong alerts you to the presence of ethical
aspects when you face a decision.
4-33. Ethical reasoning is an art, not a science,
and sometimes the best answer is going to be
hard to determine. Often, the hardest decisions
are not between right and wrong, but between
shades of right. Regulations may allow more
than one choice. There may even be more than
one good answer, or there may not be enough
time to conduct a long review. In those cases,
you must rely on your judgment.
Define the Problem
4-34. Defining the problem is the first step in
making any decision. When you think a
decision may have ethical aspects or effects, it’s
especially important to define it precisely.
Know who said what—and what specifically
was said, ordered, or demanded. Don’t settle for
secondhand information; get the details. Problems can be described in more than one way.
This is the hardest step in solving any problem.
It’s especially difficult for decisions in the face
of potential ethical conflicts. Too often some
people come to rapid conclusions about the nature of a problem and end up applying solutions
to what turn out to be only symptoms.
Know the Relevant Rules
4-35. This step is part of fact gathering, the second step in problem solving. Do your homework. Sometimes what looks like an ethical
problem may stem from a misunderstanding of
a regulation or policy, frustration, or overenthusiasm. Sometimes the person who gave an
order or made a demand didn’t check the regulation and a thorough reading may make the
problem go away. Other times, a difficult situation results from trying to do something right
in the wrong way. Also, some regulations leave
room for interpretation; the problem then becomes a policy matter rather than an ethical
one. If you do perceive an ethical problem,

Army Leadership

explain it to the person you think is causing it
and try to come up with a better way to do the
job.
Develop and Evaluate Courses of Action
4-36. Once you know the rules, lay out possible
courses of action. As with the previous steps,
you do this whenever you must make a decision.
Next, consider these courses of action in view of
Army values. Consider the consequences of
your courses of action by asking yourself a few
practical questions: Which course of action best
upholds Army values? Do any of the courses of
action compromise Army values? Does any
course of action violate a principle, rule, or
regulation identified in Step 2? Which course of
action is in the best interest of the Army and of
the nation? This part will feel like a juggling
act; but with careful ethical reflection, you can
reduce the chaos, determine the essentials, and
choose the best course—even when that choice
is the least bad of a set of undesirable options.
Choose the Course of Action That Best
Represents Army Values
4-37. The last step in solving any problem is
making a decision and acting on it. Leaders are
paid to make decisions. As an Army leader,
you’re expected—by your bosses and your people—to make decisions that solve problems
without violating Army values.
4-38. As a values-based organization, the Army
uses expressed values—Army values—to provide its fundamental ethical framework. Army
values lay out the ethical standards expected of
soldiers and DA civilians. Taken together, Army
values and ethical decision making provide a
moral touchstone and a workable process that
enable you to make sound ethical decisions and
take right actions confidently.
4-39. The ethical aspects of some decisions are
more obvious that those of others. This example
contains an obvious ethical problem. The issues
will seldom be so clear-cut; however, as you
read the example, focus on the steps SGT Kirk
follows as he moves toward an ethical decision.
Follow the same steps when you seek to do the
right thing.

4-9

Direct Leadership Skills

The EFMB Test
SGT Kirk, who has already earned the Expert Field Medical Badge (EFMB), is assigned as a
grader on the division’s EFMB course. Sergeant Kirk’s squad leader, SSG Michaels, passes through
SGT Kirk’s station and fails the task. Just before SGT Kirk records the score, SSG Michaels pulls him
aside.
“I need my EFMB to get promoted,” SSG Michaels says. “You can really help me out here; it’s only
a couple of points anyway. No big deal. Show a little loyalty.”
SGT Kirk wants to help SSG Michaels, who’s been an excellent squad leader and who’s loyal to
his subordinates. SSG Michaels even spent two Saturdays helping SGT Kirk prepare for his
promotion board. If SGT Kirk wanted to make this easy on himself, he would say the choice is
between honesty and loyalty. Then he could choose loyalty, falsify the score, and send everyone
home happy. His life under SSG Michaels would probably be much easier too.
However, SGT Kirk would not have defined the problem correctly. (Remember, defining the
problem is often the hardest step in ethical reasoning.) SGT Kirk knows the choice isn’t between
loyalty and honesty. Loyalty doesn’t require that he lie. In fact, lying would be disloyal to the Army,
himself, and the soldiers who met the standard. To falsify the score would also be a violation of the
trust and confidence the Army placed in him when he was made an NCO and a grader. SGT Kirk
knows that loyalty to the Army and the NCO corps comes first and that giving SSG Michaels a passing
score would be granting the squad leader an unfair advantage. SGT Kirk knows it would be wrong to
be a coward in the face of this ethical choice, just as it would be wrong to be a coward in battle. And if
all that were not enough, when SGT Kirk imagines seeing the incident in the newspaper the next
morning—Trusted NCO Lies to Help Boss—he knows what he must do.

4-40. When SGT Kirk stands his ground and
does the right thing, it may cost him some pain
in the short run, but the entire Army benefits.
If he makes the wrong choice, he weakens the
Army. Whether or not the Army lives by its values isn’t just up to generals and colonels; it’s up
to each of the thousands of SGT Kirks, the
Army leaders who must make tough calls when
no one is watching, when the easy thing to do is
the wrong thing to do.
REFLECTIVE THINKING
4-41. Leader development doesn’t occur in a
vacuum. All leaders must be open to feedback
on their performance from multiple perspectives—seniors, peers, and subordinates.
But being open to feedback is only one part of
the equation. As a leader, you must also listen
to and use the feedback: you must be able to
reflect. Reflecting is the ability to take information, assess it, and apply it to behavior to explain why things did or did not go well. You can
then use the resulting explanations to improve
future behavior. Good leaders are always

4-10

striving to become better leaders. This means
you need consistently to assess your strengths
and weaknesses and reflect on what you can do
to sustain your strengths and correct your
weaknesses. To become a better leader, you
must be willing to change.
4-42. For reasons discussed fully in Chapter 5,
the Army often places a premium on doing—on
the third element of BE, KNOW, DO. All Army
leaders are busy dealing with what’s on their
plates and investing a lot of energy in accomplishing tasks. But how often do they take the
time to STOP and really THINK about what
they are doing? How often have you seen this
sign on a leader’s door: Do Not Disturb—Busy
Reflecting? Not often. Well, good leaders need
to take the time to think and reflect. Schedule
it; start really exercising your capacity to get
feedback. Then reflect on it and use it to improve. There’s nothing wrong with making mistakes, but there’s plenty wrong with not
learning from those mistakes. Reflection is the
means to that end.

TECHNICAL SKILLS
The first thing the senior NCOs had to do was to determine who wasn’t qualified with his
weapon, who didn’t have his protective mask properly tested and sealed—just all the basic
little things. Those things had to be determined real fast.

KNOWING EQUIPMENT
4-43. Technical skill is skill with things—equipment, weapons, systems—everything from the
towing winch on the front of a vehicle to the
computer that keeps track of corps personnel
actions. Direct leaders must know their

equipment and how to operate it. Figure 4-3
highlights direct leader technical skills. Technical manuals, training circulars, SOPs, and all
the other publications necessary for efficient,
effective performance explain specific skills
more completely.
4-44. Direct leaders are closer to their equipment than organizational and strategic leaders.
Thus, they have a greater need to know how it
works and how to use it. In addition, direct
leaders are the experts who are called upon to
solve problems with the equipment, the ones
who figure out how to make it work better, how
to apply it, how to fix it—even how to modify it.
Sergeants, junior officers, warrant officers,
wage grade employees, and journeymen are the
Army’s technical experts and best teachers.
Subordinates expect their first-line leaders to
know their equipment and be experts in all the
applicable technical skills.
OPERATING EQUIPMENT
4-45. Direct leaders know how to operate their
equipment and make sure their people do as
well. They set the example with a hands-on approach. When new equipment arrives, direct
leaders find out how it works, learn how to use
it themselves, and train their subordinates to
do the same.

Technical Skill into Combat Power
Technical skill gave the Army a decided advantage in the 1944 battle for France. For example,
the German Army had nothing like the US Army’s maintenance battalions. Such an organization was
a new idea, and a good one. These machine-age units were able to return almost half the
battle-damaged tanks to action within two days. The job was done by young men who had been
working at gas stations and body shops two years earlier and had brought their skill into the service of
their country. Instead of fixing cars, they replaced damaged tank tracks, welded patches on the
armor, and repaired engines. These combat supporters dragged tanks that were beyond repair to the
rear and stripped them for parts. The Germans just left theirs in place.

Army Leadership

4-11

Direct Leadership Skills

I felt we had to get back to the basic soldier
skills. The basics of setting up a training
schedule for every soldier every day. We had to
execute the standard field disciplines, such as
NCOs checking weapons cleanliness and
ensuring soldiers practiced personal hygiene
daily. Our job is to go out there and kill the
enemy. In order to do that, as Fehrenbach writes
in [his study of the Korean Conflict entitled]
This Kind of War, we have to have disciplined
teams; discipline brings pride to the unit.
Discipline coupled with tough, realistic training
is the key to high morale in units. Soldiers want
to belong to good outfits, and our job as leaders
is to give them the best outfit we can.

4-46. This company commander is talking
about two levels of skill. First is the individual
level: soldiers are trained with their equipment
and know how to do their jobs. Next is the collective level: leaders take these trained individuals and form them into teams. The result: a
whole greater than the sum of its parts, a team
that’s more than just a collection of trained individuals, an organization that’s capable of
much more than any one of its elements. (FM
25-101 discusses how to integrate individual,
collective, and leader training).

Figure 4-4. Direct Leader Skills—Tactical

4-12

4-47. Tactics is the art and science of employing available means to win battles and engagements. The science of tactics encompasses
capabilities, techniques, and procedures that
can be codified. The art of tactics includes the
creative and flexible array of means to accomplish assigned missions, decision making when
faced with an intelligent enemy, and the effects
of combat on soldiers. Together, FM 100-34,
FM 100-40, and branch-specific doctrinal
manuals capture the tactical skills that are essential to mastering both the science and the
art of tactics. Figure 4-4 highlights direct leader
tactical skills.
FIELDCRAFT
4-48. Fieldcraft consists of the skills soldiers
need to sustain themselves in the field. Proficiency in fieldcraft reduces the likelihood soldiers will become casualties. The requirement
to be able to do one’s job in a field environment
distinguishes the soldier’s profession from
most civilian occupations. Likewise, the

FM 22-100

Tactical Skills

requirement that Army leaders make sure
their soldiers take care of themselves and provide them with the means to do so is unique.
4-49. The Soldier’s Manual of Common Tasks
lists the individual skills all soldiers must
master to operate effectively in the field. Those
skills include everything from how to stay
healthy, to how to pitch a tent, to how to run a
heater. Some military occupational specialties
(MOS) require proficiency in additional
fieldcraft skills. Soldier’s Manuals for these
MOS list them.
4-50. Army leaders gain proficiency in fieldcraft
through schooling, study, and practice. Once
learned, few fieldcraft skills are difficult. However, they are easy to neglect during exercises,
when everyone knows that the exercise will end
at a specific time, sick and injured soldiers are
always evacuated, and the adversary isn’t using
real ammunition. During peacetime, it’s up to
Army leaders to enforce tactical discipline, to
make sure their soldiers practice the fieldcraft
skills that will keep them from becoming casualties—battle or nonbattle—during operations.
TACTICAL SKILLS AND TRAINING
4-51. Direct leaders are the Army’s primary tactical trainers, both for individuals and for
teams. Practicing tactical skills is often challenging. The best way to improve individual
and collective skills is to replicate operational
conditions. Unfortunately, Army leaders can’t

always get the whole unit out in the field to
practice maneuvers, so they make do with
training parts of it separately. Sometimes they
can’t get the people, the time, and the money all
together at the right time and the right place to
train the entire team. There are always training distracters. There will always be a hundred
excuses not to train together and one reason
why such training must occur: units fight as
they train. (FM 25-100 and FM 25-101 discuss
training principles and techniques.)
4-52. Unfortunately, the Army has been caught
unprepared for war more than once. In July
1950, American troops who had been on occupation duty in Japan were thrown into combat
when North Korean forces invaded South Korea. Ill-trained, ill-equipped, and out of shape,
they went into action and were overrun. However, that same conflict provides another example of how well things can go when a direct
leader has tactical skill, the ability to pull people and things together into a team. Near the
end of November 1950, American forces were
chasing the remnants of the broken North Korean People’s Army into the remote northern
corners of the Korean Peninsula. Two American units pushed all the way to the Yalu River,
which forms the boundary between North Korea and the People’s Republic of China. One
was the 17th Infantry Regiment. The other was
a task force commanded by a 24-year-old first
lieutenant named Joseph Kingston.

Task Force Kingston
1LT Joseph Kingston, a boyish-looking platoon leader in K Company, 3d Battalion, 32d Infantry,
was the lead element for his battalion’s move northward. The terrain was mountainous, the weather
bitterly cold—the temperature often below zero—and the cornered enemy still dangerous. 1LT
Kingston inched his way forward, with the battalion adding elements to his force. He had antiaircraft
jeeps mounted with quad .50 caliber machine guns, a tank, a squad (later a platoon) of engineers, and
an artillery forward observer. Some of these attachments were commanded by lieutenants who
outranked him, as did a captain who was the tactical air controller. But 1LT Kingston remained in
command, and battalion headquarters began referring to Task Force Kingston.
Bogged down in Yongsong-ni with casualties mounting, Task Force Kingston received
reinforcements that brought the number of men to nearly 300. Despite tough fighting, the force
continued to move northward. 1LT Kingston’s battalion commander wanted him to remain in
command, even though they sent several more officers who outranked 1LT Kingston. One of the

Army Leadership

4-13

Direct Leadership Skills

Task Force Kingston (continued)
attached units was a rifle company, commanded by a captain. But the arrangement worked, mostly
because 1LT Kingston himself was an able leader. Hit while leading an assault on one enemy
stronghold, he managed to toss a grenade just as a North Korean soldier shot him in the head. His
helmet, badly grazed, saved his life. His personal courage inspired his men and the soldiers from the
widely varied units who were under his control. Task Force Kingston was commanded by the soldier
who showed, by courage and personal example, that he could handle the job.

4-53. 1LT Kingston made the task force work
by applying skills at a level of responsibility far
above what was normal for a soldier of his rank
and experience. He knew how to shoot, move,
and communicate. He knew the fundamentals
of his profession. He employed the weapons
under his command and controlled a rather

unwieldy collection of combat assets. He
understood small-unit tactics and applied his
reasoning skills to make decisions. He fostered
a sense of teamwork, even in this collection of
units that had never trained together. Finally,
he set the example with personal courage.

SUMMARY
4-54. Direct leadership is face-to-face, first-line
leadership. It takes place in organizations
where subordinates are used to seeing their
leaders all the time: teams, squads, sections,
platoons, companies, and battalions. To be effective, direct leaders must master many interpersonal, conceptual, technical, and tactical
skills.
4-55. Direct leaders are first-line leaders. They
apply the conceptual skills of critical reasoning
and creative thinking to determine the best way
to accomplish the mission. They use ethical reasoning to make sure their choice is the right
thing to do, and they use reflective thinking to
assess and improve team performance, their
subordinates, and themselves. They employ the
interpersonal skills of communicating and supervising to get the job done. They develop their
people by mentoring and counseling and mold

4-14

them into cohesive teams by training them to
standard.
4-56. Direct leaders are the Army’s technical
experts and best teachers. Both their bosses
and their people expect them to know their
equipment and be experts in all the applicable
technical skills. On top of that, direct leaders
combine those skills with the tactical skills of
doctrine, fieldcraft, and training to accomplish
tactical missions.
4-57. Direct leaders use their competence to
foster discipline in their units and to develop
soldiers and DA civilians of character. They use
their mastery of equipment and doctrine to
train their subordinates to standard. They
create and sustain teams with the skill, trust,
and confidence to succeed—in peace and war.

FM 22-100

Chapter 5

Direct Leadership Actions
5-1. Preparing to be a leader doesn’t get the job
done; the test of your character and competence
comes when you act, when you DO those things
required of a leader.
5-2. The three broad leader actions that Chapters 1 and 2 introduced—influencing, operating, and improving—contain other activities.
As with the skills and attributes discussed previously, none of these exist alone. Most of what
you do as a leader is a mix of these actions. This
manual talks about them individually to explain them more clearly; in practice they’re often too closely connected to sort out.

5-3. Remember that your actions say more
about what kind of leader you are than
anything else. Your people watch you all the
time; you’re always on duty. And if there’s a
disconnect between what you say and how you
act, they’ll make up their minds about
you—and act accordingly—based on how you
act. It’s not good enough to talk the talk; you
have to walk the walk.

The most important influence you
have on your people is the example
you set.

5-4. Leadership is both art and science. It requires constant study, hard work, and frequent
practice. Since you’re dealing with people and
their emotions, dreams, and fears, it also calls
for imagination and a positive, upbeat approach.
5-5. Effective leaders act competently and confidently. Your attitude sets the tone for the entire unit, and you choose your attitude—day to
day, task to task, even minute to minute. Remember that optimism, a positive outlook, and
a sense of humor are infectious. This is especially true when you must make unpopular
decisions and face the challenge of bringing the
team on board.

Army Leadership

SUMMARY ..........................................5-27

5-1

Direct Leadership Actions

5-6. Figure 5-1 shows that influencing consists
of communicating, decision making and
motivating. As a leader, you should be asking
several questions: What’s happening? What
should be happening but isn’t? Why are these
things happening? Then ask yourself: How can I
get this team moving toward the goal? (Appendix
B lists leader performance indicators).
COMMUNICATING
You must talk to your soldiers…I don’t just
mean in formation or groups, but one-on-one.
Take time (at least 15 to 30 minutes a day) to
really talk to a soldier, one soldier a day.
Command Sergeant Major Daniel E. Wright

5-7. Leaders keep their subordinates informed
because doing so shows trust, because sharing
information can relieve stress, and because information allows subordinates to determine
what they need to do to accomplish the mission
when circumstances change. By informing
them of a decision—and, as much as possible,
the reasons for it—you show your subordinates
they’re important members of the team. Accurate information also relieves unnecessary
stress and helps keep rumors under control.
(Without an explanation for what’s happening,
your people will manufacture one—or several—of their own.) Finally, if something
should happen to you, the next leader in the
chain will be better prepared to take over and
accomplish the mission if everyone knows
what’s going on. Subordinates must understand your intent. In a tactical setting, leaders
must understand the intent of their commanders two levels up.
5-8. In other situations, leaders use a variety of
means to keep people informed, from face-toface talks to published memos and family newsletters. No matter what the method, keep two
things in mind:

· As a leader, you are responsible for making
·

sure your subordinates understand you.
Communication isn’t limited to your immediate superiors and subordinates.

5-9. The success or failure of any communication is the responsibility of the leader. If it

5-2

appears your subordinates don’t understand,
check to make sure you’ve made yourself clear.
In fact, even if you think your people understand, check anyway; ask for a back-brief.
5-10. Don’t assume that communication
begins or ends at the next level up or the next
level down. If you’re a team leader, listen carefully to what your supervisors, platoon sergeants, platoon leaders, and company commanders say. If you’re a platoon sergeant, pass
the word through your squad leaders or section
chiefs, but also watch and listen to the troops to
see if the information has made it all the way to
where it needs to go. Listen carefully at least
two levels up and two levels down.
5-11. In combat, subordinates may be out of
contact with their leaders. Sometimes the
plan falls apart because of something
unexpected—weather, terrain, enemy action.
Sometimes the leader may be killed or
wounded. In those situations, subordinates
who know the overall purpose of the mission
and the commander’s intent have the basic
information they need to carry on. And if the
leader has established a climate of trust, if
the leader has trained the subordinate leaders in how and why decisions are made, one of
these subordinates is more likely to step up
and take charge.
5-12. To prepare your subordinates for such
circumstances, create training situations where
they must act on their own with a minimum of
guidance—or with no guidance except a clear
understanding of the purpose. Follow up these
training situations with AARs so that subordinates learn what they did well, what they could
have done better, and they should do differently
next time.
5-13. Communicating also goes on from bottom
to top. Leaders find out what their people are
thinking, saying, and doing by using that most
important communication tool: listening. By
listening carefully, you can even hear those
messages behind what a person is actually saying, the equivalent of reading between the lines.
Practice “leadership by walking around.” Get
out and coach, listen, teach, and clarify; pass on

FM 22-100

Influencing Actions

what you learn to your superiors. They need to
know what’s going on to make good plans.
DECISION MAKING
A good leader must sometimes be stubborn.
Armed with the courage of his convictions, he
must often fight to defend them. When he has
come to a decision after thorough analysis—and
when he is sure he is right—he must stick to it
even to the point of stubbornness.
General of the Army, Omar N. Bradley
Address to the US Army Command and
General Staff College, May 1967

5-14. A problem is an existing condition or
situation in which what you want to happen is
different from what actually is happening.
Decision making is the process that begins to
change that situation. Thus, decision making is
knowing whether to decide, then when and
what to decide. It includes understanding the
consequences of your decisions.
5-15. Army leaders usually follow one of two
decision-making processes. Leaders at company
level and below follow the troop leading procedures (TLP). The TLP are designed to support
solving tactical problems. Leaders at battalion
level and above follow the military decision
making process (MDMP). The MDMP, which
FM 101-5 discusses, is designed for organizations with staffs. These established and proven
methodologies combine elements of the planning operating action to save time and achieve
parallel decision making and planning. Both
follow the problem solving steps discussed
below.
5-16. Every once in a while, you may come
across a decision that’s easy to make: yes or no,
right or left, on or off. As you gain experience as
a leader, some of the decisions you find difficult
now will become easier. But there will always
be difficult decisions that require imagination,
that require rigorous thinking and analysis, or
that require you to factor in your gut reaction.
Those are the tough decisions, the ones you’re
getting paid to make. As an experienced first
sergeant once said to a brand new company
commander, “We get paid the big bucks to

Army Leadership

make the hard calls.” The next several paragraphs explain the steps you should use to solve
a problem; then you’ll read about other factors
that affect how you make those hard calls and
the importance of setting priorities.
Problem Solving Steps
5-17. Identify the problem. Don’t be distracted by the symptoms of the problem; get at
its root cause. There may be more than one
thing contributing to a problem, and you may
run into a case where there are lots of contributing factors but no real “smoking gun.”
The issue you choose to address as the root
cause becomes the mission (or restated mission
for tactical problems). The mission must include a simple statement of who, what, when,
where, and why. In addition, it should include
your end state, how you want things to look
when the mission is complete.
5-18. Identify facts and assumptions. Get
whatever facts you can in the time you have.
Facts are statements of what you know about
the situation. Assumptions are statements of
what you believe about the situation but don’t
have facts to support. Make only assumptions
that are likely to be true and essential to generate alternatives. Some of the many sources of
facts include regulations, policies, and doctrinal
publications. Your organization’s mission,
goals, and objectives may also be a source.
Sources of assumptions can be personal experiences, members of the organization, subject
matter experts, or written observations. Analyze the facts and assumptions you identify to
determine the scope of the problem. (FM 101-5
contains more information on facts and assumptions.)
5-19. Generate alternatives. Alternatives
are ways to solve the problem. Develop more
than one possible alternative. Don’t be satisfied
with the first thing that comes into your mind.
That’s lazy thinking; the third or fourth or
twentieth alternative you come up with might
be the best one. If you have time and experienced subordinates, include them in this
step.

5-3

Direct Leadership Actions

5-20. Analyze the alternatives. Identify
intended and unintended consequences, resource or other constraints, and the advantages
and disadvantages of each alternative. Be sure to
consider allyouralternatives. Don’tprejudge the
situationbyfavoringanyonealternativeoverthe
others.
5-21. Compare the alternatives. Evaluate
each alternative for its probability of success
and its cost. Think past the immediate future.
How will this decision change things tomorrow?
Next week? Next year?
5-22. Make and execute your decision.
Prepare a leader’s plan of action, if necessary,
and put it in motion. (Planning, an operating
action, is covered later in this chapter. Appendix C discusses plans of action as part of
developmental counseling. Appendix D contains an example of a leader’s plan of action.)
5-23. Assess the results. Check constantly to
see how the execution of your plan of action is
going. Keep track of what happens. Adjust your
plan, if necessary. Learn from the experience so
you’ll be better equipped next time. Follow up
on results and make further adjustments as required.
Factors to Consider
5-24. All of this looks great on paper; and it’s
easy to talk about when things are calm, when
there’s plenty of time. But even when there
isn’t a great deal of time, you’ll come up with
the best solution if you follow this process to the
extent that time allows.
5-25. Even following these steps, you may find
that with some decisions you need to take into
account your knowledge, your intuition, and
your best judgment. Intuition tells you what
feels right; it comes from accumulated experience, often referred to as “gut feeling.”
However, don’t be fooled into relying only on
intuition, even if it has worked in the past. A
leader who says “Hey, I just do what feels right”

5-4

may be hiding a lack of competence or may just
be too lazy to do the homework needed to make
a reasoned, thought-out decision. Don’t let that
be you. Use your experience, listen to your instincts, but do your research as well. Get the
facts and generate alternatives. Analyze and
compare as many as time allows. Then make
your decision and act.
5-26. Remember also that any decision you
make must reflect Army values. Chapter 4 discusses ethical reasoning. Its steps match the
problem solving steps outlined here. Most problems are not ethical problems, but many have
ethical aspects. Taking leave for example, is a
right soldiers and DA civilians enjoy, but leaders must balance mission requirements with
their people’s desires and their own. Reconciling such issues may require ethical reasoning.
As a leader, your superiors and your people expect you to take ethical aspects into account
and make decisions that are right as well as
good.
Setting Priorities
5-27. Decisions are not often narrowly defined,
as in “Do I choose A or B?” Leaders make decisions when they establish priorities and determine what’s important, when they supervise,
when they choose someone for a job, when they
train.
5-28. As a leader, you must also set priorities. If
you give your subordinates a list of things to do
and say “They’re all important,” you may be
trying to say something about urgency. But the
message you actually send is “I can’t decide
which of these are most important, so I’ll just
lean on you and see what happens.”
5-29. Sometimes all courses of action may
appear equally good (or equally bad) and that
any decision will be equally right (or equally
wrong). Situations like that may tempt you to
sit on the fence, to make no decision and let
things work themselves out. Occasionally that
may be appropriate; remember that decision

FM 22-100

Influencing Actions

making involves judgment, knowing whether to
decide. More often, things left to themselves go
from bad to worse. In such situations, the decision you make may be less important than simply deciding to do something. Leaders must

have the personal courage to say which tasks
are more important than others. In the absence
of a clear priority, you must set one; not everything can be a top priority, and you can’t make
progress without making decisions.

Solving a Training Problem
A rifle platoon gets a new platoon leader and a new platoon sergeant within days of a poor
showing in the division’s military operations on urbanized terrain (MOUT) exercise. The new leaders
assume the platoon’s poor showing is a problem. Feedback from the evaluators is general and vague.
The platoon’s squad and fire team leaders are angry and not much help in assessing what went
wrong, so the new leaders begin investigating. In their fact-finding step they identify the following
facts: (1) The soldiers are out of shape and unable to complete some of the physical tasks. (2) The fire
team leaders don’t know MOUT tactics, and some of the squad leaders are also weak. (3) Third
Squad performed well, but didn’t help the other squads. (4) The soldiers didn’t have the right
equipment at the training site.
Pushing a bit further to get at the root causes of these problems, the new leaders uncover the
following: (1) Platoon PT emphasizes preparation for the APFT only. (2) Third Squad’s leaders know
MOUT techniques, and had even developed simple drills to help their soldiers learn, but because of
unhealthy competition encouraged by the previous leaders, Third Squad didn’t share the knowledge.
(3) The company supply sergeant has the equipment the soldiers needed, but because the platoon
had lost some equipment on the last field exercise, the supply sergeant didn’t let the platoon sign out
the equipment.
The new platoon leader and platoon sergeant set a goal of successfully meeting the exercise
standard in two months. To generate alternatives, they meet with the squad leaders and ask for
suggestions to improve training. They use all their available resources to develop solutions. Among
the things suggested was to shuffle some of the team leaders to break up Third Squad’s clique and
spread some of the tactical knowledge around. When squad leaders complained, the platoon
sergeant emphasized that they must think as a platoon, not just a collection of squads.
The platoon sergeant talks to the supply sergeant, who tells him the platoon’s previous leadership
had been lax about property accountability. Furthermore, the previous leaders didn’t want to bother
keeping track of equipment, so they often left it in garrison. The platoon sergeant teaches his squad
leaders how to keep track of equipment and says that, in the future, soldiers who lose equipment will
pay for it: “We wouldn’t leave our stuff behind in war, so we’re not going to do it in training.”
Building on Third Squad’s experience, the platoon leader works with the squad and fire team
leaders to come up with some simple drills for the platoon’s missions. He takes the leaders to the field
and practices the drills with them so they’ll be able to train their soldiers to the new standard.
The platoon sergeant also goes to the brigade’s fitness trainers and, with their help, develops a
PT program that emphasizes skills the soldiers need for their combat tasks. The new program
includes rope climbing, running with weapons and equipment, and road marches. Finally, the leaders
monitor how their plan is working. A few weeks before going through the course again, they decide to
eliminate one of the battle drills because the squad leaders suggested that it wasn’t necessary after
all.

5-30. The platoon leader and platoon sergeant
followed the problem solving steps you just read
about. Given a problem (poor performance),

Army Leadership

they identified the facts surrounding it (poor
PT practices, poor property accountability, and
unhealthy competition), developed a plan of

5-5

Direct Leadership Actions

action, and executed it. Where appropriate,
they analyzed and compared different alternatives (Third Squad’s drills). They included their
subordinates in the process, but had the moral
courage to make unpopular decisions (breaking
up the Third Squad clique). Will the platoon do
better the next time out? Probably, but before
then the new leaders will have to assess the results of their actions to make sure they’re accomplishing what the leaders want. There may
be other aspects of this problem that were not
apparent at first. And following this or any process doesn’t guarantee success. The process is
only a framework that helps you make a plan
and act. Success depends on your ability to apply your attributes and skills to influencing and
operating actions.
5-31. Army leaders also make decisions when
they evaluate subordinates, whether it’s with a
counseling statement, an evaluation report, or
even on-the-spot encouragement. At an in-ranks
inspection, a new squad leader takes a second
look at a soldier’s haircut—or lack of one. The
squad leader’s first reaction may be to ask, “Did
you get your haircut lately?” But that avoids the
problem. The soldier’s haircut is either to standard or not—the NCO must decide. The squad
leader either says—without apologizing or dancing around the subject—“You need a haircut” or
else says nothing. Either way, the decision communicates the leader’s standard. Looking a subordinate in the eye and making a necessary
correction is a direct leader hallmark.
MOTIVATING
A unit with a high esprit de corps can
accomplish its mission in spite of seemingly
insurmountable odds.
FM 22-10, 1951

5-32. Recall from Chapter 1 that motivation involves using word and example to give your subordinates the will to accomplish the mission.
Motivation grows out of people’s confidence in
themselves, their unit, and their leaders. This
confidence is born in hard, realistic training;
it’s nurtured by constant reinforcement and
through the kind of leadership—consistent,
hard, and fair—that promotes trust. Remember
that trust, like loyalty, is a gift your soldiers

5-6

give you only when you demonstrate that you
deserve it. Motivation also springs from the
person’s faith in the larger mission of the organization—a sense of being a part of the big
picture.
Empowering People
5-33. People want to be recognized for the work
they do and want to be empowered. You empower subordinates when you train them to do
a job, give them the necessary resources and
authority, get out of their way, and let them
work. Not only is this a tremendous statement
of the trust you have in your subordinates; it’s
one of the best ways to develop them as leaders.
Coach and counsel them, both when they succeed and when they fail.
Positive Reinforcement
5-34. Part of empowering subordinates is finding out their needs. Talk to your people: find
out what’s important to them, what they want
to accomplish, what their personal goals are.
Give them feedback that lets them know how
they’re doing. Listen carefully so that you know
what they mean, not just what they say. Use
their feedback when it makes sense, and if you
change something in the organization because
of a subordinate’s suggestion, let everyone
know where the good idea came from. Remember, there’s no limit to the amount of good you
can do as long as you don’t worry about who
gets the credit. Give the credit to those who deserve it and you’ll be amazed at the results.
5-35. You recognize subordinates when you
give them credit for the work they do, from a
pat on the back to a formal award or decoration.
Don’t underestimate the power of a few choice
words of praise when a person has done a good
job. Don’t hesitate to give out awards—commendations, letters, certificates—when appropriate. (Use good judgment, however. If you
give out a medal for every little thing, pretty
soon the award becomes meaningless. Give an
award for the wrong thing and you show you’re
out of touch.) Napoleon marveled at the motivational power of properly awarded ribbons and
medals. He once said that if he had enough ribbon, he could rule the world.

dations.
Choose a reward valued by the person
receiving it, one that appeals to the individual’s personal pride. This may be a locally approved award that’s more respected
than traditional DA awards.
Use the established system of awards (certificates, medals, letters of commendation,
driver and mechanic badges) when appropriate. These are recognized throughout
the Army; when a soldier goes to a new unit,
the reward will still be valuable.
Present the award at an appropriate ceremony. Emphasize its importance. Let others see how hard work is rewarded.
Give rewards promptly.
Praise only good work or honest effort. Giving praise too freely cheapens its effect.
Promote people who get the job done and
who influence others to do better work.
Recognize those who meet the standard and
improve their performance. A soldier who
works hard and raises his score on the
APFT deserves some recognition, even if
the soldier doesn’t achieve the maximum
score. Not everyone can be soldier of the
quarter.

5-37. Of course, not everyone is going to
perform to standard. In fact, some will require
punishment. Using punishment to motivate a
person away from an undesirable behavior is effective, but can be tricky. Sound judgment must
guide you when administering punishment.
Consider these guidelines:

·

· Before you punish a subordinate, make sure

·

·

the subordinate understands the reason for
the punishment. In most—although not
all—cases, you’ll want to try to change the
subordinate’s behavior by counseling or
retraining before resulting to punishment.
Consult your leader or supervisor before
you punish a subordinate. They’ll be aware
of policies you need to consider and may be

·

able to assist you in changing the subordinate’s behavior.
Avoid threatening a subordinate with punishment. Making a threat puts you in the
position of having to deliver on that threat.
In such a situation you may end up punishing because you said you would rather than
because the behavior merits punishment.
This undermines your standing as a leader.
Avoid mass punishment. Correctly identify
the problem, determine if an individual or
individuals are responsible, and use an
appropriate form of correction.
With an open mind and without prejudging,
listen to the subordinate’s side of the story.
Let the subordinate know that it’s the
behavior—not the individual—that is the
problem. “You let the team down” works;
“You’re a loser” sends the wrong message.
Since people tend to live up to their leader’s
expectations, tell them, “I know you can do
better than that. I expect you to do better
than that.”
Punish those who are able but unwilling to
perform. Retrain a person who’s unable to
complete a task.
Respond immediately to undesirable behavior. Investigate fully. Take prompt and prudent corrective action in accordance with
established legal or regulatory procedures.
Never humiliate a subordinate; avoid public
reprimand.
Ensure the person knows exactly what behavior got the person in trouble.
Make sure the punishment isn’t excessive
or unreasonable. It’s not only the severity of
punishment that keeps subordinates in line;
it’s the certainty that they can’t get away
with undesirable behavior.
Control your temper and hold no grudges.
Don’t let your personal feelings interfere;
whether you like or dislike someone has
nothing to do with good order and discipline.

5-38. If you were surprised to find a discussion
of punishment under the section on motivation, consider this: good leaders are always
on the lookout for opportunities to develop

subordinates, even the ones who are being punished. Your people—even the ones who cause
you problems—are still the most important resource you have. When a vehicle is broken, you

don’t throw it out; you fix it. If one of your people is performing poorly, don’t just get rid of the
person; try to help fix the problem.

Actions—Operating
5-39. You’re operating when you act to achieve
an immediate objective, when you’re working
to get today’s job done. Although FM 25-100 is
predominantly a training tool, its methodology
applies to a unit’s overall operational effectiveness. Because operating includes planning, preparing, executing, and assessing (see Figure
5-2), you can use the FM 25-100 principles as a
model for operations other than training.
Sometimes these elements are part of a cycle;
other times they happen simultaneously.
5-40. You’ll often find yourself influencing
after you’ve moved on to operating. In practice,
the nice, neat divisions in this manual are not
clear-cut; you often must handle multiple tasks
requiring different skills at the same time.
(Appendix B lists operating actions and some
indicators of effectiveness.)

5-8

5-41. In peacetime training, in actual
operations, and especially in combat, your job
is to help your organization function
effectively—accomplish the mission—in an
environment that can be chaotic. That begins
with a well thought-out plan and thorough
preparation. A well-trained organization
with a sound plan is much better prepared
than one without a plan. Planning ahead reduces confusion, builds subordinates’ confidence in themselves and the organization,
and helps ensure success with a minimum of
wasted effort—or in combat, the minimum
number of casualties. (FM 101-5 discusses
the different types of plans.)
5-42. A plan is a proposal for executing a command decision or project. Planning begins with
a mission, specified or implied. A specified mission comes from your boss or from higher headquarters. An implied mission results when the
leader, who may be you, sees something within
his area of responsibility that needs to be done
and, on his own initiative, develops a leader
plan of action. (Remember that a problem exists when you’re not satisfied with the way
things are or the direction they’re heading.) Either type of mission contains implied and specified tasks, actions that must be completed to
accomplish the mission. (FM 101-5 discusses
how the MDMP supports planning.)
Reverse Planning
5-43. When you begin with the goal in mind,
you often will use the reverse planning method.
Start with the question “Where do I want to
end up?” and work backward from there until
you reach “We are here right now.”
5-44. Along the way, determine the basics of
what’s required: who, what, when, where, and
why. You may also want to consider how to accomplish the task, although the “how” is

FM 22-100

Operating Actions

usually not included in a mission to a subordinate. As you plan, consider the amount of time
needed to coordinate and conduct each step.
For instance, a tank platoon sergeant whose
platoon has to spend part of a field exercise on
the firing range might have to arrange, among
other things, refueling at the range. No one explicitly said to refuel at the range, but the platoon sergeant knows what needs to happen.
The platoon sergeant must think through the
steps from the last to the first: (1) when the refueling must be complete, (2) how long the refueling will take, (3) how long it takes the
refueling unit to get set up, and finally (4) when
the refueling vehicles should report to the
range.
5-45. After you have figured out what must
happen on the way to the goal, put the tasks in
sequence, set priorities, and determine a schedule. Look at the steps in the order they will occur. Make sure events are in logical order and
you have allotted enough time for each one. As
always, a good leader asks for input from subordinates when time allows. Getting input not
only acts as a check on the your plan (you may
have overlooked something), but also gets your
people involved; involvement builds trust, selfconfidence, and the will to succeed.
Preparing
5-46. While
leaders
plan,
subordinates
prepare. Leaders can develop a plan while their
organization is preparing if they provide
advance notice of the task or mission and initial
guidance for preparation in a warning order.
(Warning orders are part of the TLP and
MDMP; however, any leader—uniformed or DA

civilian—can apply the principle of the warning
order by giving subordinates advance notice of
an impending requirement and how they’ll be
expected to contribute to it. FM 101-5 discusses
warning orders.) Based on this guidance, subordinates can draw ammunition, rehearse key actions, inspect equipment, conduct security
patrols, or begin movement while the leader
completes the plan. In the case of a nontactical
requirement, preparation may include making
sure the necessary facilities and other resources
are available to support it. In all cases, preparation includes coordinating with people and organizations that are involved or might be
affected by the operation or project. (TC 25-30
discusses preparing for company- and platoonlevel training).
5-47. Rehearsal is an important element of
preparation. Rehearsing key combat actions
lets subordinates see how things are supposed
to work and builds confidence in the plan for
both soldiers and leaders. Even a simple
walk-through helps them visualize who’s
supposed to be where and do what when.
Mobilization exercises provide a similar
function for DA civilians and reserve
component soldiers: they provide a chance to
understand and rehearse mobilization and
deployment support functions. Execution goes
more smoothly because everyone has a mental
picture of what’s supposed to happen.
Rehearsals help people remember their
responsibilities. They also help leaders see how
things might happen, what might go wrong,
how the plan needs to be changed, and what
things the leader didn’t think of. (FM 101-5
contains an in-depth discussion of rehearsals.)

An Implied Mission and Leader Plan of Action
Not all missions originate with higher headquarters; sometimes the leader sees what’s required
and, exercising initiative, develops a leader plan of action.
Suppose a platoon sergeant’s soldiers had trouble meeting minimum weapons qualification
requirements. Since everyone qualified, no one has said to work on marksmanship. But the platoon
sergeant knows the platoon made it through range week on sheer luck. The leader develops a training

Army Leadership

5-9

Direct Leadership Actions

An Implied Mission and Leader Plan of Action (continued)
plan to work on basic marksmanship, then goes to the platoon leader and presents it. Together the
two leaders figure out a way to make sure their soldiers get a chance to train, even with all the other
mission requirements. After they’ve talked it over, they bring in their subordinate leaders and involve
them in the planning process. The platoon sergeant keeps track of the progress and effectiveness of
the leader plan of action, making sure it accomplishes the intent and changing it when necessary.
Later, the platoon leader and platoon sergeant meet to assess the plan’s results and to decide if
further action is required.

5-48. Leader plans of action can be used to reinforce positive behavior, improve performance,
or even change an aspect of the organizational

climate. A leader plan of action may also be personal—as when the leader decides “I need to
improve my skills in this area.”

Brief Solutions, Not Problems
Leaders develop their subordinates by requiring those subordinates to plan. A lieutenant, new to
the battalion staff, ran into a problem getting all the resources the unit was going to need for an
upcoming deployment. The officer studied the problem, talked to the people involved, checked his
facts, and generally did a thorough analysis—of which he was very proud. Then he marched into the
battalion executive officer’s (XO’s) office and laid it all out in a masterly fashion. The XO looked up
from his desk and said, “Great. What are you going to do about it?”
The lieutenant was back in a half-hour with three possible solutions he had worked out with his
NCOs. From that day on, the officer never presented a problem to any boss without offering some
solutions as well. The lieutenant learned a useful technique from the XO. He learned it so well he
began using it with his soldiers and became a better coach and mentor because of it.
5-49. No matter what your position is, part of
your duty is making your boss’s job easier. Just
as you loyally provide resources and authority
for your subordinates to do their jobs, you leave
the boss free to do his. Ask only for decisions
that fall outside your scope of authority—not
those you want to avoid. Forward only problems you can’t fix—not those whose solutions
are just difficult. Ask for advice from others
with more experience or seek clarification when
you don’t understand what’s required. Do all
that and exercise disciplined initiative within
your boss’s intent. (Appendix A discusses delegation of authority.)
EXECUTING
Soldiers do what they are told to do. It’s
leadership that’s the key. Young men and
women join the Army; if they’re with competent,

5-10

confident, capable leaders they turn into good
soldiers.
Sergeant Major of the Army Robert E. Hall

5-50. Executing means acting to accomplish
the mission, moving to achieve the leader’s
goals as expressed in the leader’s vision—to
standard and on time—while taking care of
your people.
5-51. Execution, the payoff, is based on all the
work that has gone before. But planning and
preparation alone can’t guarantee success.
Things will go wrong. Large chunks of the plan
will go flying out the window. At times, it will
seem as if everything is working against you.
Then you must have the will to fight through,
keeping in mind your higher leaders’ intent and
the mission’s ultimate goal. You must adapt
and improvise.

FM 22-100

Operating Actions

5-52. In a tactical setting, all leaders must
know the intent of commanders two levels up.
During execution, position yourself to best lead
your people, initiate and control the action, get
others to follow the plan, react to changes, keep
your people focused, and work the team to accomplish the goal to standard. A well-trained
organization accomplishes the mission, even
when things go wrong.
5-53. Finally, leaders ensure they and their
subordinate leaders are doing the right jobs.
This goes hand in hand with empowerment. A
company commander doesn’t do a squad
leader’s job. A division chief doesn’t do a branch
chief’s job. A supervisor doesn’t do a team
leader’s job.
Maintaining Standards
5-54. The Army has established standards for
all military activities. Standards are formal, detailed instructions that can be stated, measured, and achieved. They provide a
performance baseline to evaluate how well a
specific task has been executed. You must
know, communicate and enforce standards. Explain the ones that apply to your organization
and give your subordinate leaders the authority
to enforce them. Then hold your subordinates
responsible for achieving them.
5-55. Army leaders don’t set the minimum
standards as goals. However, everything can’t
be a number one priority. As an Army leader,
you must exercise judgment concerning which
tasks are most important. Organizations are required to perform many tasks that are not
mission-related. While some of these are extremely important, others require only a minimum effort. Striving for excellence in every
area, regardless of how trivial, quickly works an
organization to death. On the other hand, the
fact that a task isn’t a first priority doesn’t excuse a sloppy performance. Professional soldiers accomplish all tasks to standard.
Competent leaders make sure the standard fits
the task’s importance.
Setting Goals
5-56. The leader’s ultimate goal—your
ultimate goal—is to train the organization to
succeed in its wartime mission. Your daily work

Army Leadership

includes setting intermediate goals to get the
organization ready. Involve your subordinates
in goal setting. This kind of cooperation fosters
trust and makes the best use of subordinates’
talents. When developing goals, consider these
points:

· Goals must be realistic, challenging, and at·
·
·

tainable.
Goals should lead to improved combat
readiness.
Subordinates ought to be involved in the
goal setting.
Leaders develop a plan of action to achieve
each goal.
ASSESSING

Schools and their training offer better ways to
do things, but only through experience are we
able to capitalize on this learning. The process of
profiting from mistakes becomes a milestone in
learning to become a more efficient soldier.
Former Sergeant Major of the Army
William G. Bainbridge

5-57. Setting goals and maintaining standards
are central to assessing mission accomplishment. Whenever you talk about accomplishing the mission, always include the phrase
“to standard.” When you set goals for your
subordinates, make sure they know what the
standards are. To use a simple example, the
goal might be “All unit members will pass the
APFT.” The APFT standard tells you, for each
exercise, how many repetitions are required in
how much time, as well as describing a proper
way to do the exercise.
5-58. Also central to assessing is spot checking.
Army leaders check things: people, performance, equipment, resources. They check things
to ensure the organization is meeting standards
and moving toward the goals the leader has established. Look closely; do it early and often; do
it both before and after the fact. Praise good
performance and figure out how to fix poor performance. Watch good first sergeants or command sergeants major as they go through the
mess line at the organizational dining facility.
They pick up the silverware and run their fingers over it—almost unconsciously—checking

and correct their subordinates. They don’t
waste time; they’re always on duty.

good leaders listen closely. (FM 25-101 and TC
25-20 discuss how to prepare, conduct, and follow up after AARs.)

5-59. Some assessments you make yourself.
For others, you may want to involve subordinates. Involving subordinates in assessments and obtaining straightforward feedback
from them become more important as your
span of authority increases. Two techniques
that involve your subordinates in assessing are
in-process reviews (IPRs) and after-action
reviews (AARs).

5-63. Leaders base reviews on accurate
observations and correct recording of those observations. If you’re evaluating a ten-day field
exercise, take good notes because you won’t remember everything. Look at things in a systematic way; get out and see things firsthand. Don’t
neglect tasks that call for subjective judgment:
evaluate unit cohesion, discipline, and morale.
(FM 25-100 and FM 25-101 discuss training assessment.)

In-Process Reviews
5-60. Successful assessment begins with forming a picture of the organization’s performance
early. Anticipate which areas the organization
might have trouble in; that way you know
which areas to watch closely. Once the organization begins the mission, use IPRs to evaluate
performance and give feedback. Think of an
IPR as a checkpoint on the way to mission
accomplishment.
5-61. Say you tell your driver to take you to division headquarters. If you recognize the landmarks, you decide your driver knows the way
and probably say nothing. If you don’t recognize the landmarks, you might ask where you
are. And if you determine that the driver is lost
or has made a wrong turn, you give instructions
to get back to where you need to be. In more
complex missions, IPRs give leaders and subordinates a chance to talk about what’s going on.
They can catch problems early and take steps to
correct or avoid them.
After-Action Reviews
5-62. AARs fill a similar role at the end of the
mission. Army leaders use AARs as opportunities to develop subordinates. During an
AAR, give subordinates a chance to talk about
how they saw things. Teach them how to look
past a problem’s symptoms to its root cause.
Teach them how to give constructive, useful
feedback. (“Here’s what we did well; here’s
what we can do better.”) When subordinates
share in identifying reasons for success and failure, they become owners of a stake in how
things get done. AARs also give you a chance to
hear what’s on your subordinates’ minds—and

5-12

Initial Leader Assessments
5-64. Leaders often conduct an initial
assessment before they take over a new position. How competent are your new subordinates? What’s expected of you in your new job?
Watch how people operate; this will give you
clues about the organizational climate.
(Remember SSG Withers and the vehicle inspection in Chapter 3?) Review the organization’s SOP and any regulations that apply.
Meet with the outgoing leader and listen to his
assessment. (But don’t take it as the absolute
truth; everyone sees things through filters.) Review status reports and recent inspection results. Identify the key people outside the
organization whose help you’ll need to be
successful. However, remember that your initial impression may be off-base. After you’ve
been in the position for a while, take the necessary time to make an in-depth assessment.
5-65. And in the midst of all this checking and
rechecking, don’t forget to take a look at
yourself. What kind of leader are you? Do you
oversupervise? Undersupervise? How can you
improve? What’s your plan for working on your
weak areas? What’s the best way to make use of
your strengths? Get feedback on yourself from
as many sources as possible: your boss, your
peers, even your subordinates. As Chapter 1
said in the discussion of character, make sure
your own house is in order.
Assessment of Subordinates
5-66. Good leaders provide straightforward
feedback to subordinates. Tell them where you
see their strengths; let them know where they

FM 22-100

Operating Actions

can improve. Have them come up with a plan of
action for self-improvement; offer your help.
Leader assessment should be a positive experience that your subordinates see as a chance for
them to improve. They should see it as an opportunity to tap into your experience and
knowledge for their benefit.

Leader Assessments and Plans of Action

must—

tion to improve performance.

IMPROVING ACTIONS
How can you know if you’ve made a difference? Sometimes—rarely—the results are instant.
Usually it takes much longer. You may see a soldier again as a seasoned NCO; you may get a
call or a letter or see a name in the Army Times. In most cases, you will never be sure how well
you succeeded, but don’t let that stop you.
Command Sergeant Major John D. Woodyard, 1993

5-69. Improving actions are things leaders do to
leave their organizations better than they
found them. Improving actions fall into the
categories highlighted in Figure 5-3: developing, building, and learning.
5-70. Developing refers to people: you improve
your organization and the Army as an institution when you develop your subordinates.
5-71. Building refers to team building: as a direct leader, you improve your organization by
building strong, cohesive teams that perform to
standard, even in your absence.

Army Leadership

5-72. Learning refers to you, your subordinates,
and your organization as a whole. As a leader,
you must model self-development for your people; you must constantly be learning. In addition, you must also encourage your subordinates
to learn and reward their self-development efforts. Finally, you must establish an organizational climate that rewards collective learning
and act to ensure your organization learns from
its experiences.

5-75. The Army school system provides formal
education and training for job-related and leadership skills. The American public education
system is progressive; that is, children attend
primary school before middle school or junior
high and then go on to high school. Likewise,
the Army school system is progressive. The
main difference is that you can expect to go out
and use your skills in an assignment before being considered for the next level of schooling.
Institutional training is critical in developing
leaders and preparing them for increased positions of responsibility throughout the Army.

LEADER
DEVELOPMENT
TRAINED & READY

Former Sergeant Major of the Army Glenn E. Morrell

5-73. In the Army, developing means developing people. Your subordinates are the leaders of
tomorrow’s Army. You have a responsibility to
train them, to be the kind of leader they deserve
so that they’ll see how leading is done. It’s your
duty to invest the time and energy it takes to
help them reach their fullest potential. The
driving principle behind Army leader development is that leaders must be prepared before
assuming leadership positions; they must be
competent and confident in their abilities. This
principle applies to all ranks and levels, to soldiers and DA civilians, and to both the active
and reserve components.
5-74. As Figure 5-4 shows, a trained and ready
Army rests on effective leader development. In
turn, leader development rests on a foundation
of training and education, expectations and
standards, and values and ethics. This foundation supports the three leader development

training and previous assignments. You gain
and expand your experience base by performing a wide range of duties and tasks under a variety of frequently changing conditions and
situations. Operational assignments provide a

Improving Actions

powerful resource for leader development—an
opportunity to learn by doing.
Self-Development
5-77. Self-development is a process you should
use to enhance previously acquired skills,
knowledge, and experience. Its goal is to
increase your readiness and potential for positions of greater responsibility. Effective selfdevelopment focuses on aspects of your character, knowledge, and capabilities that you believe need developing or improving. You can use
the dimensions of the Army leadership framework to help you determine what areas to work
on. Self-development is continuous: it takes
place during institutional training and operational assignments.
5-78. Self-development is a joint effort involving
you, your first-line leader, and your commander.
Commanders establish and monitor selfdevelopment programs for their organizations.
You and your first-line leader together establish
goals to meet your individual needs and plan the
actions you must take to meet them. You do this
as part of developmental counseling, which is
discussed below and in Appendix C. Finally, you
must execute your plan of action. If you have subordinates, you monitor how well they’re acting
on their plans of action. You can’t execute their
plans for them, but you can give them advice,
encouragement, and—when necessary and mission permits—time.
5-79. Self-development for junior personnel is
very structured and generally narrow in focus.
The focus broadens as individuals learn their
strengths and weaknesses, determine their individual needs, and become more independent.
Everyone’s knowledge and perspective increases with age, experience, institutional
training, and operational assignments. Specific,
goal-oriented self-development actions can accelerate and broaden a person’s skills and
knowledge. As a member of the Army, you’re
obligated to develop your abilities to the greatest extent possible. As an Army leader, you’re
responsible to assist your subordinates in their
self-development.

learning. They seek to educate and train
themselves beyond what’s offered in formal
schooling or even in their duty assignments.
Leaders look for educational opportunities to
prepare themselves for their next job and
future responsibilities. Look for Army off-duty
education that interests you and will give you
useful skills. Seek civilian education to broaden
your outlook on life. Look for things to read
that will develop your mind and help you build
skills. Challenge yourself and apply the same
initiative here as you do in your day-to-day
duties.
5-81. Remember that Army leaders challenge
themselves and take advantage of work done by
others in such fields as leadership and military
history as well as in their off-duty areas of interest. In the leadership area, you can begin with
some of the books listed in the bibliography or
go to any bookstore or library. You’ll find hundreds of titles under the heading of leadership.
The libraries of your post, nearby civilian communities, and colleges contain works on these
topics. In addition, the Internet can also be a
useful place for obtaining information on some
areas. However, be careful. Some books contain
more reliable and useful information than others; the same is true of Internet sites.
5-82. Figure 5-4 also shows that actions, skills,
and attributes form the foundation of success in
operational assignments. This is where you, the
leader, fit into Army leader development. As a
leader, you help your subordinates internalize
Army values. You also assist them in developing
the individual attributes, learning the skills,
and mastering the actions required to become
leaders of character and competence themselves. You do this through the action of
mentoring.

Direct Leadership Actions

Mentoring (in the Army) is the proactive development of each subordinate through observing,
assessing, coaching, teaching, developmental
counseling, and evaluating that results in people
being treated with fairness and equal opportunity. Mentoring is an inclusive process (not an
exclusive one) for everyone under a leader’s
charge.

5-83. Mentoring is totally inclusive, real-life
leader development for every subordinate.
Because leaders don’t know which of their
subordinates today will be the most significant
contributors and leaders in the future, they
strive to provide all their subordinates with the
knowledge and skills necessary to become the
best they can be—for the Army and for
themselves.
5-84. Mentoring begins with the leader setting
the right example. As an Army leader, you mentor people every day in a positive or negative
way, depending on how you live Army values
and perform leader actions. Mentoring shows
your subordinates a mature example of values,
attributes, and skills in action. It encourages
them to develop their own character and leader
attributes accordingly.
5-85. Mentoring links operating leader actions
to improving leader actions. When you mentor,
you take the observing, assessing, and evaluating you do when you operate and apply these actions to developing individual subordinates.
Mentoring techniques include teaching, developmental counseling, and coaching.
Teaching gives knowledge or provides skills
to others, causing them to learn by example
or experience.
5-86. Teaching is passing on knowledge and
skills to subordinates. It’s a primary task for
first-line leaders. Teaching focuses primarily on
technical and tactical skills. Developmental
counseling
is
better
for
improving
interpersonal and conceptual skills. Technical

5-16

competence is critical to effective teaching. In
order to develop subordinates, you must be able
to demonstrate the technical and tactical skills
you expect them to perform; otherwise they
won’t listen to you.
5-87. To be an Army leader, you must be a
teacher. You give your subordinates knowledge
and skills all the time, whether in formal, classroom settings or through your example. To be
an effective teacher, you must first be professionally competent; then you must create conditions in which your subordinates can learn.
Soldiers learn to be good leaders from good
leaders.
Former Sergeant Major of the Army Richard A. Kidd
5-88. The measure of how well you teach is how
well your people learn. In most cases, your people will learn more by performing a skill than
they will by watching you do it or by hearing
you talk about how to do it. However, it’s up to
you to choose the teaching method that best fits
the material. To make this choice, you need to
understand the different ways people learn.
People learn—
· Through the example of others (observing).
· By forming a picture in their minds of what
they’re trying to learn (thinking).
· By absorbing information (thinking).
· Through practice (hands-on experience).
5-89. Teaching is a complex art, one that you
must learn in addition to the competencies you
seek to teach. Just because you can pull the engine out of a tank doesn’t mean you would be
any good at teaching other people to do it.
There are techniques and methods involved in
teaching that have nothing to do with how good
you are on the job; you must know both the
skills related to the subject and another set of
teaching skills. As an Army leader, you must
develop these teaching skills as well. A subject
matter expert who has acquired technical
knowledge but is unable to teach that knowledge to others isn’t improving the organization
or the Army. (FM 25-101 addresses these and
other areas related to conducting training.)

FM 22-100

Improving Actions

Developmental Counseling is
subordinate-centered communication that
produces a plan outlining actions necessary
for subordinates to achieve individual or
organizational goals.
5-90. Developmental counseling is central to
leader development. It’s the means by which
you prepare your subordinates of today to be
the leaders of tomorrow. (Appendix C contains
more details on developmental counseling.)
5-91. Developmental counseling isn’t a time for
war stories or for tales of how things were done
way back when. It should focus on today’s performance and problems and tomorrow’s plans
and solutions. Effective developmental counseling is centered on the subordinate, who is actively involved—listening, asking for more
feedback, seeking elaboration of what the counselor has to say.
5-92. Developmental counseling isn’t an
occasional event that you do when you feel like
it. It needs to be part of your program to develop
your subordinates. It requires you to use all your
counseling tools and skills. This means using
counseling requirements such as those prescribed in the NCO Evaluation Reporting System (NCOERS), Officer Evaluation Reporting
System (OERS), and Total Army Performance
Evaluation System (TAPES, which is used to
evaluate DA civilians) as more than paper drills.
It means face-to-face counseling of individuals
you rate. But more important, it means making
time throughout the rating period to discuss performance objectives and provide meaningful assessments and feedback. No evaluation
report—positive or negative—should be a surprise. A consistent developmental counseling
program ensures your people know where they
stand and what they should be doing to improve
their performance and develop themselves.
Your program should include all your people,
not just the ones you think have the most
potential. (The bibliography lists the evaluation
and support forms prescribed by the OERS,
NCOERS, and TAPES. Appendix C discusses

Army Leadership

how to use support forms to assist you with developmental counseling.)
5-93. New direct leaders are sometimes
uncomfortable confronting a subordinate who
isn’t performing to standard. However, remember that counseling isn’t about how comfortable
or uncomfortable you are; counseling is about
correcting the performance or developing the
character of a subordinate. Therefore, be honest and frank with your subordinates during developmental counseling. If you let your people
get away with substandard behavior because
you want them to like you or because you’re
afraid to make a hard call, you’re sacrificing
Army standards for your personal wellbeing—and you’re not developing your
subordinates.
5-94. This manual has emphasized throughout
the importance of the example that you, as an
Army leader, set for your subordinates. Your
people look to you to see what kind of leader
they want to be. The example you set in
counseling is especially important. Army leaders at every level must ensure their subordinate
leaders use counseling to develop their own
subordinates. Setting the example is a powerful
leadership tool: if you counsel your subordinates, your subordinate leaders will counsel
theirs as well. The way you counsel is the way
they’ll counsel. Your people copy your behavior.
The significance of your position as a role model
can’t be understated. It’s a powerful teaching
tool, for developmental counseling as well as
other behaviors.
5-95. Although you’re responsible for developing your subordinates, no leader can be all
things to all people. In addition, the Army is already culturally diverse and is becoming increasingly technologically complex. In this
environment, some of your subordinates may
seek advice and counsel from informal relationships in addition to their leadership chain. Such
relationships can be particularly important for
women, minorities, and those in low-density
specialties who have relatively few role models
nearby.
5-96. This situation in no way relieves you, the
leader, of any of your responsibilities regarding
caring for and developing your people. Rather,

5-17

Direct Leadership Actions

being sensitive to your subordinates’ professional development and cultural needs is part of
the cultural awareness leader attribute. As an
Army leader, you must know your people and
take advantage of every resource available to
help your subordinates develop as leaders. This
includes other leaders who have skills or attributes different from your own.

Coaching involves a leader’s assessing
performance based on observations,
helping the subordinate develop an
effective plan of action to sustain strengths
and overcome weaknesses, and supporting
the subordinate and the plan.

5-97. You can consider coaching to be both an
operating and an improving leader action. It’s
less formal than teaching. When you’re dealing
with individuals, coaching is a form of specific
instance counseling (which Appendix C discusses). When you’re dealing with all or part of
a team, it’s generally associated with AARs
(which you read about earlier in this chapter).
5-98. Coaching follows naturally from the
assessing leader action. As you observe your
subordinates at work, you’ll see them perform
some tasks to standard and some not to
standard. Some of their plans will work; some
won’t. Your subordinates know when you’re
watching them. They expect you to tell them
what they need to do to meet the standard, improve the team’s performance, or develop themselves. You provide this sort of feedback
through coaching. And don’t limit your coaching to formal sessions. Use every opportunity to
teach, counsel or coach from quarterly training
briefings to AARs. Teaching moments and
coaching opportunities occur all the time when
you concentrate on developing leaders.
Mentoring and Developing Tomorrow’s
Army
5-99. Mentoring is demanding business, but
the future of the Army depends on the trained
and effective leaders whom you leave behind.
Sometimes it requires you to set priorities, to

5-18

balance short-term readiness with long-term
leader development. The commitment to mentoring future leaders may require you to take
risks. It requires you to give subordinates the
opportunity to learn and develop themselves
while using your experience to guide them
without micromanaging. Mentoring will lead
your subordinates to successes that build their
confidence and skills for the future.
5-100. Mentoring isn’t something new for the
Army. Past successes and failures can often be
traced to how seriously those in charge took the
challenge of developing future leaders. As you
consider the rapid pace of change in today’s
world, it’s critical that you take the time to develop leaders capable of responding to that
change. The success of the next generation of
Army leaders depends on how well you accept
the responsibility of mentoring your subordinates. Competent and confident leaders trained
to meet tomorrow’s challenges and fight and
win future conflicts will be your legacy.
5-101. As you assume positions of greater
responsibility, as the number of people for
whom you are responsible increases, you need
to do even more to develop your subordinates.
More, in this case, means establishing a leader
development program for your organization. It
also means encouraging your subordinates to
take actions to develop themselves personally
and professionally. In addition, you may have to
provide time for them to pursue selfdevelopment. (FM 25-101 discusses leader
development programs.)

What have YOU done TODAY to develop
the leaders of tomorrow’s Army?

BUILDING
Building Teams
5-102. You’ve heard—no doubt countless
times—that the Army is a team. Just how important is it that people have a sense of the
team? Very important. The national cause, the
purpose of the mission, and all the larger concerns may not be visible from the battlefield.

FM 22-100

Improving Actions

Regardless of other issues, soldiers perform for
the other people in the squad or section, for others in the team or crew, for the person on their
right or left. This is a fundamental truth: soldiers perform because they don’t want to let
their buddies down.
5-103. If the leaders of the small teams that
make up the Army are competent, and if their
members trust one another, those teams and
the larger team of teams will hang together and
get the job done. People who belong to a successful team look at nearly everything in a positive light; their winners’ attitudes are
infectious, and they see problems as challenges
rather than obstacles. Additionally, a cohesive

team accomplishes the mission much more efficiently than a group of individuals. Just as a
football team practices to win on the gridiron,
so must a team of soldiers practice to be effective on the battlefield.
5-104. Training together builds collective competence; trust is a product of that competence.
Subordinates learn to trust their leaders if the
leaders know how to do their jobs and act consistently—if they say what they mean and
mean what they say. Trust also springs from
the collective competence of the team. As the
team becomes more experienced and enjoys
more successes, it becomes more cohesive.

Trust Earned
In a 1976 interview, Congressman Hamilton Fish of New York told of his experiences as a white
officer with the 369th Infantry Regiment, an all-black unit in the segregated Army of 1917. Fish knew
that his unit would function only if his soldiers trusted him; his soldiers, all of whom had volunteered for
combat duty, deserved nothing less than a trustworthy leader. When a white regiment threatened to
attack the black soldiers in training camp, Fish, his pistol drawn, alerted the leaders of that regiment
and headed off a disaster.
“There was one thing they wanted above all from a white officer,” [Fish recalled in an interview
nearly 60 years later] “and that was fair treatment. You see, even in New York City [home of most of
his soldiers] they really did not get a square deal most of the time. But if they felt you were on the level
with them, they would go all out for you. And they seemed to have a sixth sense in realizing just how
you felt. I sincerely wanted to lead them as real soldiers, and they knew it.”
5-105. Developing teams takes hard work,
patience, and quite a bit of interpersonal skill
on the part of the leader, but it’s a worthwhile
investment. Good teams get the job done. People who are part of a good team complete the
mission on time with the resources given them
and a minimum of wasted effort; in combat,
good teams are the most effective and take the
fewest casualties.
5-106. Good teams—

Work together to accomplish the mission.
Execute tasks thoroughly and quickly.
Meet or exceed the standard.
Thrive on demanding challenges.
Learn from their experiences and are proud
of their accomplishments.

Army Leadership

5-107. The Army is a team that includes members who are not soldiers but whose contributions are essential to mission success. The
contributions made by almost 1,600 DA civilians in the Persian Gulf region were all but lost
in the celebrations surrounding the military
victory against Iraq and the homecoming celebration for the soldiers that followed. However,
one safety specialist noted that these deployed
DA civilians recognized the need for a team
effort:
Patriotism was their drawing force for being
there.…We were part of the team supporting our
soldiers! The focus is where it should be—on the
military. They’re here to do the job; we’re here to
help them.

5-19

Direct Leadership Actions

5-108. People will do the most extraordinary
things for their buddies. It’s your job as an
Army leader to pull each member into the team
because you may someday ask that person for
extraordinary effort. Team building involves
applying interpersonal leader skills that transform individuals into productive teams. If
you’ve done your work, the team member won’t
let you down.
5-109. Within a larger team, smaller teams
may be at different stages of development. For
instance, members of First Squad may be used
to working together. They trust one another
and get the job done—usually exceeding the
standard—with no wasted motion. Second
Squad in the same platoon just received three
new soldiers and a team leader from another
company. As a team, Second Squad is less mature; it will take them some time to get up to the
level of First Squad. New team members have
to learn how things work: they have to be
brought on board and made to feel members of
the team; they must learn the standards and
the climate of their new unit; they’ll have to
demonstrate some competence before other
members really accept them; and finally, they
must practice working together. Leaders, who
must oversee all this, are better equipped if
they know what to expect. Make use of the information on the next few pages; learn what to
look for—and stay flexible.
5-110. Figure 5-5 lists things you must do to
pull a team together, get it going in the right direction, and keep it moving. And that list only
hints at the work that lies ahead as you get
your team to work together. Your subordinates
must know—must truly believe—that they’re a
part of the team, that their contribution is important and valued. They must know that
you’ll train them and listen to them. They
don’t want you to let them get away with
shoddy work or half-baked efforts; there’s no
pride in loafing. You must constantly observe,
counsel, develop, listen; you must be every bit
the team player you want your subordinates to
be—and more.

series of developmental stages: formation,
enrichment, and sustainment. This discussion
may make the process seem more orderly than
it actually is; as with so many things leaders do,
the reality is more complicated than the explanation. Each team develops differently: the
boundaries between stages are not hard and
fast. As a leader, you must be sensitive to the
characteristics of the team you’re building and
of its individual members—your people. Compare the characteristics of your team with the
team building stage descriptions. The information that results can help you determine what
to expect of your team and what you need to do
to improve its capabilities.
Stages of Team Building
5-112. Teams, like individuals, have different
personalities. As with individuals, the leader’s
job isn’t to make teams that are clones of one
another; the job is to make best use of the peculiar talents of the team, maximize the potential
of the unit climate, and motivate aggressive
execution.
5-113. Formation stage. Teams work best
when new members are brought on board
quickly, when they’re made to feel a part of the
team. The two steps—reception and orientation—are dramatically different in peace and
war. In combat, this sponsorship process can literally mean life or death to new members and to
the team.
5-114. Reception is the leader’s welcome: the
orientation begins with meeting other team
members, learning the layout of the workplace,
learning the schedule and other requirements,
and generally getting to know the lay of the
land. In combat, leaders may not have time to
spend with new members. In this case, new
arrivals are often assigned a buddy who will
help them get oriented and keep them out of
trouble until they learn their way around.
Whatever technique you use, your soldiers
should never encounter a situation similar to
the one in the next example.

5-111. Teams don’t come together by accident;
leaders must build and guide them through a

Replacements in the ETO
Most historians writing about World War II agree that the replacement system that fed new
soldiers into the line units was seriously flawed, especially in the ETO, and did tremendous harm to
the soldiers and the Army. Troops fresh from stateside posts were shuffled about in tent cities where
they were just numbers. 1LT George Wilson, an infantry company commander who received one
hundred replacements on December 29, 1944, in the midst of the Battle of the Bulge, remembers the
results: “We discovered that these men had been on a rifle range only once; they had never thrown a
grenade or fired a bazooka [antitank rocket], mortar or machine gun.”
PVT Morris Dunn, another soldier who ended up with the 84th Division after weeks in a
replacement depot recalls how the new soldiers felt: “We were just numbers, we didn’t know anybody,
and I’ve never felt so alone and miserable and helpless in my entire life—we’d been herded around
like cattle at roundup time.…On the ride to the front it was cold and raining with the artillery fire louder
every mile, and finally we were dumped out in the middle of a heavily damaged town.”
5-115. In combat, Army leaders have countless
things to worry about; the mental state of new
arrivals might seem low on the list. But if those
soldiers can’t fight, the unit will suffer needless
casualties and may fail to complete the mission.
5-116. Discipline and shared hardship pull people together in powerful ways. SGT Alvin C.
York, who won the Medal of Honor in an action
you’ll read about later in this chapter, talked
about cohesion this way:
War brings out the worst in you. It turns you into
a mad, fighting animal, but it also brings out
something else, something I just don’t know
how to describe, a sort of tenderness and love for
the fellow fighting with you.

5-117. However, the emotions SGT York
mentions don’t emerge automatically in combat. One way to ensure cohesion is to build it
during peacetime. Team building begins with
receiving new members; you know how important first impressions are when you meet someone new. The same thing is true of teams; the
new member’s reception and orientation creates that crucial first impression that colors the
person’s opinion of the team for a long time. A
good experience joining the organization will
make it easier for the new member to fit in and
contribute. Even in peacetime, the way a person is received into an organization can have
long-lasting effects—good or bad—on the individual and the team. (Appendix C discusses reception and integration counseling.)

Reception on Christmas Eve
An assistant division commander of the 25th Infantry Division told this story as part of his farewell
speech:
“I ran across some new soldiers and asked them about their arrival on the island [of Oahu]. They
said they got in on Christmas Eve, and I thought to myself, ‘Can’t we do a better job when we ship
these kids out, so they’re not sitting in some airport on their first big holiday away from home?’ I mean,
I really felt sorry for them. So I said, ‘Must have been pretty lonesome sitting in a new barracks where
you didn’t know anyone.’ And one of them said, ‘No, sir. We weren’t there a half-hour before the CQ
[charge of quarters] came up and told us to get into class B’s and be standing out front of the company
in 15 minutes. Then this civilian drives up, a teenager, and the CQ orders us into the car. Turns out the
kid was the first sergeant’s son; his father had sent him over to police up anybody who was hanging
around the barracks. We went over to the first sergeant’s house to a big luau [party] with his family and
a bunch of their neighbors and friends.’

Reception on Christmas Eve (continued)
“My guess is that those soldiers will not only do anything and everything that first sergeant wants,
but they are going to tell anyone who will listen that they belong to the best outfit in the Army.”

5-118. Enrichment stage. New teams and
new team members gradually move from
questioning everything to trusting themselves,
their peers, and their leaders. Leaders earn that
trust by listening, following up on what they
hear, establishing clear lines of authority, and
setting standards. By far the most important
thing a leader does to strengthen the team is
training. Training takes a group of individuals
and molds them into a team while preparing
them to accomplish their missions. Training occurs during all three team building stages, but
is particularly important during enrichment;
it’s at this point that the team is building
collective proficiency.
5-119. Sustainment stage. When a team
reaches this stage, its members think of the
team as “their team.” They own it, have pride
in it, and want the team to succeed. At this
stage, team members will do what needs to be
done without being told. Every new mission
gives the leader a chance to make the bonds
even stronger, to challenge the team to reach
for new heights. The leader develops his
subordinates because they’re tomorrow’s
team leaders. He continues to train the team
so that it maintains proficiency in the collective and individual tasks it must perform to
accomplish its missions. Finally, the leader
works to keep the team going in spite of the
stresses and losses of combat.
Building the Ethical Climate
5-120. As an Army leader, you are the ethical
standard bearer for your organization. You’re
responsible for building an ethical climate that
demands and rewards behavior consistent with
Army values. The primary factor affecting an
organization’s ethical climate is its leader’s
ethical standard. Leaders can look to other

Army Leadership

organizational or installation personnel—for
example, the chaplain, staff judge advocate, inspector general, and equal employment opportunity manager—to assist them in building and
assessing their organization’s ethical climate,
but the ultimate responsibility belongs to the
leader—period.
5-121. Setting a good ethical example doesn’t
necessarily mean subordinates will follow it.
Some of them may feel that circumstances justify unethical behavior. (See, for example, the
situation portrayed in Appendix D.) Therefore,
you must constantly seek to maintain a feel for
your organization’s current ethical climate and
take prompt action to correct any discrepancies
between the climate and the standard. One tool
to help you is the Ethical Climate Assessment
Survey (ECAS), which is discussed in Appendix
D. You can also use some of the resources listed
above to help you get a feel for your organization’s ethical climate. After analyzing the information gathered from the survey or other
sources, a focus group may be a part of your
plan of action to improve the ethical climate.
Your abilities to listen and decide are the most
important tools you have for this job.
5-122. It’s important for subordinates to have
confidence in the organization’s ethical environment because much of what is necessary in
war goes against the grain of the societal values
individuals bring into the Army. You read in
the part of Chapter 4 that discusses ethical reasoning that a soldier’s conscience may tell him
it’s wrong to take human life while the mission
of the unit calls for exactly that. Unless you’ve
established a strong ethical climate that lets
that soldier know his duty, the conflict of values
may sap the soldier’s will to fight.

SGT York
A conscientious objector from the Tennessee hills, Alvin C. York was drafted after America’s
entry into World War I and assigned to the 328th Infantry Regiment of the 82d Division, the “All
Americans.” PVT York, a devout Christian, told his commander, CPT E. C. B. Danforth, that he would
bear arms against the enemy but didn’t believe in killing. Recognizing PVT York as a potential leader
but unable to sway him from his convictions, CPT Danforth consulted his battalion commander, MAJ
George E. Buxton, about how to handle the situation.
MAJ Buxton was also deeply religious and knew the Bible as well as PVT York did. He had CPT
Danforth bring PVT York to him, and they talked at length about the Scriptures, about God’s
teachings, about right and wrong, about just wars. Then MAJ Buxton sent PVT York home on leave to
ponder and pray over the dilemma. The battalion commander promised to release him from the Army
if PVT York decided he could not serve his country without sacrificing his integrity. After two weeks of
reflection and deep soul-searching, PVT York returned, having reconciled his personal values with
those of the Army. PVT York’s decision had great consequences for both himself and his unit.
Alvin York performed an exploit of almost unbelievable heroism in the morning hours of 8 October
1918 in France’s Argonne Forest. He was now a corporal (CPL), having won his stripes during
combat in the Lorraine. That morning CPL York’s battalion was moving across a valley to seize a
German-held rail point when a German infantry battalion, hidden on a wooded ridge overlooking the
valley, opened up with machine gun fire. The American battalion dived for cover, and the attack
stalled. CPL York’s platoon, already reduced to 16 men, was sent to flank the enemy machine guns.
As the platoon advanced through the woods to the rear of the German outfit, it surprised a group
of about 25 German soldiers. The shocked enemy offered only token resistance, but then more
hidden machine guns swept the clearing with fire. The Germans dropped safely to the ground, but
nine Americans, including the platoon leader and the other two corporals, fell dead or wounded. CPL
York was the only unwounded leader remaining.
CPL York found his platoon trapped and under fire within 25 yards of the enemy’s machine gun
pits. Nonetheless, he didn’t panic. Instead, he began firing into the nearest enemy position, aware
that the Germans would have to expose themselves to get an aimed shot at him. An expert
marksman, CPL York was able to hit every enemy soldier who popped his head over the parapet.
After he had shot more than a dozen enemy, six German soldiers charged him with fixed
bayonets. As the Germans ran toward him, CPL York once again drew on the instincts of a
Tennessee hunter and shot the last man first (so the ones in front wouldn’t see the ones he shot fall),
then the fifth, and so on. After he had shot all the assaulting Germans, CPL York again turned his
attention to the machine gun pits. In between shots, he called for the Germans to give up. It may have
initially seemed ludicrous for a lone soldier in the open to call on a well-entrenched enemy to
surrender, but their situation looked desperate to the German battalion commander, who had seen
over 20 of his soldiers killed by this one American. The commander advanced and offered to
surrender if CPL York would stop shooting.
CPL York now faced a daunting task. His platoon, now numbering seven unwounded soldiers,
was isolated behind enemy lines with several dozen prisoners. However, when one American said
their predicament was hopeless, CPL York told him to be quiet and began organizing the prisoners for
a movement. CPL York moved his unit and prisoners toward American lines, encountering other
German positions and forcing their surrender. By the time the platoon reached the edge of the valley
they had left just a few hours before, the hill was clear of German machine guns. The fire on the
Americans in the valley was substantially reduced and their advance began again.

SGT York (continued)
CPL York returned to American lines, having taken a total of 132 prisoners and putting 35
machine guns out of action. He left the prisoners and headed back to his own outfit. Intelligence
officers questioned the prisoners and learned from their testimony the incredible story of how a
fighting battalion was destroyed by one determined soldier armed only with a rifle and pistol. Alvin C.
York was promoted to sergeant and awarded the Medal of Honor for this action. His character,
physical courage, technical competence, and leadership enabled him to destroy the morale and
effectiveness of an entire enemy infantry battalion.

5-123. CPT Danforth and MAJ Buxton could
have ordered SGT York to go to war, or they
might have shipped him out to a job that would
take him away from the fight. Instead, these
leaders carefully addressed the soldier’s ethical
concerns. MAJ Buxton, in particular, established the ethical climate by showing that he,
too, had wrestled with the very questions that
troubled SGT York. The climate these leaders
created held that every person’s beliefs are important and should be considered. MAJ Buxton
demonstrated that a soldier’s duties could be
consistent with the ethical framework established by his religious beliefs. Leaders who create a healthy ethical environment inspire
confidence in their subordinates; that confidence and the trust it engenders builds the
unit’s will. They create an environment where
soldiers can truly “be all they can be.”
LEARNING
For most men, the matter of learning is one of
personal preference. But for Army [leaders], the
obligation to learn, to grow in their profession,
is clearly a public duty.
General of the Army Omar N. Bradley

5-124. The Army is a learning organization,
one that harnesses the experience of its people
and organizations to improve the way it does
business. Based on their experiences, learning
organizations adopt new techniques and procedures that get the job done more efficiently or
effectively. Likewise, they discard techniques
and procedures that have outlived their purpose. However, you must remain flexible when
trying to make sense of your experiences. The
leader who works day after day after day and

Army Leadership

never stops to ask “How can I do this better?” is
never going to learn and won’t improve the
team.
5-125. Leaders who learn look at their experience and find better ways of doing things.
Don’t be afraid to challenge how you and your
subordinates operate. When you ask “Why do
we do it that way?” and the only answer you get
is “Because we’ve always done it that way,” it’s
time for a closer look. Teams that have found a
way that works still may not be doing things the
best way. Unless leaders are willing to question
how things are, no one will ever know what can
be.
“Zero Defects” and Learning
5-126. There’s no room for the “zero-defects”
mentality in a learning organization. Leaders
willing to learn welcome new ways of looking at
things, examine what’s going well, and are not
afraid to look at what’s going poorly. When direct leaders stop receiving feedback from subordinates, it’s a good indication that something is
wrong. If the message you hammer home is
“There will be no mistakes,” or if you lose your
temper and “shoot the messenger” every time
there’s bad news, eventually your people will
just stop telling you when things go wrong or
suggesting how to make things go right. Then
there will be some unpleasant surprises in
store. Any time you have human beings in a
complex organization doing difficult jobs, often
under pressure, there are going to be problems.
Effective leaders use those mistakes to figure
out how to do things better and share what they
have learned with other leaders in the organization, both peers and superiors.

5-25

Direct Leadership Actions

5-127. That being said, all environments are
not learning environments; a standard of
“zero-defects” is acceptable, if not mandatory,
in some circumstances. A parachute rigger is
charged with a “zero-defect” standard. If a rigger makes a mistake, a parachutist will die.
Helicopter repairers live in a “zero-defect” environment as well. They can’t allow aircraft to
be mechanically unstable during flight. In these
and similar work environments, safety concerns mandate a “zero-defects” mentality. Of
course, organizations and people make mistakes; mistakes are part of training and may be
the price of taking action. Leaders must make
their intent clear and ensure their people understand the sorts of mistakes that are acceptable and those that are not.
5-128. Leaders can create a “zero-defects”
environment without realizing it. Good leaders
want their organizations to excel. But an
organizational “standard” of excellence can
quickly slide into “zero defects” if the leader
isn’t careful. For example, the published minimum standard for passing the APFT is 180
points—60 points per event. However, in units
that are routinely assigned missions requiring
highly strenuous physical activities, leaders
need to train their people to a higher-thanaverage level of physical fitness. If leaders use
APFT scores as the primary means of gauging
physical fitness, their soldiers will focus on the
test rather than the need for physical fitness. A
better course would be for leaders to train their
people on mission-related skills that require the
higher level of physical readiness while at the
same time motivating them to strive for their
personal best on the APFT.
Barriers to Learning
5-129. Fear of mistakes isn’t the only thing
that can get in the way of learning; so can rigid,
lockstep thinking and plain mental laziness.
These habits can become learning barriers leaders are so used to that they don’t even notice
them. Fight this tendency. Challenge yourself.
Use your imagination. Ask how other people do
things. Listen to subordinates.

5-26

Helping People Learn
5-130. Certain conditions help people learn.
First, you must motivate the person to learn.
Explain to the subordinate why the subject is
important or show how it will help the individual perform better. Second, involve the subordinate in the learning process; make it active. For
instance, you would never try to teach someone
how to drive a vehicle with classroom instruction alone; you have to get the person behind
the wheel. That same approach applies to much
more complex tasks; keep the lecture to a minimum and maximize the hands-on time.
5-131. Learning from experience isn’t enough;
you can’t have every kind of experience. But if
you take advantage of what others have
learned, you get the benefit without having the
experience. An obvious example is when combat veterans in a unit share their experiences
with soldiers who haven’t been to war. A less
obvious, but no less important, example is when
leaders share their experience with subordinates during developmental counseling.
After-Action Reviews and Learning
5-132. Individuals benefit when the group
learns together. The AAR is one tool good leaders use to help their organizations learn as a
group. Properly conducted, an AAR is a professional discussion of an event, focused on performance standards, that enables people to
discover for themselves what happened, why it
happened, and how to sustain strengths and
improve on weaknesses. Like warning orders
and rehearsals, the AAR is a technique that all
leaders—military or DA civilian—can use in
garrison as well as field environments. (FM
25-101 and TC 25-20 discuss how to prepare for,
conduct, and follow up after an AAR.) When
your team sits down for an AAR, make sure everyone participates and all understand what’s
being said. With input from the whole team,
your people will learn more than if they just
think about the experience by themselves.
Organizational Climate and Learning
5-133. It takes courage to create a learning environment. When you try new things or try
things in different ways, you’re bound to make
mistakes. Learn from your mistakes and the

FM 22-100

Improving Actions

mistakes of others. Pick your team and yourself
up, determine what went right and wrong, and
continue the mission. Be confident in your
abilities. Theodore Roosevelt, a colonel during
the Spanish-American War and twenty-sixth
President of the United States, put it this way:

5-134. Your actions as a direct leader move the
Army forward. How you influence your
subordinates and the people you work for, how
you operate to get the job done, how you
improve the organization for a better future, all
determine the Army’s success or failure.

Whenever you are asked if you can do a job, tell
’em, Certainly I can!—and get busy and find out
how to do it.

SUMMARY
5-135. Direct leaders influence their subordinates face-to-face as they operate to accomplish the mission and improve the organization.
Because their leadership is face-to-face, direct
leaders see the outcomes of their actions almost
immediately. This is partly because they receive
immediate feedback on the results of their
actions.
5-136. Direct leaders influence by determining
their purpose and direction from the boss’s intent and concept of the operation. They motivate subordinates by completing tasks that
reinforce this intent and concept. They continually acquire and assess outcomes and motivate

Army Leadership

their subordinates through face-to-face contact
and personal example.
5-137. Direct leaders operate by focusing their
subordinates’ activities toward the organization’s objective and achieving it. Direct leaders
plan,prepare,execute,andassess as theyoperate.

sometimes
occur
simultaneously.
5-138. Direct leaders improve by living Army
values and providing the proper role model for
subordinates. Leaders must develop all subordinates as they build strong, cohesive teams and establish an effective learning environment.

5-27

PART THREE

Organizational and Strategic Leadership
As they mature and assume greater responsibilities, Army leaders must also learn new skills,
develop new abilities, and act in more complex environments. Organizational and strategic
leaders maintain their own personalities and propensities, but they also expand what they
know and refine what they do.
Chapters 6 and 7 describe (rather than prescribe or mandate) skills and actions required of
organizational and strategic leaders. The chapters discuss much of what developing leaders
often sense and explore some concepts that may seem foreign to them. Neither chapter
outlines exhaustively what leaders know and do at higher levels; they simply introduce what’s
different.
The audience for Chapters 6 and 7 is only in part organizational and strategic leaders, who
have prepared to serve in those positions by career-long experience and study. Primarily,
these chapters offer staffs and subordinates who work for those leaders insight into the
additional concerns and activities of organizational and strategic leadership.

Chapter 6

Organizational Leadership
6-1. During the Battle of the Bulge, with the
Germans bearing down on retreating US forces,
PFC Vernon L. Haught dug in and told a sergeant in a tank destroyer, “Just pull your
vehicle behind me . . . I’m the 82d Airborne, and
this is as far as the bastards are going.” He
knew his division commander’s intent. Despite
desperate odds, he had confidence in himself
and his unit and knew they would make the difference. Faced with a fluid situation, he knew
where the line had to be drawn; he had the will
to act and he didn’t hesitate to do what he
thought was right.
6-2. Whether for key terrain in combat or for
results in peacetime training, leaders in units
and organizations translate strategy into policy
and practice. They develop programs, plans,
and systems that allow soldiers in teams, like
the infantryman in the All-American Division,

6-1

Organizational Leadership

to turn plans and orders into fire and maneuver
that seize victory at the least possible cost in
sweat and blood. By force of will and application
of their leadership skills, organizational leaders
build teams with discipline, cohesion, trust, and
proficiency. They clarify missions throughout
the ranks by producing an intent, concept, and
systematic approach to execution.
6-3. Organizational leadership builds on direct
leader actions. Organizational leaders apply
direct leader skills in their daily work with their
command and staff teams and, with soldiers
and subordinate leaders, they influence during
their contacts with units. But to lead complex
organizations like brigades, divisions, and corps
at today’s OPTEMPO and under the stresses of
training, contingency operations, and combat,
organizational leaders must add a whole new
set of skills and actions to their leadership
arsenal. They must practice direct and
organizational leadership simultaneously.
6-4. Communicating to NCOs, like the
airborne soldier at the Battle of the Bulge, occurs through individual subordinates, the staff,
and the chain of command. Organizational
leaders divide their attention between the concerns of the larger organization and their staffs
and those of their subordinate leaders, units,
and individuals. This tradeoff requires them to
apply interpersonal and conceptual skills differently when exercising organizational leadership than when exercising direct leadership.
6-5. Organizational leaders rely heavily on
mentoring subordinates and empowering them
to execute their assigned responsibilities and
missions. They stay mentally and emotionally
detached from their immediate surroundings so
they can visualize the larger impact on the organization and mission. Soldiers and subordinate leaders look to their organizational leaders

6-2

to establish standards for mission accomplishment and provide resources (conditions) to
achieve that goal. Organizational leaders provide direction and programs for training and
execution that focus efforts on mission success.
6-6. Due to the indirect nature of their
influence, organizational leaders assess interrelated systems and design long-term plans to
accomplish the mission. They must sharpen
their abilities to assess their environments,
their organization, and their subordinates.
Organizational leaders determine the cause
and effect of shortcomings, translate these new
understandings into plans and programs, and
allow their subordinate leaders latitude to execute and get the job done.
6-7. Organizational demands also differ as
leaders develop a systems perspective. At the
strategic level, the Army has identified six
imperatives: quality people, training, force
mix, doctrine, modern equipment, and leader
development. In organizations these imperatives translate into doctrine, training,
leader development, organization, materiel,
and soldiers—commonly called DTLOMS.
Together with Army values, these systems
provide the framework for influencing people
and organizations at all levels, conducting a
wide variety of operations, and continually
improving the force. Doctrine includes techniques to drive the functional systems in
Army organizations. FMs 25-100, 25-101, and
101-5 lay out procedures for training management and military decision making that
enable and focus execution. The training
management and military decision-making
processes provide a ready-made, systemic approach to planning, preparing, executing,
and assessing.

Interpersonal Skills

SECTION I
WHAT IT TAKES TO LEAD ORGANIZATIONS—SKILLS
6-8. Organizational leaders continue to use
the direct leader skills discussed in Chapter 4.
However their larger organizations and spans
of authority require them to master additional

skills. As with direct leader skills, these span
four areas: interpersonal, conceptual,
technical, and tactical.

INTERPERSONAL SKILLS
To get the best out of your men, they must feel that you are their real leader and must know that
they can depend upon you.

UNDERSTANDING SOLDIERS
6-9. Good organizational leaders understand
the human dimension, which Chapter 3
discussed. They use that understanding to motivate subordinates and to encourage initiative.
Chapter 5 explained that motivation means
much more than an individual willingness to do
what’s directed. It imparts a desire on the part
of individuals and organizations to do what’s
needed without being directed. This collective
desire to accomplish the mission underlies good
organizational discipline: good soldiers and
competent DA civilians adhere to standards

Army Leadership

6-10. This understanding, along with Army
values, forms the foundation of great units.
Units that have solid discipline can take
tremendous stress and friction yet persevere,
fight through, and win. Fostering initiative
builds on motivation and discipline. It requires
subordinates’ confidence that in an uncertain
situation, when they know the commander’s
intent and develop a competent solution, the
commander will underwrite the risk they take.
While this principle applies to both direct and
organizational leaders, the stakes are usually
higher in larger, more complex organizations.
Additionally, organizational leaders may be
more remote in time and distance and
subordinates’ ability to check back with them is
diminished. Therefore, organizational leaders’
understanding must develop beyond what they
can immediately and personally observe.
COMMUNICATING
6-11. Persuasion is a communication skill
i m p o rt an t t o o rgan i z at i o n al l e a d er s .
Well-developed skills of persuasion and an
openness to working through controversy in a
positive way help organizational leaders
overcome resistance and build support. These
characteristics are particularly important in
dealing with other organizational leaders. By
reducing grounds for misunderstanding,
persuasion reduces time wasted in overcoming
u n i m p o rt an t i s s u e s . I t al s o e n s u r es

6-3

Organizational Leadership

involvement of others, opens communication
w it h t he m, and pl aces val ue on t he i r
opinions—all team-building actions. Openness
to discussing one’s position and a positive
attitude toward a dissenting view often diffuses
tension and saves time and resistance in the
long run. By demonstrating these traits,
organizational leaders also provide an example
that subordinates can use in self-development.
6-12. In some circumstances, persuasion may
be inappropriate. In combat, all leaders make
decisions quickly, modifying the decisionmaking process to fit the circumstances. But
this practice of using the directing leadership
styles as opposed to more participatory ones
should occur when situations are in doubt,
risks are high, and time is short—circumstances that often appear in combat. No exact
blueprints exist for success in every context;
leadership and the ability to adapt to the situation will carry the day. Appropriate style, seasoned instinct, and the realities of the situation
must prevail.

SUPERVISING
6-13. Organizations pay attention to things
leaders check. Feedback and coaching enhance
motivation and improve performance by showing subordinates how to succeed. But how much
should you check and how much is too much?
When are statistics and reports adequate indicators and when must you visit your front-line
organizations, talk to your soldiers and DA civilians and see what’s going on yourself?
6-14. Overcentralized authority and
oversupervising undermine trust and empowerment. Undersupervising can lead to failure,
especially in cases where the leader’s intent
wasn’t fully understood or where subordinate
organizations lack the training for the task. Different subordinate commanders need different
levels of supervision: some need a great deal of
coaching and encouragement, though most
would just as soon be left alone. As always, a
good leader knows his subordinates and has the
skill to supervise at the appropriate level.

Knowing Your People
This General said, “Each of our three regimental commanders must be handled differently.
Colonel ‘A’ does not want an order. He wants to do everything himself and always does well. Colonel
‘B’ executes every order, but has no initiative. Colonel ‘C’ opposes everything he is told to do and
wants to do the contrary.”
A few days later the troops confronted a well-entrenched enemy whose position would have to be
attacked. The General issued the following orders:
To Colonel “A” (who wants to do everything himself): “My dear Colonel “A”, I think we will attack.
Your regiment will have to carry the burden of the attack. I have, however, selected you for this
reason. The boundaries of your regiment are so-and-so. Attack at X-hour. I don’t have to tell you
anything more.”
To Colonel “C” (who opposes everything): “We have met a very strong enemy. I am afraid we will
not be able to attack with the forces at our disposal.” “Oh, General, certainly we will attack. Just give
my regiment the time of attack and you will see that we are successful,” replied Colonel “C.” “Go then,
we will try it,” said the General, giving him the order for the attack, which he had prepared some time
previously.
To Colonel “B” (who always must have detailed orders) the attack order was merely sent with
additional details.
All three regiments attacked splendidly.

Conceptual
6-15. The complexity of the organizational
leader’s environment requires patience, the
willingness to think before acting. Furthermore, the importance of conceptual and
analytical skills increases as an organizational
leader moves into positions of greater responsibility. Organizational environments with
multiple dimensions offer problems that
become more abstract, complex, and uncertain.
6-16. Figure 6-2 identifies the conceptual skills
required of organizational leaders. For organizational leaders, reasoning skills are crucial for
developing intent and direction toward common goals. Critical thinking at the organizational level requires understanding systems
and an increased ability to filter information,
that is, to identify quickly information that applies to the task at hand and separate the important from the unimportant. Organizational
leaders use this analytical ability to assess ambiguous environments and to calculate and
manage risk. Their experience may allow them
to see and define problems more easily—but not
necessarily fix them quickly. Therefore, they

Army Leadership

also dedicate time to think and generate alternative ways of organizing their organizations
and resources for maximum effect. It’s important for organizational leaders to encourage
critical thinking in subordinates because subordinates also assess organizational challenges,
analyze indicators, and recommend courses of
action. It’s also important, time and mission
permitting, to allow subordinates’ solutions to
bear fruit.
ESTABLISHING INTENT
In an organization like ours, you have to think
through what it is that you are becoming. Like a
marathon runner, you have to get out in front,
mentally, and pull the organization to you. You
have to visualize the finish line—to see yourself
there—and pull yourself along—not push—pull
yourself to the future.

General Gordon R. Sullivan
Former Army Chief of Staff
6-17. Intent is the leader’s personal expression
of a mission’s end state and the key tasks the
organization must accomplish to achieve it.
During operations and field training, it’s a
clear, concise statement of what the force must
do to succeed with respect to the enemy and the
terrain and to the desired end state. It provides
the link between the mission and the concept of
operations. By describing their intent, organizational leaders highlight the key tasks that,
along with the mission, are the basis for subordinates to exercise initiative when unanticipated opportunities arise or when the original
concept of operations no longer applies. Clear
and concise, the leader’s intent includes a mission’s overall purpose and expected results. It
provides purpose, motivation, and direction,
whether the leader is commanding a division or
running a staff directorate. An organizational
leader visualizes the sequence of activities that
will move the organization from its current
state to the desired end state and expresses it as
simply and clearly as possible. (FM 101-5-1 contains a complete definition of commander’s intent. FM 100-34 discusses the relationship of
intent and visualization to command and

6-5

Organizational Leadership

control. FM 101-5 discusses the development of
intent in the MDMP.)
6-18. After establishing a clear and valid intent, the art of organizational leadership lies in
having subordinates take actions on their own
to transform that intent into reality. Since organizational leaders are likely to be farther
away from the point of execution in time and
space, they must describe the collective goal
rather than list tasks for individual subordinates. With clearly communicated purpose and
direction, subordinates can then determine
what they must do and why. Within that broad
framework, leaders empower subordinates,
delegating authority to act within the intent:
“Here’s where we’re headed, why we’re going

there, and how we’re going to get there.” Purpose and direction align the efforts of subordinates working toward common goals.
6-19. A former division commander has said,
“You must be seen to be heard.” There’s a great
temptation for organizational leaders to rely
exclusively on indirect leadership, to spread
intent by passing orders through subordinates
or communicating electronically with troops
scattered far and wide. However, nothing can
take the place of face-to-face contact.
Organizational leaders make every effort to get
out among the troops. There they can
spot-check intent to see that it’s disseminated
and understood among those who must execute
it.

GEN Grant and the End of the Civil War
I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.

General Ulysses S. Grant
Dispatch, May 11, 1864

GEN Ulysses S. Grant penned those words at Spotsylvania, Virginia, after being appointed
general in chief of the Union Army and stationing himself forward with the Army of the Potomac. After
fighting a bloody draw at the Wilderness, the Army of the Potomac had moved aggressively to
outflank GEN Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia but once more faced a dug-in Confederate
Army. However, where previous Union commanders had turned away, GEN Grant would not relent.
His intent was clear. It was reinforced in the sentiment of his army, which wanted to finish the war.
In a series of determined attacks, the new Union commander broke GEN Lee’s defense and used
a turning movement to force his opponent out of position. Again they met at Cold Harbor, where GEN
Grant attacked frontally and failed. Prior to his attack, Union soldiers, literally days from the end of
their enlistment, were seen writing notes to their families and pinning them on the backs of their shirts
so one last message would get home if they were killed. Their resolution demonstrates the power of
their commitment to a shared intent.
After his bloody repulse at Cold Harbor, GEN Grant again moved south, maintaining the initiative,
always pressing, always threatening to turn the Confederate flank and expose Richmond, the capital
of Virginia. GEN Lee, in turn, was forced to block and defend Petersburg, Richmond’s railroad hub.
Uncovering it would have isolated Richmond as well as his army’s rail-based lines of communication.
GEN Grant had his opponent pinned to a critical strategic resource. Doing this denied the Army of
Northern Virginia its greatest asset, its excellent ability to maneuver. It would not escape.
GEN Grant was unstinting in his resolve to totally defeat GEN Lee. He was a familiar figure to his
soldiers, riding among them with his slouch hat in his private’s uniform with general’s rank. He drove
his subordinates, who themselves wanted to finish off their old foe; despite casualties, he
unflinchingly resisted pressure to back away from his intent.

6-20. Having
established
an
azimuth,
organizational leaders assist their subordinates’ efforts to build and train their organizations on those tasks necessary for success.
Finally, they act to motivate subordinate leaders and organizations to meet the operational
standards upon which discipline depends.
FILTERING INFORMATION
Leaders at all levels, but particularly those at
higher levels who lack recent personal
observations, can only make decisions based on
the information given to them. What sets senior
leaders apart is their ability to sort through
great amounts of information, key in on what is
significant, and then make decisions. But, these
decisions are only as good as the information
provided.

A Former Battalion Commander

6-21. Organizational leaders deal with a
tremendous amount of information. Some information will make sense only to someone
with a broad perspective and an understanding
of the entire situation. Organizational leaders
communicate clearly to their staffs what information they need and then hold the staff accountable for providing it. Then, they
judge—based on their education, training, and
experience—what’s important and make wellinformed, timely decisions.
6-22. Analysis and synthesis are essential to effective decision-making and program development. Analysis breaks a problem into its
component parts. Synthesis assembles complex
and disorganized data into a solution. Often,
data must be processed before it fits into place.
6-23. Commander’s
critical
information
requirements (CCIR) are the commander’s most
important information filters. Commanders
must know the environment, the situation, their

Army Leadership

organizations, and themselves well enough to articulate what they need to know to control their
organizations and accomplish their missions.
They must also ensure they have thought
through the feedback systems necessary to supervise execution. Organizational-level commanders must not only establish CCIR but also
train their staffs to battle drill proficiency in information filtering. (FM 101-5 discusses CCIR,
mission analysis, information management, and
other staff operations.)
UNDERSTANDING SYSTEMS
6-24. Organizational leaders think about
systems in their organization: how they work
together, how using one affects the others, and
how to get the best performance from the
whole. They think beyond their own organizations to how what their organization
does affects other organizations and the team
as a whole. Whether coordinating fires among
different units or improving sponsorship of new
personnel, organizational leaders use a systems
perspective. While direct leaders think about
tasks, organizational leaders integrate, synchronize, and fine-tune systems and monitor
outcomes. If organizational leaders can’t get
something done, the flaw or failure is more
likely systemic than human. Being able to
understand and leverage systems increases a
leader’s ability to achieve organizational goals
and objectives.
6-25. Organizational leaders also know how
effectively apply all available systems to achieve
mission success. They constantly make sure
that the systems for personnel, administration,
logistical support, resourcing, and training
work effectively. They know where to look to
see if the critical parts of the system are
functioning properly.

Organizational Leadership

DA Civilian Support to Desert Shield
During Operation Desert Shield, a contingent of DA civilians deployed to a depot in the combat
theater to provide warfighting supplies and operational equipment to Third (US) Army. These DA
civilians were under the supervision of DA civilian supervisors, who motivated their employees in
spite of the harsh conditions in the region: hot weather, a dismal environment, and the constant
threat of Iraqi missile and chemical attacks. It turned out that the uplifting organizational climate these
leaders provided overcame the physical deprivation.
Two senior DA civilian leaders, the depot’s deputy director of maintenance and the chief of the
vehicle branch, developed a plan to replace arriving units’ M1 tanks with M1A1s, which boasted
greater firepower, better armor, and a more advanced nuclear, biological, and chemical protective
system. They also developed systems for performing semiannual and annual maintenance checks,
quickly resolving problems, applying modifications such as additional armor, and repainting the tanks
in the desert camouflage pattern.
Although similar programs normally take 18 to 24 months to complete, the two leaders set an
ambitious objective of 6 months. Many experts thought the goal could not be met, but the tenacious
leaders never wavered in their resolve. After 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a week operations, their inspired
team of teams completed the project in 2 months. These DA civilian leaders with clear intent, firm
objectives, and unrelenting will motivated their team and provided modern, lethal weapons to the
soldiers who needed them when they were needed.

6-26. Organizational leaders analyze systems
and results to determine why things happened
the way they did. Performance indicators and
standards for systems assist them in their
analysis. Equipment failure rates, unit status
reports (USR) Standard Installation/Division
Personnel System (SIDPERS), Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) data, and
evaluation report timeliness all show the health
of systems. Once an assessment is complete and
causes of a problem known, organizational
leaders develop appropriate solutions that address the problem’s root cause.

6-27. Isolating why things go wrong and where
systems break down usually requires giving
subordinates time and encouragement to ferret
out what’s really happening. The dilemma for
organizational leaders occurs when circumstances and mission pressures require immediate remedial action and preclude gathering
more data. It’s then that they must fall back on
their experience and that of their subordinates,
make a judgment, and act.

Innovative Reorganization
Facing a long-term downsizing of his organization, a DA civilian director didn’t simply shrink its
size. Instead, the director creatively flattened the organization by reducing the number of deputy
executives, managers, and supervisors. The director increased responsibilities of those in leadership
positions and returned to a technical focus those managers and supervisors with dominant mission
skills. The result was a better leader-to-led ratio, a reduced number of administrative and clerical
positions, and a smoother transition to multidisciplined team operations. The director’s systems
understanding led him to tailor inputs that maintained healthy systems and improved outputs.

6-28. The external responsibilities of organizational leaders are greater than those of direct
leaders, both vertically and horizontally. Their
organizations have more levels than directlevel organizations and, depending on the
organization’s role, command interest may
reach to the CINC or national command
authority. There are more requirements to coordinate with other organizations, which may
include agencies outside the Department of Defense (DOD). To make full use of their organizations’ capabilities, organizational leaders must
continue to master technical skills outside their
original area of expertise.

too complex for that. It does, however, mean
that organizational leaders must identify and
be proficient in those critical, direct-leader
skills they need to assess tactical training and
set the example.
6-30. One organizational leader who set the
example by drawing on deeply embedded technical skills was COL Marian Tierney. In her final military assignment, COL Tierney was
responsible for nursing operations at 38 hospitals with 2500 nurses in the Republic of Vietnam. In 1966 she had to call on the basic
medical skills and personal character she had
honed throughout a career in places like
Omaha Beach during the Normandy invasion.
That day, 22 years after D-Day, the aircraft on
which she was a passenger crashed, leaving
many injured and panicked survivors. Ignoring
her own injuries COL Tierney treated her comrades and took charge of evacuating the scene.
For her heroism she received the Soldier’s
Medal. Her actions demonstrate that courageous leaders of character and competence
serve at all levels.
RESOURCING

MAINTAINING CRITICAL SKILLS

6-31. In addition to using the technical skills
they learned as direct leaders, organizational
leaders must also master the skill of resourcing.
Resources—which include time, equipment, facilities, budgets, and people—are required to
achieve organizational goals. Organizational
leaders must aggressively manage the resources at their disposal to ensure their organizations’ readiness. The leader’s job grows more
difficult when unprogrammed costs—such as
an emergency deployment—shift priorities.

6-29. Organizational leaders have fewer opportunities to practice many of the technical skills
they mastered as direct leaders. However, that
doesn’t mean they can forget about them. In
every organization there are certain skills in
which all members must be proficient. Soldiers
know what they are and expect their leaders to
be able to perform them. This doesn’t mean
that organizational leaders must be able to perform every specialty-related skill as well as an
individual holding that specialty. The Army is

6-32. Organizational leaders are stewards of
their people’s time and energy and their own
will and tenacity. They don’t waste these
resources but skillfully evaluate objectives, anticipate resource requirements, and efficiently
allocate what’s available. They balance available resources with organizational requirements and distribute them in a way that best
achieves organizational goals—in combat as
well as peacetime. For instance, when a cavalry
squadron acting as the division flank guard

Army Leadership

6-9

Organizational Leadership

makes contact, its commander asks for priority
of fires. The division commander considers the
needs of the squadron but must weigh it against
the overall requirements of the current and future missions.
PREDICTING SECOND- AND
THIRD-ORDER EFFECTS
6-33. Because the decisions of organizational
leaders have wider-ranging effects than those
of direct leaders, organizational leaders must
be more sensitive to how their own actions affect the organization’s climate. These actions
may be conscious, as in the case of orders and
policies, or unconscious, such as requirements
for routine or unscheduled reports and meetings. The ability to discern and predict secondand third-order effects helps organizational
leaders assess the health of the organizational
climate and provide constructive feedback to
subordinates. It can also result in identifying
resource requirements and changes to organizations and procedures. (The ECAS process

illustrated in Appendix D or a similar one can
be applied by organizational as well as direct
leaders.)
6-34. For instance, when the Army Chief of
Staff approved a separate military occupational
specialty code for mechanized infantry soldiers,
the consequences were wide-ranging. Secondorder effects included more specialized schooling for infantry NCOs, a revised promotion system to accommodate different infantry NCO
career patterns, and more doctrinal and training material to support the new specialty.
Third-order effects included resource requirements for developing the training material and
adding additional instructor positions at the Infantry Center and School. Organizational leaders are responsible for anticipating the
consequences of any action they take or direct.
Requiring thorough staff work can help. However, proper anticipation also requires imagination and vision as well as an appreciation for
other people and organizations.

6-35. Organizational leaders must master the
tactical skills of synchronization and orchestration. Synchronization applies at the tactical
level of war; orchestration is an operationallevel term. Synchronization arranges activities
in time, space, and purpose to focus maximum
relative military power at a decisive point in
space and time. Organizational leaders synchronize battles, each of which may comprise
several synchronized engagements. (FM 100-40
discusses synchronization. FM 100-5 discusses
orchestration.)

higher levels orchestrate by applying the complementary and reinforcing effects of all military and nonmilitary assets to overwhelm

out—in time and distance—than do direct
leaders.

6-37. Tactical skill for direct leaders involves employing individuals and teams of company size
and smaller. In contrast, tactical skill for organizational leaders entails employing units of battalion size and larger. Organizational leaders get
divisions, brigades, and battalions to the right
place, at the right time, and in the right combination to fight and win battles and engagements.
(FM 100-40 discusses battles and engagements.)
They project the effects of their decisions further

6-38. The operational skill of orchestrating a
series of tactical events is also more demanding
and far-reaching. Time horizons are longer. Effects take more time to unfold. Decision sets are
more intricate. GEN Grant’s Vicksburg campaign in the spring of 1863, which split the Confederacy and opened the Mississippi River to
Union use, is a classic example of an organizational leader orchestrating the efforts of subordinate forces.

GEN Grant at Vicksburg
After failing to capture Vicksburg by attacking from the north, GEN Ulysses S. Grant moved along
the west bank of the Mississippi River to a point south of the city. He masked his movement and
intentions by sending COL Benjamin Grierson’s cavalry deep into Mississippi to conduct a series of
raids. The Union commander also synchronized the daring dispatch of US Navy gunboats through
Confederate shore batteries to link up with his army south of Vicksburg. Using Admiral (ADM) David
D. Porter’s gunboats, the Union Army crossed to the east bank of the Mississippi while MG William T.
Sherman conducted a diversionary attack on the northern approaches to Vicksburg.
Once across the Mississippi, GEN Grant bypassed Vicksburg, used the Big Black River to protect
his flank, and maneuvered east toward Jackson, Mississippi. By threatening both Jackson and
Vicksburg, GEN Grant prevented Confederate forces from uniting against him. After a rapid series of
engagements, the Union Army forced the enemy out of Jackson, blocking Vicksburg’s main line of
supply. It then turned west for an assault of Vicksburg, the key to control of the Mississippi. With
supply lines severed and Union forces surrounding the city, Confederate forces at Vicksburg
capitulated on 4 July 1863.
GEN Grant’s Vicksburg campaign demonstrates the orchestration of a series of subordinate unit
actions. In a succession of calculated moves, he defeated the Confederate forces under the
command of Generals Joseph E. Johnston and John C. Pemberton, gained control of the Mississippi
River, and divided the Confederacy.

6-39. Organizational leaders know doctrine,
tactics, techniques, and procedures. Their
refined tactical skills allow them to understand,

Army Leadership

integrate, and synchronize the activities of systems, bringing all resources and systems to
bear on warfighting tasks.

Organizational Leadership

SECTION II
WHAT IT TAKES TO LEAD ORGANIZATIONS—ACTIONS
Making decisions, exercising command, managing, administering—those are the dynamics
of our calling. Responsibility is its core.

General Harold K. Johnson
Former Army Chief of Staff

6-40. Actions by organizational leaders have
far greater consequences for more people over a
longer time than those of direct leaders.
Because the connections between action and effect are sometimes more remote and difficult to
see, organizational leaders spend more time
thinking about what they’re doing and how
they’re doing it than direct leaders do. When organizational leaders act, they must translate
their intent into action through the larger
number of people working for them.
6-41. Knowledge of subordinates is crucial to
success. To maximize and focus the energy of

their staffs, organizational leaders ensure that
subordinates know what must be done and
why. In addition, they ensure that work being
done is moving the organization in the right direction. They develop concepts for operations
and policies and procedures to control and
monitor their execution. Since the challenges
they face are varied and complicated, no manual can possibly address them all. However, the
following section provides a framework for examining, explaining, and reflecting on organizational leader actions.

initial tool for getting the word out from, and
returning feedback to, the commander. In

6-42. As Figure 6-5 shows, influencing is
achieved through communicating, decision
making, and motivating. At the organizational
level, influencing means not only getting the order or concept out; it means marshaling the activities of the staff and subordinate leaders to
move towards the organization’s objective. Influencing involves continuing to reinforce the
intent and concept, continually acquiring and
assessing available feedback, and inspiring subordinates with the leader’s own presence and
encouragement.

more focused, and more unequivocal than
direct leaders’ communication. Because organizational leaders move quickly from one project
to another and one part of the organization to
the other, they must be careful that the right
message goes out the first time. Poor communication can have tremendously negative consequences.

6-44. Communication becomes more complex
for organizational leaders because of their
increased span of control and separation from
elements actually executing the mission. Whatever organizational leaders ask for, explicitly or
implicitly, causes ripples throughout the organization. Therefore, they must consider how
subordinates might interpret their wishes. Directives and actions must be clear and issued in
a manner that discourages overreaction. The
installation commander who remarks out loud
about bland walls may cause an entire organization’s soldiers to paint all weekend (it
has happened).

Know Yourself

6-45. Organizational leaders also lose the right
to complain in public; for example, their opinion of a support agency affects the attitude of
hundreds or thousands of people. Where the
leader is, how the leader looks, and what the
leader does and says influence routine leadership actions throughout the organization. Like
direct leaders, organizational leaders are always on display, and their demeanor and presence set the tone and climate for subordinate
organizations. However, the position of organizational leaders makes them more prominent,
and they must remain aware of how their behavior affects their organization. A bad day for
the leader should not have to be a bad day for
everyone else.
COMMUNICATING
Too often we place the burden of comprehension
on [those at a different level from] us, assuming
both the existence of a common language and
motivation.

General Edward C. Meyer
Former Army Chief of Staff
6-46. Ironically, organizational leaders’ faceto-face communication must be more powerful,

Army Leadership

6-47. Even before assuming an organizational,
leadership position, leaders must assess themselves, understand their strengths and weaknesses, and commit to an appropriate
leadership philosophy. Organizational leaders
must realize that some techniques that worked
in direct-level positions may no longer work at
the organizational level. They must resist the
temptation to revert to their old role and thus
preempt their subordinates by making decisions for them.
6-48. That said, personal qualities that contributed to their previous success are still important for organizational leaders. They must be
themselves. They must know their biases, frustrations, and desires and try to keep these factors from negatively influencing their
communication. It’s not enough to be careful
about what they say. Nonverbal communication is so powerful that organizational leaders
need to be aware of personal mannerisms, behavioral quirks, and demeanor that reinforce or
contradict a spoken message.
Know the Purpose
6-49. Organizational leaders know themselves,
the mission, and the message. They owe it to
their organization and their people to share as
much as possible. People have to know what to
do and why. At the most basic level, communication provides the primary way that organizational leaders show they care. If subordinates
are to succeed and the organization is to move
forward, then the organizational leader must
work hard at maintaining positive communication. Encouraging open dialogue, actively listening to all perspectives, and ensuring that
subordinate leaders and staffs can have a forthright, open, and honest voice in the organization without fear of negative consequences

6-13

Organizational Leadership

greatly fosters communication at all levels.
Organizational leaders who communicate
openly and genuinely reinforce team values,

send a message of trust to subordinates, and
benefit from subordinates’ good ideas.

The Commander’s Notebook
A brigade commander met with his subordinate leaders and outlined his goals for an upcoming
training exercise. In the days following, while the brigade staff worked on the formal orders and
requirements, the commander spent time visiting subordinate units as they trained. As a part of each
visit, he asked his subordinate leaders for specific feedback on his intent. Was it clear? Could they
repeat the three main points he had tried to make? What would they add to the unit’s goals for the
training? He listened, asked his own questions, and allowed them to question him. It turned out that
most of the people he spoke to missed one of his three main points, which led the commander to
believe that he hadn’t made himself clear the first time. Eventually, he started the conversation by
saying, “There are a couple of points I tried to make in my talk; apparently, I dropped the ball on at
least one of them. Let me take another shot at it.” Then he explained the point again.
Whenever subordinate leaders offered suggestions about the upcoming exercise, the brigade
commander took out a pocket notebook and wrote some notes. Even when suggestions sounded
lame, he wrote them down. That way, he signaled to the speaker, “Yes, your opinion counts, too.”
Secondly, by writing down the ideas, the commander guaranteed himself a chance to look at the
comments later. He knew from experience that sometimes the ones that don’t seem to make sense at
first turn out to be quite useful later. Many of the direct leaders remarked that they had never seen a
brigade commander do anything like that before. They were even more astonished when they got
feedback on the suggestion. The brigade adjutant even explained to one company commander why
his suggestion wasn’t implemented. On a Saturday morning the brigade commander was standing in
line at the PX when a platoon sergeant engaged him in conversation. “I wasn’t around the day you
visited my company last week, sir,” the NCO said, “but I heard the other folks had a few suggestions
for you. I wonder if I could add something?”

Know the Environment

Know the Boss

6-50. Before organizational leaders can
effectively communicate, they must assess the
environment—people, events, and systems—and tailor their message to the target
audience. Organizational leaders constantly
communicate by persuading and conveying intent, standards, goals, and priorities at four levels within the Army: their people, their own and
higher staffs, their subordinate leaders and
commanders, and their superiors. There may
also be occasions that require organizational
leaders to speak to audiences outside the Army
such as the media or community groups. They
may have to repeat the message to different
audiences and retune it for different echelons,
but only leaders can reinforce their true intent.

6-51. Working to communicate consistently
with the boss is especially important for organizational leaders. Organizational leaders have to
figure out how to reach the boss. They must assess how the boss communicates and how the
boss receives information. For some leaders, direct and personal contact is best; others may be
more comfortable with weekly meetings, email, or letters. Knowing the boss’s intent, priorities, and thought processes greatly enhances
organizational success. An organizational
leader who communicates well with the boss
minimizes friction between the organization
and the higher headquarters and improves the
overall organizational climate.

Know the Subordinates
If it’s dumb it’s not our policy.
Lieutenant General Walter F. Ulmer Jr.
Former Commanding General, III Corps
6-52. The mere presence of an organizational
leader somewhere communicates the leader’s
character and what the leader values. The
organizational leader who hurries through a
talk about caring for subordinates, then passes
up an opportunity to speak face-to-face with
some soldiers, does more than negate the message; he undercuts whatever trust his subordinates may have had.
6-53. Because organizational leaders know
themselves, they also know that others bring
the sum total of their experience to their duties.
They analyze interpersonal contact to gather
meaning; they look for the message behind the
words. In this way, they gain a greater understanding of peers, subordinates, and superiors.
Improving communication skills becomes a major self-development challenge for them. By
stating their intent openly, organizational leaders give subordinates an open door for feedback
on unintended consequences or just bad policy:
“Hey sir, did you really mean it when you said,
‘If it’s dumb it’s not our policy?’ OK, well what
about…?” Leaders must be seen to be heard.
Know the Staff
6-54. Organizational leaders must understand
what’s going on within their own and the nexthigher echelon staff. Networking allows them
to improve communication and mission accomplishment by giving them a better understanding of the overall environment. Networking
requires leaders to constantly interact and
share thoughts, ideas, and priorities. Informed
staffs can then turn policies, plans, and programs into realities.
6-55. Organizational leaders must also know
the focus of the next-higher staff and commander. Through taking time to interact with the
next-higher staff, organizational leaders gain a
greater understanding of the boss’s priorities
and also help set the conditions for their own
requirements. Constantly sensing—observing,
talking, questioning, and actively listening

Army Leadership

to—what’s going on helps organizational leaders better identify and solve potential problems
and allows them to anticipate decisions and put
their outfit in the best possible position to
execute.
Know the Best Method
6-56. To disseminate information accurately
and rapidly, organizational leaders must also
develop an effective communications network.
Some of these networks—such as the chain of
command, the family support network, the
NCO support channel, and staff relationships—simply need to be recognized and
exploited. Other informal chains must be
developed. Different actions may require different networks.
6-57. The more adept organizational leaders
become in recognizing, establishing, and using
these networks, the more successful the outcome, especially as they become comfortable using a wider range of communications forums.
Memorandums, notes, and e-mail as well as formal and informal meetings, interactions, and
publications are tools of an effective communicator. Organizational leaders must know the
audiences these methods reach and use them
accordingly.
DECISION MAKING
The key is not to make quick decisions, but to
make timely decisions.
General Colin Powell
Former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff
6-58. Organizational leaders are far more likely
than direct leaders to be required to make decisions with incomplete information. They determine whether they have to decide at all, which
decisions to make themselves, and which ones
to push down to lower levels. To determine the
right course of action, they consider possible
second- and third-order effects and think farther into the future—months, or even years,
out in the case of some directorates.
6-59. Organizational leaders identify the problem, collect input from all levels, synthesize
that input into solutions, and then choose and
execute the best solution in time to make a

6-15

Organizational Leadership

difference. To maximize the use of resources
and have the greatest effect on developing an
effective organization, organizational leaders
move beyond a reacting, problem-solving approach to an anticipating, problem-preemption
method. While there will always be emergencies
and unforeseen circumstances, organizational
leaders focus on anticipating future events and
making decisions about the systems and people
necessary to minimize crises. Vision is essential
for organizational leaders.
6-60. During operations, the pace and stress of
action increase over those of training. Organizational leaders use the MDMP to make tactical
decisions; however, they must add their conceptual skill of systems understanding to their
knowledge of tactics when considering courses
of action. Organizational leaders may be
tempted—because of pressure, the threat, fear,
or fatigue—to abandon sound decision making
by reacting to short-term demands. The same
impulses may result in focusing too narrowly
on specific events and losing their sense of time
and timing. But there’s no reason for organizational leaders to abandon proven decisionmaking processes in crises, although they
shouldn’t hesitate to modify a process to fit the
situation. In combat, success comes from creative, flexible decision making by leaders who
quickly analyze a problem, anticipate enemy actions, and rapidly execute their decisions. (Remember GEN Grant’s actions at Vicksburg.)
Leaders who delay or attempt to avoid a decision may cause unnecessary casualties and
even mission failure.
6-61. Effective and timely decision making—both the commander’s and subordinates’—is crucial to success. As part of decision
making, organizational leaders establish responsibility and accountability among their
subordinates. They delegate decision making
authority as far as it will go, empowering and
encouraging subordinates to make decisions
that affect their areas of responsibility or to further delegate that authority to their own
subordinates.
6-62. Effective organizational leaders encourage initiative and risk-taking. They remember that they are training leaders and

6-16

soldiers; the goal is a better-trained team, not
some ideal outcome. When necessary, they support subordinates’ bad decisions, but only those
made attempting to follow the commander’s intent. Failing through want of experience or luck
is forgivable. Negligence, indecision, or attempts to take an easy route should never be
tolerated.
6-63. As GEN Powell’s comment makes clear, a
decision’s timeliness is as important as the
speed at which it is made. Just as for direct leaders, a good decision now is better than a perfect
one too late. Leaders who are good at handling
the decision-making process will perform better
when the OPTEMPO speeds up. Leaders who
don’t deliver timely decisions leave their subordinates scrambling and trying to make up for
lost time. Better to launch the operation with a
good concept and let empowered subordinates
develop subsequent changes to the plan than to
court failure by waiting too long for the perfect
plan.
6-64. In tough moments, organizational leaders may need the support of key subordinates to
close an issue. Consider MG George G. Meade’s
position at Gettysburg. In command of the
Army of the Potomac for only a few days, MG
Meade met with his subordinates on the night
of 2 July 1863 after two days of tough fighting.
Uncertainty hung heavy in the air. MG Meade’s
decision to stand and fight, made with the support of his corps commanders, influenced the
outcome of the battle and became a turning
point of the Civil War.
6-65. Coping with uncertainty is normal for all
leaders, increasingly so for organizational leaders. Given today’s information technology, the
dangerous temptation to wait for all available
information before making a decision will persist. Even though this same technology may
also bring the unwanted attention of a superior,
leaders should not allow it to unduly influence
their decisions. Organizational leaders are
where they are because of their experience, intuition, initiative, and judgment. Events move
quickly, and it’s more important for decisive organizational leaders to recognize and seize opportunities, thereby creating success, than to
wait for all the facts and risk failure.

FM 22-100

Influencing Actions

6-66. In the end, leaders bear ultimate responsibility for their organizations’ success or
failure. If the mission fails, they can’t lay the
blame elsewhere but must take full responsibility. If the mission succeeds, good leaders give
credit to their subordinates. While organizational leaders can’t ensure success by being allknowing or present everywhere, they can assert
themselves throughout the organization by being decisive in times of crisis and quick to seize
opportunities. In combat, leaders take advantage of fleeting windows of opportunity: they
see challenges rather than obstacles; they seek
solutions rather than excuses; they fight
through uncertainty to victory.
MOTIVATING
It is not enough to fight. It is the spirit which we
bring to the fight that decides the issue. It is
morale that wins the victory.

General of the Army George C. Marshall

6-67. Interpersonal skills involved in creating
and sustaining ethical and supportive climates
are required at the organizational as well as the
direct leadership level. As Chapter 3 explains,
the organizational, unit, or command climate
describes the environment in which subordinates work. Chapter 5 discusses how direct
leaders focus their motivational skills on individuals or small groups of subordinates. While
direct leaders are responsible for their organizations’ climate, their efforts are constrained
(or reinforced) by the larger organization’s climate. Organizational leaders shape that larger
environment. Their primary motivational responsibility is to establish and maintain the climate of their entire organization.
6-68. Disciplined organizations evolve within a
positive organizational climate. An organization’s climate springs from its leader’s
attitudes, actions, and priorities. Organizational leaders set the tone most powerfully through a personal example that brings
Army values to life. Upon assuming an organizational leadership position, a leader determines the organizational climate by assessing

Army Leadership

the organization from the bottom up. Once this
assessment is complete, the leader can provide
the guidance and focus (purpose, direction, and
motivation) required to move the organizational climate to the desired end state.
6-69. A climate that promotes Army values and
fosters the warrior ethos encourages learning
and promotes creative performance. The foundation for a positive organizational climate is a
healthy ethical climate, but that alone is insufficient. Characteristics of successful organizational climates include a clear, widely known
intent; well-trained and confident soldiers; disciplined, cohesive teams; and trusted, competent leadership.
6-70. To create such a climate, organizational
leaders recognize mistakes as opportunities to
learn, create cohesive teams, and reward leaders of character and competence. Organizational leaders value honest feedback and
constantly use all available means to maintain a
feel for the environment. Staff members who
may be good sources for straightforward feedback may include equal opportunity advisors
and chaplains. Methods may include town hall
meetings, surveys, and councils. And of course,
personal observation—getting out and talking
to DA civilians, soldiers, and family members—brings organizational leaders face-toface with the people affected by their decisions
and policies. Organizational leaders’ consistent, sincere effort to see what’s really going on
and fix things that are not working right can result in mutual respect throughout their organizations. They must know the intricacies of the
job, trust their people, develop trust among
them, and support their subordinates.
6-71. Organizational leaders who are positive,
fair, and honest in their dealings and who are
not afraid of constructive criticism encourage
an atmosphere of openness and trust. Their
people willingly share ideas and take risks to
get the job done well because their leaders
strive for more than compliance; they seek to
develop subordinates with good judgment.

6-17

Organizational Leadership

6-72. Good judgment doesn’t mean lockstep
thinking. Thinking “outside the box” isn’t the
same as indiscipline. In fact, a disciplined organization systematically encourages creativity
and taking prudent risks. The leader convinces
subordinates that anything they break can be
fixed, except life or limb. Effective organizational leaders actively listen to, support, and reward subordinates who show disciplined
initiative. All these things create opportunities
for subordinates to succeed and thereby build
their confidence and motivation.

6-73. However, it’s not enough that individuals
can perform. When people are part of a disciplined and cohesive team, they gain proficiency,
are motivated, and willingly subordinate themselves to organizational needs. People who sense
they’re part of a competent, well-trained team
act on what the team needs; they’re confident in
themselves and feel a part of something important and compelling. These team members know
that what they do matters and discipline
themselves.

The 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment at Normandy
On 7 June 1944, the day after D-Day, nearly 600 paratroopers of the 505th Parachute Infantry
Regiment were in position in the town of Ste. Mère Église in Normandy to block any German
counterattack of the Allied invasion force. Although outnumbered by an enemy force of over 6,000
soldiers, the paratroopers attacked the German flank and prevented the enemy’s assault. The
paratroopers were motivated and well-trained, and they all understood the absolute necessity of
preventing the German counterattack. Even in the fog of war, they did what needed to be done to
achieve victory. Their feat is especially noteworthy since many landed outside their planned drop
zones and had to find their units on their own. They did so quickly and efficiently in the face of the
enemy.
The 505th combined shared purpose, a positive and ethical climate, and cohesive, disciplined
teams to build the confidence and motivation necessary to fight and win in the face of uncertainty and
adversity. Both leaders and soldiers understood that no plan remains intact after a unit crosses the
line of departure. The leaders’ initiative allowed the disciplined units to execute the mission by
following the commander’s intent, even when the conditions on the battlefield changed.

6-76. GEN Patton wasn’t belittling the importance of planning; he was emphasizing the balance necessary for successful operations.
Planning, getting ready for the future by laying
out how leaders aim to turn their intent into reality, is something leaders do every day and
something the Army does very well. However,
organizational leaders plan for the systems that
support training and operations as well as for
the actual training event or operation. Systems
planning involves seven steps:

· Establish intent.
· Set goals.
· Determine objectives.
· Determine tasks.
· Establish priorities.
· Follow up.
Establish Intent
6-77. The first step in systems planning is for
the organizational leader to have a clear intent
for what he wants the organization to be. What
will it look like at some future point? Spending
extra time visualizing the end state up front is
more important than quickly jumping into the
mechanics of planning. Obviously, the actual
mission is critical in determining this end state.
The organizational leader’s intent should be
announced at the earliest practicable time after
it has been formulated so the staff and subordinate commanders can have maximum time to
plan. For a division, the intent might be—

Army Leadership

· The best infantry division in the world.
· Supported by the finest installation in the
Army.

· Trained and ready to deploy anywhere in
·
·

the world to fight and win.
But flexible enough to accomplish any other
mission the nation asks us to perform.
A values-based organization that takes care
of its soldiers, DA civilians, and families.

6-78. Organizational leaders must determine
how this intent affects the various systems for
which they are responsible. By their actions and
those of their subordinates and by using their
presence to be heard, organizational leaders
bring meaning for their intent to their people.
Set Goals
6-79. Once they have established their intent,
organizational leaders, with the help of their
team of subordinate leaders and staffs, set specific goals for their organizations. Goals frame
the organizational leader’s intent. For instance, the goal “Improve fire control and killing power” could support that part of the intent
that states the division will be “trained and
ready to deploy anywhere in the world to fight
and win.” Organizational leaders are personally involved in setting goals and priorities to
execute their intent and are aware that unrealistic goals punish subordinates.
Determine Objectives
6-80. In the third step, organizational leaders
establish objectives that are specific and measurable. For example, an objective that supports
the goal of improving fire control and killing
power could be “Fifty percent of the force must
fire expert on their personal weapons.” Establishing objectives is difficult because the process requires making precise calls from a wide
variety of options. Since time and resources are
limited, organizational leaders make choices
about what can and cannot be accomplished.
They check key system nodes to monitor
subsystem functions.
Determine Tasks
6-81. The fourth step involves determining the
measurable, concrete steps that must be taken
on the way to the objective. For example, the

6-19

Organizational Leadership

commander of a forward-stationed division
might ensure family readiness by ordering that
any newly arriving soldier with a family may
not be deployed without having a vehicle in
country and household goods delivered.
Establish Priorities
6-82. The fifth step is to establish a priority for
the tasks. This crucial step lets subordinates
know how to spend one of their most critical resources: time.
6-83. This system of establishing priorities is
important for the organization; organizational
leaders must also practice it personally. In fact,
a highly developed system of time management
may be the only way for organizational leaders
to handle all the demands upon them. There’s
rarely enough time to do everything, yet they
must make the time to assess and synthesize information and make timely decisions. Leaders
who recognize distractions are better equipped
to handle their time well.
Prepare

they also have more assets: a staff and
additional subordinate leaders, specialists, and
equipment allow their preparation to be diverse
and complete. Direct leaders prepare by getting
individuals moving in the right direction; organizational leaders take a step back and check
to make sure the systems necessary to support
the mission are in place and functioning
correctly.
Follow Up
6-85. The final step in systems planning is to
follow up: Does the team understand the tasks?
Is the team taking the necessary actions to complete them? Check the chain of command again:
does everyone have the word? Organizational
leader involvement in this follow up validates
the priorities and demonstrates that the leader
is serious about seeing the mission completed.
Organizational leaders who fail to follow up
send a message that the priorities are not really
that important and that their orders are not
really binding.

6-84. Though organizational leaders have
more complex missions than direct leaders,

The “Paperwork Purge”
The division’s new chief of staff was surprised at how much time subordinates spent at meetings;
it seemed they had time for little else. After observing the way things worked for two weeks, the chief
did away with most of the scheduled meetings, telling the staff, “We’ll meet when we need to meet,
and not just because it’s Friday morning.” What’s more, the chief required an agenda for each
meeting ahead of time: “That way, people can do their homework and see who needs to be there and
who doesn’t.” The chief was always on time for meetings and started at the time specified on the
agenda. There were no interruptions of whomever had the floor, and the long, meandering speeches
that had marked previous meetings were cut short.
The chief put a one-page limit on briefing papers for the boss. This meant subordinates learned to
write concisely. Each staff section did a top-to-bottom review of procedures that had been in place as
long as anyone could remember. Anything that couldn’t be justified was thrown out. The chief handled
most of the correspondence that came across his desk with a quick note written on the original and
told the staff to do the same.
The chief made the staff justify requirements they sent to subordinate organizations, with the
comment, “If you can’t tell them why it’s important, then maybe it’s not important.” The explanation
also helped subordinate elements determine their own priorities: “You can’t keep sending stuff down
saying, ‘This is critical!’ It gets to be like the boy who cried wolf.”

Operating Actions

The “Paperwork Purge” (continued)
Of course, the staff didn’t take the new chief quite seriously at first, and after a week of reviewing
old policy letters, some staff sections let the requirement slide. Then the chief showed up one day and
had them give him a rundown on all the policies left after what everyone was calling “the big
paperwork purge.” A few more outdated requirements fell by the wayside that afternoon. More
important, the staff got the message that the chief followed through on decisions.
Finally, and most startling, the chief told staff members that now and then they should sit quietly
and stare into space: “You’re getting paid to think, and every once in a while you’ve got to stop moving
to do that well.”

6-86. Keeping their intent in mind, organizational leaders fight distracters, make time to reflect, and seek to work more efficiently. Despite
the pressure of too much to do in too little time,
they keep their sense of humor and help those
around them do the same.
THE CREATIVE STAFF PROCESS
None of us is as smart as all of us.

A Former Brigade Commander
6-87. The size and complexity of the organizations led by organizational leaders requires
well-trained, competent staffs. Training these
staffs is a major responsibility of organizational
leaders. The chief of staff or executive officer is
the organizational leader’s right hand in that
effort.
6-88. In the 100 days leading to the Battle of
Waterloo, Napoleon had to campaign without
his intensely loyal and untiring chief of staff,
Berthier. In all his other campaigns, Berthier
had transformed Napoleon’s orders into
instructions to the marshals, usually in quadruplicate with different riders carrying four copies to the same marshal over different routes.
Berthier’s genius for translating Napoleon’s intent into tasks for each corps underlay the
French Army’s versatile, fluid maneuver style.
Without Berthier and with an increasingly rigid
Napoleon disdaining advice from any source,
Napoleon’s formations lost a good deal of their
flexibility and speed.
6-89. Great staffs work in concert with the
leader to turn intent into reality. A
single leader in isolation has no doubt done

Army Leadership

great things and made good decisions. However, the organizational leader alone can’t consistently make the right decisions in an
environment where operational momentum
never stops.
6-90. Building a creative, thinking staff
requires the commander’s time, maturity, wisdom, and patience. Although managing information is important, the organizational leader
needs to invest in both quality people and in
training them to think rather than just process
information. Several factors contribute to
building a creative, thinking staff.
The Right People
6-91. A high-performing staff starts with putting the right people in the right places. Organizational leaders are limited to their
organization’s resources, but have many
choices about how to use them. They assemble,
from throughout their organizations, people
who think creatively, possess a vast array of
technical skills, are trained to solve problems,
and can work together. They take the time to
evaluate the staff and implement a training
program to improve it as a whole. They avoid
micromanaging the staff, instead trusting and
empowering it to think creatively and provide
answers.
The Chief of Staff
6-92. The staff needs its own leader to take
charge—someone who can focus it, work with
it, inspire it, and move it to decisive action in
the absence of the commander. The sections of
the staff work as equals, yet without superb
leadership they won’t perform exceptionally.

6-21

Organizational Leadership

To make a staff a true team, an empowered deputy must be worthy of the staff and have its respect. The chief of staff must have the courage
to anticipate and demand the best possible
quality. On the other hand, the chief must take
care of the hardworking people who make up
the staff and create an environment that fosters
individual initiative and develops potential.
(FM 100-34 discusses the role of the chief of
staff.)
Challenging Problems
6-93. A staff constantly needs challenging
problems to solve if it’s to build the attitude
that it can overcome any obstacle. Tackling
problems with restricted time and resources
improves the staff members’ confidence and
proficiency, as long as they get an opportunity
to celebrate successes and to recharge their batteries. Great confidence comes from training
under conditions more strenuous than they
would likely face otherwise.
Clear Guidance
6-94. The commander constantly shares
thoughts and guidance with the staff. Welltrained staffs can then synthesize data according to those guidelines. Computers, because of
their ability to handle large amounts of data,
are useful analytical tools, but they can do only
limited, low-order synthesis. There’s no substitute for a clear commander’s intent, clearly understood by every member of the staff.
EXECUTING
The American soldier demonstrated that,
properly equipped, trained, and led, he has no
superior among all the armies of the world.

General Lucian K. Truscott
Former Commanding General, 5th Army

6-95. Planning and preparation for branches
and sequels of a plan and contingencies for future operations may continue, even during execution. However, execution is the purpose for
which the other operating actions occur; at
some point, the organizational leader commits
to action, spurs his organization forward, and
sees the job through to the end. (FM 100-34 and
FM 101-5 discuss branches and sequels.)

6-22

6-96. In combat, organizational leaders
integrate and synchronize all available elements of the combined arms team, empower
subordinates, and assign tasks to accomplish
the mission. But the essence of warfighting for
organizational leaders is their will. They must
persevere despite limitations, setbacks, physical exhaustion, and declining mental and emotional reserves. They then directly and
indirectly energize their units—commanders
and soldiers—to push through confusion and
hardship to victory.
6-97. Whether they’re officers, NCOs, or DA
civilians, the ultimate responsibility of
organizational-level leaders is to accomplish
the mission. To this end, they must mass the
effects of available forces on the battlefield, to
include supporting assets from other services.
The process starts before the fight as leaders
align forces, resources, training, and other supporting systems.
Combined Arms and Joint Warfighting
6-98. Brigades and battalions usually conduct
single-service operations supported by assets
from other services. In contrast, the large areas
of responsibility in which divisions and corps
operate make division and corps fights joint by
nature. Joint task forces (JTFs) are also
organizational-level formations. Therefore, organizational leaders and their staffs at
division-level and higher must understand joint
procedures and concerns at least as well as they
understand Army procedures and concerns. In
addition, it’s not unusual for a corps to control
forces of another nation; divisions do also, but
not as frequently. This means that corps and division headquarters include liaison officers
from other nations. In some cases, these staffs
may have members of other nations permanently assigned: such a staff is truly
multinational.
6-99. Today’s operations present all Army
leaders—but
particularly
organizational
leaders—with a nonlinear, dynamic environment ranging the full spectrum of continuous
operations. These dispersed conditions create
an information-intense environment that
challenges leaders to synchronize their efforts

with nonmilitary and often nongovernmental
agencies.
Empowering
Never tell people how to do things. Tell them
what to do and they will surprise you with their
ingenuity.

General George S. Patton Jr.

War As I Knew It

6-100. To increase the effects of their will, organizational leaders must encourage initiative
in their subordinates. Although unity of command is a principle of war, at some level a single
leader alone can no longer control all elements
of an organization and personally direct the accomplishment of every aspect of its mission. As
leaders approach the brigade or directorate
level, hard work and force of personality alone
cannot carry the organization. Effective organizational leaders delegate authority and support their subordinates’ decisions, while
holding subordinates accountable for their
actions.
6-101. Delegating
successfully
involves
convincing subordinates that they’re empowered, that they indeed have the freedom to act
independently. Empowered subordinates have,
and know they have, more than the responsibility to get the job done. They have the authority
to operate in the way they see fit and are limited
only by the leader’s intent.
6-102. To do that, the organizational leader
gives subordinates the mission, motivates
them, and lets them go. Subordinates know
that the boss trusts them to make the right
things happen; this security motivates them, in
turn, to lead their people with determination.
They know the boss will underwrite honest
mistakes, well-intentioned mistakes—not stupid, careless, or repeated ones. So for the boss,
empowering subordinates means building the
systems and establishing the climate that gives
subordinates the rein to do the job within the
bounds of acceptable risk. It means setting organizational objectives and delegating tasks to
ensure parallel, synchronized progress.
6-103. Delegation is a critical task: Which subordinates can be trusted with independent

Army Leadership

action? Which need a short rein? In fluid situations—especially in combat, where circumstances can change rapidly or where leaders
may be out of touch or become casualties—empowered subordinates will pursue the commander’s intent as the situation develops and react
correctly to changes that previous orders failed
to anticipate. However, as important as delegation is to the success of organizations, it does
not imply in any way a reduction of the commander’s responsibility for the outcome. Only
the commander is accountable for the overall
outcome, the success or failure, of the mission.
ASSESSING
6-104. The ability to assess a situation
accurately and reliably—a critical tool in the
leader’s arsenal—requires instinct and
intuition based on experience and learning. It
also requires a feel for the reliability and validity of information and its sources. Organizational assessment is necessary to determine
organizational weaknesses and preempt mishaps. Accurately determining causes is essential to training management, developing
subordinate
leadership,
and
process
improvement.
6-105. There are several different ways to
gather information: asking subordinates
questions to find out if the word is getting to
them, meeting people, and checking for
synchronized plans are a few. Assessing may
also involve delving into the electronic databases upon which situational understanding
depends. Assessment techniques are more than
measurement tools; in fact, the way a leader assesses something can influence the process being assessed. The techniques used may produce
high quality, useful feedback; however, in a dysfunctional command climate, they can backfire
and send the wrong message about priorities.
6-106. Staff and subordinates manage and process information for a leader, but this doesn’t
relieve the leader from the responsibility of
analyzing information as part of the decisionmaking process. Leaders obtain information
from various sources so they can compare and
make judgments about the accuracy of sources.

6-23

Organizational Leadership

6-107. As Third Army commander during
World War II, GEN George Patton did this continuously. Third Army staff officers visited
front-line units daily to gather the latest
available information. In addition, the 6th Cavalry Group, the so-called “Household Cavalry”
monitored subordinate unit reconnaissance
nets and sent liaison patrols to visit command
and observation posts of units in contact. These
liaison patrols would exchange information
with subordinate unit G2s and G3s and report
tactical and operational information directly to
the Third Army forward headquarters (after
clearing it with the operations section of the
unit they were visiting).
6-108. In addition to providing timely combat
information, the Household Cavalry and staff
visits reduced the number of reports Third
Army headquarters required and created a
sense of cohesiveness and understanding not
found in other field armies. Other organizational leaders have accomplished the
same thing using liaison officers grounded in
their commander’s intent. Whatever the
method they choose, organizational leaders
must be aware of the second- and third-order effects of having “another set of eyes.”
6-109. In the world of digital command and
control, commanders may set screens on
various command and control systems to monitor the status of key units, selected enemy parameters, and critical planning and execution
timelines. They may establish prompts in the
command and control terminal that warn of imminent selected events, such as low fuel levels
in maneuver units, tight fighter management
timelines among aviation crews, or massing enemy artillery.
6-110. A leader’s preconceived notions and
opinions (such as “technology undermines basic skills” or “technology is the answer”) can interfere with objective analysis. It’s also possible
to be too analytical, especially with limited
amounts of information and time. Therefore,
when analyzing information, organizational
leaders guard against dogmatism, impatience,
or overconfidence that may bias their analysis.
6-111. The first step in designing an
assessment system is to determine the purpose

6-24

of the assessment. While purposes vary, most
fall into one of the following categories:

· Evaluate progress toward organizational

goals (using an emergency deployment
readiness exercise to check unit readiness or
monitoring progress of units through stages
of reception, staging, onward movement,
and integration).
· Evaluate the efficiency of a system, that is,
the ratio of the resources expended to the
results gained (comparing the amount of
time spent performing maintenance to the
organization’s readiness rate).
· Evaluate the effectiveness of a system, that
is, the quality of the results it produces
(analyzing the variation in Bradley gunnery scores).
· Compare the relative efficiency or effectiveness against standards.
· Compare the behavior of individuals in a
group with the prescribed standards (APFT
or gunnery scores).
· Evaluate systems supporting the organization (following up “no pay dues” to
see what the NCO support channel did
about them).
6-112. Organizational leaders consider the
direct and indirect costs of assessing. Objective
costs include the manpower required to design
and administer the system and to collect, analyze, and report the data. Costs may also include machine-processing times and expenses
related to communicating the data. Subjective
costs include possible confusion regarding organizational priorities and philosophies, misperceptions
regarding
trust
and
decentralization, fears over unfair use of
collected data, and the energy expended to collect and refine the data.
6-113. Organizational leaders ask themselves
these questions: What’s the standard? Does the
standard make sense to all concerned? Did we
meet it? What system measures it? Who’s responsible for the system? How do we reinforce
or correct our findings? One of the greatest contributions organizational leaders can make to
their organizations is to assess their own leadership actions: Are you doing things the way
you would to support the nation at war? Will

FM 22-100

Operating Actions

your current systems serve equally well under
the stress and strain of continuous fighting? If
not, why not?
6-114. It follows that organizational leaders
who make those evaluations every day will also
hold their organizations to the highest standards. When asked, their closest subordinates
will give them informal AARs of their leadership behaviors in the critical situations. When
they arrange to be part of official AARs, they
can invite subordinates to comment on how
they could have made things go better. Organizational leader errors are very visible; their results are probably observed and felt by many
subordinates. Thus, there’s no sense in not admitting, analyzing. and learning from these errors. A bit of reflection in peacetime may lead to
greater effectiveness in war.

hard work over a period of years, in countless
field exercises on ranges and at the combat
training centers. The continual assessment
process allowed organizational leaders to trade
long hours of hard work in peacetime for operations in war.
6-116. Organizational leaders are personally
dedicated to providing tough, battle-focused
training so that the scrimmage is always harder
than the game. They must ensure that in training, to the extent that resources and risks allow,
nothing
is
simulated.
Constant
assessments refine training challenges, forge
confidence, and foster the quiet, calculating,
and deadly warrior ethos that wins battles and
campaigns. (FM 25-100 and FM 25-101 discuss
battle focus and training assessment.)

Army Leadership

6-117. Improving actions are what all leaders
do today to make their organization and subordinates better tomorrow, next month, next
year, five years from now. The responsibility for
how the Army fights the next war lies with today’s leaders; the work to improve the organization in the long term never ends. Leaders
teaching subordinates to do the leader’s job in
combat is the hallmark of the profession of
arms.
6-118. The payoff for improving actions might
not be evident for years. In fact, leaders at all
levels may never see the benefit of developing
subordinates, since those subordinates go on to
work for someone else. But this doesn’t stop
them from taking pride in their subordinates’
development and performance; a subordinate’s
success is a great measure of a leader’s success.
Further, it’s often difficult to draw a causeand-effect line from what leaders do today to

6-25

Organizational Leadership

how it pays off tomorrow. Precisely because of
these difficulties, organizational leaders ensure
the goals they establish include improving people and organizations. They also make sure
they communicate this to their subordinates.
6-119. The developing, building, and learning
actions may be more difficult at the organizational level because the leaders themselves
must rely more on indirect leadership methods.
The challenge is greater because of the size of
the organization, but the rewards increase as
well: organizational leaders can influence large
numbers of people and improve large segments
of the Army.
DEVELOPING
Let us set for ourselves a standard so high that it
will be a glory to live up to it, and then let us live
up to it and add a new laurel to the crown of
America.

Woodrow Wilson
28th President of the United States

6-120. Just as leadership begins at the top, so
does developing. Organizational leaders keep a
focus on where the organization needs to go and
what all leaders must be capable of accomplishing. They continually develop themselves and
mentor their subordinate leaders. As discussed
in Chapter 3, leaders search for and take advantage of opportunities to mentor their subordinates. At the organizational level, commanders
ensure that systems and conditions are in place
for the mentoring of all organizational
members.
6-121. Effective organizational leaders grow
leaders at all levels of their organization. Just
as they prepare their units for in-stride
breaches, for example, they combine existing
opportunities into a coherent plan for
leadership development. Leaders get much of
their development when they practice what
they’ve learned and receive straightforward
feedback in rigorously honest AARs. Feedback
also comes from self-assessments as well as
from peers, subordinates, and supervisors.
6-122. Organizational leaders design and integrate leader development programs into everyday training. They aim to capture learning in

6-26

common duties, ensure timely feedback, and allow reflection and analysis. As Frederick the
Great said, “What good is experience if you do
not reflect?” Simply scheduling officer and
NCO professional development sessions isn’t
enough
for
genuine,
lasting
leader
development. Letting “operating” overwhelm
“improving” threatens the future.
6-123. Leadership development is purposeful,
not accidental. Everyday mission requirements
are opportunities to grow leaders. Based on assessment of their subordinate leaders, organizational leaders describe how they intend to
deliberately influence leader development
through a comprehensive leadership development program that captures and harnesses
what’s already occurring in the organization. A
leadership development program must provide
for learning skills, practicing actions, and
receiving feedback.
6-124. Organizational leaders assess their organizations to determine organization-specific
developmental needs. They analyze their mission, equipment, and long-term schedule as
well as the experience and competence of their
subordinate leaders to determine leadership requirements. In addition to preparing their immediate subordinates to take their place,
organizational leaders must also prepare subordinate leaders selected for specific duties to actually execute them.
6-125. Based on their assessment, organizational leaders define and clearly articulate their goals and objectives for leadership
development within the organization. They create program goals and objectives to support
their focus as well as to communicate specific
responsibilities for subordinate leaders. These
subordinate leaders help bring leadership development to life through constant mentoring
and experiential learning opportunities. Leadership development is an important responsibility shared by leaders at every level. It
becomes their greatest contribution—their
legacy.
6-126. The development technique used
depends on the leaders involved. Learning by
making mistakes is possible, but having subordinates develop habits of succeeding is better

FM 22-100

Improving Actions

for instilling self-confidence and initiative.
Newly assigned assistant operations officers
may need time to visit remote sites over which
they have day-to-day control. They may need
time to visit higher headquarters to establish
rapport with those action officers they will have
to deal with under the pressure of a tense operational situation. They may have to see the tactical operations center set up in the field and get
a chance to review its SOPs before a big exercise. These activities can only happen if the organizational leader supports the leader
development program and demands it take
place in spite of the pressures of daily (routine)
business.
6-127. There are many ways to tackle leader
development. For example, instead of pursuing
long-term training programs for his career civilians, one DA civilian leader enrolled both his
DA civilian managers and military officers in
graduate programs while they continued to
work full-time. This approach allowed the
directorate to provide development opportunities to four times as many personnel at onethird the cost of long-term training. In addition,
the students were able to apply what they were
learning directly to their jobs, thus providing
immediate benefit to the organization.
6-128. In addition to educational programs, innovative interagency exchange assignments
can cross-level the knowledge, skills, and experience of DA civilian leaders. Whether taking on
new interns or expanding the perspectives of
seasoned managers, the DA civilian component
mirrors the uniformed components in its approach to broad-based leadership opportunities.
6-129. Often developmental programs involve
historical events similar to current operational
challenges. Such situations allow all to share a
sense of what works and what does not from
what worked before and what did not. This
analysis can also be applied to recent organizational experiences. For example, in preparation
for a CTC rotation, leaders review their own as
well as others’ experiences to determine valuable lessons learned. They master the individual and collective tasks through a training
program that sets up soldiers and leaders for
success. Based on internal AARs, they continue

Army Leadership

to learn, practice, and assess. CTCs also provide
individual leaders with invaluable experience
in operating under harsh conditions. Organizations execute missions, receive candid feedback
and coaching to facilitate lessons learned, then
execute again.
6-130. Commanders must take the time to
ensure they do developmental counseling.
Nothing can replace the face-to-face contribution made by a commander mentoring a
subordinate. Developing the most talented
and (often) those with the greatest challenges
requires a great amount of time and energy,
but it’s an essential investment for the
future.
BUILDING
Building Combat Power
6-131. Emphasis on winning can’t waver
during training, deploying, and fighting. By developing the right systems and formulating appropriate contingency plans, organizational
leaders ensure that the organization is
prepared for a variety of conditions and uncertainties. In wartime, building combat power derives from task organization, resourcing, and
preparing for execution while still meeting the
human needs of the organization. Commanders
must preserve and recycle organizational energy throughout the campaign. In peacetime,
the main component of potential combat power
is embedded collective skill and organizational
readiness stemming from hard, continuous,
and challenging training to standard.
Building Teams
All United States military doctrine is based
upon reliance on the ingenuity of the individual
working on his own initiative as a member of a
team and using the most modern weapons and
equipment which can be provided him.

General Manton S. Eddy
Commanding General, XII Corps, World War II

6-132. Organizational leaders rely on others to
follow and execute their intent. Turning a
battlefield vision or training goals into reality
takes the combined efforts of many teams
inside and outside of the leader’s organization.

Organizational leaders build solid, effective
teams by developing and training them and sustain those teams by creating healthy
organizational climates.

consistently to create individual and team ownership of organizational goals. By knowing
their subordinates—their aspirations, fears,
and concerns—organizational leaders can ensure their subordinate organizations and leaders work together. Taking time to allow
subordinates to develop ways to meet organizational missions fosters ownership of a plan. The
FM 25-100 training management process, in
which subordinate organizations define supporting tasks and suggest the training required
to gain and maintain proficiency, is an example
of a process that encourages collective investment in training. That investment leads to a
commitment that not only supports execution
but also reduces the chances of internal
conflict.
6-134. Subordinates work hard and fight
tenaciously when they’re well-trained and feel
they’re part of a good team. Collective
confidence comes from winning under challenging and stressful conditions. People’s sense of
belonging comes from technical and tactical
proficiency—as
individuals
and
then
collectively as a team—and the confidence they
have in their peers and their leaders. As
cohesive teams combine into a network, a team
of teams, organizations work in harness with
those on the left and right to fight as a whole.
The balance among three good battalions is
more important than having a single outstanding one. Following that philosophy necessarily

assignment.
6-135. Organizational leaders build cohesive
organizations. They overcome, and even
capitalize on, diversity of background and experience to create the energy necessary to achieve
organizational goals. They resolve conflicts
among subordinate leaders as well as any conflicts between their own organization and
others.
6-136. For example, subordinate leaders may
compete for limited resources while pursuing

6-28

their individual organization’s goals. Two
battalion commanders may both want and need
a certain maneuver training area to prepare for
deployment, so they both present the issue professionally and creatively to their commander.
The brigade commander must then weigh and
decide between the different unit requirements, balancing their competing demands
with the greater good of the entire organization
and the Army. An even better situation would
be if the organizational climate facilitates teamwork and cooperation that results in the subordinate commanders themselves producing a
satisfactory solution.
6-137. Similarly, the brigade commander’s
own interests may at times conflict with that of
other organizations. He must maintain a broad
perspective and develop sensible solutions for
positive resolution with his contemporaries. In
both these cases, subordinates observe the actions of leaders and pattern their attitudes and
actions after them. Everyone, even experienced
leaders, looks up the chain of command for the
example of “how we do it here,” how to do it
right. Organizational leaders empower their
subordinates with a powerful personal
example.
6-138. Like direct leaders, organizational leaders build teams by keeping team members informed. They share information, solicit input,
and consider suggestions. This give-and-take
also allows subordinates a glimpse into the
mind of their leaders, which helps them prepare
for the day when they fill that job. The leader
who sends these messages—“I value your opinion; I’m preparing you for greater responsibilities; you’re part of the team”—strengthens the
bonds that hold the team together.
6-139. Team building produces trust. Trust begins with action, when leaders demonstrate discipline
and
competence.
Over
time,
subordinates learn that leaders do what they
say they’ll do. Likewise leaders learn to trust
their subordinates. That connection, that mutual assurance, is the link that helps organizations accomplish the most difficult tasks. (FM
100-34 discusses the importance of building
trust for command and control.)

FM 22-100

Improving Actions

LEARNING
6-140. Organizational leaders create an
environment that supports people within their
organizations learning from their own experiences and the experiences of others. How
leaders react to failure and encourage success
now is critical to reaching excellence in the future. Subordinates who feel they need to hide
mistakes deprive others of valuable lessons.
Organizational leaders set the tone for this
honest sharing of experiences by acknowledging that not all experiences (even their own) are
successful. They encourage subordinates to examine their experiences, and make it easy for
them to share what they learn.

6-141. Learning is continuous and occurs
throughout an organization: someone is always
experiencing something from which a lesson
can be drawn. For this reason, organizational
leaders ensure continual teaching at all levels;
the organization as a whole shares knowledge
and applies relevant lessons. They have systems in place to collect and disseminate those
lessons so that individual mistakes become organizational tools. This commitment improves
organizational programs, processes, and
performances.

SECTION III
A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE OF ORGANIZATIONAL
LEADERSHIP—GENERAL RIDGWAY IN KOREA
6-142. Few leaders have better exemplified effective organizational leadership in combat
than GEN Matthew B. Ridgway. GEN Ridgway
successfully led the 82d Airborne Division and
XVIII Airborne Corps in the ETO during World
War II and Eighth (US) Army during the Korean War. His actions during four months in
command of Eighth Army prior to his appointment as UN Supreme Commander bring to life
the skills and actions described throughout this
chapter.
6-143. At the outbreak of the Korean War in
June 1950, GEN Ridgway was assigned as the
Army Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations. In an
agreement between the Army Chief of Staff,
GEN J. Lawton Collins, and the UN Supreme
Commander, GA Douglas MacArthur, GEN
Ridgway was identified early as the replacement for the Eighth Army commander,
GEN Walton H. Walker, in the event GEN
Walker was killed in combat.
6-144. That year, on 23 December, GEN
Walker died in a jeep accident. Following
approval by Secretary of Defense George C.
Marshall and President Truman, GEN Ridgway
was ordered to take command of Eighth Army.
At that time, Eighth Army was defending near

Army Leadership

the 38th parallel, having completed a 300-mile
retreat after the Chinese intervention and stunning victory on the Chongchin River.
6-145. The UN defeat had left its forces in serious disarray. One of Eighth Army’s four American divisions, the 2d, needed extensive
replacements and reorganization. Two other divisions, the 25th and 1st Cavalry, were
seriously battered. Of the Republic of Korea divisions, only the 1st was in good fighting shape.
A British brigade was combat ready, but it too
had suffered substantial losses in helping cover
the retreat.
6-146. Within 24 hours of GEN Walker’s death,
GEN Ridgway was bound for Korea. During the
long flight from Washington, DC, to GA MacArthur’s headquarters in Japan, GEN Ridgway
had an opportunity to reflect on what lay ahead.
He felt this problem was like so many others he
had experienced: “Here’s the situation—what’s
your solution?” He began to formulate his plan
of action. He determined each step based on his
assessment of the enemy’s strengths and capabilities as well as his own command’s strengths
and capabilities.

6-29

Organizational Leadership

6-147. The necessary steps seemed clear: gain
an appreciation for the immediate situation
from GA MacArthur’s staff, establish his
presence as Eighth Army commander by sending a statement of his confidence in them, and
then meet with his own staff to establish his
priorities. His first message to his new
command was straight to the point: “You will
have my utmost. I shall expect yours.”
6-148. During the flight from Japan to his forward command post, GEN Ridgway carefully
looked at the terrain upon which he was to
fight. The battered Eighth Army had to cover a
rugged, 100-mile-long front that restricted both
maneuver and resupply. Poor morale presented
a further problem. Many military observers felt
that Eighth Army lacked spirit and possessed
little stomach for continuing the bruising battle
with the Chinese.
6-149. For three days GEN Ridgway traveled
the army area by jeep, talking with commanders who had faced the enemy beyond the
Han River. GEN Ridgway wrote later,
I held to the old-fashioned idea that it helped the
spirits of the men to see the Old Man up there, in
the snow and the sleet and the mud, sharing the
same cold, miserable existence they had to
endure.
6-150. GEN Ridgway believed a commander
should publicly show a personal interest in the
well-being of his soldiers. He needed to do
something to attract notice and display his concern for the front-line fighters. Finding that
one of his units was still short of some winter
equipment, GEN Ridgway dramatically ordered that the equipment be delivered within
24 hours. In response, the logistical command
made a massive effort to comply, flying equipment from Pusan to the front lines. Everyone
noticed. He also ordered—and made sure the
order was known—that the troops be served
hot meals, with any failures to comply reported
directly to him.
6-151. GEN Ridgway was candid, criticizing
the spirit of both the commanders and soldiers
of Eighth Army. He talked with riflemen and
generals, from front-line foxholes to corps command posts. He was appalled at American

6-30

infantrymen who didn’t patrol, who had no
knowledge of the terrain in which they fought,
and who failed to know the whereabouts of
their enemy. Moreover, this army was roadbound and failed to occupy commanding terrain
overlooking its positions and supply lines. GEN
Ridgway also sensed that Eighth Army—particularly
the
commanders
and
their
staffs—kept looking over their shoulders for
the best route to the rear and planned only for
retreat. In short, he found his army immobilized and demoralized.
6-152. An important part of GEN Ridgway’s effort to instill fighting spirit in Eighth Army was
to order units to close up their flanks and tie in
with other units. He said he wanted no units
cut off and abandoned, as had happened to the
3d Battalion, 8th Cavalry at Unsan, Task Force
Faith at Chosin Reservoir, and the 2d Division
at Kuni-ri. GEN Ridgway felt that it was essential for soldiers to know they would not be left
to fend for themselves if cut off. He believed
that soldiers would be persuaded to stand and
fight only if they realized help would come.
Without that confidence in the command and
their fellow soldiers, they would pull out, fearing to be left behind.
6-153. As he visited their headquarters, GEN
Ridgway spoke to commanders and their staffs.
These talks contained many of his ideas about
proper combat leadership. He told his commanders to get out of their command posts and
up to the front. When commanders reported on
terrain, GEN Ridgway demanded that they
base their information on personal knowledge
and that it be correct.
6-154. Furthermore, he urged commanders to
conduct intensive training in night fighting and
make full use of their firepower. He also required commanders to personally check that
their men had adequate winter clothing, warming tents, and writing materials. In addition, he
encouraged commanders to locate wounded
who had been evacuated and make every effort
to return them to their old units. Finally, the
army commander ordered his officers to stop
wasting resources, calling for punishment of
those who lost government equipment.

FM 22-100

Historical Perspective

6-155. During its first battle under GEN
Ridgway’s command in early January 1951,
Eighth Army fell back another 70 miles and lost
Seoul, South Korea’s capital. Major commanders didn’t carry out orders to fall back in an orderly fashion, use field artillery to inflict the
heaviest possible enemy casualties, and counterattack in force during daylight hours. Eighth
Army’s morale and sense of purpose reached
their lowest point ever.
6-156. Eighth Army had only two choices: substantially improve its fighting spirit or get out
of Korea. GEN Ridgway began to restore his
men’s fighting spirit by ordering aggressive patrolling into areas just lost. When patrols found
the enemy few in number and not aggressive,
the army commander increased the number
and size of patrols. His army discovered it could
drive back the Chinese without suffering overwhelming casualties. Buoyed by these successes, GEN Ridgway ordered a general
advance along Korea’s west coast, where the
terrain was more open and his forces could take
advantage of its tanks, artillery, and aircraft.
6-157. During this advance, GEN Ridgway also
attempted to tell the men of Eighth Army why
they were fighting in Korea. He sought to build
a fighting spirit in his men based on unit and
soldier pride. In addition, he called on them to
defend Western Civilization from Communist
degradation, saying:
In the final analysis, the issue now joined right
here in Korea is whether Communism or
individual freedom shall prevail; whether the
flight of the fear-driven people we have
witnessed here shall be checked, or shall at some
future time, however distant, engulf our own
loved ones in all its misery and despair.
6-158. In mid-February of 1951, the Chinese
and North Koreans launched yet another offensive in the central area of Korea, where US
tanks could not maneuver as readily and artillery could be trapped on narrow roads in mountainous terrain. In heavy fights at Chipyon-ni
and Wonju, Eighth Army, for the first time, re-

Army Leadership

pulsed the Communist attacks. Eighth Army’s
offensive spirit soared as GEN Ridgway quickly
followed up with a renewed attack that took
Seoul and regained roughly the same positions
Eight Army had held when he first took command. In late March, Eighth Army pushed the
Communist forces north of the 38th parallel.
6-159. GEN Ridgway’s actions superbly
exemplify those expected of organizational
leaders. His knowledge of American soldiers,
units, and the Korean situation led him to certain expectations. Those expectations gave him
a baseline from which to assess his command
once he arrived. He continually visited units
throughout the army area, talked with soldiers
and their commanders, assessed command climate, and took action to mold attitudes with
clear intent, supreme confidence, and unyielding tactical discipline.
6-160. He sought to develop subordinate commanders and their staffs by sharing his
thoughts and expectations of combat
leadership. He felt the pulse of the men on the
front, shared their hardships, and demanded
they be taken care of. He pushed the logistical
systems to provide creature comforts as well as
the supplies of war. He eliminated the
skepticism of purpose, gave soldiers cause to
fight, and helped them gain confidence by winning small victories. Most of all, he led by
example.
6-161. In April GEN Ridgway turned Eighth
Army over to GEN James A. Van Fleet. In
under four months, a dynamic, aggressive commander had revitalized and transformed a traumatized and desperate army into a proud,
determined fighting force. GA Omar N.
Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
summed up GEN Ridgway’s contributions:
It is not often that a single battlefield commander
can make a decisive difference. But in Korea
Ridgway would prove to be that exception. His
brilliant, driving, uncompromising leadership
would turn the tide of battle like no other general’s
in our military history.

6-31

Organizational Leadership

SUMMARY
6-162. This chapter has covered how organizational leaders train and lead staffs, subordinate leaders, and entire organizations. The
influence of organizational leaders is primarily
indirect: they communicate and motivate
through staffs and subordinate commanders.
Because their leadership is much more indirect,
the eventual outcomes of their actions are often
difficult to foresee. Nor do organizational leaders receive the immediate feedback that direct
leaders do.
6-163. Still, as demonstrated by GEN Ridgway
in Korea, the presence of commanders at the
critical time and place boosts confidence and
performance. Regardless of the type of organization they head, organizational leaders direct
operations by setting the example, empowering
their subordinates and organizations and supervising them appropriately. Organizational

6-32

leaders concern themselves with combat
power—how to build, maintain, and recover it.
That includes developing systems that will provide the organization and the Army with its
next generation of leaders. They also improve
conditions by sustaining an ethical and supportive climate, building strong cohesive teams
and organizations, and improving the processes
that work within the organization.
6-164. Strategic leaders provide leadership at
the highest levels of the Army. Their influence
is even more indirect and the consequences of
their actions more delayed than those of organizational leaders. Because of this, strategic leaders must develop additional skills based on
those they’ve mastered as direct and organizational leaders. Chapter 7 discusses these and
other aspects of strategic leadership.

Chapter 7

Strategic Leadership
It became clear to me that at the age of 58 I would have to learn new tricks that were not taught
in the military manuals or on the battlefield. In this position I am a political soldier and will
have to put my training in rapping-out orders and making snap decisions on the back burner,
and have to learn the arts of persuasion and guile. I must become an expert in a whole new set
of skills.

General of the Army George C. Marshall

7-1. Strategic leaders are the Army’s highestlevel thinkers, warfighters, and politicalmilitary experts. Some work in an institutional
setting within the United States; others work
in strategic regions around the world. They simultaneously sustain the Army’s culture, envision the future, convey that vision to a wide
audience, and personally lead change. Strategic
leaders look at the environment outside the
Army today to understand the context for the
institution’s future role. They also use their
knowledge of the current force to anchor their
vision in reality. This chapter outlines strategic
leadership for audiences other than the general
officers and Senior Executive Service DA civilians who actually lead there. Those who support strategic leaders need to understand the
distinct environment in which these leaders
work and the special considerations it requires.

environment requires an in-depth knowledge of
the political, economic, informational, and military elements of national power as well as the
interrelationship among them. In short, strategic leaders not only know themselves and their
own organizations but also understand a host of
different players, rules, and conditions.
7-4. Because strategic leaders implement the
National Military Strategy, they deal with the
elements that shape that strategy. The most important of these are Presidential Decision
Memorandums, Department of State Policies,
the will of the American people, US national secu ri t y i n t e re s t s , an d t he co l l e c ti v e
strategies—theater and functional—of the combatant commanders (CINCs). Strategic leaders
operate in intricate networks of competing

7-2. Strategic leadership requires significantly
different techniques in both scope and skill
from direct and organizational leadership. In
an environment of extreme uncertainty,
complexity, ambiguity, and volatility, strategic
leaders think in multiple time domains and operate flexibly to manage change. Moreover,
strategic leaders often interact with other leaders over whom they have minimal authority.

constituencies and cooperate in endeavors extending beyond their establishments. As institutional leaders, they represent their organizations to soldiers, DA civilians, citizens, statesmen, and the media, as well as to other services
and nations. Communicating effectively with
these different audiences is vital to the organization’s success.
7-5. Strategic leaders are keenly aware of the
complexities of the national security environment. Their decisions take into account
factors such as congressional hearings, Army
budget constraints, reserve component issues,
new systems acquisition, DA civilian programs,
research, development, and interservice cooperation. Strategic leaders process information
from these areas quickly, assess alternatives
based on incomplete data, make decisions, and
garner support. Often, highly developed interpersonal skills are essential to building consensus among civilian and military policy makers.
Limited interpersonal skills can limit the effect
of other skills.

7-6. While direct and organizational leaders
have a short-term focus, strategic leaders have
a “future focus.” Strategic leaders spend much
of their time looking toward the mid-term and
positioning their establishments for long-term
success, even as they contend with immediate
issues. With that perspective, strategic leaders
seldom see the whole life span of their ideas; initiatives at this level may take years to come to
fruition. Strategic leaders think, therefore, in
terms of strategic systems that will operate
over extended time periods. They ensure these
systems are built in accord with the six imperatives mentioned in Chapter 6—quality people,
training, force mix, doctrine, modern equipment, and leader development—and they ensure that programs and resources are in place
to sustain them. This systems approach sharpens strategic leaders’ “future focus” and helps
align separate actions, reduce conflict, and improve cooperation.

SECTION I
STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP SKILLS
7-7. The values and attributes demanded of
Army leaders are the same at all leadership levels. Strategic leaders live by Army values and set
the example just as much as direct and organizational leaders, but they face additional challenges. Strategic leaders affect the culture of the
entire Army and may find themselves involved
in political decision making at the highest national or even global levels. Therefore, nearly
any task strategic leaders set out to accomplish
requires more coordination, takes longer, has a
wider impact, and produces longer-term effects
than a similar organizational-level task.

7-8. Strategic leaders understand, embody, and
execute values-based leadership. The political
and long-term nature of their decisions doesn’t
release strategic leaders from the current demands of training, readiness, and unforeseen
crises; they are responsible to continue to work
toward the ultimate goals of the force, despite
the burden of those events. Army values provide
the constant reference for actions in the stressful environment of strategic leaders. Strategic
leaders understand, embody, and execute leadership based on Army values.

INTERPERSONAL SKILLS
7-9. Strategic leaders continue to use interpersonal skills developed as direct and organizational leaders, but the scope, responsibilities,
and authority of strategic positions require
leaders with unusually sophisticated interpersonal skills. Internally, there are more levels of

7-2

people to deal with; externally, there are more
interactions with outside agencies, with the media, even with foreign governments. Knowing
the Army’s needs and goals, strategic leaders
patiently but tenaciously labor to convince the
proper people about what the Army must have

communications skills as they represent their
organizations. One of the most prominent differences between strategic leaders and leaders
at other levels is the greater importance of symbolic communication. The example strategic
leaders set, their decisions, and their actions
have meaning beyond their immediate consequences to a much greater extent than those of
direct and organizational leaders.
7-12. Thus, strategic leaders identify those
actions that send messages. Then they use their
positions to send the desired messages to their
organizations and ensure that the right
audiences hear them. The messages strategic
leaders send set the example in the largest
sense. For instance, messages that support traditions, Army values, or a particular program
indicate the strategic leader’s priorities.
7-13. Thus, strategic leaders communicate not
only to the organization but also to a large
external audience that includes the political
leadership, media, and the American people. To
influence those audiences, strategic leaders
seek to convey integrity and win trust. As GA
Marshall noted, they become expert in “the art
of persuasion.”

7-10. Strategic leaders and their staffs develop
networks of knowledgeable individuals in organizations and agencies that influence their
own organizations. Through penetrating assessments, these leaders seek to understand the
personal strengths and weaknesses of all the
main players on a particular issue. Strategic
leaders are adept at reading other people, and
they work to completely control their own actions and reactions. Armed with improved
knowledge of others, self-control, and
established networks, strategic leaders influence external events by providing leadership,
timely and relevant information, and access to
the right people and agencies.

7-14. Strategic leaders commit to a few common, powerful, and consistent messages and repeat them over and over in different forms and
settings. They devise a communications campaign plan, written or conceptual, that outlines
how to deal with each target group. When preparing to address a specific audience, they determine its composition and agenda so they
know how best to reach its members. Finding
some apparent success with the medium, frequency, and words of the message, strategic
leaders determine the best way to measure the
message’s effectiveness and continually scan
and assess the environment to make sure that
the message is going to all the right groups.

COMMUNICATING

USING DIALOGUE

7-11. Communication at the strategic level is
complicated by the wide array of staff,
functional, and operational components interacting with each other and with external agencies. These complex relationships require
strategic leaders to employ comprehensive

7-15. One of the forms of communication that
strategic leaders use to persuade individuals,
rather than groups, is dialogue. Dialogue is a
conversation between two or more people. It requires not only active listening, but carefully
considering what’s said (and not said), logically

Army Leadership

7-3

Strategic Leadership

assessing it without personal bias, and specifying issues that are not understood or don’t
make sense within the strategic leader’s frame
of reference. By using dialogue to thoroughly
exchange points of view, assumptions, and concepts, strategic leaders gather information,
clarify issues, and enlist support of subordinates and peers.

unspoken agendas and detach themselves from
the negotiation process. Successful negotiating
involves communicating a clear position on all
issues while still conveying willingness to bargain on negotiable issues, recognizing what’s
acceptable to all concerned, and achieving a
compromise that meets the needs of all participants to the greatest extent possible.

NEGOTIATING

7-19. Sometimes strategic leaders to put out a
proposal early so the interchange and ultimate
solution revolve around factors important to
the Army. However, they are confident enough
to resist the impulse to leave their thumbprints
on final products. Strategic leaders don’t have
to claim every good idea because they know
they will have more. Their understanding of
selfless service allows them to subordinate personal recognition to negotiated settlements
that produce the greatest good for their establishment, the Army, and the nation or coalition.

7-16. Many relationships between strategiclevel organizations are lateral and without clear
subordination. Often, strategic leaders rely
heavily on negotiating skills to obtain the cooperation and support necessary to accomplish a
mission or meet the command’s needs. For example, commanders of the national contingents
that made up the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) implementation force (IFOR)
sent to Bosnia to support the 1995 Dayton peace
accords all had limitations imposed on the extent of their participation. In addition, they all
had direct lines to their home governments,
which they used when they believed IFOR commanders exceeded those limits. NATO strategic
leaders had to negotiate some actions that ordinarily would have required only issuing orders.
They often had to interpret a requirement to the
satisfaction of one or more foreign governments.
7-17. Successful negotiation requires a range
of interpersonal skills. Good negotiators are
also able to visualize several possible end states
while maintaining a clear idea of the best end
state from the command’s perspective. One of
the most important skills is the ability to stand
firm on nonnegotiable points while simultaneously communicating respect for other participants and their negotiating limits. In
international forums, firmness and respect
demonstrate that the negotiator knows and understands US interests. That understanding
can help the negotiator persuade others of the
validity of US interests and convince others
that the United States understands and respects the interests of other states.
7-18. A good negotiator is particularly skilled
in active listening. Other essential personal
characteristics include perceptiveness and objectivity. Negotiators must be able to diagnose

7-4

ACHIEVING CONSENSUS
7-20. Strategic leaders are skilled at reaching
consensus and building and sustaining coalitions. They may apply these skills to tasks as
diverse as designing combatant commands,
JTFs, and policy working groups or determining the direction of a major command or the
Army as an institution. Strategic leaders routinely weld people together for missions lasting
from months to years. Using peer leadership
rather than strict positional authority, strategic leaders oversee progress toward their visualized end state and monitor the health of the
relationships necessary to achieve it. Interpersonal contact sets the tone for professional relations: strategic leaders are tactful and
discreet.
7-21. GA Eisenhower’s creation of SHAEF
during World War II (which was mentioned in
Chapter 2) is an outstanding example of
coalition building and sustainment. GA Eisenhower insisted on unity of command over the
forces assigned to him. He received this authority from both the British and US governments
but exercised it through an integrated command and staff structure that related influence
roughly to the contribution of the nations involved. The sections within SHAEF all had

FM 22-100

Interpersonal Skills

chiefs of one nationality and deputies of
another.
7-22. GA Eisenhower also insisted that
military, rather than political, criteria would
predominate in his operational and strategic
decisions as Supreme Allied Commander. His
most controversial decisions, adoption of the

so-called broad-front strategy and the refusal to
race the Soviet forces to Berlin, rested on his belief that maintaining the Anglo-American alliance was a national interest and his personal
responsibility. Many historians argue that this
feat of getting the Allies to work together was
his most important contribution to the war.

Allied Command During the Battle of the Bulge
A pivotal moment in the history of the Western Alliance arrived on 16 December 1944, when the
German Army launched a massive offensive in a lightly held-sector of the American line in the
Ardennes Forest. This offensive, which became known as the Battle of the Bulge, split GEN Omar
Bradley’s Twelfth Army Group. North of the salient, British GEN Bernard Montgomery commanded
most of the Allied forces, so GA Eisenhower shifted command of the US forces there to GEN
Montgomery rather than have one US command straddle the gap. GEN Bradley, the Supreme Allied
Commander reasoned, could not effectively control forces both north and south of the penetration. It
made more sense for GEN Montgomery to command all Allied forces on the northern shoulder and
GEN Bradley all those on its southern shoulder. GA Eisenhower personally telephoned GEN Bradley
to tell his old comrade of the decision. With the SHAEF staff still present, GA Eisenhower passed the
order to his reluctant subordinate, listened to GEN Bradley’s protests, and then said sharply, “Well,
Brad, those are my orders.”
According to historian J.D. Morelock, this short conversation, more than any other action taken by
GA Eisenhower and the SHAEF staff during the battle, “discredited the German assumption that
nationalistic fears and rivalries would inhibit prompt and effective steps to meet the German
challenge.” It demonstrated GA Eisenhower’s “firm grasp of the true nature of an allied command” and
it meant that Hitler’s gamble to win the war had failed.

7-23. Across the Atlantic Ocean, GA George C.
Marshall, the Army Chief of Staff, also had to
seek consensus with demanding peers, none
more so than ADM Ernest J. King, Commander
in Chief, US Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations. GA Marshall expended great personal energy to ensure that interservice feuding at the
top didn’t mar the US war effort. ADM King, a
forceful leader with strong and often differing
views, responded in kind. Because of the ability
of these two strategic leaders to work in harmony, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had few
issues of major consequence to resolve once he
had issued a decision and guidance.
7-24. Opportunities for strategic leadership
may come at surprising moments. For instance,
Joshua Chamberlain’s greatest contribution to

Army Leadership

our nation may have been not at Gettysburg or
Petersburg, but at Appomattox. By that time a
major general, Chamberlain was chosen to command the parade at which GEN Lee’s Army of
Northern Virginia laid down its arms and colors. GEN Grant had directed a simple ceremony that recognized the Union victory
without humiliating the Confederates.
7-25. However, MG Chamberlain sensed the
need for something even greater. Instead of
gloating as the vanquished army passed, he directed his bugler to sound the commands for attention and present arms. His units came to
attention and rendered a salute, following his
order out of respect for their commander, certainly not out of sudden warmth for recent enemies. That act set the tone for reconciliation

7-5

and reconstruction and marks a brilliant
leader, brave in battle and respectful in peace,
who knew when, where, and how to lead.
BUILDING STAFFS
The best executive is the one who has sense
enough to pick good men to do what he wants
done, and self-restraint enough to keep from
meddling with them while they do it.

Theodore Roosevelt
26th President of the United States
7-26. Until Army leaders reach the highest levels, they cannot staff positions and projects as
they prefer. Strategic leaders have not only the
authority but also the responsibility to pick the
best people for their staffs. They seek to put the
right people in the right places, balancing
strengths and weaknesses for the good of the
nation. They mold staffs able to package concise, unbiased information and build networks
across organizational lines. Strategic leaders
make so many wide-ranging, interrelated decisions that they must have imaginative staff
members who know the environment, foresee
consequences of various courses of action, and
identify crucial information accordingly.
7-27. With their understanding of the strategic
environment and vision for the future, strategic
leaders seek to build staffs that compensate for

their weaknesses, reinforce their vision, and ensure institutional success. Strategic leaders
can’t afford to be surrounded by staffs that
blindly agree with everything they say. Not
only do they avoid surrounding themselves
with “yes-men,” they also reward staff members for speaking the truth. Strategic leaders
encourage their staffs to participate in dialogue
with them, discuss alternative points of view,
and explore all facts, assumptions, and implications. Such dialogue assists strategic leaders to
fully assess all aspects of an issue and helps
clarify their intent and guidance.
7-28. As strategic leaders build and use their
staffs, they continually seek honesty and
competence. Strategic-level staffs must be able
to discern what the “truth” is. During World
War II, GA Marshall’s ability to fill his staff and
commands with excellent officers made a difference in how quickly the Army could create a
wartime force able to mobilize, deploy, fight,
and win. Today’s strategic leaders face an environment more complex than the one GA Marshall faced. They often have less time than GA
Marshall had to assess situations, make plans,
prepare an appropriate response, and execute.
The importance of building courageous, honest,
and competent staffs has correspondingly
increased.

CONCEPTUAL SKILLS
From an intellectual standpoint, Princeton was a world-shaking experience. It fundamentally
changed my approach to life. The basic thrust of the curriculum was to give students an
appreciation of how complex and diverse various political systems and issues are....The
bottom line was that answers had to be sought in terms of the shifting relationships of groups
and individuals, that politics pervades all human activity, a truth not to be condemned but
appreciated and put to use.

Conceptual
7-29. Strategic leaders, more than direct and organizational leaders, draw on their conceptual
skills to comprehend national, national security,
and theater strategies, operate in the strategic
and theater contexts, and improve their vast,
complex organizations. The variety and scope of
their concerns demand the application of more
sophisticated concepts.
7-30. Strategic leaders need wisdom—and wisdom isn’t just knowledge. They routinely deal
with diversity, complexity, ambiguity, change,
uncertainty, and conflicting policies. They are
responsible for developing well-reasoned positions and providing their views and advice to

Army Leadership

our nation’s highest leaders. For the good of
the Army and the nation, strategic leaders seek
to determine what’s important now and what
will be important in the future. They develop
the necessary wisdom by freeing themselves to
stay in touch with the force and spending time
thinking, simply thinking.
ENVISIONING
It is in the minds of the commanders that the
issue of battle is really decided.

Sir Basil H. Liddell Hart
7-31. Strategic leaders design compelling visions for their organizations and inspire a collaborative effort to articulate the vision in
detail. They then communicate that vision
clearly and use it to create a plan, gain support,
and focus subordinates’ work. Strategic leaders
have the further responsibility of defining for
their diverse organizations what counts as success in achieving the vision. They monitor their
progress by drawing on personal observations,
review and analysis, strategic management
plans, and informal discussions with soldiers
and DA civilians.
7-32. Strategic leaders look realistically at
what the future may hold. They consider things
they know and things they can anticipate. They
incorporate new ideas, new technologies, and
new capabilities. The National Security Strategy and National Military Strategy guide strategic leaders as they develop visions for their
organizations. From a complicated mixture of
ideas, facts, conjecture, and personal experience they create an image of what their organizations need to be.

7-7

Strategic Leadership

7-33. Once strategic leaders have developed a
vision, they create a plan to reach that end state.
They consider objectives, courses of action to
take the organization there, and resources
needed to do the job. The word “vision” implies
that strategic leaders create a conceptual model
of what they want. Subordinates will be more
involved in moving the organization forward if
they can “see” what the leader has in mind. And
because moving a large organization is often a
long haul, subordinates need some sign that
they’re making progress. Strategic leaders
therefore provide intermediate objectives that
act as milestones for their subordinates in
checking their direction and measuring their
progress.
7-34. The strategic leader’s vision provides the
ultimate sense of purpose, direction, and motivation for everyone in the organization. It is at
once the starting point for developing specific
goals and plans, a yardstick for measuring what
the organization accomplishes, and a check on
organizational values. Ordinarily, a strategic
leader’s vision for the organization may have a
time horizon of years, or even decades. In combat, the horizon is much closer, but strategic
leaders still focus far beyond the immediate
actions.
7-35. The strategic leader’s vision is a goal,
something the organization strives for (even
though some goals may always be just out of
reach). When members understand the vision,
they can see it as clearly as the strategic leader
can. When they see it as worthwhile and accept
it, the vision creates energy, inspiration, commitment, and a sense of belonging.
7-36. Strategic leaders set the vision for their
entire organization. They seek to keep the vision consistent with the external environment,
alliance or coalition goals, the National Security Strategy, and the National Military Strategy. Subordinate leaders align their visions and
intent with their strategic leader’s vision. A
strategic leader’s vision may be expressed in
everything from small acts to formal, written
policy statements.
7-37. Joint Vision 2010 and Army Vision 2010,
which is derived from it, are not based on

7-8

formal organizations; rather they array future
technologies and force structure against emerging threats. While no one can yet see exactly
what that force will look like, the concepts
themselves provide an azimuth and a point on
the horizon. Achieving well-publicized milepost
initiatives shows that the Army as an institution is progressing toward the end state visualized by its strategic leaders.
DEVELOPING FRAMES OF
REFERENCE
7-38. All Army leaders build a personal frame
of reference from schooling, experience, selfstudy, and reflection on current events and history. Strategic leaders create a comprehensive
frame of reference that encompasses their organization and places it in the strategic environment. To construct a useful frame, strategic
leaders are open to new experiences and to comments from others, including subordinates.
Strategic leaders are reflective, thoughtful, and
unafraid to rethink past experiences and to
learn from them. They are comfortable with the
abstractions and concepts common in the strategic environment. Moreover, they understand
the circumstances surrounding them, their
organization, and the nation.
7-39. Much like intelligence analysts, strategic
leaders look at events and see patterns that others often miss. These leaders are likely to identify and understand a strategic situation and,
more important, infer the outcome of interventions or the absence of interventions. A strategic leader’s frame of reference helps identify
the information most relevant to a strategic
situation so that the leader can go to the heart
of a matter without being distracted. In the new
information environment, that talent is more
important than ever. Cosmopolitan strategic
leaders, those with comprehensive frames of
reference and the wisdom that comes from
thought and reflection, are well equipped to
deal with events having complex causes and to
envision creative solutions.
7-40. A well-developed frame of reference also

Their vision helps them anticipate and avoid
problems.
DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTY AND
AMBIGUITY
True genius resides in the capacity for
evaluation of uncertain, hazardous, and conflicting information.

Sir Winston Churchill
Prime Minister of Great Britain, World War II
7-41. Strategic leaders operate in an environment of increased volatility, uncertainty,
complexity, and ambiguity. Change at this level
may arrive suddenly and unannounced. As they
plan for contingencies, strategic leaders prepare intellectually for a range of uncertain
threats and scenarios. Since even great planning and foresight can’t predict or influence all
future events, strategic leaders work to shape

the future on terms they can control, using diplomatic, informational, military, and economic
instruments of national power.
7-42. Strategic leaders fight complexity by
encompassing it. They must be more complex
than the situations they face. This means they’re
able to expand their frame of reference to fit a
situation rather than reducing a situation to fit
their preconceptions. They don’t lose sight of
Army values and force capabilities as they focus
on national policy. Because of their maturity and
wisdom, they tolerate ambiguity, knowing they
will never have all the information they want. Instead, they carefully analyze events and decide
whentomakeadecision,realizingthattheymust
innovate and accept some risk. Once they make
decisions, strategic leaders then explain them to
the Army and the nation, in the process imposing
order on the uncertainty and ambiguity of the
situation. Strategic leaders not only understand
the environment themselves; they also translate
their understanding to others.

Strategic Flexibility in Haiti
Operation Uphold Democracy, the 1994 US intervention in Haiti conducted under UN auspices,
provides an example of strategic leaders achieving success in spite of extreme uncertainty and
ambiguity. Prior to the order to enter Haiti, strategic leaders didn’t know either D-day or the available
forces. Neither did they know whether the operation would be an invitation (permissive entry), an
invasion (forced entry), or something in between. To complicate the actual military execution, former
President Jimmy Carter, retired GEN Colin Powell, and Senator Sam Nunn were negotiating with LTG
Raoul Cedras, commander in chief of the Haitian armed forces, in the Haitian capital even as
paratroopers, ready for a combat jump, were inbound.
When LTG Cedras agreed to hand over power, the mission of the inbound JTF changed from a
forced to a permissive entry. The basis for the operation wound up being an operation plan based on
an “in-between” course of action inferred by the JTF staff during planning. The ability of the strategic
leaders involved to change their focus so dramatically and quickly provides an outstanding example of
strategic flexibility during a crisis. The ability of the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines of the JTF to
execute the new mission on short notice is a credit to them and their leaders at all levels.

7-43. In addition to demonstrating the flexibility required to handle competing demands,
strategic leaders understand complex causeand-effect relationships and anticipate the second- and third-order effects of their decisions
throughout the organization. The highly volatile nature of the strategic environment may

Army Leadership

tempt them to concentrate on the short term,
but strategic leaders don’t allow the crisis of the
moment absorb them completely. They remain
focused on their responsibility to shape an organization or policies that will perform successfully over the next 10 to 20 years. Some secondand third-order effects are desirable; leaders

7-9

Strategic Leadership

can design and pursue actions to achieve them.
For example, strategic leaders who continually
send—through their actions—messages of

trust to subordinates inspire trust in themselves. The third-order effect may be to enhance subordinates’ initiative.

Figure 7-3. Strategic Leader Skills—
Technical
7-44. Strategic leaders create their work on a
broad canvas that requires broad technical
skills of the sort named in Figure 7-3.
STRATEGIC ART
7-45. The strategic art, broadly defined, is the
skillful formulation, coordination, and application of ends, ways, and means to promote and
defend the national interest. Masters of the strategic art competently integrate the three roles
performed by the complete strategist: strategic
leader, strategic practitioner, and strategic
theorist.
7-46. Using their understanding of the systems
within their own organizations, strategic leaders

7-10

work through the complexity and uncertainty
of the strategic environment and translate abstract concepts into concrete actions. Proficiency in the science of leadership—programs,
schedules, and systems, for example—can bring
direct or organizational leaders success. For
strategic leaders, however, the intangible qualities of leadership draw on their long and varied
experience to produce a rare art.
7-47. Strategic leaders do more than imagine
and accurately predict the future; they shape it
by moving out of the conceptual realm into
practical execution. Although strategic leaders
never lose touch with soldiers and their technical skills, some practical activities are unique to
this level.
7-48. By reconciling political and economic
constraints with the Army’s needs, strategic
leaders navigate to move the force forward using the strategy and budget processes. They
spend a great deal of time obtaining and allocating resources and determining conceptual directions, especially those judged critical for
future strategic positioning and necessary to
prevent readiness shortfalls. They’re also
charged with overseeing of the Army’s responsibilities under Title 10 of the United States
Code.
7-49. Strategic leaders focus not so much on internal processes as on how the organization fits
into the DOD and the international arena: What
are the relationships among external organizations? What are the broad political and social
systems in which the organization and the Army
must operate? Because of the complex reporting
and coordinating relationships, strategic leaders

FM 22-100

Technical Skills

fully understand their roles, the boundaries of
these roles, and the expectations of other departments and agencies. Understanding those
interdependencies outside the Army helps strategic leaders do the right thing for the programs,
systems, and people within the Army as well as
for the nation.
7-50. Theater CINCs, with their service component commanders, seek to shape their environments and accomplish long-term national
security policy goals within their theaters. They
operate through congressional testimony, creative use of assigned and attached military
forces, imaginative bilateral and multilateral
programs, treaty obligations, person-to-person
contacts with regional leaders, and various
joint processes. These actions require strategic
leaders to apply the strategic art just as much as
does designing and employing force packages to
achieve military end states.
7-51. GA Douglas MacArthur, a theater CINC
during World War II, became military governor
of occupied Japan after the Japanese surrender.
His former enemies became his responsibility;
he had to deal diplomatically with the defeated
nation as well as the directives of American civil
authorities and the interests of the former Allies. GA MacArthur understood the difference
between preliminary (often called military) end
state conditions and the broader set of end state
conditions that are necessary for the transition
from war to peace. Once a war has ended, military force can no longer be the principal means
of achieving strategic aims. Thus, a strategic
leader’s end state vision must include diplomatic, economic, and informational—as well as
military—aspects. GA MacArthur’s vision, and
the actions he took to achieve it, helped establish the framework that preserved peace in the
Pacific Ocean and rebuilt a nation that would
become a trusted ally.
7-52. A similar institutional example occurred
in the summer of 1990. Then, while the Army
was in the midst of the most precisely planned
force “build-down” in history, Army Chief of
Staff Carl Vuono had to halt the process to meet
a crisis in the Persian Gulf. GEN Vuono was required to call up, mobilize and deploy forces
necessary to meet the immediate crisis while

Army Leadership

retaining adequate capabilities in other theaters. The following year he redeployed Third
(US) Army, demobilized the activated reserves,
and resumed downsizing toward the smallest
active force since the 1930s. GEN Vuono demonstrated the technical skill of the strategic art
and proved himself a leader of character and
competence motivated by Army values.
LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY
7-53. Leveraging technology—that is, applying
technological capabilities to obtain a decisive
military advantage—has given strategic leaders
advantages in force projection, in command and
control, and in the generation of overwhelming
combat power. Leveraging technology has also
increased the tempo of operations, the speed of
maneuver, the precision of firepower, and the
pace at which information is processed. Ideally,
information technology, in particular, enhances not only communications, but also
situational understanding. With all these advantages, of course, comes increasing complexity: it’s harder to control large organizations
that are moving quickly. Strategic leaders seek
to understand emerging military technologies
and apply that understanding to resourcing, allocating, and exploiting the many systems under their control.
7-54. Emerging combat, combat support, and
combat service support technologies bring
more than changes to doctrine. Technological
change allows organizations to do the things
they do now better and faster, but it also enables them to do things that were not possible
before. So a part of leveraging technology is envisioning the future capability that could be exploited by developing a technology. Another
aspect is rethinking the form the organization
ought to take in order to exploit new processes
that previously were not available. This is why
strategic leaders take time to think “out of the
box.”
TRANSLATING POLITICAL GOALS
INTO MILITARY OBJECTIVES
7-55. Leveraging technology takes more than
understanding; it takes money. Strategic leaders call on their understanding and their knowledge of the budgetary process to determine

7-11

Strategic Leadership

which combat, combat support, and combat
service support technologies will provide the
leap-ahead capability commensurate with the
cost. Wise Army leaders in the 1970s and 1980s
realized that superior night systems and greater
standoff ranges could expose fewer Americans
to danger yet kill more of the enemy. Those leaders committed money to developing and procuring ap p ro pri ate weapons systems an d
equipment. Operation Desert Storm validated
these decisions when, for example, M1 tanks destroyed Soviet-style equipment before it could
close within its maximum effective range. However strategic leaders are always in the position
of balancing budget constraints, technological
improvements, and current force readiness

against potential threats as they shape the force
for the future.
7-56. Strategic leaders identify military conditions necessary to satisfy political ends desired
by America’s civilian leadership. They must
synchronize the efforts of the Army with those
of the other services and government agencies
to attain those conditions and achieve the end
state envisioned by America’s political leaders.
To operate on the world stage, often in conjunction with allies, strategic leaders call on their
international perspective and relationships
with policy makers in other countries.

Show of Force in the Philippines
At the end of November 1989, 1,000 rebels seized two Filipino air bases in an attempt to
overthrow the government of the Philippines. There had been rumors that someone was plotting a
coup to end Philippine President Corazon Aquino’s rule. Now rebel aircraft from the captured airfields
had bombed and strafed the presidential palace. President Aquino requested that the United States
help suppress the coup attempt by destroying the captured airfields. Vice President Dan Quayle and
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger favored US intervention to support the Philippine
government. As the principal military advisor to the president, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin
Powell was asked to recommend a response to President Aquino’s request.
GEN Powell applied critical reasoning to this request for US military power in support of a foreign
government. He first asked the purpose of the proposed intervention. The State Department and
White House answered that the United States needed to demonstrate support for President Aquino
and keep her in power. GEN Powell then asked the purpose of bombing the airfields. To prevent
aircraft from supporting the coup, was the reply. Once GEN Powell understood the political goal, he
recommended a military response to support it.
The chairman recommended to the White House that American jets fly menacing runs over the
captured airfields. The goal would be to prevent takeoffs from the airfields by intimidating the rebel
pilots rather than destroying rebel aircraft and facilities. This course of action was approved by
President George Bush and achieved the desired political goal: it deterred the rebel pilots from
supporting the coup attempt. By understanding the political goal and properly defining the military
objective, GEN Powell was able to recommend a course of action that applied a measured military
response to what was, from the United States’ perspective, a diplomatic problem. By electing to
conduct a show of force rather than an attack, the United States avoided unnecessary casualties and
damage to the Philippine infrastructure.
7-57. Since the end of the Cold War, the
international stage has become more confused.
Threats to US national security may come from
a number of quarters: regional instability,
insurgencies, terrorism, and proliferation of

7-12

weapons of mass destruction to name a few.
International drug traffickers and other
transnational groups are also potential
adversaries. To counter such diverse threats,
the nation needs a force flexible enough to

FM 22-100

Influencing Actions

execute a wide array of missions, from
warfighting
to
peace
operations
to
humanitarian assistance. And of course, the
nation needs strategic leaders with the sound
perspective that allows them to understand the

nation’s political goals in the complex
international environment and to shape
military objectives appropriate to the various
threats.

SECTION II
STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP ACTIONS
Leadership is understanding people and involving them to help you do a job. That takes all of
the good characteristics, like integrity, dedication of purpose, selflessness, knowledge, skill,
implacability, as well as determination not to accept failure.

Admiral Arleigh A. Burke

Naval Leadership: Voices of Experience
7-58. Operating at the highest levels of the
Army, the DOD, and the national security establishment, military and DA civilian strategic
leaders face highly complex demands from inside and outside the Army. Constantly changing global conditions challenge their
decision-making abilities. Strategic leaders tell
the Army story, make long-range decisions, and
shape the Army culture to influence the force
and its partners inside and outside the United

States. They plan for contingencies across the
range of military operations and allocate resources to prepare for them, all the while assessing the threat and the force’s readiness.
Steadily improving the Army, strategic leaders
develop their successors, lead changes in the
force, and optimize systems and operations.
This section addresses the influencing, operating, and improving actions they use.

INFLUENCING ACTIONS

7-61. Strategic leaders also seek to control the
information environment, consistent with US
law and Army values. Action in this area can
range from psychological operations campaigns
to managing media relationships. Strategic
leaders who know what’s happening with present and future requirements, both inside and

7-60. Because the external environment is diverse and complex, it’s sometimes difficult for
strategic leaders to identify and influence the
origins of factors affecting the organization.
This difficulty applies particularly to fast-paced
situations like theater campaigns. Strategic
leaders meet this challenge by becoming masters of information, influence, and vision.

THE LEADER

7-59. Strategic leaders act to influence both
their organization and its outside environment.

outside the organization, are in a position to influence events, take advantage of opportunities, and move the organization toward its
goals.
7-62. As noted earlier, strategic leaders develop
the wisdom and frames of reference necessary
to identify the information relevant to the
situation at hand. In addition, they use interpersonal skills to develop a network of knowledgeable
people,
especially
in
those
organizations that can influence their own.
They encourage staff members to develop similar networks. Through these networks, strategic leaders actively seek information relevant to
their organizations and subject matter experts
they can call on to assist themselves and their
staffs. Strategic leaders can often call on the nation’s best minds and information sources and
may face situations where nothing less will do.
COMMUNICATING
Moving our Army into the next century is a
journey, not a destination; we know where we
are going and we are moving out.

General Gordon R. Sullivan
Former Army Chief of Staff
Communicating a Vision
7-63. The skill of envisioning is vital to the
strategic leader. But forming a vision is pointless unless the leader shares it with a broad
audience, gains widespread support, and uses it

as a compass to guide the organization. For the
vision to provide purpose, direction, and motivation, the strategic leader must personally
commit to it, gain commitment from the organization as a whole, and persistently pursue the
goals and objectives that will spread the vision
throughout the organization and make it a
reality.
7-64. Strategic leaders identify trends, opportunities, and threats that could affect the
Army’s future and move vigorously to mobilize
the talent that will help create strategic vision.
In 1991 Army Chief of Staff Gordon R. Sullivan
formed a study group of two dozen people to
help craft his vision for the Army. In this process, GEN Sullivan considered authorship less
important than shared vision:
Once a vision has been articulated and the
process of buy-in has begun, the vision must be
continually interpreted. In some cases, the
vision may be immediately understandable at
every level. In other cases, it must be
translated—put
into
more
appropriate
language—for each part of the organization. In
still other cases, it may be possible to find
symbols that come to represent the vision.
7-65. Strategic leaders are open to ideas from a
variety of sources, not just their own organizations. Some ideas will work; some won’t. Some
will have few, if any, long-lasting effects; others, like the one in this example, will have effects few will foresee.

Combat Power from a Good Idea
In 1941, as the American military was preparing for war, Congresswoman Edith Nourse Rogers
correctly anticipated manpower shortages in industry and in the armed forces as the military grew. To
meet this need, she proposed creation of a Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) of 25,000 women
to fill administrative jobs and free men for service with combat units. After the United States entered
the war, when the size of the effort needed became clearer, Congresswoman Rogers introduced
another bill for a WAAC of some 150,000 women. Although the bill met stiff opposition in some
quarters, a version passed and eventually the Women’s Army Corps was born. Congresswoman
Rogers’ vision of how to best get the job done in the face of vast demands on manpower contributed a
great deal to the war effort.

Telling the Army Story
If you have an important point to make, don’t
try to be subtle or clever. Use a pile-driver. Hit
the point once. Then come back and hit it a
second time—a tremendous whack!

Sir Winston Churchill
Prime Minister of Great Britain, World War II

7-66. Whether by nuance or overt presentation,
strategic leaders vigorously and constantly represent who Army is, what it’s doing, and where
it’s going. The audience is the Army itself as
well as the rest of the world. There’s an especially powerful responsibility to explain things
to the American people, who support their Army
with money and lives. Whether working with
other branches of government, federal agencies,
the media, other militaries, the other services,
or their own organizations, strategic leaders
rely increasingly on writing and public speaking
(conferences and press briefings) to reinforce
the Army’s central messages. Because so much
of this communication is directed at outside
agencies, strategic leaders avoid parochial language and remain sensitive to the Army’s
image.
7-67. Strategic leaders of all times have determined and reinforced the message that speaks
to the soul of the nation and unifies the force. In
1973 Army leaders at all levels knew about
“The Big Five,” the weapons systems that
would transform the Army (a new tank, an infantry fighting vehicle, an advanced attack helicopter, a new utility helicopter, and an air
defense system). Those programs yielded the
M1 Abrams, the M2/M3 Bradley, the AH-64
Apache, the UH-60 Blackhawk, and the Patriot.
But those initiatives were more than sales
pitches for newer hardware; they were linked to
concepts about how to fight and win against a
massive Soviet-style force. As a result, fielding
the new equipment gave physical form to the
new ideas being adopted at the same time. Soldiers could see improvements as well as read
about them. The synergism of new equipment,
new ideas, and good leadership resulted in the
Army of Excellence.
7-68. Today, given the rapid growth of technology, unpredictable threats, and newly emerging

Army Leadership

roles, Army leaders can’t cling to new hardware
as the key to the Army’s vision. Instead, today’s
strategic leaders emphasize the Army’s core
strength: Army values and the timeless character of the American soldier. The Army—
trained, ready, and led by leaders of character
and competence at all levels—has met and will
continue to meet the nation’s security needs.
That’s the message of today’s Army to the
nation it serves.
7-69. A recent example of successfully telling
the Army story occurred during Operation Desert Shield. During the deployment phase, strategic leaders decided to get local reporters to
the theater of war to report on mobilized reserve component units from their communities.
That decision had several effects. The firstorder effect was to get the Army story to the
citizens of hometown America. That publicity
resulted in an unintended second-order effect: a
flood of mail that the nation sent to its deployed
soldiers. That mail, in turn, produced a thirdorder effect felt by American soldiers: a new
pride in themselves.
STRATEGIC DECISION MAKING
When I am faced with a decision—picking
somebody for a post, or choosing a course of
action—I dredge up every scrap of knowledge I
can. I call in people. I telephone them. I read
whatever I can get my hands on. I use my
intellect to inform my instinct. I then use my
instinct to test all this data. “Hey, instinct, does
this sound right? Does it smell right, feel right,
fit right?”

General Colin Powell
Former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff

7-70. Strategic leaders have great conceptual
resources; they have a collegial network to
share thoughts and plan for the institution’s
continued success and well being. Even when
there’s consensual decision making, however,
everyone knows who the boss is. Decisions
made by strategic leaders—whether CINCs deploying forces or service chiefs initiating budget
programs—often result in a major commitment
of resources. They’re expensive and tough to reverse. Therefore, strategic leaders rely on
timely feedback throughout the decision-

7-15

Strategic Leadership

making process in order to avoid making a decision based on inadequate or faulty information.
Their purpose, direction, and motivation flow
down; information and recommendations surface from below.
7-71. Strategic leaders use the processes of the
DOD, Joint Staff, and Army strategic planning
systems to provide purpose and direction to subordinate leaders. These systems include the
Joint Strategic Planning System (JSPS), the
Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES), and the Planning, Programming
and Budgeting System (PPBS). However, no
matter how many systems are involved and no
matter how complex they are, providing motivation remains the province of the individual strategic leader.

7-72. Because strategic leaders are constantly
involved in this sort of planning and because decisions at this level are so complex and depend
on so many variables, there’s a temptation to
analyze things endlessly. There’s always new
information; there’s always a reason to wait for
the next batch of reports or the next dispatch.
Strategic leaders’ perspective, wisdom, courage, and sense of timing help them know when
to decide. In peacetime the products of those decisions may not see completion for 10 to 20
years and may require leaders to constantly adjust them along the way. By contrast, a strategic leader’s decision at a critical moment in
combat can rapidly alter the course of the war,
as did the one in this example.

The D-Day Decision
On 4 June 1944 the largest invasion armada ever assembled was poised to strike the Normandy
region of France. Weather delays had already caused a 24-hour postponement and another front of
bad weather was heading for the area. If the Allies didn’t make the landings on 6 June, they would
miss the combination of favorable tides, clear flying weather, and moonlight needed for the assault. In
addition to his concerns about the weather, GA Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied
Commander, worried about his soldiers. Every hour they spent jammed aboard crowded ships,
tossed about and seasick, degraded their fighting ability.
The next possible invasion date was 19 June; however the optimal tide and visibility conditions
would not recur until mid-July. GA Eisenhower was ever mindful that the longer he delayed, the
greater chance German intelligence had to discover the Allied plan. The Germans would use any
additional time to improve the already formidable coastal defenses.
On the evening of 4 June GA Eisenhower and his staff received word that there would be a
window of clear weather on the next night, the night of 5-6 June. If the meteorologists were wrong, GA
Eisenhower would be sending seasick men ashore with no air cover or accurate naval gunfire. GA
Eisenhower was concerned for his soldiers.
“Don’t forget,” GA Eisenhower said in an interview 20 years later, “some hundreds of thousands of
men were down here around Portsmouth, and many of them had already been loaded for some time,
particularly those who were going to make the initial assault. Those people in the ships and ready to
go were in cages, you might say. You couldn’t call them anything else. They were fenced in. They
were crowded up, and everybody was unhappy.”
GA Eisenhower continued, “Goodness knows, those fellows meant a lot to me. But these are the
decisions that have to be made when you’re in a war. You say to yourself, I’m going to do something
that will be to my country’s advantage for the least cost. You can’t say without any cost. You know
you’re going to lose some of them, and it’s very difficult.”
A failed invasion would delay the end of a war that had already dragged on for nearly five years.
GA Eisenhower paced back and forth as a storm rattled the windows. There were no guarantees, but
the time had come to act.
He stopped pacing and, facing his subordinates, said quietly but clearly, “OK, let’s go.”

MOTIVATING
It is the morale of armies, as well as of nations,
more than anything else, which makes victories
and their results decisive.

Baron Antoine-Henri de Jomini
Precis de lArt de Guerre, 1838
Shaping Culture
7-73. Strategic leaders inspire great effort. To
mold morale and motivate the entire Army,
strategic leaders cultivate a challenging, supportive, and respectful environment for soldiers
and DA civilians to operate in. An institution
with a history has a mature, well-established
culture—a shared set of values and assumptions that members hold about it. At the same
time, large and complex institutions like the
Army are diverse; they have many subcultures,
such as those that exist in the civilian and reserve components, heavy and light forces, and
special operations forces. Gender, ethnic, religious, occupational, and regional differences also
define groups within the force.
Culture and Values
7-74. The challenge for strategic leaders is to
ensure that all these subcultures are part of the
larger Army culture and that they all share
Army values. Strategic leaders do this by working with the best that each subculture has to offer and ensuring that subcultures don’t foster
unhealthy competition with each other, outside
agencies, or the rest of the Army. Rather, these
various subcultures must complement each
other and the Army’s institutional culture.
Strategic leaders appreciate the differences
that characterize these subcultures and treat
all members of all components with dignity and
respect. They’re responsible for creating an environment that fosters mutual understanding
so that soldiers and DA civilians treat one another as they should.
7-75. Army values form the foundation on
which the Army’s institutional culture stands.
Army values also form the basis for Army policies and procedures. But written values are of
little use unless they are practiced. Strategic
leaders help subordinates adopt these values by
making sure that their experience validates

Army Leadership

them. In this, strategic leaders support the efforts all Army leaders make to develop the their
subordinates’ character. This character development effort (discussed in Appendix E) strives
to have all soldiers and DA civilians adopt Army
values, incorporate them into a personal code,
and act according to them.
7-76. Like organizational and direct leaders,
strategic leaders model character by their
actions. Only experience can validate Army values: subordinates will hear of Army values, then
look to see if they are being lived around them.
If they are, the Army’s institutional culture is
strengthened; if they are not, the Army’s institutional culture begins to weaken. Strategic
leaders ensure Army values remain fundamental to the Army’s institutional culture.
7-77. Over time, an institution’s culture
becomes so embedded in its members that they
may not even notice how it affects their
attitudes. The institutional culture becomes
second nature and influences the way people
think, the way they act in relation to each other
and outside agencies, and the way they approach the mission. Institutional culture helps
define the boundaries of acceptable behavior,
ranging from how to wear the uniform to how to
interact with foreign nationals. It helps determine how people approach problems, make
judgments, determine right from wrong, and establish priorities. Culture shapes Army customs
and traditions through doctrine, policies and
regulations, and the philosophy that guides the
institution. Professional journals, historical
works, ceremonies—even the folklore of the organization—all contain evidence of the Army’s
institutional culture.
Culture and Leadership
7-78. A healthy culture is a powerful
leadership tool strategic leaders use to help
them guide their large diverse organizations.
Strategic leaders seek to shape the culture to
support their vision, accomplish the mission,
and improve the organization. A cohesive
culture molds the organization’s morale, reinforcing an ethical climate built on Army values,
especially respect. As leaders initiate changes
for long-range improvements, soldiers and DA
civilians must feel that they’re valued as

7-17

Strategic Leadership

persons, not just as workers or program
supporters.
7-79. One way the Army’s institutional culture
affirms the importance of individuals is through
its commitment to leader development: in essence, this commitment declares that people are
the Army’s future. By committing to broadbased leader development, the Army has

redefined what it means to be a soldier. In fact,
Army leaders have even changed the appearance
of American soldiers and the way they perform.
Introducing height and weight standards, raising PT standards, emphasizing training and
education, and deglamorizing alcohol have all
fundamentally changed the Army’s institutional
culture.

Figure 7-5. Strategic Leader
Actions—Operating
7-80. Operating at the strategic level can involve both short-term and long-term actions.
The most agile organizations have standing
procedures and policies to take the guesswork
out of routine actions and allow leaders to concentrate their imagination and energy on the
most difficult tasks. Strategic leaders coordinate their organizations’ actions to accomplish
near-term missions, often without the benefit
of direct guidance. Strategic leaders receive
general guidance—frequently from several
sources, including the national command
authority.
7-81. Although they perform many of the same
operating actions as organizational and direct

7-18

leaders, strategic leaders also manage joint,
multinational, and interagency relationships.
For strategic leaders, planning, preparing, executing, and assessing are nearly continuous,
more so than at the other leadership levels, because the larger organizations they lead have
continuing missions. In addition, the preparing
action takes on a more comprehensive meaning
at the strategic leadership level. Leaders at all
levels keep one eye on tomorrow. Strategic leaders, to a greater extent than leaders at other
levels, must coordinate their organizations’ actions, positioning them to accomplish the current mission in a way that will feed seamlessly
into the next one. The Army doesn’t stop at the
end of a field exercise—or even after recovering
from a major deployment; there’s always another mission about to start and still another
one on the drawing board.
STRATEGIC PLANNING
7-82. Strategic-level plans must balance competing demands across the vast structure of the
DOD, but the fundamental requirements for
strategic-level planning are the same as for direct- and organizational-level planning. At all
levels, leaders establish priorities and communicate decisions; however, at the strategic level,
the sheer number of players who can influence
the organization means that strategic leaders
must stay on top of multiple demands. To plan
coherently and comprehensively, they look at
the mission from other players’ points of view.
Strategic planning depends heavily on wisely
applying interpersonal and conceptual skills.
Strategic leaders ask, What will these people
want? How will they see things? Have I justified
the mission? The interaction among strategic

leaders’ interpersonal and conceptual skills and
their operating actions is highly complex.

understanding helped the Army during Operation Uphold Democracy, the US intervention in
Haiti. The success of the plan to collect and disarm former Haitian police and military officials,
investigate them, remove them (if required), or
retrain them owed much to recognizing the special demands of the Haitian psyche. The population needed a secure and stable environment
and a way to know when that condition was in
place. The Haitians feared the resurgence of
government terror, and any long-term solution
had to address their concerns. Strategic planners maintained a focus on the desired end
state: US disengagement and a return to a
peaceful, self-governing Haiti. In the end, the
United States forced Haitian leaders to cooperate, restored the elected president, JeanBertrand Aristide, and made provisions for returning control of affairs to the Haitians
themselves.
EXECUTING
There are no victories at bargain prices.

General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower
Allocating Resources
7-84. Because lives are precious and materiel is
scarce, strategic leaders make tough decisions

about priorities. Their goal is a capable, prepared, and victorious force. In peacetime, strategic leaders decide which programs get funded
and consider the implications of those choices.
Allocating resources isn’t simply a matter of
choosing helicopters, tanks, and missiles for the
future Army. Strategic resourcing affects how
the Army will operate and fight tomorrow. For
example, strategic leaders determine how much
equipment can be pre-positioned for contingencies without degrading current operational
capabilities.
Managing Joint, Interagency, and
Multinational Relationships
7-85. Strategic leaders oversee the relationship
between their organizations, as part of the nation’s total defense force, and the national policy apparatus. They use their knowledge of how
things work at the national and international
levels to influence opinion and build consensus
for the organization’s missions, gathering support of diverse players to achieve their vision.
Among their duties, strategic leaders—

· Provide military counsel in national policy
forums.

· Interpret national policy guidelines and
directions.

· Plan for and maintain the military capability required to implement national policy.

requirements.

· Present

Multinational Resource Allocation
Following the breakout and pursuit after the Normandy landings, Allied logistics systems became
seriously overstretched. GA Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, had to make a number of
decisions on resource allocation among his three army groups. These decisions had serious
implications for the conduct of the war in the ETO. Both GEN George Patton, Commander of the Third
(US) Army in GEN Omar Bradley’s Twelfth Army Group, and British GEN Bernard Montgomery, the
Twenty-first Army Group Commander, argued that sole priority for their single thrusts into the German
homeland could win the war. GA Eisenhower, dedicated to preserving the alliance with an Allied
success in the West, gave GEN Montgomery only a limited priority for a risky attempt to gain a Rhine
bridgehead, and at the same time, slowed GEN Patton’s effort to what was logistically feasible under
the circumstances. The Supreme Allied Commander’s decision was undoubtedly unpopular with his
longtime colleague, GEN Patton, but it contributed to alliance solidarity, sent a message to the
Soviets, and ensured a final success that did not rely on the still highly uncertain collapse of German
defenses.

objectives.
Bridge the gap between political decisions
made as part of national strategy and the
individuals and organizations that must
carry out those decisions.

7-86. As part of this last requirement, strategic
leaders clarify national policy for subordinates
and explain the perspectives that contribute to
that national policy. They develop policies reflecting national security objectives and prepare their organizations to respond to missions
across the spectrum of military actions.
7-87. Just as direct and organizational leaders
consider their sister units and agencies, strategic leaders consider and work with other armed
services and government agencies. How important is this joint perspective? Most of the Army’s
four-star billets are joint or multinational. Almost half of the lieutenant generals hold similar
positions on the Joint Staff, with the DOD, or in
combatant commands. While the remaining
strategic leaders are assigned to organizations
that are nominally single service (Forces Command, Training and Doctrine Command, Army
Materiel Command), they frequently work outside Army channels. In addition, many DA civilian strategic leaders hold positions that require
a joint perspective.
7-88. The complexity of the work created by
joint and multinational requirements is
twofold. First, communication is more complicated because of the different interests, cultures, and languages of the participants. Even
the cultures and jargon of the various US
armed services differ dramatically. Second,
subordinates may not be subordinate in the
same sense as they are in a purely Army organization. Strategic leaders and their forces may
fall under international operational control but
retain their allegiances and lines of authority to
their own national commanders. UN and
NATO commands, such as the IFOR, discussed
earlier are examples of this kind of
arrangement.
7-89. To operate effectively in a joint or
multinational environment, strategic leaders
exercise a heightened multiservice and international sensitivity developed over their years of

7-20

experience. A joint perspective results from
shared experiences and interactions with leaders of other services, complemented by the leader’s habitual introspection. Similar elements in
the international arena inform an international
perspective. Combing those perspectives with
their own Army and national perspectives, strategic leaders—

· Influence the opinions of those outside the

Army and help them understand Army
needs.

· Interpret the outside environment for people on the inside, especially in the formulation of plans and policies.

Most Army leaders will have several opportunities to serve abroad, sometimes with forces of
other nations. Perceptive leaders turn such
service into opportunities for self-development
and personal broadening.
7-90. Chapter 2 describes building a “third culture,” that is, a hybrid culture that bridges the
gap between partners in multinational operations. Strategic leaders take the time to learn
about their partners’ cultures—including political, social and economic aspects—so that
they understand how and why the partners
think and act as they do. Strategic leaders are
also aware that the successful conduct of multinational operations requires a particular sensitivity to the effect that deploying US forces may
have on the laws, traditions, and customs of a
third country.
7-91. Strategic leaders understand American
and Army culture. This allows them to see their
own culturally-based actions from the viewpoint of another culture—civilian, military, or
foreign. Effective testimony before Congress requires an understanding of how Congress
works and how its members think. The same is
true concerning dealings with other federal and
state agencies, non-governmental organizations, local political leaders, the media, and
other people who shape public opinion and national attitudes toward the military. Awareness
of the audience helps strategic leaders represent their organizations to outside agencies.
Understanding societal values—those values
people bring into the Army—helps strategic

FM 22-100

Operating Actions

leaders motivate subordinates to live Army
values.
7-92. When the Army’s immediate needs conflict with the objectives of other agencies, strategic leaders work to reconcile the differences.
Reconciliation begins with a clear understanding of the other agency’s position. Understanding the other side’s position is the first step in
identifying shared interests, which may permit
a new outcome better for both parties. There
will be times when strategic leaders decide to
stick to their course; there will be other times
when Army leaders bend to accommodate other
organizations. Continued disagreement can impair the Army’s ability to serve the nation;
therefore, strategic leaders must work to devise
Army courses of action that reflect national policy objectives and take into account the interests of other organizations and agencies.
7-93. Joint and multinational task force
commanders may be strategic leaders. In certain operations they will work for a CINC but
receive guidance directly from the Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of
Defense, the State Department, or the UN. Besides establishing professional relationships
within the DOD and US government, such strategic leaders must build personal rapport with
officials from other countries and military
establishments.
Military Actions Across the Spectrum
7-94. Since the character of the next war has not
been clearly defined for them, today’s strategic
leaders rely on hints in the international environment to provide information on what sort of
force to prepare. Questions they consider include these: Where is the next threat? Will we
have allies or contend alone? What will our national and military goals be? What will the exit
strategy be? Strategic leaders address the technological, leadership, and moral considerations
associated with fighting on an asymmetrical battlefield. They’re at the center of the tension between traditional warfare and the newer kinds
of multiparty conflict emerging outside the

Army Leadership

industrialized world. Recent actions like those in
Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, Grenada, and the Persian Gulf suggest the range of possible military
contingencies. Strategic leaders struggle with
the ramifications of switching repeatedly among
the different types of military actions required
under a strategy of engagement.
7-95. The variety of potential missions calls for
the ability to quickly build temporary organizations able to perform specific tasks. As they design future joint organizations, strategic
leaders must also determine how to engineer
both cohesion and proficiency in modular units
that are constantly forming and reforming.
STRATEGIC ASSESSING
7-96. There are many elements of their environment that strategic leaders must assess. Like
leaders at other levels, they must first assess
themselves: their leadership style, strengths
and weaknesses, and their fields of excellence.
They must also understand the present operational environment—to include the will of the
American people, expressed in part through
law, policy, and their leaders. Finally, strategic
leaders must survey the political landscape and
the international environment, for these affect
the organization and shape the future strategic
requirements.
7-97. Strategic leaders also cast a wide net to
assess their own organizations. They develop
performance indicators to signal how well
they’re communicating to all levels of their
commands and how well established systems
and processes are balancing the six imperatives. Assessment starts early in each mission
and continues through its end. It may include
monitoring such diverse areas as resource use,
development of subordinates, efficiency, effects
of stress and fatigue, morale, and mission accomplishment. Such assessments generate
huge amounts of data; strategic leaders must
make clear what they’re looking for so their
staffs can filter information for them. They
must also guard against misuse of assessment
data.

Strategic Leadership

World War II Strategic Assessment
Pursuing a “Germany first” strategy in World War II was a deliberate decision based on a strategic
and political assessment of the global situation. Military planners, particularly Army Chief of Staff
George C. Marshall, worried that US troops might be dispersed and used piecemeal. Strategic
leaders heeded Frederick the Great’s adage, “He who defends everywhere defends nowhere.” The
greatest threat to US interests was a total German success in Europe: a defeated Russia and
neutralized Great Britain. Still, the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor and the Philippines and the
threat to the line of communications with Australia tugged forces toward the opposite hemisphere.
Indeed, throughout the first months of 1942, more forces headed for the Pacific Theater than across
the Atlantic.
However, before the US was at war with anyone, President Franklin Roosevelt had agreed with
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to a “Germany first” strategy. The 1942 invasion of North
Africa restored this focus. While the US military buildup took hold and forces flowed into Great Britain
for the Normandy invasion in 1944, operations in secondary theaters could and did continue.
However, they were resourced only after measuring their impact on the planned cross-channel
attack.

Improving
7-98. Improving is institutional investment for
the long haul, refining the things we do today
for a better organization tomorrow. A fundamental goal of strategic leaders is to leave the

7-22

Army better than they found it. Improving at
this level calls for experimentation and innovation; however, because strategic-level organizations are so complex, quantifying the results of
changes may be difficult.
7-99. Improving the institution and organizations involves an ongoing tradeoff between today and tomorrow. Wisdom and a refined frame of reference are tools to understand
what improvement is and what change is
needed. Knowing when and what to change is a
constant challenge: what traditions should remain stable, and which long-standing methods
need to evolve? Strategic leaders set the conditions for long-term success of the organization
by developing subordinates, leading change,
building the culture and teams, and creating a
learning environment.
7-100. One technique for the Army as a learning institution is to decentralize the learning
and other improving actions to some extent.
That technique raises the questions of how to
share good ideas across the entire institution
and how to incorporate the best ideas into doctrine (thus establishing an Army-wide standard) without discouraging the decentralized
learning process that generated the ideas in the

first place. Those and other questions face the
strategic leaders of the learning organization
the Army seeks to become.

George C. Marshall learned leadership from John
J. Pershing, and Marshall’s followers became great

N. Bradley…among them. Pershing and Marshall
each taught their subordinates their profession;
and, more importantly, they gave them room to
grow.

Mentoring
7-101. Strategic leaders develop subordinates
by sharing the benefit of their perspective and
experience. People arriving at the Pentagon
know how the Army works in the field, but regardless of what they may have read, they don’t
really know how the institutional Army works.
Strategic leaders act as a kind of sponsor by introducing them to the important players and
pointing out the important places and activities. But strategic leaders actually become mentors as they, in effect, underwrite the learning,
efforts, projects, and ideas of rising leaders. The
moral responsibility associated with mentoring
is compelling for all leaders; for strategic leaders, the potential significance is enormous.
7-102. More than a matter of required forms
and sessions, mentoring by strategic leaders
means giving the right people an intellectual
boost so that they make the leap to operations
and thinking at the highest levels. Because
those being groomed for strategic leadership
positions are among the most talented Army
leaders, the manner in which leaders and subordinates interact also changes. Strategic leaders aim not only to pass on knowledge but also
to grow wisdom in those they mentor.
7-103. Since few formal leader development
programs exist beyond the senior service colleges, strategic leaders pay special attention to
their subordinates’ self-development, showing
them what to study, where to focus, whom to
watch, and how to proceed. They speak to audiences at service schools about what goes on “at

Army Leadership

the top” and spend time sharing their perspectives with those who haven’t yet reached the
highest levels of Army leadership. Today’s subordinates will, after all, become the next generation of strategic leaders. Strategic leaders
are continually concerned that the Army institutional culture and the climates in subordinate organizations encourage mentoring by
others so that growth opportunities are available from the earliest days of a soldier or DA
civilian’s careers.
Developing Intellectual Capital
7-104. What strategic leaders do for individuals
they personally mentor, they also seek to provide to the force at large. They invest in the future of the force in several ways. Committing
money to programs and projects and investing
more time and resources in some actions than
others are obvious ways strategic leaders
choose what’s important. They also value people and ideas as investments in the future. The
concepts that shape the thinking of strategic
leaders become the intellectual currency of the
coming era; the soldiers and DA civilians who
develop those ideas become trusted assets
themselves. Strategic leaders must choose
wisely the ideas that bridge the gap between today and tomorrow and skillfully determine how
best to resource important ideas and people.
7-105. Strategic leaders make difficult decisions
about how much institutional development is
enough. They calculate how much time it will
take to plant and grow the seeds required for
the Army’s great leaders and ideas in the future. They balance today’s operational requirements with tomorrow’s leadership needs to
produce programs that develop a core of Army
leaders with the required skills and knowledge.
7-106. Programs like training with industry,
advanced civil schooling, and foreign area officer education complement the training and
education available in Army schools and
contribute to shaping the people who will shape
the Army’s future. Strategic leaders develop
the institution using Army resources when they
are available and those of other services or the
public sector when they are not.

7-23

Strategic Leadership

7-107. After Vietnam the Army’s leadership
thought investing in officer development so important that new courses were instituted to revitalize professional education for the force.
The establishment of the Training and Doctrine Command revived Army doctrine as a central intellectual pillar of the entire service. The
Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 provided similar
attention and invigoration to professional joint
education and joint doctrine.
7-108. Likewise, there has been a huge investment in and payoff from developing the NCO
corps. The Army has the world’s finest noncommissioned officers, in part because they get the
world’s best professional development. The
strategic decision to resource a robust NCO
education system signaled the Army’s investment in developing the whole person—not just
the technical skills—of its first-line leaders.
7-109. The Army Civilian Training and
Education Development System is the Army’s
program for developing DA civilian leaders.
Like the NCO education system, it continues
throughout an individual’s career. The first
course integrates interns into the Army by explaining Army values, culture, customs, and
policies. The Leadership Education and Development Course helps prepare leaders for supervisory
demands
with
training
in
communication, counseling, team building,
problem solving, and group development. For
organizational managers, the Organizational
Leadership for Executives course adds higherorder study on topics such as strategic planning, change management, climate, and culture. DA civilians in the Senior Executive
Service have a variety of leadership education
options that deal with leadership in both the
military and civilian contexts. Together, these
programs highlight ways that leadership
development of DA civilians parallels that of
soldiers.

Building Amid Change
7-110. The Army has no choice but to face
change. It’s in a nearly constant state of flux,
with new people, new missions, new technologies, new equipment, and new information. At
the same time, the Army, inspired by strategic
leaders, must innovate and create change. The
Army’s customs, procedures, hierarchical
structure, and sheer size make change especially daunting and stressful. Nonetheless, the
Army must be flexible enough to produce and
respond to change, even as it preserves the core
of traditions that tie it to the nation, its heritage and its values.
7-111. Strategic leaders deal with change by being proactive, not reactive. They anticipate
change even as they shield their organizations
from unimportant and bothersome influences;
they use the “change-drivers” of technology,
education, doctrine, equipment, and organization to control the direction and pace of
change. Many agencies and corporations have
“futures” groups charged with thinking about
tomorrow; strategic leaders and their advisory
teams are the Army’s “futures people.”

Change After Vietnam
The history of the post-Vietnam Army provides an example of how strategic leaders’ commitment
can shape the environment and harness change to improve the institution while continuing to operate.
The Army began seeking only volunteers in the early 1970s. With the all-volunteer force came a
tremendous emphasis on doctrinal, personnel, and training initiatives that took years to mature. The
Army tackled problems in drug abuse, racial tensions, and education with ambitious, long-range plans
and aggressive leader actions. Strategic leaders overhauled doctrine and created an environment
that improved training at all levels; the CTC program provided a uniform, rock-solid foundation of a
single, well-understood warfighting doctrine upon which to build a trained and ready Army.
Simultaneously, new equipment, weapons, vehicles, and uniforms were introduced. The result was
the Army of Desert Storm, which differed greatly from the force of 15 years earlier.
None of these changes happened by chance or through evolution. Change depended on the hard
work of direct and organizational leaders who developed systematically in an environment directed,
engineered, and led by strategic leaders.

7-113. Strategic leaders must guide their
organizations through eight stages if their initiatives for change are to make lasting progress.
Skipping a step or moving forward prematurely
subverts the process and compromises success.
Strategic leaders (1) demonstrate a sense of urgency by showing not only the benefits of but
the necessity for change. They (2) form guiding
coalitions to work the process all the way from
concept through implementation. With those
groups they (3) develop a vision of the future
and strategy for achieving it. Because change is
most effective when members embrace it, strategic leaders (4) communicate the vision
throughout the institution or organization, and
then (5) empower subordinates at all levels for
widespread, parallel efforts. They (6) plan for
short-term successes to validate the programs
and keep the vision credible and (7) consolidate
those wins and produce further change. Finally,
the leader (8) preserves the change culturally.
The result is an institution that constantly prepares for and even shapes the future environment. Strategic leaders seek to sustain the
Army as that kind of institution.

Army Leadership

LEARNING
A good soldier, whether he leads a platoon or an
army, is expected to look backward as well as
forward; but he must think only forward.

General of the Army Douglas MacArthur

7-114. The nation expects military professionals as individuals and the Army as an institution to learn from the experience of others and
apply that learning to understanding the present and preparing for the future. Such learning
requires both individual and institutional commitments. Each military professional must be
committed to self-development, part of which is
studying military history and other disciplines
related to military operations. The Army as an
institution must be committed to conducting
technical research, monitoring emerging
threats, and developing leaders for the next
generation. Strategic leaders, by their example
and resourcing decisions, sustain the culture
and policies that encourage both the individual
and the Army to learn.

7-25

Strategic Leadership

7-115. Strategic leaders promote learning by
emplacing systems for studying the force and
the future. Strategic leaders must resource a
structure that constantly reflects on how the
Army fights and what victory may cost. All that
means constantly assessing the culture and
deliberately encouraging creativity and
learning.
7-116. The notion of the Army as a “learning organization” is epitomized by the AAR concept,
which was developed as part of the REALTRAIN
project, the first version of engagement simulation. Since then, it has been part of a cultural
change, in which realistic “hot washes,” such as
following tough engagements at CTCs, are now
embedded in all training. Twenty years ago, anything like today’s AARs would have been rare.
7-117. Efficient and effective operations
require aligning various initiatives so that different factions are not working at crosspurposes. Strategic leaders focus research and
development efforts on achieving combined
arms success. They deal with questions such as:
Can these new systems from various sources
communicate with one another? What happens
during digitization lapses—what’s our residual

combat capability? Strategic leaders coordinate
time lines and budgets so that compatible systems are fielded together. However, they are
also concerned that the force have optimal capability across time; therefore, they prepare plans
that integrate new equipment and concepts into
the force as they’re developed, rather than waiting for all elements of a system to be ready before fielding it. Finally, learning what the force
should be means developing the structure,
training, and leaders those future systems will
support and studying the variety of threats they
may face.
7-118. The Louisiana Maneuvers in 1941
taught the Army what mechanized warfare
would look like and what was needed to prepare for it. The study of the same name 50
years later helped produce the conceptual
Force XXI and the first digitized division.
Strategic leaders commissioned these projects
because the Army is dedicated to learning
about operations in new environments,
against different threats. The projects were
strategic counterparts to the rehearsals that
direct and organizational leaders conduct to
prepare for upcoming missions.

SECTION III
A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP—
GENERAL OF THE ARMY MARSHALL DURING WORLD WAR II
7-119. GA George C. Marshall was one of the
greatest strategic leaders of World War II, of
this century, of our nation’s history. His example over many years demonstrates the skills
and actions this chapter has identified as the
hallmarks of strategic leadership.
7-120. Chosen over 34 officers senior to him,
GA Marshall became Army Chief of Staff in
1939, a time of great uncertainty about the future of the free world. Part of his appeal for
President Roosevelt was his strength of character and personal integrity. The honesty and
candor that GA Marshall displayed early in
their relationship were qualities the president
knew he and the nation would need in the difficult times ahead.

7-26

7-121. The new Army Chief of Staff knew he
had to wake the Army from its interwar slumber and grow it beyond its 174,000 soldiers—a
size that ranked it seventeenth internationally,
behind Bulgaria and Portugal. By 1941 he had
begun to move the Army toward his vision of
what it needed to become: a world-changing
force of 8,795,000 soldiers and airmen. His vision was remarkably accurate: by the end of the
war, 89 divisions and over 8,200,000 soldiers in
Army uniforms had made history.
7-122. GA Marshall reached deep within the
Army for leaders capable of the conceptual
leaps necessary to fight the impending war. He
demanded leaders ready for the huge tasks
ahead, and he accepted no excuses. As he found

FM 22-100

Historical Perspective

colonels, lieutenant colonels, and even majors
who seemed ready for the biggest challenge of
their lives, he promoted them ahead of those
more senior but less capable and made many of
them generals. He knew firsthand that such
jumps could be productive. As a lieutenant in
the Philippines, he had commanded 5,000 soldiers during an exercise. For generals who
could not adjust to the sweeping changes in the
Army, he made career shifts as well: he retired
them. His loyalty to the institution and the nation came before any personal relationships.
7-123. Merely assembling the required number
of soldiers would not be enough. The mass
Army that was forming required a new
structure to manage the forces and resources
the nation was mobilizing for the war effort.
Realizing this, GA Marshall reorganized the
Army into the Army Ground Forces, Army Air
Forces, and Army Service Forces. His foresight
organized the Army for the evolving nature of
warfare.
7-124. Preparing for combat required more
than manning the force. GA Marshall
understood that World War I had presented
confusing lessons about the future of warfare.
His in-theater experience during that war and
later reflection distilled a vision of the future.
He believed that maneuver of motorized formations spearheaded by tanks and supported logistically by trucks (instead of horse-drawn
wagons) would replace the almost siege-like
battles of World War I. So while the French
trusted the Maginot Line, GA Marshall emphasized the new technologies that would heighten
the speed and complexity of the coming conflict.
7-125. Further, GA Marshall championed the
common sense training to prepare soldiers to go
overseas ready to fight and win. By having new
units spend sufficient time on marksmanship,
fitness, drill, and fieldcraft, GA Marshall ensured that soldiers and leaders had the requisite competence and confidence to face an
experienced enemy.
7-126. Before and during the war, GA Marshall
showed a gift for communicating with the
American public. He worked closely with the
press, frequently confiding in senior newsmen
so they would know about the Army’s activities

Army Leadership

and the progress of the war. They responded to
his trust by not printing damaging or premature stories. His relaxed manner and complete
command of pertinent facts reassured the
press, and through it the nation, that America’s
youth were entrusted to the right person.
7-127. He was equally successful with
Congress. GA Marshall understood that getting
what he wanted meant asking, not demanding.
His humble and respectful approach with lawmakers won his troops what they needed; arrogant demands would have never worked.
Because he never sought anything for himself
(his five-star rank was awarded over his
objections), his credibility soared.
7-128. However, GA Marshall knew how to
shift his approach depending on the audience,
the environment, and the situation. He refused
to be intimidated by leaders such as Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Secretary of War
Henry Stimson, or even the president. Though
he was always respectful, his integrity demanded that he stand up for his deeply held
convictions—and he did, without exception.
7-129. The US role in Europe was to open a major second front to relieve pressure on the Soviet Union and ensure the Allied victory over
Germany. GA Marshall had spent years preparing the Army for Operation Overlord, the DDay invasion that would become the main effort by the Western Allies and the one expected
to lead to final victory over Nazi Germany.
Many assumed GA Marshall would command
it. President Roosevelt might have felt obligated to reward the general’s faithful and towering service, but GA Marshall never raised the
subject. Ultimately, the president told GA Marshall that it was more important that he lead
global resourcing than command a theater of
war. GA Eisenhower got the command, while
GA Marshall continued to serve on staff.
7-130. GA Marshall didn’t request the
command that would have placed him alongside
immortal combat commanders like Washington,
Grant, and Lee. His decision reflects the value of
selfless service that kept him laboring for decades without the recognition that came to some
of his associates. GA Marshall never attempted
to be anyplace but where his country needed

7-27

Strategic Leadership

him. And there, finally as Army Chief of Staff,
GA Marshall served with unsurpassed vision
and brilliance, engineering the greatest victory

in our nation’s history and setting an extraordinary example for those who came after him.

SUMMARY
7-131. Just as GA Marshall prepared for the
coming war, strategic leaders today ready the
Army for the next conflict. They may not have
years before the next D-Day; it could be just
hours away. Strategic leaders operate between
extremes, balancing a constant awareness of
the current national and global situation with a
steady focus on the Army’s long-term mission
and goals.

resource the systems that will help gain the
next success. The way strategic leaders communicate direction to soldiers, DA civilians, and
citizens determines the understanding and support for the new ideas. To communicate with
these diverse audiences, strategic leaders work
through multiple media, adjust the message
when necessary, and constantly reinforce Army
themes.

7-132. Since the nature of future military
operations is so unclear, the vision of the
Army’s strategic leaders is especially crucial.
Identifying what’s important among the concerns of mission, soldiers, weapons, logistics,
and technology produces decisions that determine the structure and capability of tomorrow’s Army.

7-135. To lead change personally and move the
Army establishment toward their concept of
the future, strategic leaders transform political
and conceptual programs into practical and
concrete initiatives. That process increasingly
involves leveraging technology and shaping the
culture. By knowing themselves, the strategic
players, the operational requirements, the geopolitical situation, and the American public,
strategic leaders position the force and the nation for success. Because there may be no time
for a World War II or Desert Storm sort of
buildup, success for Army strategic leaders
means being ready to win a variety of conflicts
now and remaining ready in the uncertain
years ahead.

7-133. Within the institution, strategic leaders
build support for the end state they desire. That
means building a staff that can take broad guidance and turn it into initiatives that move the
Army forward. To obtain the required support,
strategic leaders also seek to achieve consensus
beyond the Army, working with Congress and
the other services on budget, force structure,
and strategy issues and working with other
countries and militaries on shared interests.
The way strategic leaders communicate direction to soldiers, DA civilians, and citizens determines the understanding and support for the
new ideas.
7-134. Like GA Marshall, today’s strategic
leaders are deciding how to transform today’s
force into tomorrow’s. These leaders have little
guidance. Still, they know that they work to develop the next generation of Army leaders,
build the organizations of the future, and

7-28

7-136. Strategic leaders prepare the Army for
the future through their leadership. That
means influencing people—members of the
Army, members of other government agencies,
and the people of the nation the Army
serves—by providing purpose, direction, and
motivation. It means operating to accomplish
today’s missions, foreign and domestic. And it
means improving the institution—making
sure its people are trained and that its equipment and organizations are ready for tomorrow’s missions, anytime, anywhere.

FM 22-100

Appendix A

Roles and Relationships
A-1. When the Army speaks of soldiers, it refers
to commissioned officers, warrant officers, noncommissioned officers (NCOs), and enlisted personnel—both men and women. The terms
commissioned officer and warrant officer are
used when it is necessary to specifically address
or refer to a particular group of officers. All Army
leaders—soldiers and DA civilians—share the
same goal: to accomplish their organization’s
mission. The roles and responsibilities of Army
leaders—commissioned, warrant, noncommissioned, and DA civilian—overlap. Figure A-1
summarizes them.
A-2. Commissioned officers are direct representatives of the President of the United States.
Commissions are legal instruments the president uses to appoint and exercise direct control
over qualified people to act as his legal agents
and help him carry out his duties. The Army retains this direct-agent relationship with the
president through its commissioned officers.
The commission serves as the basis for a commissioned officer’s legal authority. Commissioned officers command, establish policy, and
manage Army resources. They are normally
generalists who assume progressively broader
responsibilities over the course of a career.
A-3. Warrant officers are highly specialized,
single-track specialty officers who receive their
authority from the Secretary of the Army upon
their initial appointment. However, Title 10
USC authorizes the commissioning of warrant
officers (WO1) upon promotion to chief warrant
officer (CW2). These commissioned warrant officers are direct representatives of the president of
the United States. They derive their authority
from the same source as commissioned officers
but remain specialists, in contrast to commissioned officers, who are generalists. Warrant officers can and do command detachments, units,
activities, and vessels as well as lead, coach,

Army Leadership

train, and counsel subordinates. As leaders and
technical experts, they provide valuable skills,
guidance, and expertise to commanders and organizations in their particular field.
A-4. NCOs, the backbone of the Army, train,
lead, and take care of enlisted soldiers. They receive their authority from their oaths of office,
law, rank structure, traditions, and regulations. This authority allows them to direct soldiers, take actions required to accomplish the
mission, and enforce good order and discipline.
NCOs represent officer, and sometimes DA
civilian, leaders. They ensure their subordinates, along with their personal equipment,
are prepared to function as effective unit and
team members. While commissioned officers
command, establish policy, and manage resources, NCOs conduct the Army’s daily
business.
A-5. As members of the executive branch of the
federal government, DA civilians are part of the
Army. They derive their authority from a variety of sources, such as commanders, supervisors, Army regulations, and Title 5 USC. DA
civilians’ authority is job-related: they normally
exercise authority related to their positions. DA
civilians fill positions in staff and base sustaining operations that would otherwise have to be
filled by officers and NCOs. Senior DA civilians
establish policy and manage Army resources,
but they do not have the authority to command.
A-6. The complementary relationship and mutual respect between the military and civilian
members of the Army is a long-standing tradition. Since the Army’s beginning in 1775, military and DA civilian duties have stayed
separate, yet necessarily related. Taken in combination, traditions, functions, and laws serve
to delineate the particular duties of military
and civilian members of the Army.

Roles and Relationships

AUTHORITY
A-7. Authority is the legitimate power of leaders to direct subordinates or to take action
within the scope of their positions. Military
authority begins with the Constitution, which
divides it between Congress and the president.
(The Constitution appears in Appendix F.) Congress has the authority to make laws that govern the Army. The president, as commander in
chief, commands the armed forces, including
the Army. Two types of military authority exist:
command and general military.

and regulations. This broad-based authority
also allows leaders to take appropriate corrective actions whenever a member of any armed
service, anywhere, commits an act involving a
breach of good order or discipline. AR 600-20,
paragraph 4-5, states this specifically, giving
commissioned, warrant, and noncommissioned
officers authority to “quell all quarrels, frays,
and disorders among persons subject to military law”—in other words, to maintain good order and discipline.

Command Authority

A-12. All enlisted leaders have general military
authority. For example, dining facility managers, platoon sergeants, squad leaders, and tank
commanders all use general military authority
when they issue orders to direct and control
their subordinates. Army leaders may exercise
general military authority over soldiers from
different units.

A-8. Command is the authority that a commander in the armed forces lawfully exercises
over subordinates by virtue of rank or assignment. Command includes the authority and responsibility for effectively using available
resources to organize, direct, coordinate, employ, and control military forces so that they accomplish assigned missions. It also includes
responsibility for health, welfare, morale, and
discipline of assigned personnel.
A-9. Command authority originates with the
president and may be supplemented by law or
regulation. It is the authority that a commander lawfully exercises over subordinates by
virtue of rank or assignment. Only commissioned and warrant officers may command
Army units and installations. DA civilians may
exercise general supervision over an Army installation or activity; however, they act under
the authority of a military supervisor. DA civilians do not command. (AR 600-20 addresses
command authority in more detail.)
A-10. Army leaders are granted command
authority when they fill command-designated
positions. These normally involve the direction
and control of other soldiers and DA civilians.
Leaders in command-designated positions have
the inherent authority to issue orders, carry out
the unit mission, and care for both military
members and DA civilians within the leader’s
scope of responsibility.
General Military Authority
A-11. General military authority originates in
oaths of office, law, rank structure, traditions,

Army Leadership

A-13. For NCOs, another source of general military authority stems from the combination of
the chain of command and the NCO support
channel. The chain of command passes orders
and policies through the NCO support channel
to provide authority for NCOs to do their job.
Delegation of Authority
A-14. Just as Congress and the president cannot participate in every aspect of armed forces
operations, most leaders cannot handle every
action directly. To meet the organization’s
goals, officers delegate authority to NCOs and,
when appropriate, to DA civilians. These leaders, in turn, may further delegate that
authority.
A-15. Unless restricted by law, regulation, or a
superior, leaders may delegate any or all of
their authority to their subordinate leaders.
However, such delegation must fall within the
leader’s scope of authority. Leaders cannot
delegate authority they do not have and subordinate leaders may not assume authority that
their superiors do not have, cannot delegate, or
have retained. The task or duty to be performed
limits the authority of the leader to which it is
assigned.

A-3

Appendix A

A-16. When a leader is assigned a task or duty,
the authority necessary to accomplish it accompanies the assignment. When a leader delegates
a task or duty to a subordinate, he delegates the
requisite authority as well. However, leaders

always retain responsibility for the outcome of
any tasks they assign. They must answer for
any actions or omissions related to them.

RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY
A-17. No definitive lines separate officer, NCO,
and DA civilian responsibilities. Officers,
NCOs, and DA civilians lead other officers,
NCOs, and DA civilians and help them carry
out their responsibilities. Commanders set
overall policies and standards, but all leaders
must provide the guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. Similarly,
subordinates must assist and advise their leaders. Mission accomplishment demands that officers, NCOs, and DA civilians work together to
advise, assist, and learn from each other. Responsibilities fall into two categories: command
and individual.
Command Responsibility
A-18. Command responsibility refers to collective or organizational accountability and includes how well units perform their missions.

For example, a company commander is responsible for all the tasks and missions assigned to
his company; his leaders hold him accountable
for completing them. Military and DA civilian
leaders have responsibility for what their sections, units, or organizations do or fail to do.
Individual Responsibility
A-19. All soldiers and DA civilians must account
for their personal conduct. Commissioned officers, warrant officers, and DA civilians assume
personal responsibility when they take their
oath. DA civilians take the same oath as commissioned officers. Soldiers take their initial
oath of enlistment. Members of the Army account for their actions to their fellow soldiers or
coworkers, the appointed leader, their unit or
organization, the Army, and the American
people.

COMMUNICATIONS AND THE CHAIN OF COMMAND
A-20. Communication among individuals,
teams, units, and organizations is essential to
efficient and effective mission accomplishment.
As Chapter 4 discusses, two-way communication is more effective than one-way communication. Mission accomplishment depends on
information passing accurately to and from
subordinates and leaders, up and down the
chain of command and NCO support channel,
and laterally among adjacent organizations or
activities. In garrison operations, organizations
working on the same mission or project should
be considered “adjacent.”
A-21. The Army has only one chain of command. Through this chain of command, leaders
issue orders and instructions and convey policies. A healthy chain of command is a two-way
communications channel. Its members do more
than transmit orders; they carry information

A-4

from within the unit or organization back up to
its leader. They furnish information about how
things are developing, notify the leader of problems, and provide requests for clarification and
help. Leaders at all levels use the chain of command—their subordinate leaders—to keep
their people informed and render assistance.
They continually facilitate the process of gaining the necessary clarification and solving
problems.
A-22. Beyond conducting their normal duties,
NCOs train soldiers and advise commanders on
individual soldier readiness and the training
needed to ensure unit readiness. Officers and DA
civilian leaders should consult their command
sergeant major, first sergeant, or NCO assistant,
before implementing policy. Commanders, commissioned and warrant officers, DA civilian leaders, and NCOs must continually communicate to

FM 22-100

Roles and Relationships

avoid duplicating instructions or issuing conflicting orders. Continuous and open lines of
communication enable commanders and DA

civilian leaders to freely plan, make decisions,
and program future training and operations.

THE NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER SUPPORT CHANNEL
A-23. The NCO support channel parallels and
reinforces the chain of command. NCO leaders
work with and support the commissioned and
warrant officers of their chain of command. For
the chain of command to work efficiently, the
NCO support channel must operate effectively.
At battalion level and higher, the NCO support
channel begins with the command sergeant major, extends through first sergeants and platoon
sergeants, and ends with section chiefs, squad
leaders, or team leaders. (TC 22-6 discusses the
NCO support channel.)
A-24. The connection between the chain of command and NCO support channel is the senior
NCO. Commanders issue orders through the
chain of command, but senior NCOs must know
and understand the orders to issue effective implementing instructions through the NCO support channel. Although the first sergeant and
command sergeant major are not part of the

formal chain of command, leaders should consult them on all individual soldier matters.
A-25. Successful leaders have a good relationship with their senior NCOs. Successful commanders have a good leader-NCO relationship
with their first sergeants and command sergeants major. The need for such a relationship
applies to platoon leaders and platoon sergeants as well as to staff officers and NCOs.
Senior NCOs have extensive experience in successfully completing missions and dealing with
enlisted soldier issues. Also, senior NCOs can
monitor organizational activities at all levels,
take corrective action to keep the organization
within the boundaries of the commander’s intent, or report situations that require the attention of the officer leadership. A positive
relationship between officers and NCOs creates
conditions for success.

DA CIVILIAN SUPPORT
A-26. The Army employs DA civilians because
they possess or develop technical skills that are
necessary to accomplish some missions. The
specialized skills of DA civilians are essential to
victory but, for a variety of reasons, they are difficult to maintain in the uniformed components. The Army expects DA civilian leaders to
be more than specialists: they are expected to
apply technical, conceptual, and interpersonal
skills together to accomplish missions—in a
combat theater, if necessary.

Army Leadership

A-27. While the command sergeant major is the
advocate in a unit for soldier issues, DA civilians have no single advocate. Rather, their own
leaders, civilian personnel advisory center, or
civilian personnel operations center represent
them and their issues to the chain of command.
Often the senior DA civilian in an organization
or the senior DA civilian in a particular career
field has the additional duty of advising and
counseling junior DA civilians on job-related issues and career development.

Appendix C

Developmental Counseling
C-1. Subordinate leadership development is
one of the most important responsibilities of
every Army leader. Developing the leaders who
will come after you should be one of your highest priorities. Your legacy and the Army’s future rests on the shoulders of those you prepare
for greater responsibility.
C-2. Leadership development reviews are a
means to focus the growing of tomorrow’s leaders. Think of them as AARs with a focus of making leaders more effective every day. These
important reviews are not necessarily limited
to internal counseling sessions; leadership feedback mechanisms also apply in operational settings such as the CTCs.
C-3. Just as training includes AARs and training strategies to fix shortcomings, leadership
development includes performance reviews.
These reviews result in agreements between
leader and subordinate on a development strategy or plan of action that builds on the subordinate’s strengths and establishes goals to
improve on weaknesses. Leaders conduct performance reviews and create plans of action
during developmental counseling.

C-4. Leadership development reviews are a
component of the broader concept of developmental counseling. Developmental counseling
is subordinate-centered communication that
produces a plan outlining actions that subordinates must take to achieve individual and organizational goals. During developmental
counseling, subordinates are not merely passive listeners; they’re actively involved in the
process. The Developmental Counseling Form
(DA Form 4856-E, which is discussed at the end
of this appendix) provides a useful framework
to prepare for almost any type of counseling.
Use it to help you mentally organize issues and
isolate important, relevant items to cover during counseling sessions.
C-5. Developmental counseling is a shared effort. As a leader, you assist your subordinates in
identifying strengths and weaknesses and creating plans of action. Then you support them
throughout the plan implementation and assessment. However, to achieve success, your
subordinates must be forthright in their commitment to improve and candid in their own assessment and goal setting.

THE LEADER’S RESPONSIBILITIES
C-6. Organizational readiness and mission accomplishment depend on every member’s ability to perform to established standards.
Supervisors must mentor their subordinates
through teaching, coaching, and counseling.
Leaders coach subordinates the same way
sports coaches improve their teams: by identifying weaknesses, setting goals, developing and
implementing plans of action, and providing
oversight and motivation throughout the process. To be effective coaches, leaders must thoroughly understand the strengths, weaknesses,
and professional goals of their subordinates.
(Chapter 5 discusses coaching.)

Army Leadership

C-7. Army leaders evaluate DA civilians using
procedures prescribed under the Total Army
Performance Evaluation System (TAPES). Although TAPES doesn’t address developmental
counseling, you can use DA Form 4856-E to
counsel DA civilians concerning professional
growth and career goals. DA Form 4856-E is
not appropriate for documenting counseling
concerning DA civilian misconduct or poor performance. The servicing civilian personnel office can provide guidance for such situations.
C-8. Soldiers and DA civilians often perceive
counseling as an adverse action. Effective leaders

C-1

Appendix C

who counsel properly can change that perception.
Army leaders conduct counseling to help subordinates become better members of the team, maintain or improve performance, and prepare for the
future. Just as no easy answers exist for exactly

what to do in all leadership situations, no easy
answers exist for exactly what to do in all counseling situations. However, to conduct effective
counseling, you should develop a counseling style
with the characteristics listed in Figure C-1.

· Purpose: Clearly define the purpose of the counseling.
· Flexibility: Fit the counseling style to the character of each subordinate and to the relationship desired.

· Respect: View subordinates as unique, complex individuals, each with a distinct set of values,
beliefs, and attitudes.

· Communication: Establish open, two-way communication with subordinates using spoken

language, nonverbal actions, gestures, and body language. Effective counselors listen more
than they speak.

· Support: Encourage subordinates through actions while guiding them through their problems.

Figure C-1. Characteristics of Effective Counseling

THE LEADER AS A COUNSELOR
C-9. Army leaders must demonstrate certain
qualities to be effective counselors. These qualities include respect for subordinates, selfawareness and cultural awareness, empathy,
and credibility.

prior to counseling subordinates. Self-aware
leaders are less likely to project their biases
onto subordinates. Also, aware leaders are
more likely to act consistently with their own
values and actions.

RESPECT FOR SUBORDINATES

C-12. Cultural awareness, as discussed in
Chapter 2, is a mental attribute. As an Army
leader, you need to be aware of the similarities
and differences between individuals of different
cultural backgrounds and how these factors
may influence values, perspectives, and actions.
Don’t let unfamiliarity with cultural backgrounds hinder you in addressing cultural issues, especially if they generate concerns
within the organization or hinder teambuilding. Cultural awareness enhances your
ability to display empathy.

C-10. As an Army leader, you show respect for
subordinates when you allow them to take responsibility for their own ideas and actions. Respecting subordinates helps create mutual
respect in the leader-subordinate relationship.
Mutual respect improves the chances of changing (or maintaining) behavior and achieving
goals.
SELF AWARENESS AND CULTURAL
AWARENESS
C-11. As an Army leader, you must be fully
aware of your own values, needs, and biases

C-2

FM 22-100

Developmental Counseling

EMPATHY
C -1 3 . Empathy i s the acti on o f b e i n g
understanding of and sensitive to the feelings,
thoughts, and experiences of another person to
the point that you can almost feel or experience
them yourself. Leaders with empathy can put
themselves in their subordinate’s shoes; they
can see a situation from the other person’s perspective. By understanding the subordinate’s
position, you can help a subordinate develop a
plan of action that fits the subordinate’s personality and needs, one that works for the subordinate. If you don’t fully comprehend a
situation from your subordinate’s point of view,
you have less credibility and influence and your

subordinate is less likely to commit to the
agreed upon plan of action.
CREDIBILITY
C-14. Leaders achieve credibility by being honest and consistent in their statements and actions. To be credible, use a straightforward
style with your subordinates. Behave in a manner that your subordinates respect and trust.
You can earn credibility by repeatedly demonstrating your willingness to assist a subordinate and being consistent in what you say and
do. If you lack credibility with your subordinates you’ll find it difficult to influence them.

LEADER COUNSELING SKILLS
C-15. One challenging aspect of counseling is
selecting the proper approach to a specific
situation. To counsel effectively, the technique
you use must fit the situation, your capabilities,
and your subordinate’s expectations. In some
cases, you may only need to give information or
listen. A subordinate’s improvement may call
for just a brief word of praise. Other situations
may require structured counseling followed by
definite actions.
C-16. All leaders should seek to develop and
improve their own counseling abilities. You can
improve your counseling techniques by studying human behavior, learning the kinds of problems that affect your subordinates, and
developing your interpersonal skills. The techniques needed to provide effective counseling
will vary from person to person and session to
session. However, general skills that you’ll
need in almost every situation include active
listening, responding, and questioning.

· Eye contact. Maintaining eye contact

·

·
·

ACTIVE LISTENING
C-17. During counseling, you must actively listen to your subordinate. When you’re actively
listening, you communicate verbally and nonverbally that you’ve received the subordinate’s
message. To fully understand a subordinate’s
message, you must listen to the words and observe the subordinate’s manners. Elements of
active listening you should consider include—

Army Leadership

·

without staring helps show sincere interest.
Occasional breaks of contact are normal and
acceptable. Subordinates may perceive
excessive breaks of eye contact, paper shuffling, and clock-watching as a lack of interest or concern. These are guidelines only.
Based on cultural background, participants
in a particular counseling session may have
different ideas about what proper eye
contact is.
Body posture. Being relaxed and comfortable will help put the subordinate at
ease. However, a too-relaxed position or
slouching may be interpreted as a lack of interest.
Head nods. Occasionally nodding your
head shows you’re paying attention and
encourages the subordinate to continue.
Facial expressions. Keep your facial
expressions natural and relaxed. A blank
look or fixed expression may disturb the
subordinate. Smiling too much or frowning
may discourage the subordinate from
continuing.
Verbal expressions. Refrain from talking
too much and avoid interrupting. Let the
subordinate do the talking while keeping
the discussion on the counseling subject.
Speaking only when necessary reinforces
the importance of what the subordinate is
saying and encourages the subordinate to

C-3

Appendix C

continue. Silence can also do this, but be
careful. Occasional silence may indicate to
the subordinate that it’s okay to continue
talking, but a long silence can sometimes be
distracting and make the subordinate feel
uncomfortable.
C-18. Active listening also means listening
thoughtfully and deliberately to the way a subordinate says things. Stay alert for common
themes. A subordinate’s opening and closing
statements as well as recurring references may
indicate the subordinate’s priorities. Inconsistencies and gaps may indicate a subordinate’s
avoidance of the real issue. This confusion and
uncertainty may suggest additional questions.
C-19. While listening, pay attention to the subordinate’s gestures. These actions complete the
total message. By watching the subordinate’s
actions, you can “see” the feelings behind the
words. Not all actions are proof of a subordinate’s feelings, but they should be taken into
consideration. Note differences between what
the subordinate says and does. Nonverbal indicators of a subordinate’s attitude include—

· Boredom. Drumming on the table,

doodling, clicking a ball-point pen, or resting the head in the palm of the hand.
· Self-confidence. Standing tall, leaning
back with hands behind the head, and
maintaining steady eye contact.
· Defensiveness. Pushing deeply into a
chair, glaring at the leader, and making
sarcastic comments as well as crossing or
folding arms in front of the chest.
· Frustration. Rubbing eyes, pulling on an
ear, taking short breaths, wringing the
hands, or frequently changing total body position.
· Interest, friendliness, and openness.
Moving toward the leader while sitting.
· Openness or anxiety. Sitting on the edge
of the chair with arms uncrossed and hands
open.
C-20. Consider these indicators carefully. Although each indicator may show something
about the subordinate, don’t assume a particular behavior absolutely means something. Ask
the subordinate about the indicator so you can

C-4

better understand the behavior and allow the
subordinate to take responsibility for it.
RESPONDING
C-21. Responding skills follow-up on active listening skills. A leader responds to communicate
that the leader understands the subordinate.
From time to time, check your understanding:
clarify and confirm what has been said. Respond
to subordinates both verbally and nonverbally.
Verbal responses consist of summarizing, interpreting, and clarifying the subordinate’s message. Nonverbal responses include eye contact
and occasional gestures such as a head nod.
QUESTIONING
C-22. Although questioning is a necessary skill,
you must use it with caution. Too many questions can aggravate the power differential between a leader and a subordinate and place the
subordinate in a passive mode. The subordinate
may also react to excessive questioning as an intrusion of privacy and become defensive. During a leadership development review, ask
questions to obtain information or to get the
subordinate to think about a particular situation. Generally, the questions should be openended so as to evoke more than a yes or no answer. Well-posed questions may help to verify
understanding, encourage further explanation,
or help the subordinate move through the
stages of the counseling session.
COUNSELING ERRORS
C-23. Effective
leaders
avoid
common
counseling mistakes. Dominating the counseling by talking too much, giving unnecessary or
inappropriate “advice,” not truly listening, and
projecting personal likes, dislikes, biases, and
prejudices all interfere with effective
counseling. You should also avoid other common mistakes such as rash judgments, stereotypes, loss of emotional control, inflexible
methods of counseling and improper follow-up.
To improve your counseling skills, follow the
guidelines in Figure C-2.

FM 22-100

THE LEADER’S LIMITATIONS
C-24. Army leaders can’t help everyone in every
situation. Even professional counselors can’t
provide all the help that a person might need.
You must recognize your limitations and, when
the situation calls for it, refer a subordinate to a
person or agency more qualified to help.

Army Leadership

C-25. These agencies Figure C-3 lists can help
you and your people resolve problems. Although
it’s generally in an individual’s best interest to
seek help first from their first-line leaders, leaders must always respect an individual’s right to
contact most of these agencies on their own.

Developmental Counseling

TYPES OF DEVELOPMENTAL COUNSELING
C-26. You can often categorize developmental
counseling based on the topic of the session. The
two major categories of counseling are eventoriented and performance/professional growth.
EVENT-ORIENTED COUNSELING
C-27. Event-oriented counseling involves a
specific event or situation. It may precede
events, such as going to a promotion board or
attending a school; or it may follow events, such
as a noteworthy duty performance, a problem
with performance or mission accomplishment,
or a personal problem. Examples of eventoriented counseling include, but are not limited
to—

· Specific instances of superior or substan·

·

knows and achieves the standard. Once the subordinate can achieve the standard, you should
end the corrective training.
C-31. When counseling a subordinate for a specific performance, take the following actions:

· Tell the subordinate the purpose of the
·
·
·

dard performance.
Reception and integration counseling.
Crisis counseling.
Referral counseling.
Promotion counseling.
Separation counseling.

·
·

Counseling for Specific Instances

·

C-28. Sometimes counseling is tied to specific
instances of superior or substandard duty performance. You tell your subordinate whether or
not the performance met the standard and what
the subordinate did right or wrong. The key to
successful counseling for specific performance
is to conduct it as close to the event as possible.
C-29. Many leaders focus counseling for specific instances on poor performance and miss,
or at least fail to acknowledge, excellent performance. You should counsel subordinates for
specific examples of superior as well as substandard duty performance. To measure your own
performance and counseling emphasis, you can
note how often you document counseling for superior versus substandard performance.
C-30. You should counsel subordinates who
don’t meet the standard. If the subordinate’s
performance is unsatisfactory because of a lack
of knowledge or ability, you and the subordinate should develop a plan to improve the subordinate’s skills. Corrective training may be
required at times to ensure the subordinate

·

counseling, what was expected, and how the
subordinate failed to meet the standard.
Address the specific unacceptable behavior
or action, not the person’s character.
Tell the subordinate the effect of the behavior, action, or performance on the rest of the
organization.
Actively listen to the subordinate’s response.
Remain unemotional.
Teach the subordinate how to meet the
standard.
Be prepared to do some personal counseling,
since a failure to meet the standard may be
related to or the result of an unresolved personal problem.
Explain to the subordinate what will be
done to improve performance (plan of action). Identify your responsibilities in implementing the plan of action; continue to
assess and follow up on the subordinate’s
progress. Adjust plan of action as necessary.

Reception and Integration Counseling
C-32. As the leader, you must counsel new
team members when they arrive at your organization. This reception and integration counseling serves two purposes. First, it identifies and
helps fix any problems or concerns that new
members may have, especially any issues resulting from the new duty assignment. Second,
it lets them know the organizational standards
and how they fit into the team. It clarifies job titles and sends the message that the chain of

counseling should begin immediately upon arrival so new team members can quickly become
integrated into the organization. (Figure C-4

Figure C-4. Reception and Integration Counseling Points
Crisis Counseling
C-33. You may conduct crisis counseling to get
a subordinate through the initial shock after receiving negative news, such as notification of
the death of a loved one. You may assist the subordinate by listening and, as appropriate, providing assistance. Assistance may include
referring the subordinate to a support activity
or coordinating external agency support. Crisis
counseling focuses on the subordinate’s immediate, short-term needs.
Referral Counseling
C-34. Referral counseling helps subordinates
work through a personal situation and may or
may not follow crisis counseling. Referral counseling may also act as preventative counseling
before the situation becomes a problem. Usually, the leader assists the subordinate in identifying the problem and refers the subordinate
to the appropriate resource, such as Army Community Services, a chaplain, or an alcohol and
drug counselor. (Figure C-3 lists support activities.)
Promotion Counseling
C-35. Leaders must conduct promotion counseling for all specialists and sergeants who are
eligible for advancement without waivers but
not recommended for promotion to the next
higher grade. Army regulations require that

C-8

soldiers within this category receive initial
(event-oriented) counseling when they attain
full eligibility and then periodic (performance/personal growth) counseling thereafter.
Adverse Separation Counseling
C-36. Adverse separation counseling may involve informing the soldier of the administrative actions available to the commander in the
event substandard performance continues and
of the consequences associated with those administrative actions (see AR 635-200).
C-37. Developmental counseling may not apply
when an individual has engaged in more serious
acts of misconduct. In those situations, you
should refer the matter to the commander and
the servicing staff judge advocate. When the
leader’s rehabilitative efforts fail, counseling
with a view towards separation fills an administrative prerequisite to many administrative discharges and serves as a final warning to the
soldier to improve performance or face discharge. In many situations, it may be beneficial
to involve the chain of command as soon as you
determine that adverse separation counseling
might be required. A unit first sergeant or commander should be the person who informs the
soldier of the notification requirements outlined in AR 635-200.

FM 22-100

Developmental Counseling

PERFORMANCE AND PROFESSIONAL
GROWTH COUNSELING
Performance Counseling
C-38. During performance counseling, you conduct a review of a subordinate’s duty performance during a certain period. You and the
subordinate jointly establish performance objectives and standards for the next period.
Rather than dwelling on the past, you should focus the session on the subordinate’s strengths,
areas needing improvement, and potential.
C-39. Performance counseling is required under the officer, NCO, and DA civilian evaluation
reporting systems. The OER process requires
periodic performance counseling as part of the
OER Support Form requirements. Mandatory,
face-to-face performance counseling between
the rater and the rated NCO is required under
the NCOERS. TAPES includes a combination
of both of these requirements.
C-40. Counseling at the beginning of and during the evaluation period facilitates a subordinate’s involvement in the evaluation process.
Performance counseling communicates standards and is an opportunity for leaders to establish and clarify the expected values, attributes,
skills, and actions. Part IVb (Leader Attributes/Skills/Actions) of the OER Support Form
(DA Form 67-9-1) serves as an excellent tool for
leaders doing performance counseling. For
lieutenants and warrant officers one, the major
performance objectives on the OER Support
Form are used as the basis for determining the
developmental tasks on the Junior Officer Developmental Support Form (DA Form 67-9-1a).
Quarterly face-to-face performance and developmental counseling is required for these junior
officers as outlined in AR 623-105.
C-41. As an Army leader, you must ensure
you’ve tied your expectations to performance
objectives and appropriate standards. You must
establish standards that your subordinates can
work towards and must teach them how to
achieve the standards if they are to develop.

and professional goals. You conduct this
counseling to assist subordinates in achieving
organizational and individual goals. During the
counseling, you and your subordinate conduct a
review to identify and discuss the subordinate’s
strengths and weaknesses and create a plan of
action to build upon strengths and overcome
weaknesses. This counseling isn’t normally
event-driven.
C-43. As part of professional growth
counseling, you may choose to discuss and develop a “pathway to success” with the subordinate.
This
future-oriented
counseling
establishes short- and long-term goals and objectives. The discussion may include opportunities for civilian or military schooling, future
duty assignments, special programs, and reenlistment options. Every person’s needs are different, and leaders must apply specific courses
of action tailored to each individual.
C-44. Career field counseling is required for
lieutenants and captains before they’re
considered for promotion to major. Raters
and senior raters, in conjunction with the
rated officer, need to determine where the officer’s skills best fit the needs of the Army.
During career field counseling, consideration
must be given to the rated officer’s preference and his abilities (both performance and
academic). The rater and senior rater should
discuss career field designation with the officer prior to making a recommendation on the
rated officer’s OER.
C-45. While these categories can help you organize and focus counseling sessions, they
should not be viewed as separate, distinct, or
exhaustive. For example, a counseling session that focuses on resolving a problem may
also address improving duty performance. A
session focused on performance may also include a discussion on opportunities for professional growth. Regardless of the topic of
the counseling session, leaders should follow
the same basic format to prepare for and
conduct it.

Professional Growth Counseling
C-42. Professional growth counseling includes
planning for the accomplishment of individual

Appendix C

APPROACHES TO COUNSELING
C-46. An effective leader approaches each subordinate as an individual. Different people and
different situations require different counseling approaches. Three approaches to counseling include nondirective, directive, and
combined. These approaches differ in the techniques used, but they all fit the definition of
counseling and contribute to its overall purpose. The major difference between the approaches is the degree to which the subordinate
participates and interacts during a counseling
session. Figure C-5 summarizes the advantages
and disadvantages of each approach.
NONDIRECTIVE
C-47. The nondirective approach is preferred
for most counseling sessions. Leaders use their
experienced insight and judgment to assist subordinates in developing solutions. You should
partially structure this type of counseling by
telling the subordinate about the counseling
process and explaining what you expect.
C-48. During the counseling session, listen
rather than make decisions or give advice. Clarify what’s said. Cause the subordinate to bring
out important points, so as to better understand the situation. When appropriate, summarize the discussion. Avoid providing solutions or
rendering opinions; instead, maintain a focus
on individual and organizational goals and objectives. Ensure the subordinate’s plan of action supports those goals and objectives.

C-10

DIRECTIVE
C-49. The directive approach works best to correct simple problems, make on-the-spot corrections, and correct aspects of duty performance.
The leader using the directive style does most of
the talking and tells the subordinate what to do
and when to do it. In contrast to the nondirective approach, the leader directs a course of action for the subordinate.
C-50. Choose this approach when time is short,
when you alone know what to do, or if a subordinate has limited problem-solving skills. It’s
also appropriate when a subordinate needs
guidance, is immature, or is insecure.
COMBINED
C-51. In the combined approach, the leader
uses techniques from both the directive and
nondirective approaches, adjusting them to articulate what’s best for the subordinate. The
combined approach emphasizes the subordinate’s planning and decision-making
responsibilities.
C-52. With your assistance, the subordinate
develops the subordinate’s own plan of action.
You should listen, suggest possible courses, and
help analyze each possible solution to determine its good and bad points. You should then
help the subordinate fully understand all aspects of the situation and encourage the subordinate to decide which solution is best.

COUNSELING TECHNIQUES
C-53. As an Army leader, you may select from a
variety of techniques when counseling subordinates. These counseling techniques, when appropriately used, cause subordinates to do
things or improve upon their performance. You
can use these methods during scheduled counseling sessions or while simply coaching a subordinate. Counseling techniques you can use
during the nondirective or combined approaches include—

· Suggesting alternatives. Discuss al-

ternative actions that the subordinate may
take, but both you and the subordinate decide which course of action is most appropriate.

· Recommending. Recommend one course

of action, but leave the decision to accept
the recommended action to the subordinate.

· Persuading. Persuade the subordinate
that a given course of action is best, but

Army Leadership

· leave the decision to the subordinate. Suc-

·

cessful persuasion depends on the leader’s
credibility, the subordinate’s willingness to
listen, and their mutual trust.
Advising. Advise the subordinate that a
given course of action is best. This is the
strongest form of influence not involving a
command.

C-54. Some techniques you can use during the
directive approach to counseling include—

· Corrective training. Teach and assist the

subordinate in attaining and maintaining
the standards. The subordinate completes
corrective training when the subordinate
attains the standard.

· Commanding. Order the subordinate to

take a given course of action in clear, exact
words. The subordinate understands that
he has been given a command and will face
the consequences for failing to carry it out.

C-11

Appendix C

THE COUNSELING PROCESS
C-55. Effective leaders use the counseling process. It consists of four stages:

·
·
·
·

Identify the need for counseling.
Prepare for counseling.
Conduct counseling.
Follow up.
IDENTIFY THE NEED FOR
COUNSELING

C-56. Quite often organizational policies, such
as counseling associated with an evaluation or
counseling required by the command, focus a
counseling session. However, you may conduct
developmental counseling whenever the need
arises for focused, two-way communication
aimed at subordinate development. Developing
subordinates consists of observing the subordinate’s performance, comparing it to the standard, and then providing feedback to the
subordinate in the form of counseling.
PREPARE FOR COUNSELING
C-57. Successful counseling requires preparation. To prepare for counseling, do the
following:

·
·
·
·
·
·
·

Select a suitable place.
Schedule the time.
Notify the subordinate well in advance.
Organize information.
Outline the counseling session components.
Plan your counseling strategy.
Establish the right atmosphere.
Select a Suitable Place

C-58. Schedule counseling in an environment
that minimizes interruptions and is free from
distracting sights and sounds.
Schedule the Time
C-59. When possible, counsel a subordinate
during the duty day. Counseling after duty
hours may be rushed or perceived as unfavorable. The length of time required for
counseling depends on the complexity of the issue. Generally a counseling session should last
less than an hour. If you need more time,

C-12

schedule a second session. Additionally, select a
time free from competition with other activities
and consider what has been planned after the
counseling session. Important events can
distract a subordinate from concentrating on
the counseling.
Notify the Subordinate Well in Advance
C-60. For a counseling session to be a
subordinate-centered, two-person effort, the
subordinate must have time to prepare for it.
The subordinate should know why, where, and
when the counseling will take place. Counseling
following a specific event should happen as
close to the event as possible. However, for performance or professional development counseling, subordinates may need a week or more to
prepare or review specific products, such as
support forms or counseling records.
Organize Information
C-61. Solid preparation is essential to
effective counseling. Review all pertinent information. This includes the purpose of the
counseling, facts and observations about the
subordinate, identification of possible problems, main points of discussion, and the development of a plan of action. Focus on
specific and objective behaviors that the subordinate must maintain or improve as well as
a plan of action with clear, obtainable goals.
Outline the Components of the
Counseling Session
C-62. Using the information obtained, determine what to discuss during the counseling session. Note what prompted the counseling,
what you aim to achieve, and what your role as
a counselor is. Identify possible comments or
questions to help you keep the counseling session subordinate-centered and help the subordinate progress through its stages. Although
you never know what a subordinate will say or
do during counseling, a written outline helps
organize the session and enhances the chance
of positive results. (Figure C-6 is one example
of a counseling outline prepared by a platoon
leader about to conduct an initial NCOER
counseling session with a platoon sergeant.)

FM 22-100

Developmental Counseling

Type of counseling: Initial NCOER counseling for SFC Taylor, a recently promoted new arrival to
the unit.
Place and time: The platoon office, 1500 hours, 9 October.
Time to notify the subordinate: Notify SFC Taylor one week in advance of the scheduled
counseling session.
Subordinate preparation: Have SFC Taylor put together a list of goals and objectives he would
like to complete over the next 90 to 180 days. Review the values, attributes, skills, and actions
from FM 22-100.
Counselor preparation:
· Review the NCO Counseling Checklist/Record (DA Form 2166-8-1).
· Update or review SFC Taylor’s duty description and fill out the rating chain and duty description
on the working copy of the NCOER (DA Form 2166-8, Parts II and III).
· Review each of the values and responsibilities in Part IV of the NCOER and the values, attributes,
skills and actions in FM 22-100. Think of how each applies to SFC Taylor and the platoon sergeant position.
· Review the actions you consider necessary for a success or excellence in each value and responsibility.
· Make notes in blank spaces in Part IV of the NCOER to assist when counseling.
Role as counselor: Help SFC Taylor to understand the expectations and standards associated
with the platoon sergeant position. Assist SFC Taylor in developing the values, attributes, skills,
and actions that will enable him to achieve his performance objectives, consistent with those of the
platoon and company. Resolve any aspects of the job that aren’t clearly understood.
Session outline: Complete an outline following the counseling session components in Figure C-7
and based on the draft duty description on the NCOER, ideally at least two to three days prior to
the actual counseling session.
Figure C-6. Example of a Counseling Outline
Plan Counseling Strategy
C-63. As many approaches to counseling exist
as there are leaders. The directive, nondirective, and combined approaches to counseling
were addressed earlier. Use a strategy that
suits your subordinates and the situation.
Establish the Right Atmosphere
C-64. The right atmosphere promotes two-way
communication between a leader and subordinate. To establish a relaxed atmosphere, you
may offer the subordinate a seat or a cup of coffee. You may want to sit in a chair facing the
subordinate since a desk can act as a barrier.
C-65. Some situations make an informal
atmosphere inappropriate. For example, during
counseling to correct substandard performance, you may direct the subordinate to
remain standing while you remain seated
behind a desk. This formal atmosphere,

Army Leadership

normally used to give specific guidance,
reinforces the leader’s rank, position in the
chain of command, and authority.
CONDUCT THE COUNSELING
SESSION
C-66. Be flexible when conducting a counseling
session. Often counseling for a specific incident
occurs spontaneously as leaders encounter subordinates in their daily activities. Such counseling can occur in the field, motor pool,
barracks—wherever subordinates perform
their duties. Good leaders take advantage of
naturally occurring events to provide subordinates with feedback.
C-67. Even when you haven’t prepared for formal counseling, you should address the four basic components of a counseling session. Their
purpose is to guide effective counseling rather

C-13

Appendix C

than mandate a series of rigid steps. Counseling
sessions consist of—

·
·
·
·

Opening the session.
Discussing the issues.
Developing the plan of action.
Recording and closing the session.

Ideally, a counseling session results in a subordinate’s commitment to a plan of action. Assessment of the plan of action (discussed below)
becomes the starting point for follow-up
counseling. (Figure C-7 is an example of a counseling session.)
Open the Session
C-68. In the session opening, state the purpose
of the session and establish a subordinatecentered setting. Establish the preferred setting
early in the session by inviting the subordinate
to speak. The best way to open a counseling session is to clearly state its purpose. For example,
an appropriate purpose statement might be:
“The purpose of this counseling is to discuss
your duty performance over the past month and
to create a plan to enhance performance and attain performance goals.” If applicable, start the
counseling session by reviewing the status of
the previous plan of action.

subordinate to define the issue as an
unreasonable standard—unless you consider
the standard negotiable or are willing to alter
the conditions under which the subordinate
must meet the standard.
Develop a Plan of Action
C-71. A plan of action identifies a method for
achieving a desired result. It specifies what the
subordinate must do to reach the goals set during the counseling session. The plan of action
must be specific: it should show the subordinate
how to modify or maintain his behavior. It
should avoid vague intentions such as “Next
month I want you to improve your land navigation skills.” The plan must use concrete and direct terms. For example, you might say: “Next
week you’ll attend the map reading class with
1st Platoon. After the class, SGT Dixon will
coach you through the land navigation course.
He will help you develop your skill with the
compass. I will observe you going through the
course with SGT Dixon, and then I will talk to
you again and determine where and if you still
need additional training.” A specific and achievable plan of action sets the stage for successful
development.
Record and Close the Session

C-69. You and the subordinate should attempt
to develop a mutual understanding of the
issues. You can best develop this by letting the
subordinate do most of the talking. Use active
listening; respond, and question without
dominating the conversation. Aim to help the
subordinate better understand the subject of
the counseling, for example, duty performance,
a problem situation and its impact, or potential
areas for growth.

C-72. Although requirements to record counseling sessions vary, a leader always benefits by
documenting the main points of a counseling
session. Documentation serves as a reference to
the agreed upon plan of action and the subordinate’s accomplishments, improvements, personal preferences, or problems. A complete
record of counseling aids in making recommendations for professional development, schools,
promotions, and evaluation reports.

C-70. Both you and the subordinate should
provide examples or cite specific observations
to reduce the perception that either is unnecessarily biased or judgmental. However, when the
issue is substandard performance, you should
make clear how the performance didn’t meet
the standard. The conversation, which should
be two-way, then addresses what the subordinate needs to do to meet the standard. It’s important that you define the issue as
substandard performance and don’t allow the

C-73. Additionally, Army regulations require
written records of counseling for certain personnel actions, such as a barring a soldier from
reenlisting, processing a soldier for administrative separation, or placing a soldier in the overweight program. When a soldier faces
involuntary separation, the leader must take
special care to maintain accurate counseling
records. Documentation of substandard actions
conveys a strong corrective message to
subordinates.

C-14

FM 22-100

Developmental Counseling

C-74. To close the session, summarize its key
points and ask if the subordinate understands
the plan of action. Invite the subordinate to review the plan of action and what’s expected of
you, the leader. With the subordinate, establish
any follow-up measures necessary to support
the successful implementation of the plan of action. These may include providing the subordinate with resources and time, periodically
assessing the plan, and following through on referrals. Schedule any future meetings, at least
tentatively, before dismissing the subordinate.
FOLLOW UP
Leader’s Responsibilities
C-75. The counseling process doesn’t end with
the counseling session. It continues through
implementation of the plan of action and
evaluation of results. After counseling, you
must support subordinates as they implement
their plans of action. Support may include

teaching, coaching, or providing time and resources. You must observe and assess this process and possibly modify the plan to meet its
goals. Appropriate measures after counseling
include follow-up counseling, making referrals,
informing the chain of command, and taking
corrective measures.
Assess the Plan of Action
C-76. The purpose of counseling is to develop
subordinates who are better able to achieve personal, professional, and organizational goals.
During the assessment, review the plan of action with the subordinate to determine if the
desired results were achieved. You and the subordinate should determine the date for this assessment during the initial counseling session.
The assessment of the plan of action provides
useful information for future follow-up counseling sessions.

Open the Session
· Establish a relaxed environment. Explain to SFC Taylor that the more one discusses and understands Army values and leader attributes, skills, and actions, the easier it is to develop and incorporate them into an individual leadership style.
· State the purpose of the counseling session. Explain that the initial counseling is based on leader
actions (what SFC Taylor needs to do to be a successful platoon sergeant) and not on professional developmental needs (what SFC Taylor needs to do to develop further as an NCO).
· Come to an agreement on the duty description, the meaning of each value and responsibility, and
the standards for success and excellence for each value and responsibility. Explain that subsequent counseling will focus on SFC Taylor’s developmental needs as well as how well SFC Taylor
is meeting the jointly agreed upon performance objectives. Instruct SFC Taylor to perform a selfassessment during the next quarter to identify his developmental needs.
· Ensure SFC Taylor knows the rating chain. Resolve any questions that SFC Taylor has about the
job. Discuss the team relationship that exists between a platoon leader and a platoon sergeant
and the importance of two-way communication between them.
Discuss the Issue
· Jointly review the duty description on the NCOER, including the maintenance, training, and taking
care of soldiers responsibilities. Mention that the duty description can be revised as necessary.
Highlight areas of special emphasis and appointed duties.
· Discuss the meaning of each value and responsibility on the NCOER. Discuss the values, attributes, skills, and actions outlined in FM 22-100. Ask open-ended questions to see if SFC Taylor
can relate these items to his role as a platoon sergeant.

Figure C-7. Example of a Counseling Session

C-15

Appendix C

· Explain that even though the developmental tasks focus on developing leader actions, character development forms the basis for leadership development. Character and actions can’t be viewed as
separate; they’re closely linked. In formulating the plan of action to accomplish major performance
objectives, the proper values, attributes, and skills form the basis for the plan. As such, character development must be incorporated into the plan of action.
Assist in Developing a Plan of Action (During the Counseling Session)
· Ask SFC Taylor to identify actions that will facilitate the accomplishment of the major performance
objectives. Categorize each action into one of the values or responsibilities listed on the NCOER.
· Discuss how each value and responsibility applies to the platoon sergeant position. Discuss specific examples of success and excellence in each value and responsibility block. Ask SFC Taylor
for suggestions to make the goals more objective, specific, and measurable.
· Ensure that SFC Taylor has at least one example of a success or excellence bullet listed under
each value and responsibility.
· Discuss SFC Taylor’s promotion goals and ask him what he considers to be his strengths and
weakness. Obtain copies of the last two master sergeant selection board results and match his
goals and objectives to these.
Close the Session
· Check SFC Taylor’s understanding of the duty description and performance objectives.
· Stress the importance of teamwork and two-way communication.
· Ensure SFC Taylor understands that you expect him to assist in your development as a platoon
leader. This means that both of you have the role of teacher and coach.
· Remind SFC Taylor to perform a self-assessment during the next quarter.
· Set a tentative date during the next quarter for the routinely scheduled follow-up counseling.
Notes on Strategy
· Facilitate answering any questions SFC Taylor may have.
· Expect SFC Taylor to be uncomfortable with the terms and the developmental process; respond
in a way that encourages participation throughout the session.

PART II - BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Purpose of Counseling: (Leader states the reason for the counseling, e.g. performance/professional or eventoriented counseling and includes the leader's facts and observations prior to the counseling):
The purpose of this counseling is to inform PFC Lloyd of his responsibility to manage his financial affairs and the
potential consequences of poorly managing finances and to help PFC Lloyd develop a plan of action to resolve his
financial problems.

Facts: The battery commander received notice of delinquent payment on PFC Lloyd's Deferred Payment Plan (DPP).
A payment of $86.00 is 45 days delinquent
PART III - SUMMARY OF COUNSELING
Complete this section during or immediately subsequent to counseling.
Key Points of Discussion:

PFC Lloyd, late payments on a DPP account reflect a lack of responsibility and poor managing of finances. You should
know that the letter of lateness has been brought to the attention of the battery commander, the first sergeant, and the
platoon sergeant. They're all questioning your ability to manage your personal affairs. I also remind you that promotions
and awards are based more than on just performing MOS-related duties; soldiers must act professionally and responsibly
in all areas. Per conversation with PFC Lloyd, the following information was obtained:
He didn't make the DPP payment due to a lack of funds in his checking account. His most recent long distance phone bill
was over $220 due to calling his house concerning his grandmother's failing health. PFC Lloyd stated that he wanted to
pay for the phone calls himself in order not to burden his parents with the expense of collect calls. He also stated that his
calling had tapered down considerably and he expects this month's phone bill to be approximately $50. We made an
appointment at ACS and ACS came up with the following information:
PFC Lloyd's monthly obligations: Car payment: $330
Car insurance: $138
Rent including utilities: $400
Other credit cards: $0
Total monthly obligations: $868.00
Monthly take-home pay: $1232.63
We discussed that with approximately $364 available for monthly living expenses, a phone bill in excess of $200 will
severely affect PFC Lloyd's financial stability and can't continue. We discussed the need for PFC Lloyd to establish a
savings account to help cover emergency expenses. PFC Lloyd agreed that his expensive phone bill and his inability to
make the DPP payment is not responsible behavior. He confirmed that he wants to get his finances back on track and
begin building a savings account.

Plan of Action: (Outlines actions that the subordinate will do after the counseling session to reach the agreed upon goals(s).
The actions must be specific enough to modify or maintain the subordinate's behavior and include a specific time line for
implementation and assessment (Part IV below)).
Based on our discussion, PFC Lloyd will be able to resume normal payment on his DPP account next month (assuming that
his phone bill is approximately $50). PFC Lloyd agreed to contact the DPP office and provide a partial payment of $20
immediately. He agreed to exercise self-restraint and not make long distance calls as frequently. He decided that his goal
is to make one ten-minute phone call every two weeks. He will write letters to express concern over his grandmother's
condition and ask his parents to do the same to keep him informed. His long-term goal is to establish a savings account
with a goal of contributing $50 a month.
PFC Lloyd also agreed to attend the check cashing class at ACS on 2, 9, and 16 April.

Figure D-1. The Leader Plan of Action Development Process

D-3. Begin your plan of action by assessing
your unit (Step 1). Observe, interact, and
gather feedback from others; or conduct formal
assessments of the workplace. Then analyze
the information you gathered to identify what
needs improvement (Step 2). Once you have
identified what needs improvement, begin to
develop courses of action to make the
improvements.
D-4. In Step 3, you develop your plan of action.
First, develop and consider several possible
courses of action to correct the weaknesses you
identified. Gather important information, assess the limitations and risks associated with
the various courses, identify available key personnel and resources, and verify facts and assumptions. Attempt to predict the outcome for
each possible course of action. Based on your
predictions, select several leader actions to deal
with the problems.

Army Leadership

D-5. Execute your plan of action (Step 4) by
educating, training, or counseling your subordinates; instituting new policies or procedures;
and revising or enforcing proper systems of rewards and punishment. Your organization
moves towards excellence by improving substandard or weak areas and maintaining conditions that meet or exceed the standard. Finally,
periodically reassesses your unit to identify new
matters of concern or to evaluate the effectiveness of the leader actions.
D-6. You can use this process for many areas of
interest within your organization. A case study
demonstrating how to use an ECAS to prepare
a leader plan of action follows. It includes a description of how one leader gathered information to complete the survey. (You can obtain the
form used to conduct an ECAS through Training Support Centers by ordering GTA 22-6-1.)

D-1

Appendix D

PREPARATION OF AN ECAS
D-7. 2LT Christina Ortega has been a military
police platoon leader for almost eight months.
When she first came to the platoon, it was a
well-trained, cohesive group. Within two
months of her taking charge, she and her
platoon deployed on a six-month rotation to
support operations in Bosnia. The unit performed well, and she quickly earned a reputation as a leader with high standards for herself
and her unit. Now redeployed, she must have
her platoon ready in two months for a rotation
at the Combat Maneuver Training Center
(CMTC). She realizes that within that time she
must get the unit’s equipment ready for deployment, train her soldiers on different missions
they will encounter at the CMTC, and provide
them some much needed and deserved time off.
D-8. As 2LT Ortega reflects on her first eight
months of leadership, she remembers how she
took charge of the platoon. She spoke individually with the leaders in the platoon about her
expectations and gathered information about
her subordinates. She stayed up all night completing the leadership philosophy memorandum that she gave to every member of her
platoon. After getting her feet on the ground
and getting to know her soldiers, she assessed
the platoon’s ethical climate using the ECAS.
Her unit’s overall ECAS score was very good.
She committed herself to maintaining that
positive ethical climate by continuing the established policies and by monitoring the climate
periodically.
D-9. Having completed a major deployment
and received a recent influx of some new
soldiers, 2LT Ortega decides to complete another ECAS. She heads to the unit motor pool to
observe her soldiers preparing for the next
day’s training exercise. The platoon is deploying to the local training area for the “best
squad” competition prior to the ARTEP evaluation at the CMTC. “The best squad competition
has really become a big deal in the company,”
she thinks. “Squad rivalry is fierce, and the
squad leaders seem to be looking for an edge so
they can come out on top and win the weekend
pass that goes to the winning squad.”

D-2

D-10. She talks to as many of her soldiers as
she can, paying particular attention to the newest members of the unit. One new soldier, a vehicle driver for SSG Smith, the 2nd Squad
Leader, appears very nervous and anxious.
During her conversation with the soldier, 2LT
Ortega discovers some disturbing information.
D-11. The new soldier, PFC O’Brien, worries
about his vehicle’s maintenance and readiness
for the next day. His squad leader has told him
to “get the parts no matter what.” PFC O’Brien
says that he admires SSG Smith because he realizes that SSG Smith just wants to perform
well and keep up the high standards of his previous driver. He recounts that SSG Smith has
vowed to win the next day’s land navigation
competition. “SSG Smith even went so far as to
say that he knows we’ll win because he already
knows the location of the points for the course.
He saw them on the XO’s desk last night and
wrote them on his map.”
D-12. 2LT Ortega thanks the soldier for talking honestly with her and immediately sets him
straight on the proper and improper way to get
repair parts. By the time she leaves, PFC
O’Brien knows that 2LT Ortega has high standards and will not tolerate improper means of
meeting them. Meanwhile, 2LT Ortega heads
back toward the company headquarters to find
the XO.
D-13. She finds the XO busily scribbling numbers and dates on pieces of paper. He is obviously involved and frantic. He looks up at her
and manages a quick “Hi, Christina,” before returning to his task. The battalion XO apparently did not like the way the unit status report
(USR) portrayed the status of the maintenance
in the battalion and refused to send that report
forward. Not completely familiar with the USR,
2LT Ortega goes to the battalion motor officer
to get some more information. After talking to a
few more people in her platoon, 2LT Ortega
completes the ECAS shown in Figure D-2.

Assessment
Survey

An ethical climate is one in which our stated Army values are routinely
articulated, supported, practiced and respected. The Ethical Climate of an
organization is determined by a variety of factors, including the individual
character of unit members, the policies and practices within the
organization, the actions of unit leaders, and environmental and mission
factors. Leaders should periodically assess their unit’s ethical climate and
take appropriate actions to maintain the high ethical standards expected of
all Army organizations. This survey will assist you in making these
assessments and in identifying the actions necessary to accomplish this
vital leader function. FM 22-100, Army Leadership, provides specific
leader actions necessary to sustain or improve your ethical climate, as
necessary.

Answer the questions in this survey according to how you currently perceive your
unit and your own leader actions, NOT according to how you would prefer them to
be or how you think they should be. This information is for your use, (not your

PREPARATION OF A LEADER PLAN OF ACTION
D-14. 2LT Ortega looks at her ECAS score and
determines that she needs to take action to improve the ethical climate in her platoon. To help
determine where she should begin, 2LT Ortega
looks at the scores for each question. She knows
that any question receiving a “1” or “2” must be
addressed immediately in her plan of action. As
2LT Ortega reviews the rest of the scores for
her unit, she identifies additional problems to
correct. Furthermore, she decides to look at a
few actions in which her unit excels and to describe ways to sustain the performance. As she
continues to develop the leader plan of action,
she looks at each subject she has identified. She

D-4

next develops the plan shown in Figure D-3 to
correct the deficiencies. At the bottom of the
form, she lists at least two actions she plans to
take to maintain the positive aspects of her platoon’s ethical climate.
D-15. 2LT Ortega has already completed the
first three steps (assess, analyze, and develop a
plan of action) specified in Figure D-1. When she
takes action to implement the plan she will have
completed the process. She must then follow up
to ensure her actions have the effects she
intended.

FM 22-100

A Leader Plan of Action

Actions to correct negative aspects of the ethical climate in the organization
Problem: Dysfunctional competition/stress in the unit (the competition is causing some members of
the unit to seek ways to gain an unfair advantage over others) [ECAS question # II.C., IV.A. &
IV.C.]
Action:

· Postpone the platoon competition; focus on the readiness of equipment and soldier preparation
rather than competition.
· Build some time in the long-range calendar to allow soldiers time to get away from work and
relax.
· Focus on the group’s accomplishment of the mission (unit excellence). Reward the platoon, not
squads, for excellent performance. Reward teamwork.

Problem: Battalion XO “ordering” the changing of reports [IV B., D. & F.]
Action:

· Go see the company XO first and discuss what he should do.
· If the XO won’t deal with it, see the commander myself to raise the issue.

Problem: Squad leader’s unethical behavior [I.B. & II.A.]
Action:

· Reprimand the squad leader for getting the land navigation points unfairly.
· Counsel the squad leader on appropriate ways to give instructions and accomplish the mission
without compromising values.

Problem: Unclear instructions given by the squad leader (“get the parts no matter what”) [II.A.]
Action:

· Have the platoon sergeant give a class (NCODP) on proper guidelines for giving instructions
·

and appropriate ethical considerations when asking subordinates to complete a task.
Have the platoon sergeant counsel the squad leader(s) on the importance of using proper supply
procedures.

Problem: Company XO “changing report” to meet battalion XO’s needs [IV.B. & F.]
Action:

· Have an informal discussion with the company XO about correct reporting or see the company
commander to raise the issue about the battalion XO.

Actions to maintain positive aspects of the ethical climate in the organization
Maintain: Continue to hold feedback (sensing) sessions and conduct ECAS assessments to maintain
a feel for how the platoon is accomplishing its mi ssion. [ I I .D. & G.; III.A. & B.]
Maintain: Continue to reward people who perform to high standards without compromising values.
Punish those caught compromising them. [III.E. & F.]

Appendix E

Character Development
E-1. Everyone who becomes part of America’s
Army, soldier or DA civilian, has character. On
the day a person joins the Army, leaders begin
building on that character. Army values emphasize the relationship between character
and competence. Although competence is a
fundamental attribute of Army leaders,
character is even more critical. This appendix
discusses the actions Army leaders take to develop their subordinates’ character.
E-2. Army leaders are responsible for refining
the character of soldiers and DA civilians. How
does the Army as an institution ensure proper
character development? What should leaders
do t o incul cate A rmy val ues i n t he i r
subordinates?
E-3. Leaders teach Army values to every new
member of the Army. Together with the leader
attributes described in Chapter 2, Army values

establish the foundation of leaders of character.
Once members learn these values, their leaders
ensure adherence. Adhering to the principles
Army values embody is essential, for the Army
cannot tolerate unethical behavior. Unethical
behavior destroys morale and cohesion; it
undermines the trust and confidence essential
to teamwork and mission accomplishment.
E-4. Ethical conduct must reflect beliefs and
convictions, not just fear of punishment. Over
time, soldiers and DA civilians adhere to Army
values because they want to live ethically and
profess the values because they know it’s right
to do so. Once people believe and demonstrate
Army values, they are persons of character. Ultimately, Army leaders are charged with the
with the essential role of developing character
in others. Figure E-1 shows the leader actions
that support character development.

Appendix E

LEADERS TEACH VALUES;
SUBORDINATES LEARN THE
CULTURE
E-5. Army leaders must teach their subordinates moral principles, ethical theory,
Army values, and leadership attributes.
Through their leaders’ programs, soldiers and
DA civilians develop character through education, experience, and reflection. By educating
their subordinates and setting the example,
Army leaders enable their subordinates to
make ethical decisions that in turn contribute
to excellence. Subordinates gain deeper
understanding from experiencing, observing,
and reflecting on the aspects of Army leadership under the guidance of their leaders.
E-6. Inculcating Army values doesn’t end with
basic training. All Army leaders should seek to
deepen subordinates’ understanding of the
ethical aspects of character through classes, informal discussions, one-on-one coaching, and
formal developmental counseling. Army leaders can also improve their own understanding
through study, reflection, and discussions with
peers and superiors.
LEADERS REINFORCE VALUES;
SUBORDINATES COMPLY
E-7. Leaders reinforce and discipline behavior
to guide subordinates’ development. To help
subordinates live according to Army values,
leaders enforce rules, policies, and regulations.
Still, soldiers and DA civilians of character do
more than merely comply with established institutional rules. Acting correctly but without
complete understanding or sound motivation is
not good enough in America’s values-based
Army. People of character behave correctly
through correct understanding and personal
desire. Understanding comes from training and
self-development. Personal desire comes from a
person’s realization that Army values are
worth adopting and living by and from that person’s decision to do just that.
E-8. Character stems from a thorough
understanding of Army values; however, this
understanding must go beyond knowing the
one-line definitions. Individuals must also

E-2

know why Army values are important and how
to apply them to everyday Army life. Leaders
can promote Army values by setting the example themselves and pointing out other examples
of Army values in both normal and exceptional
activities. Army leaders can use unit histories
and traditions, prominent individuals, and recent events to bring Army values to life and explain why adhering to them is important.
LEADERS SHAPE THE ETHICAL
CLIMATE; SUBORDINATES
INTERNALIZE ARMY VALUES
E-9. Doing the right thing is good. Doing the
right thing for the right reason and with the
right intention is better. People of character
must possess the desire to act ethically in all
situations. One of the Army leader’s primary
responsibilities is to maintain an ethical
climate that supports development of such a
character. When an organization’s ethical
climate nurtures ethical behavior, over time,
people think, feel, and act ethically—they internalize the aspects of sound character.
E-10. Leaders should influence others’
character development and foster correct actions through role modeling, teaching, and
coaching. Army leaders seek to build a climate
in which subordinates and organizations can
reach their full potential. Together, these
actions promote organizational excellence.
E-11. Army leaders can use the ECAS to assess
ethical aspects of their own character and actions, the workplace, and the external environment. Once they have done their assessment,
leaders prepare and carry out a plan of action.
The plan of action focuses on solving ethical
problems within the leaders’ span of influence;
leaders pass ethical problems they cannot
change to higher headquarters. E-12. Becoming
a person of character and a leader of character
is a career-long process involving both selfdevelopment and developmental counseling.
While individuals are responsible for their own
character development, leaders are responsible
for encouraging, supporting, and assessing the
efforts of their subordinates. Leaders of character can develop only through continual study,
reflection, experience, and feedback.

Appendix F

The Constitution of the United States
As a member of the Army, you have taken an oath to “support and defend the Constitution of the United
States against all enemies, foreign and domestic [and to] bear true faith and allegiance to the same.” But
what is this document that you have sworn to protect? In essence, the Constitution is a blueprint
establishing the powers and responsibilities of the three branches of the United States government as
well as the rights of American citizens. Especially important for the Army are those provisions in the
Constitution that place fundamental military authority in Congress and the president. As part of that
authority, Congress has the power to “provide for the common Defense,” which includes the power to
“raise and support Armies,” and the president is the commander in chief of the armed forces. So the
Constitution establishes the critical principle that America’s military leaders are subordinate to the
nation’s civilian authorities. Given the importance of that concept to our system of government, this
appendix contains a copy of the US Constitution. As you read it, you will see that, although the
Constitution was written over 200 years ago, it remains relevant today for Army leaders and all
Americans.

THE PREAMBLE
We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for

Bibliography
The Army uses the world wide web to disseminate information. All major commands and schools
maintain web pages. Since uniform resource locators (URLs) change from time to time, this bibliography
does not list any. If you do not know the URL for an organization’s web page, you can usually find it by
accessing the page for the major command or installation the organization belongs to and looking for a
link to the organization’s page. The Center for Army Leadership maintains a page under the US Army
Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, KS. The US Army Training and Doctrine
Command home page contains a link to Fort Leavenworth’s home page. The library or learning center at
your installation will provide you with free Internet access for official business. In addition, DA Pam 25-30
(available on CD-ROM) lists all Army publications and blank forms. Use it to find Army publications
related to specific topics. The US Army Publishing Agency (USAPA) home page has a link to an online
extract of DA Pam 25-30 which can link you to full-text copies of selected publications.
