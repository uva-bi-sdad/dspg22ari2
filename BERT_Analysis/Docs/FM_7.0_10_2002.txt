_____________________________________________________________________ Preface The U. S. Army exists for one reason—to serve the Nation. From the earliest days of its crea- tion, the Army has embodied and defended the American way of life and its constitutional sys- tem of government. It will continue to answer the call to fight and win our Nation’s wars, when- ever and wherever they may occur. That is the Army’s non-negotiable contract with the Ameri- can people. The Army will do whatever the Nation asks it to do, from decisively winning wars to promoting and keeping the peace. To this end, the Army must be strategically responsive and ready to be dominant at every point across the full spectrum of military operations. Today, the Army must meet the challenge of a wider range of threats and a more complex set of operating environments while incorporating new and diverse technology. The Army meets these challenges through its core competencies: Shape the Security Environment, Prompt Response, Mobilize the Army, Forcible Entry Operations, Sustained Land Dominance and Support Civil Authorities. We must maintain combat readiness as our primary focus while transitioning to a more agile, versatile, lethal, and survivable Army. Doctrine represents a professional army’s collective thinking about how it intends to fight, train, equip, and modernize. When the first edition of FM 25-100, Training the Force, was published in 1988, it represented a revolution in the way the Army trains. The doctrine articulated by FMs 25-100, Training the Force, and 25-101, Battle Focused Training, has served the Army well. These enduring principles of training remain sound; much of the content of these manuals re- mains valid for both today and well into the future. FM 7-0 updates FM 25-100 to our current operational environment and will soon be followed by FM 7-1, which will update FM 25-101. FM 7-0 is the Army’s capstone training doctrine and is applicable to all units, at all levels, and in all components. While the examples in this manual are principally focused at division and below, FM 7-0 provides the essential fundamentals for all individual, leader, and unit training. Training for warfighting is our number one priority in peace and in war. Warfighting readiness is derived from tactical and technical competence and confidence. Competence relates to the ability to fight our doctrine through tactical and technical execution. Confidence is the individ- ual and collective belief that we can do all things better than the adversary and the unit pos- sesses the trust and will to accomplish the mission. FM 7-0 provides the training and leader development methodology that forms the foundation for developing competent and confident soldiers and units that will win decisively in any environ- ment. Training is the means to achieve tactical and technical competence for specific tasks, con- ditions, and standards. Leader Development is the deliberate, continuous, sequential, and pro- gressive process, based on Army values, that develops soldiers and civilians into competent and confident leaders capable of decisive action. Closing the gap between training, leader development, and battlefield performance has always been the critical challenge for any army. Overcoming this challenge requires achieving the correct balance between training management and training execution. Training management focuses leaders on the science of training in terms of resource efficiencies (such as people, time, and ammunition) measured against tasks and standards. Training execution focuses leaders on the art of leadership to develop trust, will, and teamwork under varying conditions—intangibles that must be developed to win decisively in combat. Leaders integrate this science and art to identify the right tasks, conditions, and standards in training, foster unit will and spirit, and then adapt to the battlefield to win decisively. iv ____________________________________________________________________ Training the Force FM 7-0 provides the Training Management Cycle and the necessary guidelines on how to plan, execute, and assess training and leader development. Understanding “How the Army Trains the Army” to fight is key to successful joint, interagency, multinational (JIM), and combined arms operations. Effective training leads to units that execute the Army’s core competencies and ca- pabilities. All leaders are trainers! This manual is designed for leaders at every level and in every type of organization in the Army. The proponent for this publication is U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC).

Train for decisive warfighting. Train soldiers now, and grow leaders for the next conflict. Ensure that our soldiers are physically and mentally prepared to dominate the next battlefield—no soldier goes into harm’s way untrained. Our soldiers must be comfortable and confident in the elements—fieldcraft, field- craft, fieldcraft. General Eric Shinseki THE TRAINING IMPERATIVE 1-1. Every soldier, noncommissioned officer (NCO), warrant officer, and offi- cer has one primary mission—to be trained and ready to fight and win our Nation's wars. Success in battle does not happen by accident; it is a direct result of tough, realistic, and challenging training. The Army exists to deter war, or if deterrence fails, to reestablish peace through victory in combat wherever U.S. interests are challenged. To accomplish this, the Army's forces must be able to perform their assigned strategic, operational, and tac- tical missions. For deterrence to be effective, potential enemies must know with certainty that the Army has the credible, demonstrable capability to mobilize, deploy, fight, sustain, and win any conflict. Training is the process that melds human and materiel resources into these required capabilities. The Army has an obligation to the American people to ensure its soldiers go into battle with the assurance of success and survival. This is an obligation that only rigorous and realistic training, conducted to standard, can fulfill. 1-2. We train the way we fight because our historical experiences show the direct correlation between realistic training and success on the battlefield. Today's leaders must apply the lessons of history in planning training for to- morrow's battles. We can trace the connection between training and success in battle to our Army’s earliest experiences during the American Revolution. General Washington had long sensed the need for uniform training and or- ganization and, during the winter of 1777-1778 while camped at Valley Forge, he secured the appointment of Von Steuben, a Prussian, as inspector general in charge of training. Von Steuben clearly understood the difference between the American citizen-soldier and the European professional. He noted early that American soldiers had to be told why they did things before they would do them well, and he applied this philosophy in his training. It 1-1 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ helped the Continental soldiers understand and endure the rigorous and de- manding training he put them through. After Valley Forge, Continentals would fight on equal terms with British Regulars. Von Steuben began the tradition of effective unit level training that today still develops leaders and forges battle-ready units for the Army. 1-3. Over two centuries later, the correlation between tough, realistic train- ing and success on the battlefield remains the same. During Operation En- during Freedom, and Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan, the U.S. Army de- ployed a trained and ready force on short notice to a contemporary battlefield fighting against a coalition of rebel forces on difficult terrain. 1-4. These units trained to their wartime mission, and developed company grade officers, NCOs, and soldiers who knew their jobs and were confident they could act boldly and decisively. Their confidence, and technical and tac- tical competence gave them the ability to adapt to the mission and harsh en- vironment with resounding success. Airmobile infantry quickly perfected methods of routing rebel forces from heavily fortified caves. Special forces teams rode horses with their host nation counterparts—learning to call in tactical air support with devastating accuracy while on the move. Staffs quickly learned how to integrate Special Operations Forces (SOF) and con- ventional force operations. Engineer units cleared mine fields that were as old as many of their soldiers involved in the clearing process. Again, Ameri- can soldiers had met the enemy and decisively defeated them. 1-5. The Army’s battle-focused training was validated. These soldiers trained as they planned to fight and won. Their success was due to the Army’s emphasis on battle focused training which emphasized training es- sential warfighting tasks to standard and building cohesive combined arms teams able to adapt to the mission. Army units today train, alert, and deploy prepared for combat. Their battle focused training experience gives them the flexibility to continue training and adapting to the mission as it evolves. THE STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT 1-6. In an era of complex national security requirements, the Army's strate- gic responsibilities now embrace a wider range of missions that present even greater challenges in our training environment. To "train the way we fight," commanders and leaders at all levels must conduct training with respect to a wide variety of operational missions across the full spectrum of operations. These operations may include combined arms, joint, multinational, and in- teragency considerations, and span the entire breadth of terrain and envi- ronmental possibilities. Commanders must strive to set the daily training conditions as closely as possible to those expected for actual operations. 1-7. The operational missions of the Army include not only war, but also military operations other than war (MOOTW). Operations may be conducted as major combat operations, a small-scale contingency, or a peacetime mili- tary engagement. Offensive and defensive operations normally dominate military operations in war along with some small-scale contingencies. Stabil- ity operations and support operations dominate in MOOTW. Commanders at all echelons may combine different types of operations simultaneously and 1-2 __________________________________________________________________ How the Army Trains sequentially to accomplish missions in war and MOOTW. Throughout this document, we will emphasize the primary function of the Army—to fight and win our Nation's wars. Implicit in the emphasis is the mounting importance of MOOTW. These missions also require training; future conflict will likely involve a mix of combat and MOOTW, often concurrently. The range of pos- sible missions complicates training. Army forces cannot train for every pos- sible mission; they train for war and prepare for specific missions as time and circumstances permit. The nature of world crises requires Army forces to si- multaneously train, deploy, and execute. Therefore, at Army level, warfight- ing will encompass the full spectrum of operations that the Army may be called upon to execute. Warfighting in units is refined and focused on as- signed wartime missions or directed change of missions. 1-8. Contingency operations in the 1990s normally followed a sequence of alert, train, deployment, extended build-up, and shaping operations followed by a period of decisive operations. To be truly responsive and meet our com- mitments, Army forces must be deployable and capable of rapidly concentrat- ing combat power in an operational area with minimal additional training. Our forces today use a train, alert, deploy sequence. We cannot count on the time or opportunity to correct or make up training deficiencies after deploy- ment. Maintaining forces that are ready now, places increased emphasis on training and the priority of training. This concept is a key link between op- erational and training doctrine. 1-9. Units train to be ready for war based on the requirements of a precise and specific mission; in the process, they develop a foundation of combat skills, which can be refined based on the requirements of the assigned mis- sion. Upon alert, commanders assess and refine from this foundation of skills. In the train, alert, deploy process commanders use whatever time the alert cycle provides to continue to refine mission-focused training. Training continues during time available between alert notification and deployment, between deployment and employment, and even during employment as units adapt to the specific battlefield environment and assimilate combat replace- ments. 1-10. Resources for training are not unconstrained and compete with other missions and activities. Time is the inelastic resource, there is not enough and it cannot be increased. We cannot do everything; we must forge and sus- tain trained and ready forces. Training for the warfight, training to maintain near-term readiness is the priority; compliance training and non-mission ac- tivities are of lower priority. If training cannot be conducted, readiness re- ports are the vehicle to inform the Army’s leadership of the risks being as- sumed. 1-11. The key to winning on the battlefield is the understanding of "how we fight" and the demonstrated confidence, competence, and initiative of our sol- diers and leaders. Training is the means to achieve the tactical and technical proficiency that soldiers, leaders, and units must have to enable them to ac- complish their missions. Training focuses on fighting and winning battles. The proficiency derived from this training is the same required for many MOOTW tasks. The ability to integrate and synchronize all available assets to defeat any enemy tactically gives our Army great credibility and respect that enhances our ability to accomplish all missions to include MOOTW. 1-3 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ 1-12. Responsibility for success on the future battlefield rests on the shoul- ders of today's Army leaders at all levels. To ensure this success, all leaders must focus training on warfighting skills, and make that training the prior- ity. JOINT, INTERAGENCY, MULTINATIONAL (JIM) TRAINING 1-13. The purpose of joint training is to prepare the Army to execute mis- sions as a part of a joint force in the conduct of joint military operations and across the full spectrum of conflict. Employing Army forces at the right place and time allows combatant commanders to conduct decisive land operations along with air, sea, and space-based operations. The Army provides to a joint force commander (JFC) trained and ready forces that expand the com- mander’s range of military options. Army commanders tailor and train forces to react quickly to any crisis. 1-14. Commanders of major Army headquarters may serve as the joint force land component commander (JFLCC), a combined forces commander (CFC), or as the joint task force commander (JTFC). To perform these assignments organizations conduct joint training. 1-15. Joint training uses joint doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures, and the training involves more than one Service component. However, two or more Services training together using their respective service doctrine, tac- tics, techniques, and procedures are Service-sponsored interoperability train- ing. Although, not classified as joint training, Service sponsored interopera- bility is a vital component of joint proficiency and readiness. 1-16. Multinational training is based on applicable multinational, joint and/or service doctrine and is designed to prepare organizations for combined operations with allied nations. 1-17. Interagency training is based on applicable standard operating proce- dures; and, is designed to prepare the Army to operate in conjunction with government agencies. 1-18. The Army training doctrine contained in this manual provides Army commanders the tools to develop experienced leaders and adaptive organiza- tions prepared to exercise command and control of joint and multinational forces, and to provide interagency unity of effort. HOW THE ARMY TRAINS THE ARMY 1-19. Training is a team effort and the entire Army—Department of the Army, major Army commands (MACOMs), the institutional training base, units, the combat training centers (CTC), each individual soldier and the ci- vilian work force—has a role that contributes to force readiness. Department of the Army and MACOMs are responsible for resourcing the Army to train. The institutional Army including schools, training centers, and NCO aca- demies, for example, train soldiers and leaders to take their place in units in the Army by teaching the doctrine and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). Units, leaders, and individuals train to standard on their assigned missions, first as an organic unit and then as an integrated component of a 1-4 __________________________________________________________________ How the Army Trains team. Operational deployments, and major training opportunities such as major training exercises, CTCs, CTC-like training, and external evaluations (EXEVAL) provide rigorous, realistic, and stressful training and operational experience under actual or simulated combat and operational conditions to enhance unit readiness and produce bold, innovative leaders. Simultane- ously, individual soldiers, NCOs, warrant officers, officers, and the civilian work force are responsible for training themselves through personal self- development. Training is a continuous, lifelong endeavor that produces com- petent, confident, disciplined, and adaptive soldiers and leaders with the warrior ethos in our Army. Commanders have the ultimate responsibility to train soldiers and develop leaders who can adjust to change with confidence and exploit new situations, technology, and developments to their advantage. The result of this Army-wide team effort is a training and leader develop- ment system that is unrivaled in the world. Effective training produces the force—soldiers, leaders, and units—that can successfully execute any as- signed mission. 1-20. The Army Training and Leader Development Model (figure 1-1) cen- ters on developing trained and ready units led by competent and confident leaders. The model identifies an important interaction that trains soldiers now and develops leaders for the future. Leader Development is a lifelong learning process. The three core domains that shape the critical learning ex- periences throughout a soldier’s and leader’s career are the operational, institutional, and self-development domains. Together, these domains interact using feedback and assessment from various sources and methods to maximize warfighting readiness. Each domain has specific, measurable actions that must occur to develop our leaders. The operational domain includes home station training, combat training center rotations, joint training exercises, and operational deployments that satisfy national objectives. Each of these actions provides foundational experiences for soldiers, leaders, and unit development. The institutional domain focuses on educating and training soldiers and leaders on the key knowledge, skills, and attributes required to operate in any environment. It includes individual, unit and joint schools, and advanced education. The self-development domain, both structured and informal, focuses on taking those actions necessary to reduce or eliminate the gap between operational and institutional experiences. Throughout this lifelong learning and experience process, there is formal and informal assessment and feedback of performance to prepare leaders for their next level of responsibility. Assess- ment is the method used to determine the proficiency and potential of leaders against a known standard. Feedback must be clear, formative guidance directly related to the outcome of training events measured against standards. 1-5 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ Figure 1-1. Army Training and Leader Development Model 1-21. The importance of training the technical skills to develop competent soldiers and leaders must be directly linked to creating confident soldiers, leaders, and units with the will and warrior spirit to dominate in any envi- ronment. The operational, institutional, and self-development domains are influenced by and adapted based on the overall strategic context of the Army. Joint, interagency, and multinational training, education, and individual as- signment experiences shape the competence and confidence of leaders and units. 1-22. All of these interrelated activities take place within the Army’s culture or shared set of beliefs, values, and assumptions that define for us what is most important. Our culture is ingrained in our new soldiers and reinforced daily to all of us in order to provide a positive framework for everything we do. A detailed discussion of Army culture will be addressed in FM 6-22, Leadership, and the updated version of DA PAM 350-58, Leader Develop- ment for America’s Army. LEADER TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT 1-23. The Army is a profession, the Profession of Arms. Warfighting in de- fense of U. S. values and interests is the core competency of this profession. As a profession, the development of each member becomes the foundation, involving a lifelong devotion to duty both while in uniform and upon return to the civilian life. Professional development involves more than mastering technical skills. What is uniquely distinct to the military profession is its 1-6 __________________________________________________________________ How the Army Trains emphasis on not only what is to be accomplished, but how it is accomplished and with the full realization that the profession of arms may require of its members, the supreme sacrifice. Professional development extends to incul- cating the Army values of Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Integrity, Honor, and Personal Courage in every soldier to create a warrior ethos based on camaraderie and service to our Nation. Professional education provides the foundation involving a variety of training domains ranging from institu- tional schooling, self-study, and operational experience to personal interac- tion with superiors, peers, and subordinates. All of these interactions are es- sential in developing and understanding training and leader development for warfighting. 1-24. Competent and confident leaders are a prerequisite to the successful training of ready units. It is important to understand that leader training and leader development are integral parts of unit readiness. Leaders are in- herently soldiers first and should be technically and tactically proficient in basic soldier skills. They are also adaptive, capable of sensing their envi- ronment, adjusting the plan when appropriate, and properly applying the proficiency acquired through training. 1-25. Leader training is an expansion of these skills that qualifies them to lead other soldiers. As such, the doctrine and principles of training leader tasks is the same as that for any other task set forth in FM 7-0 and requires the same level of attention of senior commanders. Leader training occurs in the institutional Army, the unit, the combat training centers, and through self-development. Leader training is just one portion of leader development. 1-26. Leader development is the deliberate, continuous, sequential, and pro- gressive process, grounded in Army values, that grows soldiers and civilians into competent and confident leaders capable of decisive action. Leader de- velopment is achieved through the lifelong synthesis of the knowledge, skills, and experiences gained through institutional training and education, organ- izational training, operational experience, and self-development. Command- ers play the key role in leader development that ideally produces tactically and technically competent, confident, and adaptive leaders who act with boldness and initiative in dynamic, complex situations to execute mission- type orders achieving the commander’s intent. THE INSTITUTIONAL DOMAIN 1-27. The institutional Army (schools and training centers) is the foundation for lifelong learning. The institution is a key enabler for unit readiness. It develops competent, confident, disciplined, and adaptive leaders and soldiers able to succeed in situations of great uncertainty. The institution provides the framework to develop future leadership characteristics that produce criti- cal thinkers capable of full spectrum visualization, systems understanding, and mental agility. Institutional training and education enhances military knowledge, individual potential, initiative, and competence in warfighting skills. It infuses an ethos of service to the Nation and the Army, and pro- vides the educational, intellectual, and experiential foundation for success on the battlefield. The institution teaches Army doctrine and provides the experiences that train leaders and soldiers. It trains them to adapt to uncer- 1-7 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ tainty and be creative and innovative problem solvers as members of lethal units and battle staffs in combined arms, and JIM operations. Institutions provide training on common tasks and a selected portion of occupation- related critical tasks, and continue to provide lifelong, through mutual reach, access to training materials for individual soldier or unit use. The elements of institutional training and education include— INITIAL MILITARY TRAINING (IMT) 1-28. This training provides the basic skills, knowledge, and task proficiency to become a soldier and subsequently to succeed as members of a small Army unit, contribute to unit mission accomplishment, and survive on the battle- field. IMT is the foundation training given to all personnel upon entering the Army. It provides an ordered transition from being a civilian to becoming a soldier, motivation to become a dedicated and productive member of the Army, and qualification on basic critical soldier skills and knowledge. IMT instills an appreciation for the Army in a democratic society, inspires the Army warrior ethos, and establishes Army values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage. Newly commissioned officers will be competent and confident small unit leaders trained in field- craft. Warrant officers will be technically proficient in the systems associ- ated with their functional specialty. Enlisted soldiers will be qualified in the critical military occupational specialty tasks and standards defined by their branch proponent. The soldierization and professional development process continues under the leadership of NCOs when these new soldiers arrive in their first unit. PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION (PME) 1-29. PME develops Army leaders. Officer, warrant officer, and NCO train- ing and education is a continuous, career-long, learning process that inte- grates structured programs of instruction—resident at the institution and non-resident via distributed learning at home station. PME is progressive and sequential, provides a doctrinal foundation, and builds on previous train- ing, education and operational experiences. PME provides hands-on techni- cal, tactical, and leader training focused to ensure leaders are prepared for success in their next assignment and higher-level responsibility. • Officer Education System (OES). Army officers must lead and fight; be tactically and technically competent; possess leader skills; understand how the Army operates as a service, as well as a component of a joint, multinational, or interagency organization; demonstrate confidence, in- tegrity, critical judgment, and responsibility; operate in a complex, uncer- tain, and rapidly changing environment; build effective teams amid con- tinuous organizational and technological change; and solve problems creatively. OES develops officers who are self-aware and adaptive to lead Army units to mission success. • Warrant Officer Education System (WOES). Warrant officers are the Army's technical experts. WOES develops a corps of highly specialized experts and trainers who are fully competent and proficient operators, maintainers, administrators, and managers of the Army's equipment, support activities, and technical systems. 1-8 __________________________________________________________________ How the Army Trains • NCO Education System (NCOES). NCOES trains NCOs to lead and train soldiers, crews, and subordinate leaders who work and fight under their leadership. NCOES provides hands-on technical, tactical, and leader training focused to ensure that NCOs are prepared for success in their next assignment and higher-level responsibility. • Functional Training. In addition to the preceding PME courses, there are functional courses available in both resident and non-resident dis- tributed learning modes that enhance functional skills for specific duty positions. Examples are Battalion S2, Battalion Motor Officer, First Ser- geant, Battle Staff NCO, and Airborne courses. THE OPERATIONAL DOMAIN 1-30. Soldier and leader training and development continue in the unit. Us- ing the institutional foundation, training in organizations and units focuses and hones individual and team skills and knowledge. COMMANDER'S RESPONSIBILITY 1-31. The unit commander is responsible for the wartime readiness of all elements in the formation. The commander is, therefore, the primary trainer of the organization, responsible for ensuring that all training is conducted in accordance with the unit’s mission essential task list (METL) to the Army standard. This is the commander's number one priority. The command cli- mate must reflect this priority. The commander analyzes the unit's wartime mission and develops the unit's METL. Using appropriate doctrine and mis- sion training plans (MTPs), the commander plans training and briefs the training plan to the senior commander. The senior commander is responsible for resourcing, ensuring stability and predictability, protecting training from interference, and executing and assessing training. Commanders ensure MTP standards are met during all training. If they are not, the unit must re- train until the tasks are performed to standard. Train to standard, not to time. 1-32. Key to effective unit training is the commander’s involvement and presence in planning, preparing, executing, and assessing unit training to standard. Commanders ensure MTP standards are met during all training. If a squad, platoon, or company fails to meet established standards for identi- fied METL tasks, the unit must retrain until the tasks are performed to standard. Training to standard on METL tasks is more important than com- pletion of an event such as an EXEVAL. Focus on sustaining METL profi- ciency—this is the critical factor commanders must adhere to when training small units. NCO RESPONSIBILITY 1-33. A great strength of the U.S. Army is its professional NCO Corps who take pride in being responsible for the individual training of soldiers, crews, and small teams. They ensure the continuation of the soldierization process of new soldiers when they arrive in the unit. Within the unit, the NCO sup- port channel (leadership chain) parallels and complements the chain of com- mand. It is a channel of communication and supervision from the command 1-9 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ sergeant major (CSM) to first sergeant and then to other NCOs and enlisted personnel. In addition, NCOs train soldiers to the non-negotiable standards published in MTPs and soldiers training publications (STP). Commanders will define responsibilities and authority of their NCOs to their staffs and subordinates. UNIT RESPONSIBILITY 1-34. Unit training consists of three components: collective training that is derived directly from METL and MTPs, leader development that is embedded in the collective training tasks and in discrete individual leader focused training, and individual training that establishes, improves, and sustains individual soldier proficiency in tasks directly related to the unit METL. Commanders conduct unit training to prepare soldiers and leaders for unit missions. All units concentrate on improving and sustaining unit task profi- ciency. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTION AND UNIT 1-35. The goal of unit training is to develop and sustain the capability to de- ploy rapidly, and to fight and win as part of a combined arms team in a vari- ety of operational and organizational environments. Training in both the in- stitution and the unit works together toward achieving this goal. Institu- tions provide foundational training and education and, when combined with individual unit experience, provide soldiers and leaders what they need to succeed in each subsequent level of service throughout their careers, appro- priate to new and increasing levels of responsibility. The institutions also provide reach-back capability for functional and duty position-related train- ing or reference materials throughout a soldier’s service. Unit commanders, through subordinate leaders, build on the foundation provided by Army schools to continue developing the skills and knowledge required for mission success, as articulated in the unit’s METL. Unit commanders are responsible for sustaining small unit leader and individual soldier skills to support the unit's mission. Institutions are responsible to stay abreast of requirements and developments in the field to ensure the foundations they set prepare sol- diers for duty in their units. OPERATIONAL TRAINING AND MAJOR EXERCISES 1-36. Leader, individual soldier, and unit training and development continue during operational missions and major training events. These events en- hance leader development and combat readiness. They improve leader skills and judgment while increasing unit collective proficiency through realistic and challenging training and real-time operational missions. 1-37. Major training events such as situational training exercises (STX), EXEVALs, and deployment exercises provide feedback to assist commanders in assessing the effectiveness of their leader, individual soldier, unit, and maintenance training programs. Units and individuals establish and sustain their tactical and technical training proficiency. Leaders learn to solve tacti- cal problems, and to give appropriate and meaningful orders. They get feed- back on the quality of their decisions and obtain an understanding of impact 1-10 __________________________________________________________________ How the Army Trains that the frictions of the battlefield have on their decisions. Adaptive leaders are tactically and technically competent, confident in their abilities, and rou- tinely demonstrate initiative within the framework of their commander’s in- tent. Major training events provide experiences that contribute to developing leader, soldier, and unit adaptiveness. 1-38. The CTC Program, consisting of the National Training Center (NTC), Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC), Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC), Battle Command Training Program (BCTP), and other CTC-like training provides highly realistic and stressful joint and combined arms training based on current doctrine. Commanders fight with the equipment they would expect to take to war, arrayed against a free-thinking, opportun- istic opposing force (OPFOR) with an equal chance to win, monitored by a dedicated, well-trained, and experienced observer/controller team. Conse- quences of tactical decisions are fully played out in scenarios where the out- come is not assured. Doctrine-based after action reviews (AAR) identify strengths and shortcomings in unit planning, preparation, and execution, and guide leaders to accept responsibility for shortcomings and produce a fix. The CTC Program is the Army's premier training and leader development experience. It provides the following tangible benefits to the Army: • Produces bold, innovative leaders through stressful tactical and opera- tional exercises. • Embeds doctrine throughout the Army. • Provides feedback to assist the commander in assessing unit readiness. • Provides feedback to Army, JIM participants. • Provides a deployable capability to export observer/controllers, instru- mentation, and the AAR process to units at locations other than a CTC. • Provides a data source for lessons learned and trends to improve doctrine, training, leader development, organization, materiel, and soldier considerations. 1-39. Operational missions—whether they are combat operations, such as in Afghanistan, or stability operations, such as in Bosnia—continue training and leader development. Operational missions validate the fundamentals of leadership, planning, and training. Unit and individual proficiency is evalu- ated, and leaders are trained and developed. AARs are conducted, strengths are maintained, and weaknesses are corrected. These missions provide sig- nificant experience for our leaders, soldiers, and units. The experiences from these missions feed back to the institution to support doctrine development, and other leader, soldier, and unit training. THE SELF-DEVELOPMENT DOMAIN 1-40. Learning is a lifelong process. Institutional, organizational, and opera- tional training alone cannot provide the insight, intuition, imagination, and judgment needed in combat. The gravity of our profession requires compre- hensive self-study and training. In no other profession is the cost of being unprepared so high. Soldiers and leaders at all levels continually study our profession in preparation to fight and win our Nation's wars. This requires commanders at all levels to create an environment that encourages subordi- 1-11 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ nates to establish personal and professional development goals. Further re- finement of those interests should occur through personal mentoring by com- manders and first line leaders. Application of battle-focused officer and NCO professional development programs are essential to leader development. Ex- ploiting reach-back, distributed learning, and continuing education technolo- gies support these programs. 1-41. Self-development is continuous and should be emphasized in both in- stitutional and operational assignments. Successful self-development re- quires a team effort. Self-development starts with an assessment of individ- ual strengths, weaknesses, potential, and developmental needs. Command- ers and leaders provide feedback to enable subordinates to determine the reasons for their strengths and weaknesses. Together, they prioritize self- development goals and determine courses of action to improve performance. Self-development is— • A planned process involving the leader and the subordinate being devel- oped. It enhances previously acquired skills, knowledge, behaviors, and experience; contributes to personal development; and highlights the po- tential for progressively more complex and higher-level assignments. Self-development focuses on maximizing individual strengths, minimiz- ing weaknesses, and achieving individual development goals. • Initial self-development is very structured and generally narrow in focus. The focus broadens as individuals understand their strengths and weak- nesses, determine their individual needs, and become more experienced. Each soldier's knowledge and perspective increases with experience, in- stitutional training, and operational assignments. It is accelerated and broadened by specific, goal-oriented self-development actions. THE ROLE OF MACOMS, CORPS, DIVISIONS, USAR REGIONAL COMMANDS AND ARNG AREA COMMANDS IN TRAINING 1-42. These commands, whether oriented along operational, functional, or specialty missions, have unique responsibilities for managing and supporting training. Their most important contribution to training is to establish stabil- ity in the training environment by maintaining focus on warfighting tasks, identifying and providing resources, protecting planned training, and provid- ing feedback that produces good training and develops good trainers and leaders. 1-43. The corps’ and divisions’ fundamental basis for organization and op- erations is combined arms operations. They conduct these operations in- creasingly in JIM environments. Corps commanders’ training focus is on warfighting, to include joint operations, and training division commanders and corps separate commands and brigades. 1-44. Corps and division commanders must integrate SOF into their training plans. This provides opportunities to explore new combinations of concepts, people, organizations, and technology that expand their capabilities and en- hance interoperability and leverage other service capabilities. 1-45. Warfighting is the corps’ and division’s top priority. Corps and division commanders have a pivotal role in the Army Training Management System 1-12 __________________________________________________________________ How the Army Trains as the guidance and decisions they provide brigade and battalion command- ers directly affect the planning and execution of training at the company level. 1-46. The MACOMs, corps, and divisions ensure that competencies are trained to standard. When commanders do this they make their greatest contribution to leader development and unit readiness. RESERVE COMPONENT TRAINING 1-47. The Army consists of the active component (AC) and the Reserve Com- ponents (RC). The AC is a federal force of full-time soldiers and Department of the Army civilians. The RC consists of the ARNG, the USAR, and their ci- vilian support personnel. Each component is established under different statutes and has unique and discrete characteristics, but all share the same doctrine and training process, and train to the same standard. Availability of training support system (TSS) capabilities, however, varies between compo- nents. All train to the same standard; however, the RC trains at lower eche- lons. The number of tasks trained will usually differ as a result of the train- ing time available; the conditions may vary based on the RC unique envi- ronment. 1-48. The RC represent a large portion of the Army’s deterrence and war- fighting power. They are an integral part of the force. However, available training time has a significant impact on RC training. RC units have a lim- ited number of available training days. Geographic dispersion of units also impacts RC training. An average reserve battalion is spread over a 150- to 300-mile radius. Additionally, most reserve units travel an average of 150 miles to the nearest training area. Individual soldiers often travel an aver- age of 40 miles to their training sites. 1-49. RC units recruit many of their own soldiers. Since these new recruits may be assigned to the RC unit prior to completion of IMT, the RC may have fewer military occupational specialty (MOS) qualified personnel assigned than their AC counterparts. Additionally, even though doctrine requires trained leaders to train units and soldiers, RC leaders may be unable to at- tend professional military education until after assigned to their units. Pri- ority of training for RC units will go to individual duty military occupational specialty qualification (DMOSQ) and professional development to produce qualified soldiers and leaders. 1-50. RC units have premobilization readiness and postmobilization training requirements. Premobilization readiness plans must be developed and ap- proved for the current fiscal and training year. Similarly, postmobilization plans must be developed and approved for units with deployment missions. For example, the RC focuses premobilization training for infantry, armor and cavalry units on platoon and lower level maneuver and collective tasks and drills. Postmobilization training focuses on platoon gunnery, company team, and higher-level collective tasks. IMT and professional military education requirements for individual reserve officers and soldiers approximate that of the active Army with training provided by the institution. In sum, RC units focus on fewer tasks done to standard during premobilization training. 1-13 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ SUMMARY 1-51. Army training has one purpose—to produce competent, confident, adaptive soldiers, leaders and units, trained and ready to fight and win our Nation's battles. The Army training and leader development model inte- grates institutional, operational, and individual self-development into a training management system. The commander is responsible for unit train- ing and integrates the institutional, operational, as well as individual self- development resources to train combat ready units. Commanders are re- sponsible for the wartime readiness of every aspect of their unit, while NCOs train individual soldiers, crews, and teams. All training focuses on the METL and all factors involved in training lead to unit readiness. Training is the Army’s number one priority. Training is WHAT we do, not SOMETHING we do. 1-14 ________________________________________________________________ Battle Focused Training 2-8. The fundamental basis for the organization and operation of Army forces is combined arms. Combined arms is the integrated application of several arms to achieve an effect on the enemy that is greater than if each arm was used against the enemy separately or in sequence. Integration involves ar- rangement of battlefield actions in time, space, and purpose to produce maxi- mum relative effects of combat power at a decisive place and time. Through force tailored organizations, commanders and their staffs integrate and syn- chronize the battlefield operating systems (BOS) to achieve combined arms effects and accomplish the mission. 2-9. Today's Army doctrine requires teamwork at all echelons. Well-trained Army combined arms teams can readily perform in JIM environments. When committed to battle, each unit must be prepared to execute operations with- out additional training or lengthy adjustment periods. Leaders must regu- larly practice of habitually associated combat arms, combat support, and combat service support capabilities. Teams can only achieve combined arms proficiency and cohesiveness when they train together. Similarly, peacetime relationships must mirror wartime task organization to the greatest extent possible. 2-10. Commanders are responsible for training all warfighting systems. The full integration of the combined arms team is attained through the task or- ganization approach to training management. Task organizing is a tempo- rary grouping of forces designed to accomplish a particular mission. This ap- proach acknowledges that the maneuver commander integrates and synchro- nizes the BOS. In short, the maneuver commander, assisted by higher eche- lon leaders, forges the combined arms team. An example of a task-organized brigade and its warfighting systems is depicted at figure 2-2. 2-3 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ Figure 2-2. Brigade Combat Team 2-11. The commander of the task-organized force must develop a training plan that addresses two complementary challenges. The commander's train- ing plan must achieve combined arms proficiency and ensure functional training proficiency of the combat arms, combat support, and combat service support units of the task force. Combined arms proficiency requires effective integration of BOS functions. Effective integration of BOS results in syn- chronization. Functional BOS proficiency is fundamental for effective BOS integration. The commander's training plan must integrate combined arms and functional training events. 2-12. Combined arms training is standards based. The independent training of functional tasks and combined arms tasks to standard will not guarantee the desired effects of applying combat power at a decisive place and time. The standard for effective combined arms training requires a sequenced and continuous execution of functional tasks and combined arms tasks to stan- dard in order to achieve “…integrated relative combat power at a decisive place and time.” 2-13. The role of commanders and NCOs in combined arms training cannot be overemphasized. Commanders have training responsibilities that encom- pass both BOS functional task proficiency and special staff officer combined 2-4 ________________________________________________________________ Battle Focused Training arms task proficiency. Likewise, NCOs have similar training responsibilities to ensure BOS related individual and crew functional task proficiency, as well as, individual and staff section related combined arms task proficiency. Combined arms training requires commanders’ and NCOs’ active involve- ment in all phases of training. 2-14. Functional proficiency requires expertise in a particular BOS function, its capabilities, and its requirements. Organizations that provide elements of a specific BOS function, such as corps support command and divisional air defense artillery battalion, must train to maintain their functional profi- ciency. Integration involves expertise in coordination among functional troop unit commanders and staffs, and other functional commanders and staffs. 2-15. The combined arms training challenge is the same for all echelons of command. The complexity, however, increases at each higher echelon of command. The tempo, scope, and scale of operations at higher command echelons increase coordination requirements for planning and executing staff, joint, multinational, and interagency training. Commanders, at every echelon, focus combined arms training on specific integration and synchroni- zation tasks based on their METL. Figure 2-3 illustrates the scope and scale of the combined arms training challenge. Figure 2-3. Combined Arms Training—Scope and Scale 2-5 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ TRAIN FOR COMBAT PROFICIENCY 2-16. The goal of all training is to achieve the standard. This develops and sustains combat capable warfighting organizations. To achieve this, units must train to standard under realistic conditions. Achieving standards re- quires hard work by commanders, staff officers, unit leaders, and soldiers. Within the confines of safety and common sense, commanders and leaders must be willing to accept less than perfect results initially and demand real- ism in training. They must integrate such realistic conditions as imperfect intelligence; reduced communications; smoke; noise; rules of engagement; simulated nuclear, biological, and chemical environments; battlefield debris; loss of key leaders; civilians on the battlefield; JIM requirements; and varying extremes in weather. They must seize every opportunity to move soldiers out of the classroom into the field; fire weapons; maneuver as a combined arms team; and incorporate protective measures against enemy actions. Although CTCs provide the most realistic and challenging training experience in the Army, they must not be viewed as an "end point" in the unit-training life cycle. Rather, they provide a "go to war experience" by which commanders can assess their METL proficiency and determine the effectiveness of their training program. • Realistic. Tough, realistic, and intellectually and physically challenging training excites and motivates soldiers and leaders. Realistic training builds competence and confidence by developing and honing skills, and inspires excellence by fostering initiative, enthusiasm, and eagerness to learn. Successful completion of each training phase increases the capa- bility and motivation of individuals and units for more sophisticated and challenging achievement. This is the commanders' continuous quest. • Performance-Oriented. Units become proficient in the performance of critical tasks and missions by practicing the tasks and missions. Soldiers learn best by doing, using an experiential, hands-on approach. Com- manders and subordinate leaders plan training that will provide these opportunities. All training assets and resources, to include training aids, devices, simulators, and simulations (TADSS), must be included in the unit's training strategy. TRAIN TO STANDARD USING APPROPRIATE DOCTRINE 2-17. Training must be done to the Army standard and conform to Army doc- trine. If mission tasks involve emerging doctrine or non-standard tasks, commanders establish the tasks, conditions and standards using mission or- ders and guidance, lessons learned from similar operations, and their profes- sional judgment. The next higher commander approves the creation of the standards for these tasks. FM 3-0 provides the doctrinal foundations; sup- porting doctrinal manuals describe common TTP that permit commanders and organizations to adjust rapidly to changing situations. Doctrine provides a basis for a common vocabulary across the force. In units, new soldiers will have little time to learn non-standard procedures. Therefore, units must train to the Army standard contained in the MTP and STPs, while applying Army doctrine and current regulatory guidance. When serving as a joint headquarters and conducting joint training Army organizations use joint doc- trine and TTP. Joint doctrine establishes the fundamentals of joint opera- 2-6 ________________________________________________________________ Battle Focused Training tions and provides guidance on how best to employ joint forces. This linkage between operational and training doctrine is critical to successful training. TRAIN TO ADAPT 2-18. Commanders train and develop adaptive leaders and units, and pre- pare their subordinates to operate in positions of increased responsibility. Repetitive, standards-based training provides relevant experience. Com- manders intensify training experiences by varying training conditions. Training experiences coupled with timely feedback builds competence. Lead- ers build unit, staff and soldier confidence when they consistently demon- strate competence. Competence, confidence, and discipline promote initiative and enable leaders to adapt to changing situations and conditions. They im- provise with the resources at hand, exploit opportunities and accomplish their assigned mission in the absence of orders. Commanders at every eche- lon integrate training events in their training plans to develop and train imaginative, adaptive leaders and units. TRAIN TO MAINTAIN AND SUSTAIN 2-19. Soldier and equipment maintenance is a vital part of every training program. Soldiers and leaders are responsible for maintaining all assigned equipment and supplies in a high state of readiness to support training or operational missions. Units must be capable of fighting for sustained periods of time with the equipment they are issued. Soldiers must become experts in both the operation and maintenance of their equipment. This link between training and sustainment is vital to mission success. TRAIN USING MULTIECHELON TECHNIQUES 2-20. Multiechelon training is the most effective and efficient way of sustain- ing proficiency on mission essential tasks with limited time and resources. Commanders use multiechelon training to— • Train leaders, battle staffs, units, and individuals at each echelon of the organization simultaneously. • Maximize use of allocated resources and available time. • Reduce the effects of personnel turbulence. 2-21. Large-scale training events provide an excellent opportunity for valu- able individual, leader, crew, and small unit training. Multiechelon training can occur when an entire organization is training on one single METL task or when different echelons of an organization conduct training on related METL tasks simultaneously. (See chapter 4 for detailed discussion on multiechelon training.) All multiechelon training techniques— • Require detailed planning and coordination by commanders and leaders at each echelon. • Maintain battle focus by linking individual and collective battle tasks with unit METL tasks, within large-scale training event METL tasks. • Habitually train at least two echelons simultaneously on selected METL tasks. 2-7 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ TRAIN TO SUSTAIN PROFICIENCY 2-22. Once individuals and units have trained to a required level of profi- ciency, leaders must structure individual and collective training plans to re- train critical tasks at the minimum frequency necessary to sustain profi- ciency. Sustainment training is the key to maintaining unit proficiency through personnel turbulence and operational deployments. MTP and indi- vidual training plans are tools to help achieve and sustain collective and in- dividual proficiency. Sustainment training must occur often enough to train new soldiers and minimize skill decay. Army units train to accomplish their missions by frequent sustainment training on critical tasks. Infrequent "peaking" of training for an event (CTC rotation, for example) does not sus- tain wartime proficiency. Battle focused training is training on wartime tasks. Many of the METL tasks that a unit trains on for its wartime mission are the same as required for a stability operation or support operation that they might execute. 2-23. Sustainment training enables units to operate in a Band of Excellence (figure 2-4) through appropriate repetition of critical tasks. The Band of Ex- cellence is the range of proficiency within which a unit is capable of executing its wartime METL tasks. For RC units the Band of Excellence is the range of proficiency within which a unit is capable of executing its premobilization tasks. Training to sustain proficiency in the Band of Excellence includes training leaders, battle staffs, and small lethal units. The solid black line shows the results of an effective unit training strategy that sustains training proficiency over time, maintaining it within the Band of Excellence. The dot- ted black line shows an ineffective training strategy that often causes the unit to fall outside the Band of Excellence, thus requiring significant addi- tional training before the unit is capable of executing its wartime METL tasks. Personnel turbulence and availability of resources pose a continuous challenge to maintaining METL proficiency within the Band of Excellence. 2-8 ________________________________________________________________ Battle Focused Training Figure 2-4. Band of Excellence 2-24. The Army provides combat ready forces on short notice to combatant commanders. Units transition from training locations to operational theaters using the train-alert-deploy sequence. Commanders recognize that crises rarely allow sufficient time to correct training deficiencies between alert and deployment. They strive to ensure their units are prepared to accomplish their METL tasks before alert and refine mission specific training in the time available afterwards. Accordingly, applying the principles of training, a commander conducts training to sustain proficiency on METL tasks within the Band of Excellence to ensure mission readiness. Mission specific training can be conducted as organizations are alerted and deployed based on time available. 2-25. RC units require postmobilization training to achieve proficiency at level organized. Postmobilization training time can be minimized by focusing on MOS qualification, and crew, squad, section and platoon proficiency for combat arms, and company, battery, and troop proficiency for CS/CSS units during premobilization training. TRAIN AND DEVELOP LEADERS 2-26. Commanders have a duty and execute a vital role in leader training and leader development. They teach subordinates how to fight and how to train. They mentor, guide, listen to, and “think with” subordinates. They train leaders to plan training in detail, prepare for training thoroughly, exe- cute training aggressively, and evaluate short-term training proficiency in terms of desired long-term results. Training and developing leaders is an 2-9 ________________________________________________________________ Battle Focused Training REQUIRE SUBORDINATES TO UNDERSTAND AND PERFORM THEIR ROLES IN TRAINING 2-30. Since good training results from leader involvement, one of the com- mander's principal roles in training is to teach subordinate trainers how to train and how to fight. The commander provides the continuing leadership that focuses on the organization's wartime mission. The commander assigns officers the primary responsibility for collective training and NCOs the pri- mary responsibility for individual, crew, and small team training. The com- mander, as the primary trainer, uses multiechelon techniques to meld leader, battle staff, and individual training requirements into collective training events, while recognizing the overlap in training responsibilities (figure 2-5). Commanders teach, coach, and mentor subordinates throughout. Figure 2-5. Overlapping Training Responsibilities TRAIN ALL ELEMENTS TO BE PROFICIENT ON THEIR MISSION ESSENTIAL TASKS 2-31. Commanders must integrate and train to Army standard all BOS, within and supporting their command, on their selected mission essential tasks. An important requirement for all leaders is to project training plans 2-11 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ far enough into the future and to coordinate resources with sufficient lead time. DEVELOP SUBORDINATES 2-32. Competent and confident leaders build cohesive organizations with a strong chain of command, high morale, and good discipline. Therefore, com- manders create leader development programs that develop warfighter pro- fessionalism—skills and knowledge. They develop their subordinates' confi- dence and empower them to make independent, situational-based decisions on the battlefield. Commanders assist subordinates with a self-development program and share experienced insights that encourage subordinates to study and learn their profession. They train leaders to plan training in de- tail, prepare for training thoroughly, execute aggressively, and evaluate short-term training proficiency in terms of desired long-term results. Effec- tive leader development programs will continuously influence the Army as junior leaders progress to higher levels of responsibility. INVOLVE THEMSELVES PERSONALLY IN PLANNING, PREPARING, EXECUTING, AND ASSESSING TRAINING 2-33. The senior commander resources training and protects subordinate commanders' training time. They are actively involved in planning for future training. They create a sense of stability throughout the organization by pro- tecting approved training plans from training distracters. Senior command- ers protect the time of subordinate commanders allowing them to be present at training as much as possible. Subordinate commanders are responsible for executing the approved training to standard. Senior commanders are pre- sent during the conduct of training as much as possible and provide experi- enced feedback to all participants. DEMAND TRAINING STANDARDS ARE ACHIEVED 2-34. Leaders anticipate that some tasks will not be performed to standard. Therefore, they design time into training events to allow additional training on tasks not performed to standard. It is more important to train to standard on a limited number of critical tasks, rather than attempting and failing to achieve the standard on too many tasks, rationalizing that corrective action will occur during some later training period. Soldiers will remember the en- forced standard, not the one that was discussed. ENSURE PROPER TASK AND EVENT DISCIPLINE 2-35. Senior leaders ensure junior leaders plan the correct task-to-time ratio. Too many tasks guarantee nothing will get trained to standard and no time is allocated for retraining. Too many events result in improper preparation and recovery. FOSTER A COMMAND CLIMATE THAT IS CONDUCIVE TO GOOD TRAINING 2-36. Commanders create a climate that rewards subordinates who are bold and innovative trainers. They challenge the organization and each individ- 2-12 ________________________________________________________________ Battle Focused Training ual to train to full potential. Patience and coaching are essential ingredients to ultimate achievement of the Army standard. ELIMINATE TRAINING DISTRACTIONS 2-37. The commander who has planned and resourced a training event is re- sponsible to ensure participation by the maximum number of soldiers. Ad- ministrative support burdens cannot be ignored, however, they can be man- aged using an effective time management system. Senior commanders must support subordinate commanders' efforts to train effectively by eliminating training distracters and reinforcing the requirement for all assigned person- nel to be present during training. TOP-DOWN/BOTTOM-UP APPROACH TO TRAINING 2-38. The top-down/bottom-up approach to training is a team effort in which senior leaders provide training focus, direction and resources, and junior leaders provide feedback on unit training proficiency, identify specific unit training needs, and execute training to standard in accordance with the ap- proved plan. It is a team effort that maintains training focus, establishes training priorities, and enables effective communication between command echelons. 2-39. Guidance, based on wartime mission and priorities, flows from the top- down and results in subordinate units’ identification of specific collective and individual tasks that support the higher unit’s mission. Input from the bot- tom up is essential because it identifies training needs to achieve task profi- ciency on identified collective and individual tasks. Leaders at all echelons communicate with each other about requirements, and planning, preparing, executing, and evaluating training. 2-40. Senior leaders centralize planning to provide a consistent training fo- cus from the top to the bottom of the organization. However, they decentral- ize execution to ensure that the conduct of mission related training sustains strengths and overcomes the weaknesses unique to each unit. Decentralized execution promotes subordinate leaders’ initiative to train their units, but does not mean senior leaders give up their responsibilities to supervise train- ing, develop leaders, and provide feedback. BATTLE FOCUS 2-41. Battle focus is a concept used to derive peacetime training require- ments from assigned and anticipated missions. The priority of training in units is to train to standard on the wartime mission. Battle focus guides the planning, preparation, execution, and assessment of each organization's training program to ensure its members train as they are going to fight. Bat- tle focus is critical throughout the entire training process and is used by commanders to allocate resources for training based on wartime and opera- tional mission requirements. Battle focus enables commanders and staffs at all echelons to structure a training program that copes with non-mission re- lated requirements while focusing on mission essential training activities. It is recognition that a unit cannot attain proficiency to standard on every task 2-13 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ whether due to time or other resource constraints. However, commanders can achieve a successful training program by consciously focusing on a re- duced number of critical tasks that are essential to mission accomplishment. 2-42. A critical aspect of the battle focus concept is to understand the re- sponsibility for, and the linkage between, the collective mission essential tasks and the individual tasks that support them. The diagram at figure 2-6 depicts the relationships and the proper sequence to derive optimum training benefit from each training opportunity. Figure 2-6. Integration of Collective and Individual Training 2-43. The commander and the CSM or 1SG must jointly coordinate the col- lective mission essential tasks and individual training tasks on which the unit will concentrate its efforts during a given period. The CSM or 1SG must select the specific individual tasks that support each collective task to be trained. Although NCOs have the primary role in training and sustaining in- dividual soldier skills, officers at every echelon remain responsible for train- ing to established standards during both individual and collective training. Battle focus is applied to all missions across the full spectrum of operations. ARMY TRAINING MANAGEMENT CYCLE 2-44. The foundation of the training process is the Army Training Manage- ment Cycle (figure 2-7). In the METL development process (chapter 3), train- ing must be related to the organization's wartime operational plans and focus 2-14 ________________________________________________________________ Battle Focused Training on METL tasks. The availability of resources does not affect METL devel- opment. The METL is an unconstrained statement of the tasks required to accomplish wartime missions. Resources for training, however, are con- strained and compete with other missions and requirements. Leaders develop the long-range, short-range, and near-term training plans (chapter 4) to util- ize effectively available resources to train for proficiency on METL tasks. Af- ter training plans are developed, units execute training by preparing, con- ducting, and recovering from training (chapter 5). The process continues with training evaluations that provide bottom-up input to organizational as- sessment. Organizational assessments provide necessary feedback to the sen- ior commander that assist in preparing the training assessment (chapter 6). Figure 2-7. Army Training Management Cycle 2-15 Chapter 3 Mission Essential Task List Development Army Mission Essential Tasks Shape the security environment Respond promptly to crisis Mobilize the Army Conduct forcible entry operations Dominate land operations Provide support to civil authorities FM 1, The Army and FM 3-0, Operations 3-1 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ METL 3-1. A mission essential task is a collective task in which an organization has to be proficient to accomplish an appropriate portion of its wartime opera- tional mission. Army organizations, whether they are AC or RC, Modifica- tion Table of Organization and Equipment (MTOE) or Table of Distribution and Allowances (TDA), cannot achieve and sustain proficiency on every pos- sible training task. The commander must identify those tasks that are es- sential to accomplishing the organization's wartime operational mission. Battle-focused METL identifies those tasks that are essential to the accom- plishment of the unit’s wartime operational mission and provides the founda- tion for the unit’s training program. 3-2. All company level and above units develop a METL that is approved by its designated wartime commander. Detachments, organized with a com- mander and under a distinct MTOE or TDA, also develop a METL. Explosive ordnance detachments, transportation port operation cargo detachments and preventive medicine medical detachments are examples of these type units. METL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 3-3. The METL development process reduces the number of tasks the organi- zation must train and focuses the organization's training efforts on the most important collective training tasks required to accomplish the mission. 3-4. METL development is the catalyst 3-2 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ Directed Missions 3-10. Army organizations are frequently directed to conduct a mission other than its assigned wartime operational mission. These missions range from major combat operations to providing humanitarian assistance or other types of stability and support operations. External Guidance 3-11. External guidance serves as an additional source of training tasks that relate to an organization's wartime operational mission. Some examples are— • Higher headquarters directives. • MTP. • Force integration plans. • Army Universal Task List (AUTL). • Universal Joint Task List (UJTL). 3-12. In some cases, external guidance identifies tasks that make up the mission (for example, MTPs). In others, they specify additional tasks that re- late to the mission (for example, mobilization plans, directed stability opera- tions or support operations). Figure 3-2 is an example of brigade tasks de- rived from the five primary inputs to the unit’s METL. Alert and Deploy the Brigade • Draw and Upload Basic/Operational Loads • Move by Road or Rail to Aerial Port of • Conduct Soldier Readiness/Administrative / Embarkation (APOE) or Seaport of Logistic Preparation for Overseas Movement Embarkation (SPOE) • Deploy Advance Parties Or Liaison Officers • Upload Equipment at APOE or SPOE Conduct Attack Conduct Defense • Attack a Moving Enemy • Conduct a Mobile Defense • Attack a Stationary Enemy • Conduct an Area Defense • Movement to Contact Conduct Support Operations Conduct Stability Operations • Domestic Support Operations • Peacekeeping Operations • Foreign Humanitarian Assistance • Combat Terrorism • Support Counter-Drug Operations Conduct Sustainment Operations • Provide Medical Treatment and Evacuation • Recover and Evacuate Disabled Equipment (air and ground) • Control Reconstitution of Subordinate Units • Move by Air/Surface Transportation • Conduct Mortuary Affairs Operations • Manage Terrain Figure 3-2. Example of Brigade Tasks Derived from Wartime Operational Plans and External Guidance 3-13. In similar type organizations, METL may vary significantly because of different missions or geographical locations. For example, a power projection organization may identify strategic deployment requirements as critical de- ployment tasks while a forward-deployed organization may identify tactical deployment requirements (such as rapid assembly and tactical road marches) 3-4 ___________________________________________________ Mission Essential Task List Development as critical deployment tasks. Geography may also influence the selection of different mission essential tasks for units with missions in tropical, cold, or desert environments. COMMANDER’S ANALYSIS 3-14. The commander’s analysis of wartime operational plans, and others primary input to the METL, identify those tasks critical for wartime mission accomplishment. Higher commanders provide guidance to help their subor- dinate commanders focus this analysis. Commanders coordinate the results of their analysis with subordinate and adjacent commanders. The higher commander approves the METL. This process provides the means to coordi- nate, link, and integrate a wartime operational mission focused METL throughout the organization. 3-15. To illustrate the METL development process, the following brigade wartime mission statement forms the start point for determining the most important training tasks: At C-day, H-hour, Brigade deploys: On order, conducts combat operations as- signed by higher headquarters. 3-16. The commander reviews the wartime operational mission statement and other primary input to the METL, and identifies all of the training tasks. Together, these five sources provide the total list of possible training tasks. This analysis results in the list at figure 3-2. The commander then narrows down the list of all derived tasks to those tasks critical for mission accom- plishment. These tasks become the brigade’s METL. Figure 3-3 shows an example of a brigade METL. Alert and Deploy the Brigade Conduct Attack Movement to Contact Conduct Area Defense Conduct Sustainment Operations Command and Control Tactical Operations Figure 3-3. Example of Brigade METL RESERVE COMPONENT METL DEVELOPMENT 3-17. The METL development process is the same for AC and RC organiza- tions. RC METL development recognizes that RC units have less than 20 percent of the training time available to their AC counterparts. Therefore, battle focus is essential so that RC commanders can concentrate their time on the most critical wartime training requirements. RC units often operate under a chain of command different from their wartime chain of command. The associate AC chain of command assigns missions, provides wartime mis- sion guidance, and approves METLs. The state adjutant general or regional 3-5 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ support groups review and coordinate RC METLs. They resource training and ensure that mission training tasks are executed and evaluated. Conti- nental U.S. Armies (CONUSAs) approve the METL for selected RC units (ARNG divisions, enhanced separate brigades, roundout units, reinforcing aviation units, and force support package units with latest arrival dates less than D+30). The peacetime chain of command approves the remainder of RC unit METLs. ECHELON ABOVE DIVISION/ECHELON ABOVE CORPS (EAD/EAC) METL DEVELOPMENT 3-18. In a similar manner, commanders of EAD/EAC organizations must use the battle focus concept and METL development process to focus their train- ing. Figure 3-4 shows an example of a corps support battalion METL. Deploy/Relocate the Battalion Plan CSS Operations Establish and Sustain Area of Operations Provide CSS Protect the Force Figure 3-4. Example of Corps Support Battalion (EAD) METL TDA METL DEVELOPMENT 3-19. Battle focus is equally applicable to TDA organizations. Senior leaders of TDA organizations derive METL from critical peacetime or wartime mis- sions. Mission essential tasks may be either critical training tasks or opera- tional activities. In short, they represent the tasks required to accomplish the TDA organization's mission. Figure 3-5 shows an example of a garrison support unit METL. Alert, Assemble and Mobilize Command and Control General Support Unit, Mobilizing and Demobilizing Units Augment BASOPS Support Provide Mobilization and Demobilization Processing Support Conduct Force Protection Operations Figure 3-5. Example of Garrison Support Unit (TDA) METL 3-6 ___________________________________________________ Mission Essential Task List Development METL DEVELOPMENT FOR DIRECTED MISSIONS 3-20. When an organization is directed to conduct a mission other than its assigned wartime operational mission (such as a stability operation or sup- port operation), the training management cycle still applies. Directed mis- sions can span the full spectrum of operations. For MTOE organizations, di- rected missions could range from major combat operations to providing hu- manitarian assistance or other types of stability operations and support op- erations. For TDA organizations, directed missions can range from mobiliza- tion to installation force protection operations. 3-21. Using their wartime METL as the foundation, commanders who are di- rected to change their mission conduct a mission analysis, identify METL tasks, and assess training proficiency for the directed mission. The mission analysis of the newly assigned mission could change the unit's METL, train- ing focus, and the strategy to achieve proficiency for METL tasks. Figure 3-6 shows an example of tasks supporting a directed mission involving a stability operation. Collective Training • Convoy Operations • Area Security • Route Security • Patrolling Operations • Rail/Air Movement Training • Establish/Operate Checkpoints Leader Training • Fire Control Exercise (FCX) • Rules Of Engagement (ROE) Proficiency • Casualty Evacuation (CAS EVAC) • Petroleum, Oils and Lubricants/Military • Deployment Exercise (POL/MIL) Seminar • Risk Management • Media Interaction Individual Training • Mine Awareness • Medical Awareness • ROE Proficiency • Country Orientation • Media Interaction • Force Protection Figure 3-6. Examples of METL Tasks to Support a Directed Mission to Conduct Stability Operation 3-22. In cases where mission tasks involve emerging doctrine or non- standard tasks, commanders establish tasks, conditions, and standards using mission orders and guidance, lessons learned from similar operations, and their professional judgment. Senior commanders approve the established standards for these tasks as part of the normal METL approval process. If time permits prior to deployment, units should execute a mission rehearsal exercise (MRE) with all participating units. 3-23. Upon redeployment from a directed mission, commanders conduct a mission analysis consistent with the training management cycle to reestab- lish proficiency in the unit's wartime operational METL. Senior commanders must take into account the additional time this reintegration process may take. Battle focus guides the planning, preparation, execution, and assess- ment of each organization's training program to ensure its members train as they will fight. 3-7 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ JOINT METL (JMETL) DEVELOPMENT 3-24. Army organizations often provide Army forces within joint force forma- tions. The missions and JMETL of such formations are derived from the Uni- versal Joint Task List by the joint force commander and service component commanders, and are approved by the combatant commander. 3-25. A selected Army headquarters may be designated as a JTF headquar- ters, joint forces land component headquarters (JFLC) or Army Forces (ARFOR) headquarters. This requires the designated Army headquarters to develop a JMETL. The Army headquarters commander crosswalks the JMETL with the current Army headquarters and subordinate unit METLs. Joint training manuals provide an overview of the joint training system (JTS), and assists in— • Developing joint training requirements. • Planning joint training. • Executing joint training. • Assessing joint proficiency. METL DEVELOPMENT FUNDAMENTALS 3-26. The following fundamentals apply to METL development— • The METL is derived from the organization's wartime plans and related tasks in external guidance. • Mission essential tasks must apply to the entire organization. METL does not include tasks assigned solely to subordinate organizations. • Each organization's METL must support and complement the METL of higher headquarters. • The availability of resources does not affect METL development. The METL is an unconstrained statement of the tasks required to accomplish wartime missions. • Commanders direct operations and integrate the BOS through plans and orders. The BOS are used to systematically ensure that interdependent organizational tasks necessary to generate, sustain, and apply combat power are directed toward accomplishing the overall mission. The BOS are the physical means (soldiers, organizations, and equipment) used to accomplish the mission. The BOS are— Intelligence. The intelligence system plans, directs, collects, proc- esses, produces, and disseminates intelligence on the threat and the environment; performs intelligence preparation of the battlefield; and other intelligence tasks. Intelligence is developed as part of a con- tinuous process and is fundamental to Army operations. Maneuver. Commanders maneuver forces to create the conditions for tactical and operational success. Maneuver involves movement to achieve positions of advantage with respect to enemy forces. Through maneuver, friendly forces gain the ability to destroy enemy forces or hinder enemy movement by direct and indirect application of fire- power or threat of its application. 3-8 ___________________________________________________ Mission Essential Task List Development Fire Support. Fire support consists of fires that directly support land, maritime, amphibious, and special operations forces in engag- ing enemy forces, combat formations, and facilities in pursuit of tacti- cal and operational objectives. Fire support integrates and synchro- nizes fires and effects to delay, disrupt, or destroy enemy forces, sys- tems, and facilities. The fire support system includes the collective and coordinated use of target acquisition data, indirect fire weapons, fixed-winged aircraft, electronic warfare, and other lethal and non- lethal means to attack targets. Air Defense. Air defense protects the force from air and missile at- tack and aerial surveillance. It prevents enemies from interdicting friendly forces while freeing commanders to synchronize maneuver and fire power. The weapons of mass destruction and proliferation of missile technology increase the importance of the air defense sys- tems. Mobility/Counter-mobility/Survivability. Mobility operations preserve the freedom of maneuver for friendly forces. Mobility mis- sions include breaching obstacles, increasing battlefield circulation, improving or building roads, providing bridge and raft support, and identifying routes around contaminated areas. Counter-mobility de- nies mobility to enemy forces. Survivability operations protect friendly forces from the effects of enemy weapon systems and from natural occurrences. Nuclear, biological, and chemical defense meas- ures are essential survivability tasks. Combat Service Support. Combat service support (CSS) provides the physical means with which forces operate, from the production base and replacement centers in the continental United States to sol- diers engaged in close combat. CSS includes many technical special- ties and functional activities. It includes maximizing the use of host nation infrastructure and contracted support. Command and Control. Command and control (C2) has two com- ponents—the commander and the C2 system. The C2 system sup- ports the commander's ability to make informed decisions, delegate authority, and synchronize the BOS. Moreover, the C2 system sup- ports the commander's ability to adjust plans for future operations, even while focusing on current operations. Reliable communications are central to C2 systems. Staffs work within the commander's in- tent to direct units and control resource allocations. Through C2, commanders initiate and integrate all BOS toward a common goal— mission accomplishment. 3-27. Staff elements at each headquarters develop a METL to address mis- sion essential tasks in their areas of responsibility. Figure 3-7 shows a sam- ple Brigade Staff METL. In addition to staff METLs, organizations may de- velop a METL for each separate command post (for example tactical, main, and rear). The organization's commander or chief of staff approves the staff METL. 3-9 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ Element/Section Staff Mission Essential Task S1 Provide Personnel Services Support S2 Conduct Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield Develop a Reconnaissance and Surveillance (R&S) Plan S3 Plan Operations using Military Decision Making Process (MDMP) Prepare OPLAN/OPORD Develop Task Organization Annex and Operations Overlay S4 Develop Logistics Estimate S5 Coordinate Host Nation Support S6 Establish Information Network DECOORD Coordinate Fire Support ENGR Conduct M/CM/S Operations ADA LNO Conduct ADA Planning and Coordination AVN LNO Conduct Army Aviation Planning and Coordination USAF ALO Conduct A2C2 Management and Control Activities Figure 3-7. Example of Brigade Staff METL 3-28. Organizations that conduct daily support functions also prepare a METL. The METL for these support organizations must address the differ- ences between peacetime and wartime operating conditions. For example, a CSS unit may operate during peacetime from a permanent facility with some major supplies provided via contract transportation and automation systems operated using commercial telephone systems. A wartime environment, how- ever, may require support missions to be accomplished under austere condi- tions on an active battlefield. 3-29. The METL for units habitually task organized must be coordinated during the development process. This requirement reinforces the training fundamental that combined arms teams will train as they fight. A key com- ponent of the senior commander's METL approval process is determining if each subordinate organization has properly coordinated its METL. A support organization’s METL must identify these wartime requirements and include them in their training plans. METL LINKED TRAINING STRATEGY 3-30. The METL provides the foundation for the organization's training plans. The METL is stabilized once approved. The commander is responsi- ble for developing a training strategy that will maintain unit proficiency for all tasks designated as mission essential. 3-31. Commanders involve subordinate commanders and their CSM/1SG in METL development to create a team approach to battle focused training. Subordinate participation develops a common understanding of the organiza- tion's critical wartime requirements so METLs throughout the organization are mutually supporting. Subordinate commanders can subsequently apply insights gained during preparation of the next higher headquarters' METL to the development of their own METL. The CSM/1SG and key NCOs must un- 3-10 ___________________________________________________ Mission Essential Task List Development derstand the organization's collective METL so that they can integrate indi- vidual tasks into each collective mission essential task during METL based training. 3-32. After the commander designates the collective mission essential tasks required to accomplish the organization's wartime operational mission, the CSM/1SG, in conjunction with key NCOs, develop a supporting individual task list for each mission essential task. Soldier training publications and MTPs are major source documents for selecting appropriate individual tasks. 3-33. There should be no attempt to prioritize tasks within the METL. All METL tasks are equally essential to ensure mission accomplishment. How- ever, all tasks may not require equal training time or resources. The com- mander allocates training resources to ensure the organization’s METL profi- ciency remains within the Band of Excellence. 3-34. Commanders realize when allocating training time and resources that there are some non-mission related requirements that are critical to the health, welfare, individual readiness, and cohesiveness of a well trained unit. Commanders must carefully select, in conjunction with the CSM/1SG, which non-mission related requirements are critical to the unit. They emphasize the priority of METL training and find opportunities to include non-mission related requirements in the training plan. 3-35. Commanders develop effective training strategies when they crosswalk collective, leader and individual tasks to each METL task with subordinate commanders, CSMs/1SGs, and other key officer and NCO leaders. TRAINING OBJECTIVES 3-36. After mission essential tasks are selected, commanders identify sup- porting training objectives for each task. The resulting training objective consists of— • Task. A clearly defined and measurable activity accomplished by organi- zations and individuals. • Condition(s). The circumstances and environment in which a task is to be performed. • Standard. The minimum acceptable proficiency required in the perform- ance of a particular training task. 3-37. The conditions and standards for many major collective training tasks are identified in applicable MTPs. Figure 3-8 shows an example of a brigade training objective. 3-11 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ MISSION ESSENTIAL TASK: Conduct an attack. CONDITIONS: The brigade is conducting operations independently or as part of a division or Army forces (ARFOR) and has received an operation order (OPORD) or fragmentary order (FRAGO) to conduct an attack at the location and time specified. Coalition forces and noncombatants may be present in the operational environment. STANDARDS: 1. Brigade leaders gain and or maintain situational awareness (SA). Brigade commander and staff receive an order or anticipate a new mission and begin the military decision-making process (MDMP). Brigade task organizes forces within the brigade. 2. Effects coordination cell (ECC) obtains guidance from the commander; plans, coordinates, and achieves the desired effects utilizing organic and attached assets. 3. Staff plans mobility, countermobility, and survivability: nuclear, biological, and chemical support; air defense (AD) support; and CSS supporting operations. 4. Brigade commander and staff conduct risk management process. 5. Brigade commander and staff conduct backbriefs and rehearsals to ensure subordinates understand commander’s intent and concept. 6. Brigade executes the attack; masses all available combat power to destroy enemy per the commander’s intent. 7. Brigade consolidates and reorganizes, as necessary. 8.

The following are documents that will assist commanders and staffs in developing collective and individual training objectives— • MTP. • Soldiers manuals. • Soldier training publications. • DA Pam 350-38. • Deployment or mobilization plans. • AUTL. • UJTL. • Army, MACOM, and local regulations. • Local standing operating procedures (SOP). 3-12 ___________________________________________________ Mission Essential Task List Development BATTLE TASKS 3-39. After review and approval of subordinate organizations' METL, the senior commander selects battle tasks. A battle task is a staff or subordinate organization mission essential task that is so critical that its accomplishment will determine the success of the next higher organization's mission essential task. Battle tasks are selected for each METL task. Battle tasks allow the senior commander to define the training tasks that— • Integrate the BOS. • Receive the highest priority for resources such as ammunition, training areas and facilities (to include live and virtual simulators and construc- tive simulations), materiel, and funds. • Receive emphasis during evaluations directed by senior headquarters. 3-40.

Figure 3-10 depicts the relationship between wartime missions, METL, and battle tasks. This diagram illustrates how battle focus provides a com- mon direction for the entire organization and the foundation for the subse- quent development of relevant training plans. Figure 3-10. Relationships between Mission, METL, and Battle Task 3-14 Chapter 4 Planning We cannot train without planning and we cannot teach without preparation. General George C. Marshall PLANNING PROCESS 4-1. Planning is an extension of the battle focus concept that links organiza- tional METL with the subsequent preparation, execution, and evaluation of training. A relatively centralized process, planning develops mutually sup- porting METL based training at all echelons within an organization. The planning process ensures continuous coordination from long-range planning, through short-range and near-term planning, and ultimately leads to train- ing execution. The commander’s assessment provides direction and focus to the planning process. (Commander’s assessment is discussed in chapter 6.) Figure 4-1 depicts the training planning process used to develop battle fo- cused training programs. 4-1 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ Figure 4-1. Training Planning Process 4-2. The commander applies two principal inputs at the start of the planning process—the METL and the training assessment. Commanders identify tasks that support the METL. The training assessment compares the or- ganization's current level of training proficiency with the desired level of warfighting proficiency. This desired level is defined in MTPs and other doc- trinal literature. Commanders may make conscious decisions, based on their training assessment, to defer training for some tasks in which they are cur- rently well trained. 4-3. Leaders determine current training proficiency levels by analyzing all available training evaluations. However, each evaluation applies only to a portion of the total proficiency of an organization at a specific time. There- fore, commanders must use all available evaluation data to develop an as- sessment of the organization's overall capability to accomplish each mission essential task. In addition to past training evaluations, other information about future events influences the assessment. For example, the projected personnel turnover rates or the fielding of new equipment could significantly affect the commander's assessment of training proficiency status during the upcoming training period. Commanders update the training assessment at the beginning of each long-range and short-range planning cycle and after a major training event or deployment. 4-4. The commander uses the broad experience and knowledge of key subor- dinates to help determine the organization's current proficiency. Although subordinates provide their evaluation as input for consideration, only the commander can assess the unit's training proficiency. For example, a divi- sion commander may direct that the assistant division commanders, key staff members, and subordinate commanders evaluate the training proficiency of the division’s ability to execute mission essential tasks and supporting battle tasks. The division CSM and subordinate CSMs evaluate proficiency on in- dividual tasks that support collective tasks. The participants review avail- able collective and individual evaluation information, relying heavily on per- sonal observations. They then compare the organization's current task profi- ciency with the Army standard. The commander uses subordinate input in making the final determination of the organization's current proficiency on each task (figure 4-2). Commanders assess current METL task proficiency by rating each task as— 4-2 ____________________________________________________________________________ Planning • "T" (trained)—The unit is trained and has demonstrated its proficiency in accomplishing the task to wartime standards. • "P" (needs practice)—The unit needs to practice the task.

Extract from Commander’s Training Assessment 4-5. The training requirement is the training necessary to achieve and sus- tain METL task proficiency within the Band of Excellence. 4-6. The commander, assisted by staff, develops a strategy to accomplish each training requirement. This includes improving proficiency on some tasks and sustaining performance on others. Through the training strategy, the commander establishes training priorities by determining the minimum frequency each mission essential task will be performed during the upcoming planning period. The strategy also includes broad guidance that links the METL with upcoming major training events. The initial training assessment includes the commander's guidance that starts the detailed planning process. 4-3 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ 4-7. The training assessment of each separate mission essential task enables the commander to develop the commander's training vision. This is a broad concept for training the organization to achieve and sustain wartime profi- ciency. The key elements that shape a commander's training vision are a thorough understanding of training and operations doctrine, assessment of METL proficiency levels, and knowledge of potential enemy capabilities. The commander's training vision is supported by organizational goals that pro- vide a common direction for all the commander's programs and systems. 4-8. Senior commanders involve their staffs and subordinate commanders in goal development to ensure common understanding and create an organiza- tional team approach. Examples of organizational goals include— • Establish and support a command climate conducive to developing a high level of individual, leader, and collective warfighting proficiency. • Conduct force integration while continuously maintaining the short-term readiness of the organization. • Develop and integrate the standard operating procedures required to employ combined arms teams that can fight and win on the battlefield. • Recruit and retain high-quality soldiers and leaders. 4-9. Through the training planning process, the commander's guidance (training vision, goals, and priorities) is melded together with the METL and the training assessment into manageable training plans. TRAINING PLANS 4-10. Figure 4-3 compares the three types of training plans— • Long-range. • Short-range. • Near-term. 4-4 ____________________________________________________________________________ Planning Long-Range Short-Range Near-Term Disseminate METL and battle Refine and expand upon Refine and expand upon short- tasks. appropriate portions of long- range plan through conduct of Establish training objective for range plan. training meetings. each mission essential task.

Properly developed training plans will— • Maintain a consistent battle focus. Each headquarters in the organi- zation involves its subordinate headquarters in the development of train- ing plans. Based on the higher headquarters' plans, subordinate com- manders prepare plans that have a battle focus that is consistent throughout the organization. • Be coordinated with habitually task organized supporting or- ganizations. Brigade combat team and battalion task force command- ers plan for coordinated combined arms training of their wartime task organizations. Commanders of habitually task-organized units actively participate in this process and develop complementary training plans. Corps and division commanders require integrated training plans and monitor coordination efforts during the planning process. • Focus on the correct time horizon. Long-range training plans in the AC extend out at least one year. The RC long-range plans consider a minimum of two years. Short-range training plans in the AC normally focus on an upcoming quarter (three months) while RC short-range train- ing plans typically use a one-year planning horizon. Near-term planning 4-5 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ for the AC starts approximately eight weeks prior to the execution of training with the RC starting approximately four months prior. • Be concerned with future proficiency. Training plans must focus on raising or sustaining the proficiency of mission essential tasks to the Army standard. • Incorporate risk management into all training plans. The nature of the military profession is inherently dangerous. Commanders must train their units to tough standards under the most realistic conditions possible. Application of the risk management process will not detract from this training goal, but will enhance execution of highly effective, re- alistic training. Risk management is the process of identifying, assess- ing, and controlling risks arising from operational factors and making de- cisions that balance risk costs with mission training benefits. Leaders and soldiers at all echelons use risk management to conserve combat power and resources. Leaders and staffs continuously identify hazards and assess both accident and tactical risks. They then develop and coor- dinate control measures to mitigate or eliminate hazards. Risk manage- ment is a continuous process for each mission or training event. It must be integral to military decisions, tied into each training plan, and become a continuous part of preparation for training. • Establish organizational stability. Changes disrupt training and frustrate subordinate leaders and soldiers. Planning allows organiza- tions to anticipate and incorporate change in a coordinated manner. Sta- bility and predictability are the result of locking in training plans. Senior commanders are responsible to protect subordinate units from change. • Make the most efficient use of resources. The planning process allo- cates limited time and other resources for training that contributes most to achieving and sustaining wartime proficiency levels. LONG-RANGE PLANNING 4-12. Senior commanders publish their training guidance document suffi- ciently in advance to provide adequate planning time for both their wartime units and supporting peacetime organizations. Guidance at these senior command echelons is critical to the development and integration of a large number of subordinate AC and RC long-range training plans. Therefore, long lead times are the norm. The long-range planning cycles for MACOM, corps, AC and RC divisions and subordinate headquarters are at figures 4-4 and 4-5. Each headquarters follows these time lines to allow subordinates adequate time to prepare their plans. 4-6 ____________________________________________________________________________ Planning Action1 Planning Guidance Future Planning Horizon Publication Date2 MACOM publishes training guidance 18 months prior to start Up to 10 years or more and major event calendar of a 2-year period3 Corps publishes training guidance 12 months prior to start 5 to 7 years and major event calendar of a 2-year period3 Division, separate brigade, regiment, 8 months prior to FY Command training and separate group publish command start guidance at least 1 year training guidance and long-range calendar4 Calendar at least 2 years Installation and community publish 7 months prior to FY At least 1 year long-range calendar start Brigade and group publish command 6 months prior to FY Command training training guidance and long-range start guidance at least 1 year calendar Calendar at least 18 months Battalion, squadron, and separate 4 months prior to FY At least 1 year company publish long-range calendar start 1 These actions also apply to similar command level TDA organizations or activities. For example, a TRADOC school normally commanded by a major general follows the same planning cycle as a division commander. 2 Each headquarters follows this time line to allow subordinates adequate time to prepare their plans. 3 Updated annually at the discretion of the commander. 4 Division, separate brigade, regiment, and separate group commanders normally brief to and receive approval of the next higher headquarters on their long-range training plans no later than 8 months prior to FY start.

Active Component Long-Range Planning Cycle 4-7 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ Action1 4-8 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ • Green. The training focus of organizations in Green periods is multieche- lon, collective training that leads to METL proficiency. This period coin- cides with the availability of major training resources and key training facilities and devices. Organizations in Green periods conduct planned training without distraction and external taskings. • Amber. The focus of units in Amber periods is on training proficiency at the platoon, squad, and crew level. Individual self-development is maxi- mized through the use of installation education centers and through dis- tributed learning. Organizations in Amber periods are assigned support taskings beyond the capability of those units in the Red period, but com- manders strive for minimal disruption to Amber organizations' training programs. • Red. The training focus of units in Red periods is on maximizing self- development opportunities to improve leader and individual task profi- ciency. Units in Red periods execute details and other administrative re- quirements and allow the maximum number of soldiers to take leave. Block leave is a technique that permits an entire unit to take leave for a designated period of time. Commanders maintain unit integrity when executing administrative and support requirements. This exercises the chain of command and provides individual training opportunities for first-line leaders. 4-10 ____________________________________________________________________________ Planning Green Cycle • Training focus primarily on collective tasks with individual and leader tasks integrated during multiechelon training. • Maximum soldier attendance at prime time, mission essential training. • Coincides with availability of major resources and key training facilities or devices. • Administrative and support requirements that keep personnel from participating in training eliminated to the maximum extent possible. • Leaves and passes limited to the minimum essential.

Unit taskings can be used to reduce the number of permanent special duty personnel within installations and communities. • Leaves and passes maximized. When appropriate, block leave may be scheduled. • Routine medical, dental, and administrative appointments coordinated and scheduled with installation support facilities. Figure 4-6. Green-Amber-Red Time Management System 4-19. Similarly, a Green-Red time management system may be more appro- priate for some organizations. Although support requirements vary greatly from installation to installation, the time management system can be modi- fied to accommodate these particular situations. The primary purpose of the time management system is to identify and protect prime time training peri- ods for subordinate organizations. 4-20. When the Green-Red time management system is used, organizations in Green periods focus training at collective task proficiency, with leader and individual tasks integrated during multiechelon training. These organiza- tions conduct planned training without distraction and external taskings. Organizations in Red periods maximize leader and individual self- development opportunities, execute details, other administrative require- ments, and allow the maximum number of soldiers to take leave. All admin- istrative and support requirements should be accomplished with unit integ- rity. The training of an organization in Red periods is on small unit, crew 4-11 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ leader, and individual proficiency. Figure 4-7 is an example of a Green-Red time management system. 4-21. Likewise, commanders can utilize the Green-Amber-Red or Green-Red time management system for internal organizational use. For example, it may be feasible for organizations in Red periods to meet all support require- ments with only a portion of their subordinate units at any given time. In this case, the remaining subordinate units are free to train. A subordinate unit could be assigned an internal Green period. In this manner, organiza- tions can optimize small unit, crew, leader, and individual soldier unit train- ing opportunities. 4-22. RC unit commanders can also use either the Green-Amber-Red or Green-Red time management system. Using the Green-Amber-Red system: most of the AT period should be Green cycle training on collective tasks, most of the IDT periods should be Amber and focused on small unit, crew, leader and individual soldier training, with one or two IDT periods being Red for mandatory training/administrative requirements. Using the Green-Red sys- tem: AT and the preponderance of IDT periods should be Green, with only one or two IDT periods being Red for mandatory training/administrative re- quirements. In all training periods DMOSQ training for soldiers who are not school trained and qualified is the first order of business. 4-12 ____________________________________________________________________________ Planning Green Cycle • Training focus primarily on collective tasks with individual and leader tasks integrated during multiechelon training. • Maximum soldier attendance at prime time, mission essential training. • Coincides with availability of major resources and key training facilities or devices. • Administrative and support requirements that keep personnel from participating in training eliminated to the maximum extent possible. • Leaves and passes limited to the minimum essential.

Green-Red Time Management System TRAINING EVENTS Do less, do it well, meet the standard…treat every training event as though it were your last. Get to excellence in warfighting. General Eric Shinseki 4-23. Commanders link training strategies to executable training plans by designing and scheduling training events. During long-range planning, commanders and their staffs make a broad assessment of the number, type, and duration of training events required to accomplish METL training. The event itself is only a tool to achieve and sustain proficiency on the METL within the Band of Excellence. METL proficiency is the objective. In the subsequent development of short-range training plans, senior commanders fully define training events in terms of METL based training objectives, sce- narios, resources, and coordinating instructions. Through training events, senior commanders— • Develop mission-related scenarios. • Focus the entire organization on several METL tasks. • Integrate all BOS into coordinated combined arms training. 4-13 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ 4-24. Training events are the common building blocks that support an inte- grated set of METL-related training requirements. Included in long-range training plans, training events form the framework for resource allocation and provide early planning guidance to subordinate commanders and staffs. 4-25. By developing and coordinating training events, the organization is able to bring together the training areas and facilities, TSS products and ser- vices, OPFOR, observer/controllers, evaluators, and other resources that cre- ate the most realistic and battle focused training. Figure 4-8 shows typical training events. • Joint Training Exercise (JTX) • Combined Training Exercise (CTX) • Situational Training Exercise (STX) • Tactical Exercise Without Troops (TEWT) • Command Field Exercise (CFX) • Deployment Exercise (DEPEX) • Command Post Exercise (CPX) • Combined Arms Live Fire Exercise (CALFEX) • Logistic Exercise (LOGEX) • Field Training Exercise (FTX) • Live Fire Exercise (LFX) • Fire Coordination Exercise (FCX) • Map Exercise (MAPEX) • BCTP/BCBST and other Simulations • CTC Rotations (CTC) Figure 4-8. Types of Training Events 4-26. During planning, senior commanders allocate maximum training time to subordinates. Some large-scale training events, however, must be planned so senior commanders can exercise and integrate all BOS within their war- time organizations. The training value of these large-scale exercises to the entire command is increased when subordinate headquarters participate in developing multiechelon training objectives and scenarios. Subordinate com- manders use higher headquarters training guidance, their unit METL, and their unit battle tasks to develop their unit training plan. The next higher commander approves, protects, and resources that plan. 4-27. The Army has increasingly emphasized externally supported training events in which a headquarters senior to the unit being trained provides as- sistance in the form of detailed planning, additional resources, and evalua- tion. Support provided by the higher headquarters usually includes a METL derived scenario with associated training and evaluation outlines (T&EO), an OPFOR, observer/controllers, and evaluation support. The Army's CTCs are prime examples of training opportunities that provide combined arms battle focused training that is externally supported. CTCs provide training events based on each participating organization's METL and conducted under real- istic and stressful conditions. Externally supported training events can also be conducted at home station to enable units to focus exclusively on the exe- cution of training. 4-28. Organizations can only obtain the full training benefits of externally supported events through carefully planned preparatory training. Therefore, a priority during long-range planning is to develop METL based training pro- grams designed to assist leaders and units in achieving and sustaining 4-14 ____________________________________________________________________________ Planning METL task proficiency in the Band of Excellence. METL proficiency is the goal, not the completion of the event. LIVE, VIRTUAL, AND CONSTRUCTIVE (L-V-C) TRAINING 4-29. Commanders use a mix of live, virtual, and constructive (L-V-C) train- ing to achieve and sustain unit and staff proficiency on selected METL tasks and supporting unit and staff battle tasks within the Band of Excellence. The goal is to train mission essential tasks to standard and sustain a war- time readiness posture. Battalion level units attain and sustain warfighting proficiency and develop soldier fieldcraft primarily through live training. Brigades and higher units rely more on V-C training events to attain and sustain their warfighting proficiency. In general, commanders at battalion level and lower plan and execute standards based in V-C simulations to— • Prepare for live “in the dirt” training. • Rehearse selected staff and unit battle tasks and squad, team and crew drills. • Retrain on selected unit battle tasks, supporting squad, team and crew critical tasks, and leader and individual soldier tasks evaluated as either “P” (needs practice) or “U” (untrained). 4-30. Battalion commanders leverage V-C training events to accelerate jun- ior leader mastery of tasks directly related to developing tactical competence, confidence, and proficiency that support their unit’s METL or supporting critical collective tasks. Similarly, battalion and company commanders look to their CSM, 1SGs and key NCO leaders to leverage V-C training events to accelerate junior NCO and soldier mastery of individual tasks directly re- lated to developing their technical competence, confidence, and proficiency that support their small unit, crew, leader, and individual soldier tasks. 4-31. Figure 4-9 provides some of the possible options commanders can use to train soldiers, staffs, leaders, units, and themselves. The commander se- lects the tools that will result in the unit receiving the best training based on available resources. Virtual and constructive training cannot replace all live training. They can, however, supplement, enhance, and complement live training to sustain unit proficiency within the Band of Excellence. 4-15 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ Several Options: Commanders Select the Right Mix!

Virtual tactical engage- ment simulation training permits units to maneuver over much larger areas. Constructive (C)—Training that uses computer models and simulations to exercise the com- mand and staff functions of units from platoon through echelons above corps. Figure 4-9. Live, Virtual, and Constructive Training Mix 4-32. Battalion task force through division/corps/Army forces/joint forces commanders must sustain their battle staffs’ wartime proficiency. Leaders and staffs achieve and sustain proficiency primarily through repetitive exe- cution of battle staff drills to standard. Brigade and battalion/task forces may execute live, virtual, and constructive training. The use of virtual and constructive training provides excellent training opportunities for leader training. The repetitive nature of these tools makes them invaluable in training adaptive leaders. Commanders can run multiple iterations of a task, changing only the conditions, to help mature the decision-making and judgment abilities of subordinate leaders. 4-33. The intent is to train to standard. It is the commander's responsibility to be familiar with all three of these tools and to select the most applicable within allocated L-V-C resources and available training time. The com- mander, when planning training, must determine the appropriate mix that 4-16 ____________________________________________________________________________ Planning meets the unit training requirements and objectives. Units may conduct training using L-V-C training, simultaneously. TRAINING RESOURCES 4-34. The commander uses his assessment of METL and battle tasks to de- termine the resource priorities for training requirements. During both long- range and short-range planning, constrained resources may require deletion of low-priority training requirements, substitution of less costly training al- ternatives, or a request for additional resources to execute METL training not resourced, and lower priority training. To the extent possible, command- ers confirm resources before publishing training plans. Figure 4-10 lists common sources for information. • Command operating budget • Force integration documents • Fuel allocation • Ammunition authorizations • Higher headquarters training plans • Local training area directives • Flying hour program • Availability of TSS products and services, • Training land and range availability including TADSS Figure 4-10. Sources of Training Resource Information 4-35. A METL-based events approach to resource planning is used for the al- location of time, facilities, ammunition, funds, fuel products, and other re- sources. For example, a reasonably close approximation of the future petro- leum, oil, and lubricants (POL) (Class III) and repair parts (Class IX) re- source requirements (the most significant operations and maintenance costs in a tank battalion) can be calculated for a training event as shown in figure 4-11. 4-17 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ Cost Factors 4-18 ____________________________________________________________________________ Planning Number Miles Cost Factors System Cost LIN System Used Traveled Class IX Class III ($) T13305 TANK COMBAT FULL TRACKED: 44 800 218.60 5.87 7,901,340 120 MM GUN M1A2 T92242 TRUCK UTIL ARMT 1-1/4 TON 5 2000 0.43 0.06 4,900 T92310 TRUCK UTIL ARMT 1-1/4 TON 5 2000 0.43 0.06 4,900 C10990 CARRIER 120 MM MORTAR: 4 480 13.31 0.47 26,460 SELF-PROPELLED ARMORED D11538 CARRIER COMMAND POST: 5 375 15.70 0.47 30,320 LIGHT TRACKED M577 C18234 CARRIER PERSONNEL FULL TRACKED: ARMORED (RISE) 10 545 11.65 0.47 66,050 M113 T61494 TRUCK UTILITY: CARGO/TROOP CARRIER 1-1/4 21 2250 0.43 0.06 23,150 TON 4X4 W/E (HMMWV) T60081 TRUCK CARGO: 4X4 LMTV W/E 7 2000 0.77 0.12 12,460 T60149 TRUCK CARGO: 4X4 LMTV W/E 1 2000 0.77 0.12 1,780 W/W R50681 M88 RECOVERY VEHICLE 7 675 83.01 1.62 399,880 T59278 HEMMT 23 930 1.80 0.34 45,770 X40931 TRUCK CARGO: DROP SIDE 5 7 2000 0.66 0.15 11,340 TON 6X6 W/WINCH W/E $8,528,350 • Calculations derived using FY01 U.S. Army Cost and Economic Analysis Center (USACEAC) cost factors. • Calculation example: Pieces of Equipment (44) X Miles Traveled (800) X Class IX Cost Factors (218.60) = Class IX Annual Costs • Pieces of Equipment (44) X Miles Traveled (800) X Class III Cost Factors (5.87) = Class III Annual Costs • Class IX Annual Costs ($7,694,720.00) + Class III Annual Costs ($206,624.00) = Total System Annual Costs ($7,901,344.00) Figure 4-12. Example Annual Training Costs for an Active Component Tank Battalion 4-37. There is a relationship between the number of miles or hours that an item of equipment, such as a tank, is operated and the dollars required to purchase the repair parts and POL for that piece of equipment. Funding au- thority to purchase the projected repair parts, fuel products, and other items necessary to support the training mission is allocated to units based on oper- ating tempo (OPTEMPO). The OPTEMPO of an organization is the average annual miles or hours of operation for its major equipment systems. The to- tal annual training cost of the desired list of training events, as shown in the example at figure 4-12, which represents an OPTEMPO of 800 miles per tank, is then compared with budget projections to determine if the desired training can be fully resourced. If the battalion is not projected to receive 4-19 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ sufficient resources to finance the projected list of events, the commander may have to revise the list of events, as illustrated in figure 4-13.

Figure 4-13. Revised List of Training Events to Meet Fiscal Constraints 4-38. The Army relies on live FTXs to provide realistic training. Live fire exercises (LFX), STXs, deployment exercises, and battle drills must be con- ducted under conditions that replicate actual combat as nearly as possible. This is especially true at battalion level and below. Virtual and constructive training cannot replace live training. They can, however, supplement, en- hance, and complement live training to sustain unit proficiency within the Band of Excellence. Based on resources available (such as time, ammunition, simulations, and range availability), commanders determine the right mix and frequency of live, virtual, and constructive training to ensure efficient use of allocated training resources. Brigade size and larger organizations normally plan and execute more virtual and constructive training, as shown in figure 4-14. 4-20 ____________________________________________________________________________ Planning Figure 4-14. Application of Live-Virtual-Constructive Training 4-39. Live, virtual, and constructive training opportunities are integral com- ponents of a commander's training strategy to develop competent, confident, and adaptive leaders, battle staffs, and units. A resource analysis allows leaders at all echelons to make training trade-offs, within various budget and program levels, that best support the commander's training strategy. 4-40. The unit may be required to conduct fewer FTXs and LFXs (which re- quire higher densities of equipment and higher resource expenditures) and add a mix of simulation exercises to stay within resource constraints and maintain training proficiency within the Band of Excellence. The com- mander determines the effect these substitutions will have on attaining de- sired levels of training proficiency. He then provides this information to the next higher commander who will either provide additional resources or ap- prove the constrained resource plan. 4-41. By summing up fiscal resource projections of subordinate units, com- manders at higher echelons are able to estimate resource requirements nec- essary to support their training strategies. Similar analyses are conducted to estimate ammunition, facilities, and other resources. Upon completion of the trade-off analysis, the commander includes the resulting events and associ- ated resources in the long-range training plan. 4-42. A significant resource consideration in RC planning is the allocation of available training time. Limited training time requires RC commanders to prioritize training requirements. They may have to train fewer tasks so that the Army standard can be attained. RC commanders compensate for lack of training time by carefully distributing requirements over longer periods of 4-21 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ time and identifying selected training tasks for execution during postmobili- zation training. Virtual and constructive training can complement live train- ing because they are time efficient, and can support sustainment of the RC unit in the Band of Excellence. SHORT-RANGE PLANNING 4-43. Short-range training plans define in greater detail the broad guidance on training events and other activities contained in the long-range training guidance and long-range calendar. They refine the allocation of resources to subordinate organizations and provide a common basis for preparing near- term training plans. SHORT-RANGE TRAINING GUIDANCE 4-44. Each echelon from division through battalion publishes short-range training guidance that enables the commander and staff to prioritize and re- fine mission essential training guidance contained in the long-range CTG. Commanders must publish the short-range training guidance with sufficient lead time to ensure subordinate units have time to develop their own short- range training plans. As shown in figure 4-15, the AC division provides quarterly training guidance (QTG) to subordinate commands and installa- tions at least 90 days prior to the start of each quarter. After receiving guid- ance from higher headquarters, subordinate units down to battalion sequen- tially publish their QTG. The RC process is conceptually the same as the AC process; except, the guidance normally is published annually as yearly train- ing guidance (YTG) as shown at figure 4-16. Additionally, RC unit com- manders are required to develop a postmobilization training plan to complete training to the level organized. This plan should be updated concurrently with the yearly training plan. Planning Guidance Future Action Publication Date Planning Horizon Division, separate brigade, regiment, group, or similar 3 months prior to start 3 months level command publishes QTG of quarter 2 months prior to start Brigade and group publish QTG 3 months of quarter Battalion, squadron, and separate company publish 6 weeks prior to start 3 months QTG of quarter1 Prior to start of Conduct QTB 3+ months quarter 1 To allow sufficient time for near-term planning at company level before the start of the quarter.

Reserve Component Short-Range Planning Cycle (Annually) 4-45. An important aspect of the quarterly and yearly training guidance is the role of the NCO. Within the framework of the commander's guidance, the CSM/1SG and key NCOs provide planning recommendations on the organi- zation's individual training program. They identify the individual training tasks that must be integrated into collective mission essential tasks during the short-range planning period. Examples of topics normally addressed in QTG and YTG are— • Commander's assessment of METL proficiency. • Training priorities and strategy to improve and sustain METL profi- ciency. • Combined arms training. • Organizational inspection program. • JIM training, as applicable. • A cross reference of training events and associated METL training objectives. • Individual training. • Leader development and leader training. • Self development. • Training of trainers and evaluators. • Training evaluation and feedback. • Force integration. • Resource guidance. • Training management. • Risk management. SHORT-RANGE PLANNING CALENDAR 4-46. The short-range planning calendar refines the long-range planning cal- endar and provides the time lines necessary for small unit leaders to prepare near-term training schedules. 4-23 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ 4-47. In preparing a short-range calendar, details are added to further define the major training events contained on the long-range planning calendar. Some examples of these details include— • The principal daily activities of major training events. • Home station training conducted in preparation for major training events and evaluations. • Other mandatory training that supports METL and warfighting such as command inspections as part of the OIP, Army Physical Fitness Test, weapons qualification, or periodic equipment maintenance and services. • Significant non-training events or activities that must be considered when scheduling training. Examples are national or local holidays and installation support missions. 4-48. The short-range training calendar is coordinated with appropriate in- stallation support agencies to create a common training and support focus between supported and supporting organizations. TRAINING EVENTS 4-49. Major training events are identified and scheduled during the long- range planning process. Short-range planning refines major training events. A major aspect of designing short-range training events is allocation of time to ensure the planned training is conducted to standard. Detailed informa- tion on training events may appear in the organization's short-range training guidance or in separate documents such as exercise directives or memoran- dums of instruction. MULTIECHELON TRAINING 4-50. Limited time and other resources do not permit developing sequential training programs in which each echelon from lower to higher is successively trained to reach interim "peaks" in proficiency. Therefore, leaders use a mul- tiechelon training approach to plan training events. Multiechelon training allows simultaneous training and evaluation on any combination of individ- ual and collective tasks at more than one echelon. Multiechelon training is the most efficient and effective way to train and sustain proficiency on mis- sion essential tasks within limited periods of training time. 4-51. Figure 4-17 is an example sequence for a division directed AC battalion task force EXEVAL multiechelon training event. This example depicts mis- sion essential training tasks for each echelon from battalion task force through crew. Various exercise techniques (such as multiple integrated laser engagement system [MILES], battle simulation, and live fire), are used to ac- complish the specified training objectives. 4-24 ____________________________________________________________________________ Planning Battalion Platoon/ Mission Essential Evaluation Day Phase Task Company Squad/ Training Tasks1 HQ2 Force Crew Alert/upload basic and operational 1 X X X loads A Move to an assembly area and 1st Brigade X X X 2 assemble the force Prepare the deliberate defense X X X Continue preparation of the 3 B X X X 1st Brigade deliberate defense Conduct deliberate defense (FTX) 4 X X X 1st Brigade (MILES) Conduct offensive operations 5 (constructive simulation) X C • Hasty attack X 6 (Company X 2d Brigade 7 • Deliberate attack HQ Only) • Night attack 8 Conduct hasty attack (LFX) X 1st Brigade 9 Mounted navigation exercise All Officers D Conduct tactical movement 2d Brigade 10 (redeploy) and post-operations Noncommissioned Officers Control maintenance 1 Selected individual tasks will be evaluated during each collective training activity. 2 Division HQ is the exercise control headquarters. Designated brigades provide controllers and evaluators, OPFOR, and range safety personnel. Figure 4-17. Division Directed Battalion Task Force EXEVAL Multiechelon Training Event 4-52. The designation of control and evaluation organizations is an impor- tant aspect of externally supported training exercises. This allows the units performing training to focus on execution of training while other organiza- tions provide the necessary control, evaluation, and administrative support. The 10-day battalion task force EXEVAL training event illustrated in figure 4-17 describes two approaches to multiechelon training (figures 4-18 and 4- 19). Multiechelon training occurs when— • An entire organization focuses on a single METL task. For example, fig- ure 4-18 highlights a number of supporting tasks that a battalion task force performs simultaneously to execute a successful deliberate attack against a prepared enemy defense. • Different echelons of an organization conduct training on related METL tasks simultaneously. The example at figure 4-19 depicts different eche- lons training on related tasks during days 5 through 7 of the battalion task force EXEVAL training event at figure 4-17. The battalion task force headquarters and company headquarters participate in a construc- tive battle simulation while tank platoons concurrently conduct platoon STXs in virtual simulations. Mechanized platoons concurrently conduct squad live fire exercises and crew proficiency training to prepare for the platoon hasty attack LFXs on "Day 8". 4-25 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ Responsibility Participants Activity Collective Tasks Leaders/Staff/Individual Tasks 4-26 ____________________________________________________________________________ Planning Event Description Wartime Mission-Related CPX All commanders and staffs from division through battalion participate in an exercise that thoroughly rehearses wartime operations plans. Division (training support) provides controllers, operates the battle board, and simulates the company level chain of command. The CONUSA provides personnel for a corps headquarters response cell and assists in evaluation. Company and Platoon STX As more senior commanders are participating in the CPX, companies negotiate a series of METL-related STXs. For example, an RC maneuver platoon is required to cross an LD at a specific time, react to an enemy ambush, clear an obstacle, conduct a hasty attack, and defend against a counter attack. The RC unit would perform the STX, participate in detailed after- action reviews, and renegotiate the course until the Army standard on each training task was achieved. Similar STXs are established for all of the combat arms, combat support, and combat service support organizations in the division. Figure 4-20. Multiechelon Training for Reserve Component Division Annual Training 4-54. Larger scale training events also provide an opportunity for valuable individual, crew, battle staff, and small unit training. These exercises can result in unproductive training for soldiers at lower echelons unless senior leaders plan multiechelon training down to the smallest participating units. This is the best method to maintain battle focus on the large unit METL tasks as well as on supporting collective and individual battle tasks for even the smallest participating units. TRAINING RESOURCES 4-55. In short-range planning, commanders allocate training resources to subordinate organizations for specific training activities. As required, ad- justments are made from the initial resource projections contained in long- range plans. The key requirement for division and brigade commanders is to coordinate short-range training plans with the various resource processes that support training. Examples of these processes are Program Budget Ad- visory Committee (PBAC) meetings, ammunition forecasts, and training area and facility scheduling conferences. A significant resource to assist the commander in planning training is the TSS. The TSS is a collection of re- sources that supports training and leverages available technology to replicate combat conditions and enhance training. Examples of TSS training support products are— • Facilities such as ranges, training areas, firing points, urban training sites, digital training facilities, and mission support and training facilities. • Training products such as MTP, training support packages, multimedia products, and distance learning through electronically stored and deliv- ered course content and programs of instruction. 4-27 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ • TADSS such as tactical engagement simulations, instrumentation at the CTC and home station, embedded training capabilities, MILES, and war- fighter simulation. • Training services such as the Center for Army Lessons Learned, propo- nent schools, installation support, and CTC. Training support products and their applications to training will be discussed in detail in FM 7-1 (projected). TRAIN THE TRAINERS 4-56. Training the trainers is a critical step in preparation for training. The leaders, trainers, and evaluators involved in any training event must know, understand, and be proficient on the specified tasks. Leaders, trainers, and evaluators must be trained to standard if the training event is to be done to standard. 4-57. In addition to leader training, specific trainer training must also be identified and planned. All leaders are trainers, but all trainers are not nec- essarily leaders. A specialist or subject matter expert may be necessary to conduct the instruction for a particular collective or individual task. It is es- sential that these trainers be allocated sufficient time to prepare the speci- fied training. 4-58. An overlap in training responsibilities, frequently overlooked by lead- ers when planning, is the case where a subordinate leader is the primary trainer as well as the leader of an element undergoing a collective training event. Senior leaders must consciously allocate sufficient time for subordi- nates to prepare for these responsibilities. 4-59. Training leaders, trainers, and evaluators to standard supports, en- hances, and enables collective training when properly planned and conducted before the training event. Commanders must plan, resource, and ensure timely accomplishment of trainer training. SHORT-RANGE TRAINING BRIEFINGS 4-60. The short-range training briefing is a conference conducted by senior commanders to review and approve the training plans of subordinate units. It is conducted before the time period addressed in the QTG or YTG. AC units conduct QTB. RC units conduct YTB. 4-61. Division commanders receive the short-range training briefing from subordinate brigades and all battalions in the division. The brigade com- mander and CSM personally present the overview of the brigade training plan; battalion commanders and CSMs present detailed briefings of their training plans. All habitually associated commanders participate in prepar- ing and conducting the training briefing. 4-62. Training briefings produce a contract between the senior commander and each subordinate commander. As a result of this contract, the senior commander agrees to provide resources, including time, and protect the sub- ordinate unit from unprogrammed taskings. The subordinate commander agrees to execute the approved training plan and conduct training to stan- dard. This shared responsibility helps maintain priorities, achieve unity of 4-28 ____________________________________________________________________________ Planning effort, and synchronize actions to achieve quality training and efficient re- sourcing. The QTB or YTB, as appropriate, is the forum where contracts for that training period are discussed and confirmed. Training guidance flows from the top-down and requirements for planning and execution of tasks flow from the bottom-up. 4-63. The training briefing is a highlight of the senior commander's leader development program. It provides the commander an opportunity to coach and teach subordinates on the fine points of his philosophy and strategies in all aspects of warfighting, to include doctrine, training, force integration, and leader development. It enables subordinate commanders, some of whom may be new to the organization, to gain a better understanding of how their mis- sion essential training relates to the battle focused training programs of their senior commanders and peers. 4-64. The senior commander specifies the format and content of the briefing in the QTG or YTG. However, the briefing guidance should be flexible enough to provide subordinate commanders and CSMs the latitude to high- light their initiatives and priorities. Units should refrain from discussing readiness issues not directly related to training. Such statistical, logistical, manning, or other management data is more appropriate to other readiness review forums and distracts from the overall training focus of the QTB or YTB. 4-65. During the training briefing, the subordinate commanders, as a mini- mum, usually address the following specific areas— • Brief training that was planned and briefed at previous QTB or YTB, but was not conducted and why. • The organization's METL and assessment of proficiency levels. • A discussion of the unit's training focus and objectives for the upcoming training period. • A presentation of the organization's short-range planning calendar. • A description of upcoming training events. • Officer leader development program with emphasis on warfighting skill development. • Self development. • Risk management. • Plans for preparing trainers and evaluators. • Force integration plans for the upcoming period. • Resource allocation. 4-66. Each CSM normally follows the commander's presentation. The CSM provides an analysis of the organization's individual training proficiency and discusses the organization's planned individual training and education. Ex- ample discussion topics include— • Individual training proficiency feedback received concerning previous short-range planning period. • An assessment of the organization's current individual training proficiency. 4-29 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ • Individual training events planned during the upcoming short-range planning period and strategy to prepare soldiers for these evaluations. • A description of METL derived individual tasks to be integrated with up- coming collective mission essential tasks. • Marksmanship and physical fitness programs. • NCO leader development program with emphasis on warfighting skill development. • Self development. • NCO/enlisted schools. NEAR-TERM PLANNING 4-67. Near-term planning is primarily conducted at battalion and subordi- nate command levels. It is conducted to— • Schedule and execute training objectives specified in the short-range training plan to the Army standard. • Provide specific guidance to trainers. • Make final coordination for the allocation of resources to be used in train- ing. • Complete final coordination with other units that will participate in training as part of the task organizations. • Prepare detailed training schedules. 4-68. Near-term planning covers a six- to eight-week period prior to the con- duct of training for AC units (figure 4-21) and a four-month period prior to training for RC units (figure 4-22). Formal near-term planning culminates when the unit publishes its training schedule.

Reserve Component Near-Term Planning Cycle (Monthly) TRAINING MEETINGS 4-69. Training meetings are the key to near-term planning. Training meet- ings create the bottom-up flow of information regarding specific training pro- ficiency needs of the small unit, battle staff, and individual soldier. Normally platoons, companies, and battalions conduct weekly training meetings. At battalion level, training meetings primarily cover training management is- sues. At company and platoon level, they are directly concerned with the specifics of training execution and must include pre-execution checks. Dur- ing training meetings, nothing is discussed but training. All key leaders of the unit must attend. TRAINING SCHEDULES 4-70. Near-term planning results in detailed training schedules. Training is considered "locked in" when the battalion commander signs the training schedule. At a minimum, it should— • Specify when training starts and where it takes place. • Allocate adequate time for scheduled training and additional training as required to correct anticipated deficiencies. • Specify individual, leader, and collective tasks to be trained. • Provide concurrent training topics that will efficiently use available training time. • Specify who conducts the training and who evaluates the training. • Provide administrative information concerning uniform, weapons, equipment, references, and safety precautions. 4-71. Senior commanders establish policies to minimize changes to the train- ing schedule. Training is locked in when training schedules are published. Command responsibility is established as follows— • The company commander drafts the training schedule. • The battalion commander approves and signs the schedule and provides necessary administrative support. • The brigade commander reviews each training schedule published in his command. • The division commander reviews selected training schedules in detail and the complete list of organization wide training highlights developed by the division staff. 4-31 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ 4-72. Senior commanders provide feedback to subordinates on training schedule quality and subsequently attend as much training as possible to en- sure that mission essential tasks are accomplished to standard. CS AND CSS TRAINING 4-73. CS and CSS units support combined arms unit training every day through execution of core warfighting functional tasks. Combat arms unit commanders recognize their units cannot conduct combined arms training without their task organized CS and CSS units. For example, combat arms unit commanders recognize their units cannot train without operational equipment, fuel, rations, water, and other supplies and services provided by their supporting CSS units. CS and CSS unit commanders integrate their unit training plans with their supported combat arms units. CS and CSS units daily perform their core warfighting functional tasks, at the section, team, and individual technical MOS level. For example, maintenance sup- port teams routinely perform organizational and direct support automotive, turret, armament, and communications-electronic maintenance and periodic services, as well as provide repair parts support to their supported combat arms units. Certain low density technical MOSs pose a particular training challenge because these soldiers may not be able to perform some of their in- dividual technical MOS tasks while their organization is in garrison. CS and CSS unit commanders look for opportunities elsewhere on the installation to train these soldiers on their individual technical MOS tasks. 4-74. CS and CSS unit commanders ensure training exercises are designed in such a way as to provide opportunities to train on CS and CSS company and battalion level METL tasks. For example, a corps support group (CSG) commander may design an exercise that provides an opportunity for a subordinate engineer battalion (combat heavy), a quartermaster company (water supply) (direct support/general support [DS/GS]) and a quartermaster tactical water distribution team (Hoseline) to practice selected wartime METL tasks while participating in a support operations training exercise. In this exercise, these units provide water supply and distribution, and restore vital infrastructure to a host country devastated by a natural or man-made disaster. Figure 4-23 highlights a number of supporting tasks, at different echelons, that an engineer battalion (combat heavy) performs during such a support operation exercise. All these tasks support a single wartime METL task of construct/repair water distribution system. 4-32 ____________________________________________________________________________ Planning Responsibility Participants Activity Collective Tasks Leader/Individual Tasks BN CDR: Determine Prepare construction events in a construction estimates project Battalion Commander Site-adapt a standard Battalion Staff FTX S2: Plan/Direct engineer (CBT) (HVY) construction design intelligence collection Control construction S3: Schedule work in a operations construction project Company All assigned or Prepare a water storage Commander attached FTX Design drainage system and distribution site (CBT)(HVY) personnel Construct/repair a water All assigned or distribution system Read construction prints Platoon Leader (Gen attached FTX Const PLT) Construct/repair sewage Prepare a bill of materials personnel system Squad Leader (Gen Conduct excavation Supervise installation of Squad members FTX Const PLT) operations plumbing system Backfill with scoop loader Conduct excavation Individual Soldiers Squad members FTX Operate excavation operations equipment Note Tasks taken from ARTEPs 5-415-66-MTP, 5-417-35-MTP, 5-417-17 and 5-417-17-MTP.

Garrison commanders’ training plans incorporate mobilization, post- mobilization, deployment, redeployment, and demobilization requirements. Garrison commanders plan and schedule periodic mobilization exercises (MOBEXs), emergency deployment readiness exercises (EDREs), and other contingency plan exercises to sustain proficiency on Title X related tasks out- lined in current Army and MACOM regulations. Garrison commanders coor- dinate their training plans with their supported corps, divisional, and tenant organizations. Garrisons routinely support scheduled unit training deploy- ments and exercise certain deployment tasks such as "operating depar- ture/arrival airfield control groups and seaports of embarkation and debarka- tion." 4-34 Chapter 5 Execution Only through high training requirements, rigidly enforced, can low casualty rates be possible. Only well armed and equipped, adequately trained and efficiently led forces can expect victory in future combat. General Matthew B. Ridgway EXECUTION OF TRAINING 5-1. All good training, regardless of the specific collective, leader, and individual tasks being executed, must comply with certain common requirements. These include adequate preparation, effective presentation and practice, and thorough evaluation. (Evaluation is discussed in chapter 6.) The execution of training in- cludes preparation for training, conduct of training, and recovery from training (figure 5-1). 5-1 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ 5-2. The training execution process is applicable at all echelons, from a high level staff participating in a joint training exercise to a first line leader's individual training of his team. Figure 5-1. Training Execution Process PREPARATION FOR TRAINING 5-3. As discussed in chapter 4, formal near-term planning for training culmi- nates with the publication of the unit training schedule. Informal planning, de- tailed coordination, and preparation for executing the training continue until the training is performed. Commanders and other trainers use training meetings to assign responsibility for preparation of all scheduled training. Preparation for training includes selecting tasks to be trained, planning the conduct of the train- ing, training the trainers, reconnaissance of the site, issuing the training execu- tion plan, and conducting rehearsals and pre-execution checks. Pre-execution checks are preliminary actions commanders and trainers use to identify respon- sibility for these and other training support tasks. They are used to monitor preparation activities and to follow-up to ensure planned training is conducted to standard. Pre-execution checks are a critical portion of any training meeting. During preparation for training, battalion and company commanders identify and eliminate potential training distracters that develop within their organizations. They also stress personnel accountability to ensure maximum at- tendance at training. 5-4. Subordinate leaders, as a result of the bottom-up feed from internal training meetings, identify and select the collective, leader, and individual tasks neces- sary to support the identified training objectives. Commanders develop the ten- tative plan to include requirements for preparatory training, concurrent training, and training resources. At a minimum, the training plan should include confir- mation of training areas and locations, training ammunition allocations, training simulations and simulators availability, transportation requirements, soldier support items, a risk management analysis, assignment of responsibility for the training, designation of trainers responsible for approved training, and final co- ordination. The time and other necessary resources for retraining must also be an integral part of the original training plan. 5-5. Leaders, trainers, evaluators, observer/controllers, and OPFOR are identi- fied, trained to standard, and rehearsed prior to the conduct of the training. Leaders and trainers are coached on how to train, given time to prepare, and re- hearsed so that training will be challenging and doctrinally correct. Command- ers ensure that trainers and evaluators are not only tactically and technically competent on their training tasks, but also understand how the training relates to the organization's METL. Properly prepared trainers, evaluators, and leaders project confidence and enthusiasm to those being trained. Trainer and leader training is a critical event in the preparation phase of training. These individu- als must demonstrate proficiency on the selected tasks prior to the conduct of training. 5-2 ____________________________________________________________________________ Execution 5-6. Commanders, with their subordinate leaders and trainers, conduct site re- connaissance; identify additional training support requirements; and refine and issue the training execution plan. The training plan should identify all elements necessary to ensure the conduct of training to standard. Rehearsals are essential to the execution of good training. Realistic, standards based performance ori- ented training requires rehearsals for trainers, support personnel, evaluators, observer/controllers, and OPFOR. 5-7. Preparing for training in RC organizations can require complex pre- execution checks. RC trainers must often conduct detailed coordination to obtain equipment, TSS products, and ammunition from distant locations. In addition, RC pre-execution checks may be required to coordinate AC assistance from the numbered CONUSA, Divisions (Training Support), and directed training affilia- tions. CONDUCT OF TRAINING 5-8. Ideally, training is executed using the crawl-walk-run approach. This allows and promotes an objective, standards-based approach to training. Training starts at the basic level. Crawl events are relatively simple to conduct and re- quire minimum support from the unit. After the crawl stage, training becomes incrementally more difficult, requiring more resources from the unit and home station, and increasing the level of realism. At the run stage, the level of diffi- culty for the training event intensifies. Run stage training requires optimum re- sources and ideally approaches the level of realism expected in combat. Progres- sion from the walk to the run stage for a particular task may occur during a one- day training exercise or may require a succession of training periods over time. Achievement of the Army standard determines progression between stages. 5-9. In crawl-walk-run training, the tasks and the standards remain the same, however, the conditions under which they are trained change. Commanders may change the conditions for example, by increasing the difficulty of the conditions under which the task is being performed, increasing the tempo of the task train- ing, increasing the number of tasks being trained, or by increasing the number of personnel involved in the training. Whichever approach is used, it is important that all leaders and soldiers involved understand which stage they are currently training and understand the Army standard. Example The crawl-walk-run approach occurs in the execution of a mechanized infantry platoon executing an “Assault an Objective” STX. In the crawl stage, the platoon conducts a dismounted rehearsal of the assault. In the walk stage, the platoon conducts a fully mechanized rehearsal of the assault to include consolidation and reorganization. In the run stage, the platoon executes several iterations of the assault against an OPFOR. Some iterations are conducted under NBC conditions, and some during pe- riods of limited visibility. In each iteration of the assault, the platoon strives to achieve the tactical objective to the standard described in the T&EO for “assault an objective.” 5-3 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ 5-10. An AAR is conducted immediately after training and may indicate that additional training is needed. Any task that was not conducted to standard should be retrained. Retraining should be conducted at the earliest opportunity. Commanders should program time and other resources for retraining as an inte- gral part of their long, short-, and near-term training planning cycle. Training is incomplete until the task is trained to standard. Soldiers will remember the standard enforced, not the one discussed. 5-11. Commanders employ this same approach using virtual and constructive simulations as a means to train battle staffs and subordinate organizations. Commanders strive to attain and sustain a level of proficiency within the Band of Excellence. 5-12. Trainers use the appropriate combination of demonstrations, conferences, discussions, and practice activities to present training. Using the crawl-walk-run approach, they inform individuals being trained of the training objectives (tasks, conditions, and standards) and applicable evaluation methods. They immedi- ately follow presentation with practice to convert information into usable indi- vidual and collective skills. The amount of detail included in practice depends on experience levels. If individuals or organizations are receiving initial training on a mission essential task, trainers emphasize the basic conditions. If those receiv- ing the instruction are receiving sustainment training on a task, trainers raise the level of detail and realism until the conditions replicate the wartime envi- ronment as closely as possible. Trainers challenge those with considerable ex- perience to perform multiple training tasks within a given training scenario. Properly presented and executed training is realistic, safe, accurate, well struc- tured, efficient, and effective: • Realistic training requires organizations to train the way they will fight or support within all dimensions of the battlefield/space. Realistic training in- cludes all available elements of combined arms teams and, as appropriate, joint, multinational, and interagency teams. It optimizes the use of TSS products to replicate the stresses, sounds, and conditions of combat. • Safe training is the predictable result of performing to established tactical and technical standards. Through the risk management process, leaders at all echelons ensure that safety requirements are integral and not add-on con- siderations to all aspects of planning, executing, and evaluating training. • Accurate training complies with Army operational and training doctrine and is technically correct. Field manuals, MTPs, battle drills, and other training publications provide factual information to trainers to facilitate con- duct of training, coach subordinate trainers, and evaluate training results. • Well-structured training contains a mixture of initial and sustainment training. It also consists of a mix of individual and leader tasks that are in- tegrated into METL collective tasks. Soldiers and leaders increase profi- ciency in individual tasks while training on collective mission essential tasks. • Efficient training ensures that training resources are expended properly. Efficiently executed training makes full use of every participant's time. Commanders monitor physical and financial resource execution through PBACs, range conferences, and similar forums. They use the feedback re- ceived during these forums to adjust resources within their commands to sus- tain METL proficiency within the Band of Excellence. Continuing advances in training technology enhance the commander's ability to hone warfighting skills and are increasingly required to balance constraints to training, such as environmental protection considerations and availability of training areas and ranges. Similarly, TSS products and services, such as TADSS, not only 5-4 ____________________________________________________________________________ Execution provide a means for initial and sustainment training on warfighting funda- mentals, but also provide relatively inexpensive preparation for resource in- tensive training events. Although TSS products provide excellent virtual and constructive training supplements, there is no substitute for the more robust experience of live training. • Effective training builds proficiency, teamwork, confidence, and cohesive- ness. Effective training is competitive. Although individuals and organiza- tions may sometimes compete against one another, they should always com- pete to achieve the prescribed standard. If they do not initially achieve the standard, trainers take corrective actions so that the proper performance level results. Additional considerations for conducting effective training are— Training and Evaluation Outline (T&EO). Effective collective, leader, and individual training are guided by the use of T&EOs. The T&EO provides summary information concerning collective training ob- jectives as well as individual and leader training tasks that support the collective training objectives. They also provide information concerning resource requirements and evaluation standards applicable to a training situation. The principal source documents for T&EOs are MTPs and other soldier training publications. Since the conditions in these publica- tions can vary, trainers adjust and supplement T&EO conditions to con- form to the METT-TC of the organization's operational plans. Individual Training. Fundamental to the adaptability of the force is the maintenance of individual skills yielding technically and tactically competent soldiers who are confident in their abilities. The individual soldier is the heart of any unit’s ability to conduct its mission. The ability to perform individual/leader skills to standard is founded in the institu- tional training base, but it is honed and maintained by effective, periodic repetition of tasks. Training devices, simulators, and web-based training can be used to facilitate the training of individual tasks. Leader Training. Leaders spend virtually all available training time supervising the training of subordinates. Often, they do not increase their own understanding of how to fight as combat or support leaders. Therefore, senior commanders view leader training as a continuous proc- ess that encompasses more than periodic officer and NCO professional development classes. Senior commanders establish a positive training environment that encourages subordinates to become adaptive leaders capable of independent thinking on the move, and of timely decision mak- ing based on broad, effects-based intent guidance, mission orders, and a shared vision of the battlefield. Growing and maturing leaders is a vital part of an effective training program. Leader training, when properly conducted, produces competent, confident, adaptable leaders, and ulti- mately produces soldiers who are confident in the abilities of their lead- ers. Battle Rosters. Battle rosters are maintained at battalion level and be- low to track key training information on selected mission essential sys- tems (such as tanks, howitzers, automated command and control sys- tems, forklifts, etc.). They track such pertinent training data as crew sta- bility and manning levels, and qualification status. A key aspect of battle rosters is the designation of qualified back-up operators or crewmembers assigned in other positions in the organization. During the execution of training, battle rostered crewmembers train with their designated crews 5-5 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ at available opportunities. Commanders must discipline the battle roster system. Battle Staff Training. Battle staff training develops and sustains plan- ning, coordination, execution, and other staff functions related to wartime mission requirements. Battle staff training objectives are de- rived from the staff METL. Commanders train battle staffs primarily through a mix of constructive and virtual simulations. They maximize the use of information technology systems to enhance leader skills and to develop the adaptiveness necessary to leverage developing information technology. Battle staffs train to integrate and coordinate the BOS in- ternally within their own headquarters, horizontally with other staffs at the same organizational level, and vertically with higher and subordinate organizational staffs. The result of this training produces commanders and staffs capable of synchronizing the BOS across the full spectrum of operations. A well-trained battle staff is a combat multiplier. JIM Training. JIM training requires different considerations. Joint training is conducted using approved joint doctrine and TTPs, and must be consistent with assigned joint missions and priorities. When assigned as a JFC, Army commanders establish joint training objectives and plans, execute and evaluate joint training, and assess training proficiency. Mul- tinational training optimizes contributions of member forces by matching their missions with their capabilities, and uses available training assis- tance programs. Major FTXs can be complemented with the use of simulations to enhance multinational training. Joint training publica- tions are available to multinational partners. Interagency training is of growing importance. When Army missions will likely involve U.S. gov- ernment agencies, if possible, training should be conducted with the or- ganizations and people likely to be involved in the assigned mission. JIM training is as rigorous as any other training the Army conducts. This training also results in mutual appreciation for other capabilities, and the development of valuable personal and professional relationships among those who will operate together. RECOVERY FROM TRAINING 5-13. The recovery process is an extension of training and, once completed, it sig- nifies the end of the training event. At a minimum, recovery includes conduct of maintenance training, turn-in of training support items, and the conduct of AARs that review the overall effectiveness of the training. 5-14. Maintenance training is the conduct of post operations preventive mainte- nance checks and services, accountability of organizational and individual equip- ment, and final inspections. Class IV, Class V, TADSS and other support items are maintained, accounted for, and turned-in. Training sites and facilities are closed out. 5-15. AARs conducted during recovery focus on collective, leader, and individual task performance, and on the planning, preparation and conduct of the training. Unit AARs focus on individual and collective task performance, and identify shortcomings and the training required to correct deficiencies. AARs with lead- ers focus on tactical judgment. These AARs contribute to leader learning and provide opportunities for leader development. AARs with trainers, evaluators, observer/controllers, and OPFOR provide additional opportunities for leader development. 5-6 ____________________________________________________________________________ Execution 5-16. The AARs conducted during recovery along with the AARs that took place during the conduct of training enhance future training . They provide the feed- back that contributes to the development of training plans to correct identified deficiencies. Finally, these AARs contribute to the commander’s overall evalua- tion of training effectiveness and unit assessment. However, they are not in themselves the end state of recovery. Recovery from training is complete when the unit is again prepared to conduct its assigned mission. ROLE OF COMMANDERS AND SENIOR LEADERS 5-17. Although planning for training is relatively centralized to align training priorities at all echelons of an organization, the execution of training is decen- tralized. Decentralization tailors training execution to available resources and promotes bottom-up communication of unique wartime mission related strengths and weaknesses of each individual, leader, and unit. 5-18. Senior commanders must personally observe and evaluate the execution of training at all echelons to the maximum extent possible. From their observa- tions of training and other feedback, they provide guidance and direct changes that lead to improved training and increased readiness. 5-19. By personally visiting training, senior commanders communicate to subor- dinate units and leaders the paramount importance of training. In addition to observing and evaluating the training of their headquarters and immediate sub- ordinate commands, senior commanders also observe and evaluate the quality of training at all echelons down to the lowest levels of the organization. They re- ceive feedback from subordinate leaders and soldiers during training visits. Through feedback, senior commanders identify and resolve systemic problems in planning, leadership, management, support, and other functions. 5-20. The most beneficial senior commander and staff visits to training are un- announced or short notice. They observe training as experienced by soldiers and prevent excessive visitor preparation by subordinate organizations (this, in itself, can become a training distracter). Senior commanders assign coordination of training support for subordinate units as a priority requirement for organiza- tional staffs. Training support and coordination of training resources are key to successful training execution. Senior commanders check the adequacy of exter- nal training support during every training visit and require prompt and effective corrective action to resolve support deficiencies. ROLE OF NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS 5-21. The difference in our Army and every other army in the world is that we have a proud, professional NCO Corps that takes pride in, and accepts responsi- bility for, the care and individual training of soldiers. CSM/1SG and key NCOs select and train specific individual tasks that support the units' collective mis- sion essential tasks. NCOs are indispensable throughout the training process. Commanders approve the tasks selected and supervise and evaluate training with the officers and NCOs throughout the training execution process. 5-22. NCOs are responsible for individual, crew, and small team training. They continue the soldierization process of newly assigned enlisted soldiers and begin their professional development. In units, individual skill training is presented by the first-line leader, and not presented to large numbers of soldiers by com- mittee. The first-line leader is responsible to train individual tasks to soldiers in 5-7 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ their squads, crews, teams, and equivalent small units. The first-line leader and senior NCOs emphasize standards-based, performance-oriented training to en- sure soldiers achieve the Army standard. NCO leaders conduct cross training to 5-8 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ with feedback on the demonstrated training proficiency of soldiers, leaders, bat- tle staffs, and units. Commanders cannot personally observe all training in their organization and, therefore, gather feedback from their senior staff officers and NCOs. ORGANIZATIONAL ASSESSMENT 6-3. Battalion and higher echelon commanders must be concerned with broader concepts. Accordingly, they perform organizational assessments that aggregate a large number of evaluations. These commanders establish an organizational as- sessment program that— • Fixes responsibility within the staff and subordinate units for gathering and analyzing evaluation data and preparing recommendations. • Concentrates on the effectiveness of leader and organization training. • Utilizes the CSM and other senior NCOs to gather feedback on the individ- ual, crew, and team training. • Allows the senior commander to monitor outcomes and take action to reshape priorities, policies, or plans to overcome assessed weaknesses and sustain demonstrated strengths. 6-4. CTC take-home packages are an excellent source of feedback to include in an organizational assessment. These packages consist of videotapes and written documentation of AARs, a report of unit strengths and weaknesses as noted by the observer/controllers, and recommendations for future home station training. Some important sources of feedback for the senior commander's assessment of the organization's ability to accomplish wartime missions are listed in figure 6-1. 6-2 __________________________________________________________________________ Assessment Personal observations of training.

Sources of Feedback for Organizational Assessments EVALUATIONS 6-5. Evaluations can be informal, formal, internal, external, or any combination, thereof— • Informal evaluations take place when a leader conducts training with his unit, for example when a squad leader trains his squad to assault an objec- tive. Another example would be whenever a leader visits ongoing training, for instance when a battalion commander observes company training. This type of evaluation provides real time feedback on the training environment and the proficiency resulting from training. • Formal evaluations are resourced with dedicated evaluators and are gen- erally scheduled in the long-range or short-range training plans. Formal evaluations are normally highlighted during short-range training briefings. To the maximum extent possible, headquarters two echelons higher conduct formal external evaluations; for example, division commanders evaluate bat- talions, brigade commanders evaluate companies, and battalion commanders evaluate platoons. • Internal evaluations are planned, resourced, and conducted by the organi- zation undergoing the evaluation. • External evaluations are planned, resourced, and conducted by a head- quarters at an echelon higher in the chain of command than the organization undergoing the evaluation or a headquarters outside the chain of command. 6-6. Evaluation of individual and small unit training normally includes every soldier and leader involved in the training. For large-scale training events, evaluators sample a number of individuals and subordinate organizations to de- 6-3 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ termine the likelihood of the entire organization to be able to perform specific mission essential tasks to standard. 6-7. During and after formal evaluation, evaluators prepare their findings and recommendations. They provide these reports to the evaluated unit commander and higher commanders as required by the headquarters directing the evalua- tion. Evaluation documentation can range from an annotated T&EO for an in- ternal training evaluation to a comprehensive report on RC units during AT pe- riods. EVALUATION OF TRAINING 6-8. Training evaluations are a critical component of any training assessment. Evaluation measures the demonstrated ability of soldiers, commanders, leaders, battle staffs, and units against the Army standard. Evaluation of training is in- tegral to standards-based training and is the cornerstone of leader training and leader development. 6-9. All training must be evaluated to measure performance levels against the established Army standard. The evaluation can be as fundamental as an infor- mal, internal evaluation performed by the leader conducting the training. Evaluation is conducted specifically to enable the unit or individual undergoing the training to know whether the training standard has been achieved. Com- manders must establish a climate that encourages candid and accurate feedback for the purpose of developing leaders and trained units. 6-10. Evaluation of training is not a test; it is not used to find reasons to punish leaders and soldiers. Evaluation tells the unit or the soldier whether or not they achieved the Army standard and, therefore, assists them in determining the overall effectiveness of their training plans. Evaluation produces disciplined sol- diers, leaders and units. Training without evaluation is a waste of time and re- sources. 6-11. Leaders use evaluations as an opportunity to coach and mentor subordi- nates. A key element in developing leaders is immediate, positive feedback that coaches and leads subordinate leaders to achieve the Army standard. This is a tested and proven path to develop competent, confident adaptive leaders. AFTER ACTION REVIEW 6-12. The AAR, whether formal or informal, provides feedback for all training. It is a structured review process that allows participating soldiers, leaders, and units to discover for themselves what happened during the training, why it hap- pened, and how it can be done better. The AAR is a professional discussion that requires the active participation of those being trained. The AAR is not a cri- tique and has the following advantages over a critique: • Focuses directly on key METL derived training objectives. • Emphasizes meeting Army standards rather than pronouncing judgment of success or failure. • Uses "leading questions" to encourage participants to self-discover important lessons from the training event. • Allows a large number of individuals and leaders to participate so more of the training can be recalled and more lessons learned can be shared. 6-13. The AAR consists of four parts— 6-4 __________________________________________________________________________ Assessment • Review what was supposed to happen (training plans). The evaluator, along with the participants, reviews what was supposed to happen based on the commander's intent for the training event, unit-training plan, training objectives, and applicable T&EOs. • Establish what happened. The evaluator and the participants determine what actually happened during performance of the training task. A factual and indisputable account is vital to the effectiveness of the discussion that follows. For force-on-force training, OPFOR members assist in describing the flow of the training event and discuss training outcomes from their points of view. • Determine what was right or wrong with what happened. The par- ticipants establish the strong and weak points of their performance. The evaluator plays a critical role in guiding the discussions so conclusions reached by participants are doctrinally sound, consistent with Army stan- dards, and relevant to the wartime mission. • Determine how the task should be done differently the next time. The evaluator assists the chain of command undergoing the training to lead the group in determining exactly how participants will perform differently the next time the task is performed. This results in organizational and indi- vidual motivation to conduct future sustainment training to standard. 6-14. Leaders understand that not all tasks will be performed to standard and in their initial planning, allocate time and other resources for retraining. Retrain- ing allows the participants to apply the lessons learned during the AAR and im- plement corrective action. Retraining should be conducted at the earliest oppor- tunity to translate observation and evaluation into training to standard. Com- manders must ensure that units understand that training is incomplete until the Army standard is achieved. 6-15. The AAR is often "tiered" as a multiechelon leader development technique. Following an AAR with all participants, senior trainers may use the AAR for an extended professional discussion with selected leaders. These discussions usu- ally include a more specific AAR of leader contributions to the observed training results. Commanders use this process as a link between leader training and leader development. EVALUATORS 6-16. Commanders must plan for formal evaluation and must ensure the evalua- tors are trained. These evaluators must also be trained as facilitators to conduct AARs that elicit maximum participation from those being trained. External evaluators will be certified in the tasks they are evaluating and normally will not be dual-hatted as a participant in the training being executed. In addition to be- ing able to plan, prepare, and conduct AARs, effective evaluators must also— • Be familiar with the evaluated organization's METL. • Be trained (tactically and technically proficient) and rehearsed in the tasks evaluated. • Know the evaluation standards. • Follow the tactical and field SOPs for the organization being evaluated. • Apply relevant information about the evaluated unit, such as wartime mis- sions, personnel turbulence, leader fill, and equipment status. 6-5 FM 7-0 (FM 25-100) _____________________________________________________________________ 6-17. Unit leaders, officers and NCOs, must be trained to conduct informal, in- ternal evaluations as well. They must be able to plan, prepare, and conduct AARs effectively. This means they must— • Be familiar with their organization's METL and how it supports their higher headquarters’ METL. • Be tactically and technically proficient in the tasks evaluated. 6-18. Not only do the individuals and units receiving the training learn from the evaluator, but also the evaluator learns while observing the evaluated unit. THE ROLE OF SENIOR COMMANDERS AND LEADERS 6-19. Senior commanders ensure that evaluations take place at each echelon in the organization. Commanders use this feedback to teach, coach, and mentor their subordinates. They ensure that every training event is evaluated as part of training execution and that every trainer conducts evaluations. Senior com- manders use evaluations to focus command attention by requiring evaluation of specific mission essential and battle tasks. They also take advantage of evalua- tion information to develop appropriate lessons learned for distribution through- out their commands. 6-20. The use of evaluation data can have a strong effect on the command cli- mate of the organization. Therefore, senior commanders make on-the-spot cor- rections, underwrite honest mistakes, and create an environment for aggressive action to correct training deficiencies, through retraining. 6-21. Senior commanders use training evaluations as one component of a feed- back system. To keep the training system dynamic, they use feedback to deter- mine the effectiveness of the planning, execution, and assessment portions of the training management cycle. These feedback systems allow the senior com- mander to make changes that lead to superior training results and to teach, coach and mentor subordinate leaders. To be effective, this feedback flows be- tween senior and subordinate headquarters, within each command echelon, and among a network of trainers that may cross several command lines. Some sources of training feedback include— • Training plan assessments. • Quarterly training briefing (AC). • Yearly training briefing (RC). • PBAC. • Range conferences. • Evaluation data. • Staff visits. • Leader development discussions. • Personal observations. • CTC take home packages. 6-6 __________________________________________________________________________ Assessment Figure 6-2. Army Training Management Cycle SUMMARY 6-22. This field manual establishes Army training doctrine and applies through- out the force; to all units, at all echelons, AC and RC. Training to the Army stan- dard is the key to fighting and winning. Every commander and leader from squad through Army is expected to know, understand, and apply this capstone training doctrine. Training excellence is the cornerstone of combat readiness. All leaders are trainers! The more you sweat in training, the less you bleed in war.
