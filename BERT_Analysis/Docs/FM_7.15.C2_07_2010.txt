Police intelligence operations (PIO) is a military police (MP) function, integrated within all MP operations, which supports the operations process through analysis, production, and dissemination of information collected as a result of police activities to enhance situational understanding, protection, civil control, and law enforcement. Upon analysis, this information may contribute to commander’s critical information requirements (CCIR), intelligence-led, time-sensitive operations, or policing strategies necessary to forecast, anticipate, and preempt crime or related disruptive activities to maintain order. Police intelligence results from the application of systems, technologies, and processes that analyze applicable data and information necessary for situational understanding and focusing policing activities to maintain law and order. (FM 3-19.50) (USAMPS) Notes: PIO function is not an intelligence discipline; it is a law enforcement function. However, it is within the critical intelligence task, “support situational understanding” that PIO best support the Army operations process and informs the intelligence process. PIO are essential to this task, particularly where irregular threats (criminal, terrorist, and insurgents) threaten the security of U.S. forces and military operations. This function supports and enhances the commander’s situational awareness and common operational picture through collection, analysis, and appropriate dissemination of relevant criminal, police information, and police intelligence. PIO are a vital tool of law enforcement and criminal investigators that distributes and focuses military police and criminal investigations assets. U.S. Codes, executive orders, Department of Defense (DOD) directives, and Army regulations contain specific guidance regarding the prohibition of intelligence personnel from collecting intelligence on U.S. citizens, U.S. corporations, and resident aliens.

Chapter 4 ART 4.0: The Sustainment Warfighting Function The sustainment warfighting function is the related tasks and systems that provide support and services to ensure freedom of action, extend operational reach, and prolong endurance. The endurance of Army forces is primarily a function of their sustainment. Sustainment determines the depth and duration of Army operations. It is essential to retaining and exploiting the initiative. Sustainment is the provision of the logistics, personnel services, and health service support necessary to maintain operations until mission accomplishment. Internment, resettlement, and detainee operations fall under the sustainment warfighting function and include elements of all three major subfunctions. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) Note: This task and many of its subordinate tasks encompass environmental considerations. + Logistics is the science of planning, preparing, executing, and assessing the movement and maintenance of forces.

Internment and resettlement (I/R) operations include the two major categories of internment operations and resettlement operations. These categories are further refined focusing on specific types of detainees and U.S. military prisoners while discriminating between civilian internees included as part of internment and those dislocated civilians (DCs) that may be retained as part of resettlement operations. Internment operations focus on all types of detainees and U.S. military prisoners. Although a part of internment operations, confinement refers to U.S military prisoners rather than internment (U.S. military prisoners are covered under ART 5.8.2). Resettlement operations focus on DCs, those civilians that are not part of the population of detainees. Military police conduct internment/resettlement operations to shelter, sustain, guard, protect, and account for populations (enemy prisoners of war (EPWs), civilian internees, DCs, or U.S. military prisoners) as a result of military or civil conflict, of natural or man-made disaster, or to facilitate criminal prosecution. Internment involves detaining a population or group that poses some level of threat to military operations. Resettlement involves quartering members of a population or group for their protection. These operations inherently control the movement and activities of their specific population for imperative reasons of security, safety, or intelligence gathering. (FM 3-39.40) (USAMPS) Note: ART 4.1.7.5.4 (Construct, Manage, and Maintain Bases and Installations) addresses the construction, management, and maintenance of bases and installations to include facilities such as those required for the internment of detainees.

ART 6.2.2.4 REDEPLOY PERSONNEL RECOVERY CAPABILITIES 6-31. As units redeploy, either back to continental United States (CONUS) or to another area of operations (AO), actions accomplished for personnel recovery (PR) are similar to those undertaken during deployment. An important task is the transfer of PR responsibility, including the key task of transferring lessons learned gathered during after action reviews. When units redeploy to CONUS, PR responsibility for the AO transfers to incoming forces. If redeploying to another AO, units integrate into that AO’s established PR architecture or build one if it does not exist. (FM 3-50.1) (USACAC) No. Scale Measure Unit ensured PR capabilities were available until all forces, including contractors and 01 Yes/No Army civilians, have redeployed. 02 Yes/No Unit ensured counterintelligence debriefing of recovered personnel.

Stability operations encompass various military missions, tasks, and activities conducted outside the United States in coordination with elements of combat to maintain or reestablish a safe and secure environment, provide essential government services, emergency infrastructure reconstruction, and humanitarian relief. Stability operations can be conducted in support of a host-nation or interim government or as part of an occupation when no government exists. Stability operations involve both coercive and constructive actions by the military force. They are designed to establish a safe and secure environment; facilitate reconciliation among local or regional adversaries; establish political, legal, social, and economic institutions; and facilitate the transition to legitimate local governance. Army forces conduct five stability 7 July 2010 FM 7-15, C2 7-7 Chapter 7 tasks: civil security, civil control, restore essential services, support to governance, and support to economic and infrastructure development. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) Note: This task branch only addresses those tasks that support the conduct of Army stability operations. Other tasks that support stability operations are addressed elsewhere in the AUTL: ART 6.5.4 (Provide Protective Services for Selected Individuals) addresses the protection of personnel. ART 6.5.2 (Conduct Critical Installations and Facilities Security) addresses the protection of facilities. ART 6.12 (Provide Explosive Ordnance Disposal Protection Support) addresses the conduct of unexploded ordnance disposal. ART 7.3.1 ESTABLISH CIVIL SECURITY 7-31. Civil security involves providing for the safety of the state and its population, including protection from internal and external threats. Civil security includes a diverse set of activities, ranging from enforcing peace agreements to executing disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration. For the other stability tasks to be effective, civil security is required. Establishing a safe, secure, and stable environment for the local populace is key to obtaining their support for the overall stability operation. To help establish civil security, military forces enforce ceasefires, supervise disengagement of belligerent forces, and neutralize potential adversaries. As soon the host-nation security forces can safely perform this task, Army forces transition civil security responsibilities to them.

ART 7.3.2.5 SUPPORT PROPERTY AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESSES 7-45. One of the most vital services provided by the judiciary branch is the resolution of property disputes. In a fragile state, long-standing disputes over ownership and control of property are common. Authorities must implement dispute resolution mechanisms. This prevents the escalation of violence that can occur in the absence of law and order as people seek resolution on their own terms. Typically, the military’s role in resolving disputes is limited to transitional military authority where these mechanisms are implemented in the absence of a functioning host-nation government.

ART 7.3.4.3 SUPPORT ELECTIONS 7-61. Military forces may be required to provide security assistance to the host-nation civil authorities or international election commission agencies to prevent the disruption of elections. The primary role of military forces in support of elections is to facilitate civil order by providing a secure environment and should not be perceived as influencing the election outcome. U.S. forces should not be perceived as influencing elections by endorsing political platforms, parties, or candidates. Ideally, host-nation government and institutions will have the lead in developing and implementing elections with U.S. military in a supporting role. This support may include assisting the electoral commission in the planning and coordination of the election execution process and augmenting the host-nation security forces, as directed. Overt U.S. forces involvement in elections may be perceived as detrimental to an open, democratic, and legitimate election and taint the outcome. Planning and execution must be consistent with U.S. law, military guidance, and host-nation government regulations. The integrity of the election is the responsibility of the host-nation government or international election commission.

Economic recovery begins with an actively engaged labor force. When a military force occupies an operational area, the demand for local goods, services, and labor creates employment opportunities for the local populace. Local projects, such as restoring public services, rebuilding schools, or clearing roads, offer additional opportunities for the local labor pool. Drawing on local goods, services, and labor presents the force with the first opportunity to infuse cash into the local economy, which in turn stimulates market activity.

SECTION IV – ART 7.4: CONDUCT CIVIL SUPPORT OPERATIONS 7-68. Civil support is Department of Defense support to U.S. civil authorities for domestic emergencies, and for designated law enforcement and other activities. Civil support includes operations that address the consequences of natural or manmade disasters, accidents, and incidents within the United States and its territories. Army forces conduct civil support operations when the size and scope of events exceed the capabilities of domestic civilian agencies. The Army National Guard is often the first military force to respond on behalf of state authorities. Army civil support operations include three tasks: provide support in response to a disaster, support civil law enforcement, and provide other support as required. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) Note: Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives weapons and explosive ordnance disposal support provided in civil support are tasks addressed elsewhere in the AUTL: ART 6.9.5 (Conduct Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosives Consequence Management) discusses the coordination of essential services and activities required to manage and mitigate damage resulting from the use of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons or the release of toxic industrial materials or contaminants. ART 6.12.8.5 (Provide Explosive Ordnance Disposal Support to Civil Authorities) addresses assistance to include providing explosive ordnance disposal service when requested by local, state, or federal authorities in the interest of public safety. 7-24 FM 7-15, C2 7 July 2010 ART 7.0: Full Spectrum Operations, Tactical Mission Tasks, and Operational Themes ART 6.12.8.6 (Provide Specific Training to Personnel on Explosive Ordnance Disposal) addresses training for military personnel, federal agencies, and public officials involved with civil emergency preparedness, law enforcement, and fire protection as requested. ART 7.4.1 PROVIDE SUPPORT IN RESPONSE TO DISASTER OR TERRORIST ATTACK 7-69. Disaster relief operations focus on recovery of critical infrastructure after natural or man-made disasters. Humanitarian relief focuses on the well-being of supported populations. Both normally occur simultaneously. In the case of a disaster, state, and local authorities are responsible for restoring essential services. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.4.1.1 PROVIDE DISASTER RELIEF 7-70. Disaster relief restores or recreates essential infrastructure. It includes establishing and maintaining the minimum safe working conditions, less security measures, necessary to protect relief workers and the affected population. Disaster relief allows effective humanitarian relief and creates conditions for long-term recovery. It may involve consultation on and provision of emergency medical treatment and evacuation; repairing or demolishing damaged structures; restoring or building bridges, roads, and airfields; and removing debris from supply routes and relief sites. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) Note: Disaster relief includes the submissions of military assistance to civilian disaster organizations, natural disaster relief, oil and hazardous substances incident or emergency, public health emergency, as well as technological or man-made disaster relief. ART 7.4.1.2 PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN RELIEF 7-71. Humanitarian relief focuses on lifesaving measures that alleviate the immediate needs of a population in crisis. It often includes providing medical support, food, water, medicine, clothing, blankets, shelter, and heating or cooking fuels. In some cases, it involves transporting affected people from a disaster area. Civilian relief agencies, government and nongovernmental, are best suited to provide this type of relief. Army forces conducting humanitarian relief usually facilitate civil relief efforts. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.4.2 PROVIDE SUPPORT TO CIVIL LAW ENFORCEMENT 7-72. Support to domestic civil law enforcement involves activities related to the Department of Justice’s counterterrorism activities, counterdrug activities, military assistance during civil disturbances, and general support. Army support involves providing resources, training, or augmentation. Federal military forces remain under the military chain of command while supporting civil law enforcement. The supported law enforcement agency coordinates Army forces activities per appropriate civil laws and interagency agreements. Army National Guard units in state status can be a particularly useful military resource. They may be able to provide assistance to civil authorities when federal units cannot due to the Posse Comitatus Act. Title 10 U.S. Code prohibits the military from directly participating in arrests, searches, seizures, or other similar activities unless authorized by law. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) Note: Support to civil law enforcement includes border protection enforcement, combating terrorism, critical infrastructure protection as well as Department of Defense support to counterdrug operations. Army missions related to supporting civil law enforcement in counterdrug operations are discussed under ART 7.6.1.5 (Provide Military Support to Counterdrug Efforts). 7 July 2010 FM 7-15, C2 7-25 Chapter 7 ART 7.4.2.1 SUPPORT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE COUNTERTERRORISM ACTIVITIES 7-73. When directed by the President, Army forces may provide assistance to the Department of Justice in the areas of transportation, equipment, training, and personnel. When terrorists pose an imminent threat, Army forces may be used to counter these threats. Army forces may also support crisis management. Crisis management of a terrorist incident includes measures to resolve a situation and investigate a criminal case for prosecution under federal law. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is the lead agency and has responsibility for crisis management within the United States. Army forces may provide specialized or technical capabilities to assist in defusing or resolving a terrorist crisis. Support of crisis management includes opening lines of communications for military assistance, evacuating casualties, executing reconnaissance, and decontaminating or assessing the effects of weapons of mass destruction. In the aftermath of a terrorist incident, Army forces may be involved in consequence management activities. These activities include casualty and medical assistance, evaluation and repair of damage to structures and utilities, explosive ordnance disposal, and mortuary affairs. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.4.2.2 CONDUCT CIVIL DISTURBANCE OPERATIONS 7-74. Army forces assist civil authorities in restoring law and order when state and local law enforcement agencies are unable to control civil disturbances. The Army National Guard is the first military responder during most civil disturbance situations. It usually remains on state active-duty status throughout the operation. When conditions of domestic violence and disorder endanger life and property to the extent that state law enforcement agencies, to include the Army National Guard, cannot suppress violence and restore law and order, the President may federalize Army National Guard units under Title 10, U.S. Code, Chapter 15. The President may use federalized Army National Guard and federal forces to restore law and order. Restrictions may be placed on federal military forces either in the executive order directing their use or through the rules for the use of force outlined in the Department of Defense Civil Disturbance Plan. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.4.2.3 PROVIDE GENERAL SUPPORT TO CIVIL LAW ENFORCEMENT 7-75. Provide limited military support to law enforcement agencies. Department of Defense may direct Army forces to provide training to federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement agencies. Such assistance may include training in the operation and maintenance of military equipment. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.4.3 PROVIDE OTHER SUPPORT AS REQUIRED 7-76. Community assistance is a broad range of activities that provide support and maintain a strong connection between the military and civilian communities. Community assistance activities provide effective means of projecting a positive military image, provide training opportunities, and enhance the relationship between Army forces and the American public. They should fulfill community needs that would not otherwise be met. Community assistance activities can enhance individual and unit combat readiness. Army assistance to the community can include air ambulance support, search and rescue activities, firefighting capability, explosive ordnance disposal, emergency or broad-based medical care, wildlife and domestic animal management, assistance in safety and traffic control, emergency snow removal, temporary supplemental housing for the displaced or disadvantaged, and postal augmentation.

Planning support provided to law enforcement agencies must take into account the organization’s mission, current goals, structure or chain of command, measures of success, and relationships with other government agencies or countries. Planning support provided to host nations is similar to that provided to domestic law enforcement agencies. However, the host-nation culture, historical perspectives, political climate, and economic conditions are also considered. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.1.5.4 Provide Logistic Support to Counterdrug Efforts 7-117. Army forces can assist law enforcement agencies or host nations during their conduct of counterdrug operations with logistic management and execution. This includes transportation, maintenance, engineer design and construction, use of facilities, equipment loans, or military working dog support. Army forces can provide supplies and field services directly, if authorized, or assist other agencies in procuring and managing them from other sources. Commanders who assist law enforcement with transportation of evidence, seized property, or contraband ensure a law enforcement officer accompanies the shipment to maintain continuity of the chain of custody. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) 7 July 2010 FM 7-15, C2 7-33 Chapter 7 ART 7.6.1.5.5 Provide Training Support to Counterdrug Efforts 7-118. Training support to law enforcement agencies and host nations includes basic military skills, such as basic marksmanship, patrolling, mission planning, medical, and survival skills. Commanders provide support using a mix of mobile training teams; participation in operational planning groups, joint or combined exercises, institutional training, noninstitutional training, and training simulations; and extended training service specialists. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.1.5.6 Provide Manpower Support to Counterdrug Efforts 7-119. Army forces may provide various individuals or units to support interagency and host-nation counterdrug efforts. Categories of manpower support are eradication, administrative—including staff judge advocate officers, legal specialists, and accounting specialists—linguist, liaison officer, inspection, military police, and intelligence analyst. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.1.5.7 Provide Research, Development, and Acquisition Support to Counterdrug Efforts 7-120. The Army Counterdrug Research, Development, and Acquisition Office makes military research, development, and acquisition efforts available to law enforcement agencies. It informs them of new technical capabilities that have possible law enforcement application. It can also assist them in contracting and procuring technical equipment. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.2 CONDUCT LIMITED INTERVENTIONS 7-121. Limited interventions are executed to achieve a clearly defined end state, limited in scope. Corresponding limitations are imposed on the supporting operations and size of the forces involved. These operations may be phased but are not intended to become campaigns. Although limited interventions are confined in terms of end state and forces, their execution may be lengthy. Joint task forces usually conduct these limited interventions. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) ART 7.6.2.1 PERFORM NONCOMBATANT EVACUATION OPERATIONS 7-122. Noncombatant evacuation operations relocate threatened civilian noncombatants from locations in a host nation to secure areas. Normally, these operations involve U.S. citizens whose lives are in danger, either from the threat of hostilities or from a natural disaster. They may also include host-nation citizens and third-country nationals. Army forces, normally as part of a joint task force, conduct noncombatant evacuation operations to assist and support the Department of State. Noncombatant evacuation operations usually involve swift insertions of a force, temporary occupation of an objective, and a planned withdrawal upon accomplishment of the mission. This operation can occur in three environments: permissive, uncertain, or hostile. The environment in which a noncombatant evacuation operation occurs can quickly change from one to another with little warning. The commander prepares to operate in all three environments. This task includes sustainment functions involving emergency medical treatment, transportation, administrative processing, and coordination with the Department of State and other agencies involved in the evacuation. Task organization for noncombatant evacuation operations is based on the operational environment in which the action is performed. However, since the environment can change rapidly, the permissive form of noncombatant evacuation operations can become uncertain or hostile. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.2.2 CONDUCT A STRIKE 7-123. Strikes are attacks conducted to damage or destroy an objective or capability or to compel a hostile government or force to defer from taking hostile actions. Strikes are usually planned and executed as part of or in support of a joint operation. (JP 3-0) (USJFCOM JWFC) ART 7.6.2.3 CONDUCT A RAID 7-124. A raid is an attack, usually small scale, involving a swift entry into hostile territory to secure information, confuse the enemy, or destroy installations. It usually ends with a planned withdrawal from 7-34 FM 7-15, C2 7 July 2010 ART 7.0: Full Spectrum Operations, Tactical Mission Tasks, and Operational Themes the objective area upon mission accomplishment. Raids have narrowly defined purposes. They require both detailed intelligence and deliberate planning. Raids may destroy key enemy installations and facilities, capture or free prisoners, or disrupt enemy command and control or other important systems. (FM 3-90) (USACAC) ART 7.6.2.4 CONDUCT A SHOW OF FORCE 7-125. Shows of force are flexible deterrence options designed to demonstrate U.S. resolve. They involve increasing the visibility of U.S. forces to defuse a situation that, if allowed to continue, may be detrimental to national interests or objectives. The United States conducts shows of force for three reasons: to bolster or reassure allies, deter potential aggressors, and gain or increase influence. Shows of force demonstrate a credible and specific threat to an aggressor or potential aggressor. They involve increasing the visibility of U.S. forces in the eyes of the target audience through establishing an area presence and performing exercises and demonstrations. Presence patrols executed by small tactical units are one technique of conducting shows of force. Although actual combat is not desired, shows of force can rapidly and unexpectedly escalate. Therefore, units assigned a show of force mission assume that combat is probable and prepare accordingly. All actions ordinarily associated with the projection of a force to conduct combat operations pertain to show of force deployments. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.2.5 CONDUCT FOREIGN HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE 7-126. Foreign humanitarian assistance operations occur outside the United States and its territories. Army forces usually conduct them to relieve or reduce the results of natural or man-made disasters before, during, or after the event. They also relieve conditions—such as pain, disease, hunger, or privation—that present a serious threat to life or loss of property. Army forces supplement or complement efforts of host- nation civil authorities or other agencies that provide assistance. Army forces participate in foreign humanitarian assistance operations that may be unilateral, multinational, or United Nations-coordinated responses. Foreign humanitarian assistance is limited in scope and duration. It focuses exclusively on prompt aid to resolve an immediate crisis. Long-term activities designed to support full recovery and a return to predisaster conditions normally will become part of a combatant commander’s theater engagement plan. In such cases, a foreign humanitarian assistance operation transitions to a stability operation. (FM 3- 07) (USACAC) No. Scale Measure Unit surveyed the disaster area; prioritized needs; conducted medical assessments; and provided medical services, communications, shelter, subsistence, water, 01 Yes/No engineering support, transportation, fire fighting, mass care, urban search and rescue, hazardous materials response, and energy distribution. 02 Percent Of mission with host-nation health provider participation. 03 Percent Of missions coordinated with command civil affairs and surgeons guidance.

ART 7.6.2.6 ENFORCE SANCTIONS AND EXCLUSION ZONES 7-127. Enforcement of sanctions includes a broad range of possible missions. Commanders must understand that actions to enforce sanctions, while endorsed by the United Nations Security Council, have traditionally been considered acts of war and should posture their forces accordingly. (FM 3-07.31) (TRADOC JADD) 7 July 2010 FM 7-15, C2 7-35 Chapter 7 No. Scale Measure 01 Yes/No Unit established checkpoints and control measures and occupied key terrain. 02 Yes/No Unit provided sufficient force to ensure deterrence. 03 Yes/No Unit established appropriate rules of engagement. 04 Yes/No Unit supported with information operations. 05 Yes/No Unit established communications with controlling authorities. 06 Yes/No Unit established a quick reaction force. 07 Yes/No Unit ensured coordination and negotiation mechanisms were established. ART 7.6.3 CONDUCT PEACE OPERATIONS 7-128. Peace operations is a broad term that encompasses multiagency and multinational crisis response and limited contingency operations involving all instruments of national power with military missions to contain conflict, redress the peace, and shape the environment to support reconciliation and rebuilding and facilitate the transition to legitimate governance. Peace operations include peacekeeping, peace enforcement, peacemaking, peace building, and conflict prevention efforts. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) No. Scale Measure 01 Yes/No Unit physically occupied key terrain to establish control over urban and rural areas. 02 Yes/No Unit separated belligerent forces. 03 Yes/No Unit disarmed, demobilized, and reintegrated belligerent forces. 04 Yes/No Unit controlled weapons and borders. 05 Yes/No Unit regulated movement of persons and goods across borders. 06 Yes/No Unit secured key sites. 07 Yes/No Unit established visible control measures and made them known to the local population. 08 Yes/No Unit established public security and freedom of movement. 09 Yes/No Unit established protected areas and secure bases. ART 7.6.3.1 CONDUCT PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS 7-129. Peacekeeping operations are military operations undertaken with the consent of all major parties to a dispute. They are designed to monitor and facilitate implementation of agreements (cease fire, truce, or other such agreements) and support diplomatic efforts to reach a long-term political settlement. Peacekeeping operations usually involve observing, monitoring, or supervising and assisting parties to a dispute. To achieve their objectives, Army forces conducting peacekeeping operations rely on the legitimacy acknowledged by all major belligerents and international or regional organizations. They use or threaten the use of force only in self-defense or as a last resort. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) No. Scale Measure 01 Yes/No Unit supervised disengagement of belligerent forces. 02 Yes/No Unit monitored exchange of prisoners of war. 03 Yes/No Unit developed confidence-building measures between host-nation belligerents. 04 Yes/No Unit investigated alleged breaches of agreements. 05 Yes/No Unit supported and sustained confidence-building measures among belligerents. 06 Time To transfer monitor requirements to host-nation security institutions. ART 7.6.3.1.1 Conduct Observation 7-130. Observation missions are performed primarily by unarmed military observers but may also be performed by peacekeeping forces. In either case, observers forces help ensure that parties to the dispute follow the agreements. (FM 3-07.31) (TRADOC JADD) 7-36 FM 7-15, C2 7 July 2010 ART 7.0: Full Spectrum Operations, Tactical Mission Tasks, and Operational Themes No. Scale Measure Unit established observation posts, mounted and dismounted patrols, and aerial 01 Yes/No reconnaissance.

To verify the storage or destruction of certain categories of military equipment specified 07 Time in the relevant agreements. ART 7.6.3.1.2 Supervise Cease-Fires, Withdrawals, and Disengagements 7-131. Lightly armed forces normally perform supervision and assistance missions. The force undertaking these tasks requires large service support organizations, equipment, and finances. In addition to those tasks being performed by military observers in observation missions, peacekeeping forces may perform other tasks when they are within the scope of the military mission, such as supervising cease fires. (FM 3-07.31) (TRADOC JADD) No. Scale Measure Unit established observation posts, mounted and dismounted patrols, and aerial 01 Yes/No reconnaissance. 02 Yes/No Unit deployed on the territory of the disputing parties between contending parties. 03 Yes/No Unit supervised demilitarized zone or buffer zone. 04 Yes/No Unit observed and reported on the disputing parties’ compliance with a cease-fire. 05 Yes/No Unit investigated alleged cease-fire violations, boundary incidents, and complaints.

Unit assisted in prisoner of war exchanges between the parties to include 09 Yes/No transportation. ART 7.6.3.2 CONDUCT PEACE BUILDING OPERATIONS 7-132. Peace building operations are post-conflict actions, predominantly diplomatic and economic, that strengthen and rebuild governmental infrastructure and institutions to avoid a relapse into conflict. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) Note: The tasks in ART 7.3 (Conduct Stability Operations) describe the tasks that pertain to peace building. ART 7.6.3.3 CONDUCT PEACEMAKING OPERATIONS 7-133. Peacemaking is the process of diplomacy, mediation, negotiation, or other forms of peaceful settlements that arranges an end to a dispute and resolves issues that led to it. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) Note: Selective tasks in ART 7.6.1 (Conduct Military Engagements) can support peacemaking operations. 7 July 2010 FM 7-15, C2 7-37 Chapter 7 ART 7.6.3.4 CONDUCT PEACE ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS 7-134. Peace enforcement operations are the application of military force, or the threat of its use, normally pursuant to international authorization, to compel compliance with resolutions or sanctions designed to maintain or restore peace and order. Unlike peacekeeping operations, peace enforcement operations do not require the consent of all parties. Peace enforcement operations maintain or restore peace and support diplomatic efforts to reach a long-term political settlement. Army forces assigned a peace enforcement mission must be able to apply sufficient combat power for self-defense and to perform tasks forcibly. Units must also be prepared to transition to peacekeeping operations. Peace enforcement operations normally include one or more of six subordinate operations: forcible separation of belligerents, establishment and supervision of protected areas, sanction and exclusion zone enforcement, movement denial and guarantee, restoration and maintenance of order, and protection of humanitarian assistance. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) No. Scale Measure 01 Yes/No Unit enforced ceasefires. 02 Yes/No Unit identified and neutralized potential spoilers. 03 Yes/No Unit established and controlled buffers, including demilitarized zones. 04 Yes/No Unit supported and enforced political, military, and economic terms arrangements.

ART 7.6.3.5 CONDUCT CONFLICT PREVENTION OPERATIONS 7-135. Conflict prevention consists of actions taken before a predictable crisis to prevent or limit violence, deter parties, and reach an agreement before armed hostilities begin. Conflict prevention often involves diplomatic initiatives. It also includes efforts designed to reform a country’s security sector and make it more accountable to civilian control. Conflict prevention may require deploying forces to contain a dispute or prevent it from escalating into hostilities. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) No. Scale Measure 01 Yes/No Military activities were tailored to meet the political and situational demands. Military efforts had the desired result in achieving the mission specifically assigned to 02 Yes/No the force.

Irregular warfare is a violent struggle among state and nonstate actors for legitimacy and influence over a population. U.S. Army forces operations grouped under irregular warfare are foreign internal 7-38 FM 7-15, C2 7 July 2010 ART 7.0: Full Spectrum Operations, Tactical Mission Tasks, and Operational Themes defense, support for insurgencies, counterinsurgency, combating terrorism, and unconventional warfare. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) ART 7.6.4.1 CONDUCT FOREIGN INTERNAL DEFENSE OPERATIONS 7-137. Foreign internal defense is participation by civilian and military agencies of a government in any of the action programs taken by another government or other designated organization to free and protect its society from subversion, lawlessness, and insurgency. Foreign internal defense missions are applicable to a wide variety of operational environments. U.S. policy currently deals with threats through the indirect use of military force in concert with the diplomatic, informational, military, and economic instruments of national power. Direct use of military force is the exception rather than the rule. This approach relies on supporting efforts of the government of the nation in which the problem is developing. (FM 3-05.202) (USAJFKSWCS) ART 7.6.4.1.1 Provide Indirect Support to Foreign Internal Defense 7-138. Indirect support builds strong national infrastructures through economic and military capabilities that contribute to self-sufficiency. This can include unit exchange programs, personnel exchange programs, individual exchange programs, and combination programs. (FM 3-05.202) (USAJFKSWCS) No. Scale Measure 01 Yes/No Commander understood authorities, funding, and restrictions. 02 Yes/No Unit developed measures of effectiveness to ensure objectives were met. 03 Yes/No Unit acquired mission approval. 04 Yes/No Unit coordinated plan with host nation. 05 Yes/No Unit facilitated transitions to civil authorities or other agency. 06 Time To identify national objectives. 07 Time To evaluate host-nation capabilities. 08 Time To develop a plan to provide required assistance to host nation. ART 7.6.4.1.2 Provide Direct Support to Foreign Internal Defense (Not Involving Combat Operations) 7-139.

ART 7.6.4.1.3 Conduct Combat Operations in Support to Foreign Internal Defense 7-140. The President must approve combat operations. Combat operations are a temporary solution until host-nation forces can stabilize the situation and provide security for the populace. Emphasis should be placed on host-nation forces in the forefront during these operations to maintain host-nation legitimacy with the population. Combat operations can include counterinsurgency operations. (FM 3-05.202) (USAJFKSWCS) 7 July 2010 FM 7-15, C2 7-39 Chapter 7 No. Scale Measure 01 Yes/No Commander understood authorities, funding, and restrictions. 02 Yes/No Unit developed measures of effectiveness to ensure objectives were met. 03 Yes/No Unit acquired mission approval. 04 Yes/No Unit coordinated plan with host nation. 05 Yes/No Unit facilitated transitions to civil authorities or other agency. 06 Time To identify national objectives. 07 Time To evaluate host-nation capabilities. 08 Time To develop a plan to provide required assistance to host nation. ART 7.6.4.2 PROVIDE SUPPORT TO INSURGENCIES 7-141. Insurgencies are movements organized to overthrow a constituted government through subversion and armed conflict. By order of the President, Army forces support insurgencies that oppose regimes that threaten U.S. interests or regional stability. While any Army force can be tasked to support an insurgency, Army special operations forces usually receive these missions. The training, organization, and regional focus of Army special operations forces make them well suited for these operations. Army forces supporting insurgencies may provide logistic and training support. They can, but normally do not, conduct combat operations. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.4.3 CONDUCT COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS 7-142. Counterinsurgency is those military, paramilitary, political, economic, psychological, and civic actions taken by a government to defeat insurgency. In counterinsurgency, host-nation forces and their partners operate to defeat armed resistance, reduce passive opposition, and establish or reestablish the legitimacy of the host-nation government. Counterinsurgency is the predominant joint operation in Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. (FM 3-24) (USACAC) ART 7.6.4.4 COMBAT TERRORISM 7-143. Terrorism is the calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear. It is intended to coerce or intimidate governments or societies in pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or ideological. Enemies who cannot compete with Army forces conventionally often turn to terrorist tactics. Terrorist attacks often create a disproportionate effect on even the most capable conventional forces. Tactics used by terrorists range from arson to the use of weapons of mass destruction. Army forces routinely conduct operations to deter or defeat these attacks. Offensively-oriented operations are categorized as; defensively-oriented operations are antiterrorism. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) Note: This task branch only addresses counterterrorism operations. ART 6.6 (Apply Antiterrorism Measures) addresses antiterrorism measures. ART 7.6.4.5 CONDUCT COUNTERTERRORISM OPERATIONS 7-144. Counterterrorism are operations that include the offensive measures taken to prevent, deter, preempt, and respond to terrorism. By law, the counterterrorism mission is assigned to designated special operations forces that are organized and trained to combat terrorism. Those forces conduct counterterrorism outside the territory of the United States. Relevant National Security Decision Directives, National Security Directives, contingency plans, and other relevant classified documents address sensitive and compartmentalized counterterrorism programs. Commanders who employ conventional forces against organized terrorist forces operating in their AO are conducting conventional offensive operations, not counterterrorism operations. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) 7-40 FM 7-15, C2 7 July 2010 ART 7.0: Full Spectrum Operations, Tactical Mission Tasks, and Operational Themes ART 7.6.4.6 CONDUCT UNCONVENTIONAL WARFARE 7-145. Unconventional warfare is a broad spectrum of military and paramilitary operations, normally of long duration, predominantly conducted through, with, or by host-nation or surrogate forces that are organized, trained, equipped, supported, and directed in varying degrees by an external source. It includes, but is not limited to, guerrilla warfare, subversion, sabotage, intelligence activities, and unconventional assisted recovery. Unconventional warfare is operations conducted by, with, or through irregular forces in support of a resistance movement, insurgency, or conventional military operations.
