Basic terms, their definitions, and their proponents.................................. xiv viii FM 7-15, C5 9 December 2010 Chapter 6 ≠ART 6.0: The Protection Warfighting Function The protection warfighting function is the related tasks and systems that preserve the force so the commander can apply maximum combat power. Preserving the force includes protecting personnel (combatants and noncombatants), physical assets, and information of the United States and multinational military and civilian partners. The protection warfighting function facilitates the commander’s ability to maintain the force’s integrity and combat power. Protection determines the degree to which potential threats can disrupt operations and counters or mitigates those threats. Emphasis on protection increases during preparation and continues throughout execution. Protection is a continuing activity; it integrates all protection capabilities to safeguard bases, secure routes, and protect forces. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) 9 December 2010 FM 7-15, C5 6-1 Chapter 6 SECTION I – ART 6.1: EMPLOY AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE 6-1. The air defense system protects the force from missile attack, air attack, and aerial surveillance by any of the following: interceptor missiles, ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, conventional fixed- and rotary- wing aircraft, and unmanned aircraft systems. It prevents enemies from interdicting friendly forces, while freeing commanders to synchronize movement and firepower. All members of the combined arms team perform air defense tasks; however, ground-based air defense artillery units execute most Army air defense operations. ART 6.1 includes fires at aerial platforms by both dedicated air defense systems and nondedicated weapon systems. (FM 3-27.10) (USASMDC) ART 6.1.1 PROCESS TACTICAL AERIAL PLATFORMS 6-2. Provide advanced warning for all aerial platforms, select targets, and match the appropriate response to tactical aerial platforms including tactical ballistic missile, taking into account operational requirements and capabilities of systems and units. (FM 44-100) (USAADASCH) No. Scale Measure Unit detected, located, and identified all tactical aerial platforms in area of operations 01 Yes/No (AO). 02 Yes/No Unit developed and refined early warning plan. 03 Yes/No Unit employed all available means to detect tactical aerial platforms. 04 Yes/No Unit received advanced warning of aerial platforms. 6-2 FM 7-15, C5 9 December 2010 ART 6.0: The Protection Warfighting Function No. Scale Measure 05 Yes/No Unit processed advanced warning of aerial platforms. 06 Yes/No Unit transmitted advanced warning of aerial platforms. 07 Time In advance of air attack that advanced warning was provided in AO. 08 Percent Of enemy offensive air sorties against which friendly air defense assets are assigned. 09 Percent Of enemy air attacks in AO for which early warning provided. Of force in AO provided early warning of incoming air threat in time to allow them to 10 Percent initiate passive air defense. 11 Percent Of time that early warning system is operational.

During deployment, commanders must determine who will be providing personnel recovery (PR) coverage for their arriving forces. Until commanders can build sufficient combat power to provide PR for their forces, other forces in theater must provide PR support. Build combat power through reception, staging, onward movement, and integration (RSOI). Early and continuous connectivity with the theater PR architecture enables commanders to report isolated, missing, detained, or captured (IMDC) incidents during deployment. This also allows commanders to report unit status when ready to assume responsibility for assigned PR missions. (FM 3-50.1) (USACAC) No. Scale Measure 01 Yes/No PR capability transitioned through the RSOI process. Early deployment of PR capability was planned for in the time-phased force and 02 Yes/No deployment data. 03 Yes/No Procedures for relief in place of the PR capability were developed.

An important task is the transfer of PR responsibility, including the key task of transferring lessons learned gathered during after action reviews. When units redeploy to CONUS, PR responsibility for the AO transfers to incoming forces. If redeploying to another AO, units integrate into that AO’s established PR architecture or build one if it does not exist. (FM 3-50.1) (USACAC) No. Scale Measure Unit ensured PR capabilities were available until all forces, including contractors and 01 Yes/No Army civilians, have redeployed. 02 Yes/No Unit ensured counterintelligence debriefing of recovered personnel.

Conduct unassisted personnel recovery (PR) to achieve own recovery without outside assistance. An unassisted recovery typically involves an evasion effort by isolated, missing, detained, or captured (IMDC) personnel to get back to friendly forces, or to a point where they can be recovered via another method. While the code of conduct requires IMDC personnel to make every effort to evade or escape, commanders must strive to recover these personnel via one or a combination of the other methods.

ARSOF PR missions are conducted in support of their own operations, when directed by the joint task force commander to support a PR operation, when the threat to the recovery force is high enough to warrant the conduct of a special operation, and when ARSOF is the only force available. Detailed planning, rehearsals, and in-depth intelligence analysis characterize ARSOF PR missions. This ART includes unassisted evasion and nonconventional assisted recovery.
