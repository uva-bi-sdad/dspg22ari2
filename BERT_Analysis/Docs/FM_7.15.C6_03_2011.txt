Direct fire is inherent in maneuver, as is close combat. The function includes tasks associated with force projection related to gaining a positional advantage over an enemy. One example is moving forces to execute a large-scale air or airborne assault. Another is deploying forces to intermediate staging bases in preparation for an offensive. Maneuver is the employment of forces in the operational area through movement in combination with fires to achieve a position of advantage in respect to the enemy in order to accomplish the mission. Maneuver is the means by which commanders mass the effects of combat power to achieve surprise, shock, and momentum. Effective maneuver requires close coordination with fires. Movement is necessary to disperse and displace the force as a whole or in part when maneuvering. Both tactical and operational maneuver require logistic support. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) 18 March 2011 FM 7-15, C6 1-1 Chapter 1 SECTION I – ART 1.1: PERFORM TACTICAL ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH FORCE PROJECTION AND DEPLOYMENT 1-1. ∞Force projection is the military element of national power that systemically and rapidly moves military forces in response to requirements of full spectrum operations. Force projection demonstrates the ability of the nation to alert, mobilize, and rapidly deploy combat forces and sustainment units (regular Army, the Army National Guard/Army National Guard of the United States, and the United States Army Reserve forces) to operate effectively anywhere in the world. The ability to rapidly deploy Army forces with sufficient depth and strength to sustain multiple, simultaneous operations contributes to mission accomplishment.

ART 1.2.1 CONDUCT ONE OF THE FIVE FORMS OF MANEUVER 1-15. The forms of maneuver are envelopment, turning movement, infiltration, penetration, and frontal attack. While normally combined, each form of maneuver attacks the enemy differently. A single operation may contain several forms of offensive maneuver. For example, a frontal attack to clear a security area may be followed by a penetration to create a gap in the defenses. This could be followed by an envelopment to destroy the first line of defense. Each form of maneuver poses different challenges for attackers and different dangers for defenders. Commanders determine the form of maneuver to use by analyzing the factors of mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, civil considerations. (FM 3-90) (USACAC) ART 1.2.1.1 CONDUCT AN ENVELOPMENT 1-16. An envelopment is a form of maneuver in which an attacking force seeks to avoid the principal enemy defenses by seizing objectives to the enemy rear to destroy the enemy in his current positions. At the tactical level, envelopments focus on seizing terrain, destroying specific enemy forces, and interdicting enemy withdrawal routes. Envelopments avoid the enemy front where enemy forces are protected and can easily concentrate fires. Single envelopments maneuver against one enemy flank; double envelopments maneuver against both. A vertical envelopment (an air assault or airborne operation) creates an assailable flank by arriving from an unexpected direction. An envelopment may result in an encirclement. (FM 3-90) (USACAC) Note: Airborne, air assault, and amphibious operations are tactical aspects of forcible entry operations that involve seizing and holding a military lodgment in the face of armed opposition. Joint force commanders conduct forcible entry operations at the operational level. (See JP 3-18.) Forcible entry operation tasks are addressed in the Universal Joint Task List (UJTL). ART 1.2.1.1.1 Conduct an Airborne Assault into Area of Operations 1-17. An airborne assault secures a defendable airhead from which to conduct lodgment activities or to seize key terrain to block or deny its use by the enemy. This mission begins when paratroopers and equipment exit the aircraft by parachute or are air landed. The mission ends when all elements of the relevant airborne echelon are delivered to the objective area and the assault objective has been seized. (FM 3-90) (USACAC) Note: Marshaling forces for airborne operations is addressed as ART 1.3.1.3 (Marshal Forces to Conduct an Airborne Assault).

ART 1.2.1.1.2 Conduct an Air Assault 1-18. An air assault secures a defendable airhead or other key terrain from which to conduct lodgment activities or follow-on tactical operations. The mission ends when all elements of the relevant air assault echelon are delivered to the objective area and the assault objective has been seized. (FM 90-4) (USAIS) Note: ART 1.2.1.1.2 does not include air traffic control. Air traffic control is addressed under ART 5.1.3.1.7 (Control Tactical Airspace). ART 1.2.1.1.2 does not include efforts to improve the landing zone. Landing zone improvement is addressed under ART 1.6.2 (Enhance Movement and Maneuver). Pickup zone operations are addressed as ART 1.3.1.4 (Conduct Pickup Zone Operations). The air movement phase of air assault operations is addressed as ART 4.1.2.3.2 (Move by Air). Tasks for the ground tactical phase of air assault operations duplicate missions contained elsewhere in this chapter. Scale and measures assigned to ART 1.2.1.1.1 apply. ART 1.2.1.1.3 Conduct an Amphibious Assault 1-19. The Army conducts an amphibious assault as a member of the landing force in conducting one of four forcible entry operations. It may also conduct forcible entry operations via airborne, air assault or a combination of any or all of these forcible entry techniques. An amphibious assault secures a defendable beachhead from which to conduct lodgment activities. This mission begins when Soldiers and equipment leave the ships that bring them to the amphibious objective area and transfer to the landing craft that will deliver them to the beach. The mission ends when all elements of the amphibious force are delivered onto the beachhead and the assault objective has been seized. (JP 3-02) (USJFCOM JWFC) Note: Army forces follow joint doctrine and Marine Corps doctrinal publications when tasked to conduct amphibious operations. Scale and measures assigned to ART 1.2.1.1.1 apply. ART 1.2.1.1.4 Conduct an Encirclement 1-20. Encirclements are operations where one force loses its freedom of maneuver because an opposing force is able to isolate it by controlling all ground lines of communications. (FM 3-90) (USACAC) ART 1.2.1.2 CONDUCT A TURNING MOVEMENT 1-21. A turning movement is a maneuver in which an attacking force seeks to avoid the enemy’s principal defensive positions by seizing objectives to the enemy rear and causing the enemy to move out of his current positions or divert major forces to meet the threat. (FM 3-90) (USACAC) ART 1.2.1.3 CONDUCT AN INFILTRATION 1-22. An infiltration is a maneuver in which an attacking force conducts undetected movement through or into an area occupied by enemy forces to occupy a position of advantage while exposing only small elements to enemy defensive fires. (FM 3-90) (USACAC) Note: Infiltration is also a tactical march technique used within a friendly territory to move forces in small groups at extended or irregular intervals. (See FM 3-90.) 18 March 2011 FM 7-15, C6 1-11 Chapter 1 ART 1.2.1.4 CONDUCT A PENETRATION 1-23. A penetration is a maneuver in which an attacking force seeks to rupture enemy defenses on a narrow front to disrupt the defensive system. Commanders direct penetrations when enemy flanks are not assailable or time does not permit another form of maneuver. Successful penetrations create assailable flanks and provide access to enemy sustainment areas. (FM 3-90) (USACAC) ART 1.2.1.5 CONDUCT A FRONTAL ATTACK 1-24. A frontal attack is a maneuver in which the attacking force seeks to destroy a weaker enemy force or fix a larger enemy force in place over a broad front. At the tactical level, an attacking force can use a frontal attack to overrun a weaker enemy force rapidly. A frontal attack strikes the enemy across a wide front and over the most direct approaches. Commanders normally use it when they possess overwhelming combat power and the enemy is at a clear disadvantage. (FM 3-90) (USACAC) ART 1.2.2 EMPLOY COMBAT FORMATIONS 1-25. Use an ordered arrangement of troops and vehicles for a specific purpose. Commanders use one of seven different combat formations: column, line, echelon (left or right), box, diamond, wedge, and vee.

ART 1.6.1.3 CONDUCT GAP CROSSING OPERATIONS 1-70. A gap crossing operation is a combined arms operation to project combat power across a linear obstacle. The obstacle is linear in that it creates a line crossing all or a significant portion of the area of operations. The obstacle can be wet gap (water obstacle) or dry gap that is too wide to overcome by self- bridging. The nature of the obstacle differentiates a gap crossing from a breaching operation. A wet gap crossing (river crossing) is also unique because the water obstacle is significantly large enough to prevent normal ground maneuver. A gap crossing generally requires special planning and support. Mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, civil considerations factors dictate the type of crossing (hasty, deliberate, or retrograde). Gap crossing generally includes preparing access and egress routes, completing a hydrographic survey (underwater obstacle detection or reduction), employing crossing means (bridging and rafts), and operating an engineer regulating point if required. This task is measured against a river crossing, the most difficult standard of gap crossing operation. Crossing fundamentals include surprise, extensive preparation, a flexible plan, traffic control, organization, and speed. Gap crossings may be conducted in support of combat maneuver or in support of lines of communication.

ART 1.6.1.3.1 Conduct Gap Crossing in Support of Combat Maneuver 1-71. Conduct gap crossing in support of combat maneuver includes both hasty and deliberate gap crossings and the majority of river crossing operations. It includes both those operations conducted primarily at the brigade combat team level and those conducted by the division or corps level organization. Those gap crossings conducted as a reduction method within a combined arms breaching operation are also included in this art, but since the primary focus of planning and preparation is on the breaching operation they are typically discussed as a part of the breaching operation rather than as a separate gap crossing operation in that context.

ART 1.6.1.3.2 Conduct Line of Communications Gap Crossing Support 1-72. Conduct line of communications (LOC) gap crossing support is not tactically focused, although it may clearly affect tactical operations. This support may provide the means for combat maneuver forces to move, but it is not directly in support of combat maneuver. As the title implies this is focused on ultimately using nonstandard bridging. Both assault and tactical bridging is designed to support the flow of traffic requirements (number of passes) of LOCs.

Civil support includes operations that address the consequences of natural or manmade disasters, accidents, and incidents within the United States and its territories. Army forces conduct civil support operations when the size and scope of events exceed the capabilities of domestic civilian agencies. The Army National Guard is often the first military force to respond on behalf of state authorities. Army civil support operations include three tasks: provide support in response to a disaster, support civil law enforcement, and provide other support as required. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) Note: Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives weapons and explosive ordnance disposal support provided in civil support are tasks addressed elsewhere in the AUTL: 18 March 2011 FM 7-15, C6 7-27 Chapter 7 ART 6.9.5 (Conduct Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosives Consequence Management) discusses the coordination of essential services and activities required to manage and mitigate damage resulting from the use of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons or the release of toxic industrial materials or contaminants.

Army forces conducting humanitarian relief usually facilitate civil relief efforts. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.4.2 PROVIDE SUPPORT TO CIVIL LAW ENFORCEMENT 7-78. Support to domestic civil law enforcement involves activities related to the Department of Justice’s counterterrorism activities, counterdrug activities, military assistance during civil disturbances, and general support. Army support involves providing resources, training, or augmentation. Federal military forces remain under the military chain of command while supporting civil law enforcement. The supported law enforcement agency coordinates Army forces activities per appropriate civil laws and interagency agreements. Army National Guard units in state status can be a particularly useful military resource. They may be able to provide assistance to civil authorities when federal units cannot due to the Posse Comitatus Act. Title 10 U.S. Code prohibits the military from directly participating in arrests, searches, seizures, or other similar activities unless authorized by law.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is the lead agency and has responsibility for crisis management within the United States. Army forces may provide specialized or technical capabilities to assist in defusing or resolving a terrorist crisis. Support of crisis management includes opening lines of communications for military assistance, evacuating casualties, executing reconnaissance, and decontaminating or assessing the effects of weapons of mass destruction. In the aftermath of a terrorist incident, Army forces may be involved in consequence management activities. These activities include casualty and medical assistance, evaluation and repair of damage to structures and utilities, explosive ordnance disposal, and mortuary affairs. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.4.2.2 CONDUCT CIVIL DISTURBANCE OPERATIONS 7-80. Army forces assist civil authorities in restoring law and order when state and local law enforcement agencies are unable to control civil disturbances. The Army National Guard is the first military responder during most civil disturbance situations. It usually remains on state active-duty status throughout the operation. When conditions of domestic violence and disorder endanger life and property to the extent that state law enforcement agencies, to include the Army National Guard, cannot suppress violence and restore law and order, the President may federalize Army National Guard units under Title 10, U.S. Code, Chapter 15. The President may use federalized Army National Guard and federal forces to restore law and order. Restrictions may be placed on federal military forces either in the executive order directing their use or through the rules for the use of force outlined in the Department of Defense Civil Disturbance Plan. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.4.2.3 PROVIDE GENERAL SUPPORT TO CIVIL LAW ENFORCEMENT 7-81. Provide limited military support to law enforcement agencies.

The Army participates in counterdrug operations under provisions of the national drug control strategy. Army forces may be employed in various operations to support other government agencies responsible for detecting, disrupting, interdicting, and destroying illicit drugs and the infrastructure (personnel, materiel, and distribution systems) of illicit drug-trafficking entities. When conducted inside the United States and its territories, they are civil support operations. When conducted outside the United States and its territories, counterdrug operations are considered stability operations. Army forces do not engage in direct action in counterdrug operations. Units that support counterdrug operations comply with U.S. and foreign legal limitations concerning the acquisition of information from civilians and the conduct of law enforcement activities. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.1.5.1 Support Detection and Monitoring of Drug Shipments 7-120. Provide aerial and ground reconnaissance to support counterdrug operations by law enforcement agencies. The goal is to provide early notification to—and, as necessary, prolonged tracking of—aerial and surface targets for appropriate law enforcement agencies. This support enables law enforcement agencies to intercept, search, and arrest traffickers, and seize illegal drugs and illegally obtained property. Aerial reconnaissance may be conducted with fixed- or rotary-wing aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems, or ground-based radars. Land reconnaissance may be executed by observation posts, patrols, ground surveillance radars, and remote ground sensors. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.1.5.2 Provide Command, Control, Communication, Computer, and Intelligence Support to Counterdrug Efforts 7-121. Army personnel and equipment may assist law enforcement agencies and host nations in designing, implementing, and integrating command, control, communication, computer, and intelligence systems. Army personnel support national and departmental drug operations and law enforcement agency analytical centers. In addition, Army forces provide liaison to law enforcement agencies and host nations to facilitate smooth and successful integration of military support. Army units and personnel provide intelligence support targeted at the full range of narcotics traffickers’ operations. The principal means of providing this support is through tactical analysis teams. These teams co-locate with the U.S. country team, support law enforcement agencies, and provide focused detection and monitoring of narcotics trafficking activities. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.1.5.3 Provide Planning Support to Counterdrug Efforts 7-122. Army personnel support counterdrug planning of both law enforcement agencies and host nations. Understanding the supported agency or host nation, including its culture and people, is critical. Planning support provided to law enforcement agencies must take into account the organization’s mission, current goals, structure or chain of command, measures of success, and relationships with other government agencies or countries. Planning support provided to host nations is similar to that provided to domestic law enforcement agencies. However, the host-nation culture, historical perspectives, political climate, and economic conditions are also considered. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.1.5.4 Provide Logistic Support to Counterdrug Efforts 7-123. Army forces can assist law enforcement agencies or host nations during their conduct of counterdrug operations with logistic management and execution. This includes transportation, maintenance, engineer design and construction, use of facilities, equipment loans, or military working dog support. Army forces can provide supplies and field services directly, if authorized, or assist other agencies in procuring and managing them from other sources. Commanders who assist law enforcement with transportation of evidence, seized property, or contraband ensure a law enforcement officer accompanies the shipment to maintain continuity of the chain of custody. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) 7-36 FM 7-15, C6 18 March 2011 ART 7.0: Full Spectrum Operations, Tactical Mission Tasks, and Operational Themes ART 7.6.1.5.5 Provide Training Support to Counterdrug Efforts 7-124. Training support to law enforcement agencies and host nations includes basic military skills, such as basic marksmanship, patrolling, mission planning, medical, and survival skills. Commanders provide support using a mix of mobile training teams; participation in operational planning groups, joint or combined exercises, institutional training, noninstitutional training, and training simulations; and extended training service specialists. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.1.5.6 Provide Manpower Support to Counterdrug Efforts 7-125. Army forces may provide various individuals or units to support interagency and host-nation counterdrug efforts. Categories of manpower support are eradication, administrative—including staff judge advocate officers, legal specialists, and accounting specialists—linguist, liaison officer, inspection, military police, and intelligence analyst. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.1.5.7 Provide Research, Development, and Acquisition Support to Counterdrug Efforts 7-126. The Army Counterdrug Research, Development, and Acquisition Office makes military research, development, and acquisition efforts available to law enforcement agencies. It informs them of new technical capabilities that have possible law enforcement application. It can also assist them in contracting and procuring technical equipment. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.2 CONDUCT LIMITED INTERVENTIONS 7-127. Limited interventions are executed to achieve a clearly defined end state, limited in scope. Corresponding limitations are imposed on the supporting operations and size of the forces involved. These operations may be phased but are not intended to become campaigns. Although limited interventions are confined in terms of end state and forces, their execution may be lengthy. Joint task forces usually conduct these limited interventions. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) ART 7.6.2.1 PERFORM NONCOMBATANT EVACUATION OPERATIONS 7-128. Noncombatant evacuation operations relocate threatened civilian noncombatants from locations in a host nation to secure areas. Normally, these operations involve U.S. citizens whose lives are in danger, either from the threat of hostilities or from a natural disaster. They may also include host-nation citizens and third-country nationals. Army forces, normally as part of a joint task force, conduct noncombatant evacuation operations to assist and support the Department of State. Noncombatant evacuation operations usually involve swift insertions of a force, temporary occupation of an objective, and a planned withdrawal upon accomplishment of the mission. This operation can occur in three environments: permissive, uncertain, or hostile. The environment in which a noncombatant evacuation operation occurs can quickly change from one to another with little warning. The commander prepares to operate in all three environments. This task includes sustainment functions involving emergency medical treatment, transportation, administrative processing, and coordination with the Department of State and other agencies involved in the evacuation. Task organization for noncombatant evacuation operations is based on the operational environment in which the action is performed. However, since the environment can change rapidly, the permissive form of noncombatant evacuation operations can become uncertain or hostile. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.2.2 CONDUCT A STRIKE 7-129. Strikes are attacks conducted to damage or destroy an objective or capability or to compel a hostile government or force to defer from taking hostile actions. Strikes are usually planned and executed as part of or in support of a joint operation. (JP 3-0) (USJFCOM JWFC) ART 7.6.2.3 CONDUCT A RAID 7-130. A raid is an attack, usually small scale, involving a swift entry into hostile territory to secure information, confuse the enemy, or destroy installations. It usually ends with a planned withdrawal from 18 March 2011 FM 7-15, C6 7-37 Chapter 7 the objective area upon mission accomplishment. Raids have narrowly defined purposes. They require both detailed intelligence and deliberate planning. Raids may destroy key enemy installations and facilities, capture or free prisoners, or disrupt enemy command and control or other important systems. (FM 3-90) (USACAC) ART 7.6.2.4 CONDUCT A SHOW OF FORCE 7-131. Shows of force are flexible deterrence options designed to demonstrate U.S. resolve. They involve increasing the visibility of U.S. forces to defuse a situation that, if allowed to continue, may be detrimental to national interests or objectives. The United States conducts shows of force for three reasons: to bolster or reassure allies, deter potential aggressors, and gain or increase influence. Shows of force demonstrate a credible and specific threat to an aggressor or potential aggressor. They involve increasing the visibility of U.S. forces in the eyes of the target audience through establishing an area presence and performing exercises and demonstrations. Presence patrols executed by small tactical units are one technique of conducting shows of force. Although actual combat is not desired, shows of force can rapidly and unexpectedly escalate. Therefore, units assigned a show of force mission assume that combat is probable and prepare accordingly. All actions ordinarily associated with the projection of a force to conduct combat operations pertain to show of force deployments. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.2.5 CONDUCT FOREIGN HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE 7-132. Foreign humanitarian assistance operations occur outside the United States and its territories. Army forces usually conduct them to relieve or reduce the results of natural or man-made disasters before, during, or after the event. They also relieve conditions—such as pain, disease, hunger, or privation—that present a serious threat to life or loss of property. Army forces supplement or complement efforts of host- nation civil authorities or other agencies that provide assistance. Army forces participate in foreign humanitarian assistance operations that may be unilateral, multinational, or United Nations-coordinated responses. Foreign humanitarian assistance is limited in scope and duration. It focuses exclusively on prompt aid to resolve an immediate crisis. Long-term activities designed to support full recovery and a return to predisaster conditions normally will become part of a combatant commander’s theater engagement plan. In such cases, a foreign humanitarian assistance operation transitions to a stability operation. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) No. Scale Measure Unit surveyed the disaster area; prioritized needs; conducted medical assessments; and provided medical services, communications, shelter, subsistence, water, 01 Yes/No engineering support, transportation, fire fighting, mass care, urban search and rescue, hazardous materials response, and energy distribution. 02 Percent Of mission with host-nation health provider participation. 03 Percent Of missions coordinated with command civil affairs and surgeons guidance.

ART 7.6.3.1 CONDUCT PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS 7-135. Peacekeeping operations are military operations undertaken with the consent of all major parties to a dispute. They are designed to monitor and facilitate implementation of agreements (cease fire, truce, or other such agreements) and support diplomatic efforts to reach a long-term political settlement. Peacekeeping operations usually involve observing, monitoring, or supervising and assisting parties to a dispute. To achieve their objectives, Army forces conducting peacekeeping operations rely on the legitimacy acknowledged by all major belligerents and international or regional organizations. They use or threaten the use of force only in self-defense or as a last resort.

Peace building operations are post-conflict actions, predominantly diplomatic and economic, that strengthen and rebuild governmental infrastructure and institutions to avoid a relapse into conflict. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) Note: The tasks in ART 7.3 (Conduct Stability Operations) describe the tasks that pertain to peace building. ART 7.6.3.3 CONDUCT PEACEMAKING OPERATIONS 7-139. Peacemaking is the process of diplomacy, mediation, negotiation, or other forms of peaceful settlements that arranges an end to a dispute and resolves issues that led to it. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) 7-40 FM 7-15, C6 18 March 2011 ART 7.0: Full Spectrum Operations, Tactical Mission Tasks, and Operational Themes Note: Selective tasks in ART 7.6.1 (Conduct Military Engagements) can support peacemaking operations. ART 7.6.3.4 CONDUCT PEACE ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS 7-140. Peace enforcement operations are the application of military force, or the threat of its use, normally pursuant to international authorization, to compel compliance with resolutions or sanctions designed to maintain or restore peace and order. Unlike peacekeeping operations, peace enforcement operations do not require the consent of all parties. Peace enforcement operations maintain or restore peace and support diplomatic efforts to reach a long-term political settlement. Army forces assigned a peace enforcement mission must be able to apply sufficient combat power for self-defense and to perform tasks forcibly. Units must also be prepared to transition to peacekeeping operations. Peace enforcement operations normally include one or more of six subordinate operations: forcible separation of belligerents, establishment and supervision of protected areas, sanction and exclusion zone enforcement, movement denial and guarantee, restoration and maintenance of order, and protection of humanitarian assistance. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) No. Scale Measure 01 Yes/No Unit enforced ceasefires. 02 Yes/No Unit identified and neutralized potential spoilers. 03 Yes/No Unit established and controlled buffers, including demilitarized zones. 04 Yes/No Unit supported and enforced political, military, and economic terms arrangements.

ART 7.6.3.5 CONDUCT CONFLICT PREVENTION OPERATIONS 7-141. Conflict prevention consists of actions taken before a predictable crisis to prevent or limit violence, deter parties, and reach an agreement before armed hostilities begin. Conflict prevention often involves diplomatic initiatives. It also includes efforts designed to reform a country’s security sector and make it more accountable to civilian control. Conflict prevention may require deploying forces to contain a dispute or prevent it from escalating into hostilities. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) No. Scale Measure 01 Yes/No Military activities were tailored to meet the political and situational demands.

Irregular warfare is a violent struggle among state and nonstate actors for legitimacy and influence over a population. U.S. Army forces operations grouped under irregular warfare are foreign internal defense, support for insurgencies, counterinsurgency, combating terrorism, and unconventional warfare. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) ART 7.6.4.1 CONDUCT FOREIGN INTERNAL DEFENSE OPERATIONS 7-143. Foreign internal defense is participation by civilian and military agencies of a government in any of the action programs taken by another government or other designated organization to free and protect its society from subversion, lawlessness, and insurgency. Foreign internal defense missions are applicable to a wide variety of operational environments. U.S. policy currently deals with threats through the indirect use of military force in concert with the diplomatic, informational, military, and economic instruments of national power. Direct use of military force is the exception rather than the rule. This approach relies on supporting efforts of the government of the nation in which the problem is developing. (FM 3-05.202) (USAJFKSWCS) ART 7.6.4.1.1 Provide Indirect Support to Foreign Internal Defense 7-144. Indirect support builds strong national infrastructures through economic and military capabilities that contribute to self-sufficiency.

The President must approve combat operations. Combat operations are a temporary solution until host-nation forces can stabilize the situation and provide security for the populace. Emphasis should be placed on host-nation forces in the forefront during these operations to maintain host-nation legitimacy with the population. Combat operations can include counterinsurgency operations. (FM 3-05.202) (USAJFKSWCS) No. Scale Measure 01 Yes/No Commander understood authorities, funding, and restrictions. 02 Yes/No Unit developed measures of effectiveness to ensure objectives were met. 03 Yes/No Unit acquired mission approval. 04 Yes/No Unit coordinated plan with host nation. 05 Yes/No Unit facilitated transitions to civil authorities or other agency. 06 Time To identify national objectives. 07 Time To evaluate host-nation capabilities. 08 Time To develop a plan to provide required assistance to host nation. ART 7.6.4.2 PROVIDE SUPPORT TO INSURGENCIES 7-147. Insurgencies are movements organized to overthrow a constituted government through subversion and armed conflict. By order of the President, Army forces support insurgencies that oppose regimes that threaten U.S. interests or regional stability. While any Army force can be tasked to support an insurgency, Army special operations forces usually receive these missions. The training, organization, and regional focus of Army special operations forces make them well suited for these operations. Army forces supporting insurgencies may provide logistic and training support. They can, but normally do not, conduct combat operations. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.4.3 CONDUCT COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS 7-148. Counterinsurgency is those military, paramilitary, political, economic, psychological, and civic actions taken by a government to defeat insurgency. In counterinsurgency, host-nation forces and their partners operate to defeat armed resistance, reduce passive opposition, and establish or reestablish the legitimacy of the host-nation government. Counterinsurgency is the predominant joint operation in Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. (FM 3-24) (USACAC) ART 7.6.4.4 COMBAT TERRORISM 7-149. Terrorism is the calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear. It is intended to coerce or intimidate governments or societies in pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or ideological. Enemies who cannot compete with Army forces conventionally often turn to terrorist tactics. Terrorist attacks often create a disproportionate effect on even the most capable conventional forces. Tactics used by terrorists range from arson to the use of weapons of mass destruction. Army forces routinely conduct operations to deter or defeat these attacks. Offensively-oriented operations are categorized as; defensively-oriented operations are antiterrorism. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) Note: This task branch only addresses counterterrorism operations. ART 6.6 (Apply Antiterrorism Measures) addresses antiterrorism measures. ART 7.6.4.5 CONDUCT COUNTERTERRORISM OPERATIONS 7-150. Counterterrorism are operations that include the offensive measures taken to prevent, deter, preempt, and respond to terrorism. By law, the counterterrorism mission is assigned to designated special operations forces that are organized and trained to combat terrorism. Those forces conduct counterterrorism outside the territory of the United States. Relevant National Security Decision Directives, National Security 18 March 2011 FM 7-15, C6 7-43 Chapter 7 Directives, contingency plans, and other relevant classified documents address sensitive and compartmentalized counterterrorism programs. Commanders who employ conventional forces against organized terrorist forces operating in their AO are conducting conventional offensive operations, not counterterrorism operations. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) ART 7.6.4.6 CONDUCT UNCONVENTIONAL WARFARE 7-151. Unconventional warfare is a broad spectrum of military and paramilitary operations, normally of long duration, predominantly conducted through, with, or by host-nation or surrogate forces that are organized, trained, equipped, supported, and directed in varying degrees by an external source. It includes, but is not limited to, guerrilla warfare, subversion, sabotage, intelligence activities, and unconventional assisted recovery. Unconventional warfare is operations conducted by, with, or through irregular forces in support of a resistance movement, insurgency, or conventional military operations.
