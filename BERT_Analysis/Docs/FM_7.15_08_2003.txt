Glossary-1 BIBLIOGRAPHY ...................................................................................................... Bibliography-1 18 March 2005 FM 7-15, C1 vii Preface FM 7-15 describes the structure and content of the Army Universal Task List (AUTL). It provides a standard, doctrinal foundation and catalogue of the Army’s tactical collective tasks. Units and staffs perform these tactical collective tasks at corps level and below. For each task, the AUTL provides a definition, a numeric reference hierarchy, and the measures of performance for evaluating the task. As a catalogue, it captures doctrine as it existed on the date of its publication. As a catalogue, the AUTL can assist a commander in his mission essential task list (METL) development process by providing all the collective tasks possible for a tactical unit of company- size and above and staff sections. Commanders should use the AUTL as a cross-reference for tactical tasks. They use it to extract METL tasks only when there is no current mission training plan (MTP) for that echeloned organization, there is an unrevised MTP to delineate tasks, or the current MTP is incomplete. FM 7-0 and FM 25-101 discuss and detail METL development and requirements. The AUTL will serve as the basis for mission analysis during tactical collective task development by proponents and centers. This manual will be updated on a regular basis. If a new ATUL task requirement is identified or developed by the proponent, the new task will be provided to the Combined Arms Doctrine Directorate (CADD) for approval and input. The AUTL provides the list of Army tactical tasks. Proponents and schools are responsible for writing and defining the conditions and standards for supporting collective tasks. The AUTL does not include tasks Army forces perform as part of joint and multinational forces at the operational and strategic levels. Those tasks are included in the Universal Joint Task List (UJTL) (CJCSM 3500.04C). The UJTL defines tasks and functions performed by Army elements operating at the operational and strategic levels of war. The UJTL provides an overall description of joint tasks to apply at the strategic-national, strategic-theater, and operational levels of command. The UJTL also provides a standard reference system that TRADOC combat developers use in objective force combat developments, such as front end analysis concerning the capabilities of an objective force element. Each military service is required to publish its own tactical task list to supplement the UJTL. (The Bibliography includes the other services’ task lists.) The AUTL is subordinate to the UJTL. PURPOSE The AUTL is the comprehensive listing of Army tactical-level collective tasks. The AUTL complements the UJTL by providing tactical-level Army-specific tasks. The AUTL— z Provides a common, doctrinal structure for collective tasks that support Army tactical missions and operations performed by Army units and staffs. z Articulates what tasks the Army performs to accomplish missions, but does not describe how success occurs. z Applies to all four types of military operations (offense, defense, stability, and support). z Provides standard definitions and helps establish a common language and reference system for all tactical echelons (from company to corps) and tactical staff sections. viii 18 March 2005 FM 7-15, C1 _________________________________________________________________________ Preface Uses approved definitions or derived definitions from evolving doctrine. Addresses each Army tactical task (ART) in only one location. Lists ARTs subordinate to each of the seven Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) (Chapters 1-7) and the tasks that support execution of the Army’s tactical missions (Chapter 8). Provides a table with measures of performance that can be used to develop standards for each task in Chapters 1-7 and generic measures of performance for tasks in Chapter 8. At the upper levels, the AUTL provides a concise picture of the major activities of a force. At lower levels, it provides increased detail on what the force must do to accomplish its mission. SCOPE Army tactical tasks apply at the tactical level of war. Although the AUTL emphasizes tasks performed by Army units, the Army does not go to war alone. Therefore, the AUTL includes tactical tasks typically performed by other services to support Army forces. Chapters 1-7 detail the tactical tasks within each of the seven BOS: intelligence, maneuver, fire support, air defense, mobility/countermobility/survivability, combat service support, and command and control. The BOS group related tasks according to battlefield use. In addition, Chapters 1-7 include a menu of measures of performance associated with each BOS task. Chapter 8 captures the tactical tasks that support execution of Army doctrinal tactical missions and operations. Chapter 8 is not another battlefield operating system. The missions and operations described in this chapter are combined arms in nature and do not fall under the purview of any one BOS. Commanders, their staffs, combat developers, training developers, and doctrine analysts can use this chapter to determine what missions and operations a given tactical organization is designed or should be designed to accomplish. There are four measures of performance for tasks in Chapter 8— Mission accomplishment occurs within the higher commander’s intent statement of what the force must do and the conditions. Mission accomplishment occurs within the higher commander’s specified timeline and his risk assessment for fratricide avoidance and collateral damage. Mission accomplishment occurs with the minimum expenditure of resources. After mission accomplishment the unit remains capable of executing assigned future missions and operations. Trainers—regardless of their status as unit commanders, unit operations officers, or uniformed and civilian training developers within the US Army Training and Doctrine Command—will use the definitions in these chapters to describe specified and implied tasks of missions in common terms. However, ART definitions do not specify who or what type of unit performs the task, what means to use, when the task will be performed, or how to perform a task. A complete mission statement provides all those specifics. Trainers determine those specifics based on their unique circumstances since ARTs are independent of conditions. Trainers use the measures of performance provided in Chapters 1-7 as a basis from which to develop standards of performance for a specific unit in specific conditions. Examples of such standards are found in published Army Training and Evaluation Program (ARTEP) MTPs. Those standards reflect the existing factors of mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and civil considerations (METT-TC). For example, time is a measure of performance for the displacement of a command post (ART 7.1.2). However, a trainer will use a standard measuring in minutes for the displacement of a battalion-level tactical ix FM 7-15 __________________________________________________________________________ command post. He will use a standard measuring in days for the displacement of a corps main command post. Measures of performance are neither directive nor all-inclusive. Trainers should use them as a guide and modify or expand them based on their experience and needs. Environmental conditions are factors affecting task performance. When linked to tactical tasks, conditions help frame the differences or similarities between missions. Refer to enclosure C of the UJTL for descriptions of joint conditions. APPLICABILITY FM 7-15 applies to commanders and trainers at all tactical echelons and to doctrine, combat, and training developers who develop doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures for the tactical level of war. It applies to the active and reserve components. The AUTL provides a common language and reference system for doctrine, combat, and training developers. The link between planners and trainers helps ensure that forces train the way they will fight. The AUTL also provides a basis for establishing unit-specific ARTEP MTPs. It provides a catalogue of tasks to assist in identifying those tasks that are essential to accomplish the organization's operational mission. The AUTL’s linkage to the UJTL at the operational and strategic level aids analysts and planners in understanding and integrating joint operations. ADMINISTRATIVE INSTRUCTIONS FM 7-15 supersedes TRADOC PAM 11-9, Blueprint of the Battlefield, 27 April 1990. In this manual, the term “force” refers to Army combined arms organizations that apply the synchronized or simultaneous combat power of several arms and services. Unless this publication states otherwise, masculine nouns and pronouns do not refer exclusively to men. This manual lists a single reference for each task after the task definition. It also gives the abbreviation for the proponent for the task after the manual reference. The proponent for this manual is US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC).

The primary functions of The Army, as outlined in Department of Defense Directive 5100.1, are to organize, equip, and train forces for the conduct of prompt and sustained combat operations on land. Accordingly, The Army possesses the capability to defeat enemy land forces and to seize, occupy, and defend land areas. Additionally, it can conduct air and missile defense, space and space control operations, and joint amphibious and airborne operations. These capabilities require the support of special operations forces, the operation of landlines of communications, and civil programs prescribed by law. The Army’s mission essential tasks described in FM 3-0 derive from statutory requirements, operational experience, strategies for employing military forces, and operations requirements of the combatant commanders. They are the operational expression of the Army’s core competencies contained in FM 1. Although these tasks are termed the Army METL, all Army units develop their own battle focused METLs as described in FM 7-0. The Army METL tasks in FM 3-0 describe what well-trained, superbly led, and well- Army Mission Essential Tasks equipped soldiers do for the nation. They state • Shape the security environment what the Army does so the nation can use its • Respond promptly to crisis military power effectively across the full • Mobilize the Army spectrum of operations in war, conflict, and • Conduct forcible entry operations peace. While focused on the land dimension, • Dominate land operations Army forces complement other service forces in • Provide support to civil authorities unified action. The ability of Army forces to perform tasks generates the credible land power necessary for joint force commanders (JFCs) to preclude and deter enemy action, win decisively if deterrence fails, and establish a rapid return to sustained postconflict stability. Thus, Army forces expand a JFC’s range of military options in full spectrum operations. Joint tasks describe the current and potential capabilities of the armed forces of the United States in broad terms. They are tasks joint force commanders assign to joint staffs and integrated service components. UJTL tasks, when associated with mission conditions and standards, describe a required capability but do not describe the means necessary to fulfill a requirement. The seven UJTL tactical task areas do not reflect how the Army has traditionally organized its physical means (soldiers, organizations, and equipment) to accomplish tactical missions. The Army organizes the ARTs contained in this manual under the seven BOS. A BOS does not represent an Army branch or proponent. Any Army organization, regardless of branch or echelon, performs tasks related to one or more of the BOS. The following figure illustrates the linkages between the seven BOS and six of the UJTL tactical task areas. (Note that the figure does not link any BOS to the tactical task area of Operate in a chemical, biological, radiological nuclear, and enhanced high explosives [CBRNE] environment. Outside TRADOC objective force combat development related activities, the Army regards the presence of CBRNE effects as another environment just as it regards the desert, jungle, mountain, and urban terrain as environments. The environment forms part of the conditions under which tasks are performed. Different environments may require different standards. They do not require different tasks.) xi FM 7-15 __________________________________________________________________________ The AUTL breaks the BOS into ARTs. Almost any ART can be the “what” of a unit mission statement. Most ARTs can also be broken into subordinate ARTs. Subordinate ARTs can be broken in a cascade fashion until they are no longer collective tasks. At that level, tasks become individual tasks addressed in soldier’s manuals. Lower level ART definitions elaborate on higher-level ART definitions. The AUTL numbering system provides a standard reference for addressing and reporting requirements, capabilities, or issues. Diagrams in each chapter illustrate the relationship of each ART to the BOS that contains it and to the doctrinal mission hierarchy. The horizontal linkages of ARTs from different BOS require synchronizing their performance in space and time based on the concept of operations. The position of any Army tactical mission or task within the AUTL structure has no relationship to its importance. That importance always depends on the mission. Likewise, the position of an Army tactical mission or task does not imply either command or staff oversight. Each ART appears only once in the AUTL. Doctrine determines the subordination of ARTs. If there are several logical locations for an ART, it appears at the location that depicts its most common relationships. While some BOS functions resemble one another, their definitions clearly distinguish them. Many ARTs have parallel tasks at the other levels of war, which are addressed in the UJTL. For example, ARTs associated with preparations for overseas movement are vertically linked to operational-level force projection tasks. Vertical task linkages provide connectivity between tactical, operational, and strategic activities. However, the contributions of tactical land power to joint military power are unique in some cases and do not necessarily link directly to operational- and strategic-level UJTL tasks. In applying the AUTL to the Army training process, a number of basic terms apply. The following table shows their definitions. Understanding the relationship of Army tactical mission xii _____________________________________________________________________ Introduction tasks, operations, and missions is important to successfully using the AUTL to establish training requirements. TERM DEFINITION Battlefield The BOS are the physical means (soldiers, organizations, and equipment) Operating Systems that commanders use to accomplish missions. (BOS) A discrete event or action, not specific to a single unit, weapon system, or Task individual that enables accomplishing a mission or function. The factors of METT-TC that produce the operational environment/specific Condition situation in which an organization is expected to conduct operations. These affect task performance. The minimum acceptable proficiency required in the performance of a particular task under a specified set of conditions. Commanders establish Standard their standards as they modify published tactics, techniques, and procedures. The essential activities assigned to an individual, unit, or force. It contains Mission the elements of who, what, when, where, and the why (reasons therefore), but seldom specifies how. Conducting service, training, or administrative military missions. The Operation process of carrying out the four types of military operations (offensive, defensive, stability, and support) and their subordinate types and forms. The specific activity a unit performs while conducting a form of tactical Tactical Mission operation or form of maneuver. It is the minimum essential effects to Task accomplish the purpose. Mission Essential The list of collective tasks in which an organization must be proficient to Task List accomplish its wartime or other assigned mission. Chapters 1 through 7 define the seven Army BOS. They define and provide measures of performance for the subordinate ARTs of each BOS. Each BOS has its own chapter. Chapter 8 defines the tasks that support execution of the Army’s tactical missions and operations. The primary source for standards for most Army tactical units is their published ARTEP MTP. It is the responsibility of commanders to establish new standards when they face significant differences in the factors of METT-TC from those associated with a task identified in a MTP training and evaluation outline (T&EO). Significant differences in the factors of METT-TC include such things as the unit being equipped with new equipment or having a modified table of organization from that documented in the MTP, such as what often occurs as a result of force packaging decisions during the deployment process. It also occurs when the unit conducts tasks not contemplated by the writer of their MTP, such as a cannon equipped field artillery battery providing installation security. xiii
