Time Requirements for Training Meetings ..........................................................B-4 xi Preface FM 7-1 is the Army’s doctrinal foundation for how to train, and it is applicable to all units and organizations of the Army. It explains how the Army assesses, plans, prepares, and executes training and leader development; it is critical to all the Army does. The goal of this manual is to create leaders who know how to think and apply enduring training principles to their units and organizations. FM 7-0 introduces the training cycle, the linkage of Army training and leader development, and the three domains where training occurs—the operational, institutional, and self-development domains. FM 7-1 defines The Army Training System, outlines who is responsible for training and training support, and describes how to conduct training. This top-to-bottom understanding of training—ranging from policy and resources allocation at Headquarters, Department of the Army to unit and organization methods—is critical to executing training successfully and to linking the three domains where training occurs. The training doctrine in this manual will shape Army training regulations and support unit and organization training plans. The emphasis is on teaching leaders to think through the training process, as opposed to simply following a prescribed method. There is no training model or strategy that can achieve warfighting readiness in a unit without intensive leadership to build both competence and confidence. FM 7-1 builds on task, condition, and standards-based training. Knowing the task, assessing the level of proficiency against the standard, and developing a sustaining or improving training plan is the essence of all Army training and development. But warfighting readiness is about more than just technical competence. It is about developing confidence through trust—soldier-to- soldier, leader-to-led, and unit-to-unit—and the will to succeed. It is about leadership. Understanding how to conduct tough, realistic training at every echelon of the Army sets the foundation for successful multiechelon, joint, interagency, and coalition operations. Leaders train the unit and organizational capabilities required to fight and win across the full spectrum of operations. This manual provides leaders with the doctrinal guidelines for how to train, and is the basis for successful training and operations. Soldiers have never let the nation fail—it is essential to train soldiers and units to uphold the Army’s nonnegotiable contract with the American people—to fight and win the nation’s wars, decisively.

FM 7-1 defines the roles, Individual Self-Development ............ 1-10 responsibilities, and linkages of the Reserve Component Training .......... 1-12 Premobilization and institutional, operational, and self- Postmobilization Training........... 1-12 development domains within the Army Summary............................................ 1-13 Training and Leader Development Model (ATLDM). It provides training doctrine for current and future operating environments. FM 7-1 describes in detail Army training management at the brigade level and below; however, the principles and the fundamentals in FM 7-1 are applicable to the entire Army. Every day, every person in the Army is involved directly or indirectly in training soldiers and developing leaders. 1-3. FM 7-1 provides a common training language for the Army. To this end, it describes— Standardized training terms of reference. Training management and execution systems and processes that support unit readiness. Processes and products that support training and leader development. Roles and responsibilities of the institutional, operational, and self- development domains to support full spectrum operations. 1-4. While senior leaders determine the direction and goals of training, it is the officers and NCOs who ensure that every training activity is well planned and rigorously executed. 1-1 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ THE TRAINING CHALLENGE 1-5. Since the end of the Cold War, the world has been in a state of significant transition marked by increased uncertainty and vulnerability. The strategic environment is much less stable than in the past, and threats to American interests are more diverse and less predictable. In this era of complex national security requirements, the Army must embrace a wider range of missions that present even greater training challenges. To “train the way we fight,” commanders and leaders must conduct training in a way that ensures mission performance in the contemporary operating environment. 1-6. Training for warfighting readiness is the Army’s number one priority in peace and war. Army leaders at all levels are responsible for success on the battlefield. Training is a continuous, lifelong endeavor that produces competent, confident, disciplined, and adaptive soldiers and leaders with the warrior ethos in our Army. Commanders have two major training responsibilities: train their unit to accomplish the assigned mission, and develop soldiers and leaders for future responsibilities. 1-7. Personnel turbulence, key-leader turnover, high operating tempo (OPTEMPO), and new equipment and systems fielding present a demanding set of training challenges. Resources for training are not unconstrained—they compete with other resource demands. Time is the inelastic resource—there is never enough, and it cannot be increased. All leaders must focus training on warfighting skills, and make that training the priority. Compliance training and non-mission activities are lower priority. If training cannot be conducted to standard, then commanders use readiness reports to inform the Army’s leadership of the risks being assumed. JOINT, INTERAGENCY, INTERGOVERNMENTAL, MULTINATIONAL TRAINING 1-8. The purpose of joint training is to prepare the Army to execute missions as part of a joint force conducting joint military operations across the full spectrum of operations. Employing Army forces at the right place and time allows combatant commanders to conduct decisive land operations along with air, sea, and space-based operations. The Army provides either a Joint Force Land Component Commander (JFLCC) or a joint force commander (JFC) with trained and ready forces that expand the commander’s range of military options. Army commanders tailor and train forces to react quickly to any crisis. 1-9. Commanders of major Army headquarters (Army Service component commander, corps or division) may serve as the joint or coalition force land component commander (JFLCC/CFLCC), as a combined forces commander (CFC), or as the joint task force commander (JTFC). To prepare to conduct these operations these headquarters conduct joint, interagency, intergovernmental, multinational, and Service-specific training. 1-10. Joint training uses joint doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), and involves more than one Service component. 1-11. When two or more Services train together using their respective Service doctrine and TTP, they are conducting Service-sponsored interoperability training. Although not classified as joint training, Service- sponsored interoperability is a vital component of joint proficiency and readiness. 1-2 _______________________________________________________________ How the Army Trains 1-12. Interagency training is training based on applicable standing operating procedures (SOPs). It is designed to prepare the Army to operate with other federal agencies (such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency), private voluntary organizations, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations. 1-13. Intergovernmental training is training based on applicable standing operating procedures (SOPs). It is designed to prepare the Army to operate with state and local government (for example, in a homeland defense role). 1-14. Multinational training is training based on applicable multinational, joint and/or Service doctrine. It is designed to prepare organizations for multinational operations with other nations. 1-15. The Army training doctrine in this manual provides commanders with the tools to develop adaptive leaders and organizations prepared to exercise command and control (C2) of joint and multinational forces and to operate with interagency and intergovernmental organizations. This training facilitates unity of effort. THE ARMY TRAINING SYSTEM 1-16. The Army training system is a cooperative effort between the institutional Army, units and organizations, and individuals. The systems approach to training is the foundation of the Army training system. 1-17. The systems approach to training is an analytical method that determines what tasks units are expected to perform on the battlefield, under what conditions they will perform the tasks, and the standard that they must achieve. It further identifies leader and individual tasks that units must perform to be successful in their battlefield tasks. Some of these tasks are designated as critical. 1-18. The systems approach to training is the engine that drives many elements of the Army training system. It is the foundation for— Doctrinal publications, such as Army Training and Evaluation Program-mission training plans (ARTEP-MTPs) and soldier training publications (STPs). Institutional training programs of instruction (POIs) for initial military training (IMT) and within the Officer Education System (OES), the Warrant Officer Education System (WOES), and the Noncommissioned Officer Education System (NCOES). Collective training strategies. 1-19. The systems approach to training is the analytical basis for unit, leader, and individual training proficiency. It is the science of the training system. Commanders combine this science with the art of leadership to train their units to perform their warfighting missions. 1-20. The Army training system focuses the Army’s training efforts on supporting training in the three domains in which training occurs: the operational domain, the institutional domain, and the self-development domain. 1-3 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ THE ARMY TRAINING AND LEADER DEVELOPMENT MODEL 1-21. The Army Training and Leader Development Model (ATLDM) (figure 1-1) centers on developing trained and ready units led by competent and confident leaders. The model identifies the important interaction necessary to train soldiers now and to develop leaders for the future. The three core domains that shape the critical learning experiences throughout a soldier’s and leader’s career are the operational, institutional, and self- development domains. These domains interact to focus Army energy and resources on training and leader development. Figure 1-1. Army Training and Leader Development Model 1-22. The Army is a profession, the profession of arms. Warfighting in defense of United States values and interests is the core competency of this profession. As a profession, the development of each member becomes the foundation, involving a lifelong devotion to duty both while in uniform and upon return to the civilian life. Professional development involves more than mastering technical skills. What is uniquely distinct to the military profession is its emphasis on not only what is to be accomplished, but how it is accomplished and with the full realization that the profession of arms may require of its members the supreme sacrifice. Professional development extends to inculcating the Army values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage in every soldier to create a warrior ethos based on camaraderie and service to our nation. Professional education provides the foundation involving a variety of training domains ranging from institutional schooling, self-study, and operational experience to personal interaction with superiors, peers and subordinates. All of these interactions are essential in developing and understanding training and leader development for warfighting. 1-4 _______________________________________________________________ How the Army Trains COMMANDER’S RESPONSIBILITY 1-23. The commander is responsible for the wartime readiness of all elements in the formation and is, therefore, the primary trainer. Training soldiers and developing leaders is the commander’s number one priority. Commanders observe and evaluate training and leader development at all levels of the organization. They provide feedback as coach, teacher, and mentor. They train to standard, not to time. NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER’S RESPONSIBILITY 1-24. A great strength of the U.S. Army is its professional noncommissioned officer (NCO) corps, which takes pride in being responsible for the individual training of soldiers, crews, and small teams. NCOs conduct standards-based, performance-oriented, battle focused training. They— Identify specific individual, crew, and small team tasks that support the unit’s collective mission essential tasks. Plan, prepare, rehearse, and execute training. Evaluate training and conduct after action reviews (AARs) to provide feedback to the commander on individual, crew, and small team proficiency. Fulfill an important role by assisting in the professional development of the officer corps. THE OPERATIONAL ARMY 1-25. Training in the operational Army includes home station training, combat training center (CTC) rotations, joint training exercises, and operational deployments in support of national objectives. Each of these training activities and operations provides opportunities for experiential learning. They enable participants to conduct assessments, and to plan, resource, conduct, and evaluate training for soldiers, leaders, and units. Training in the operational Army is a team effort. Each Army command echelon has specific training roles and responsibilities in the operational Army (figure 1-2). 1-5 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 1-2. The Operational Army HEADQUARTERS, DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY 1-26. Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) is responsible for providing trained and equipped forces to combatant commanders. The HQDA staff proponent for discharging training-related responsibilities is the Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans (G3). The Army G3 exercises staff supervision for— Setting Army-wide training policy. Developing Army capstone training concepts and doctrine. Developing training-related strategies. Obtaining funding and allocating resources for the Army Training Support System (TSS), training aids devices, simulators and simulations (TADSS), and range modernization and standardization plans. Formulating and obtaining funding for CTC and home station training (HST) master plans. Planning, coordinating, and scheduling new equipment fielding and training. Advising the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA) on joint interoperability training programs. 1-6 _______________________________________________________________ How the Army Trains MAJOR COMMANDS 1-27. Major command (MACOM) key training roles and responsibilities are to— Allocate funds for training programs and resources. Establish command training policy. Publish training guidance and major training event calendars. Develop and publish mission essential task lists (METLs). Supervise CTCs. Support the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) exercise program. Coordinate, manage, and resource new equipment training teams (NETT) to support new equipment training (NET). Train and evaluate Army forces. Manage, resource, and support the NCOES. CORPS 1-28. Corps headquarters key training roles and responsibilities are to— Distribute and manage training resources. Establish command training policy. Publish training guidance and major training event calendars. Develop and publish METLs. Designate corps battle tasks from subordinate divisions and corps troops METL. Focus on preparation and execution of training on METL, corps staff, subordinate divisions, and corps troops METL tasks. Evaluate corps troops organizations. DIVISIONS 1-29. Division headquarters key training roles and responsibilities are to— Prioritize and allocate training resources. Establish command training policy. Publish training guidance and major training event calendars. Develop and publish METLs. Designate division battle tasks from subordinate brigades and division troops METL. Focus on preparation and execution of training on METL, division staff, subordinate brigades, and division troops METL tasks. Evaluate battalions and division troops organizations. THE INSTITUTIONAL ARMY 1-30. The institutional Army focuses on educating and training soldiers, leaders, and the civilian work force on the key knowledge, skills, and attributes required to operate in any environment. Institutional training and education enhances military knowledge, individual potential, initiative, and competence in warfighting skills. It infuses an ethos of service to the nation and the Army, and provides the educational, intellectual, and experiential foundation for success on the battlefield. The institutional Army (figure 1-3) has many contributing components that affect the Army’s training infrastructure. Three illustrative examples are: the Training and Doctrine 1-7 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Command (TRADOC) and Department of the Army schools, the Army Installation Management Agency (IMA), and the Army Materiel Command (AMC). Together, they support collective and individual training, provide lifelong access to training resources for individual soldier or unit training, and provide and maintain necessary training, support facilities, and materiel. Figure 1-3. The Institutional Army TRAINING AND DOCTRINE COMMAND AND DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY ORGANIZATIONS 1-31. TRADOC and DA organizations provide institutional support to every soldier and civilian in the force throughout their Army career. Their primary contributions to the institutional Army include— Recruiting and accessing officers, soldiers, and civilians into the force. Conducting individual training for all ranks, including IMT, training within the OES, WOES, and NCOES, and continued developmental and sustainment training. IMT instills an appreciation for the Army, inspires the Army warrior ethos, and establishes Army values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage. Conducting civilian leadership training for all grades to include managers, supervisors, and interns. Providing leadership training and support for self-development. Developing, producing, and distributing training support products to institutions, units, and individuals. Resourcing, planning, programming, and scheduling of schools in concert with HQDA and MACOMs. 1-8 _______________________________________________________________ How the Army Trains Developing concepts, requirements, and products in doctrine, organizations, training, material, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities. Providing infrastructure for institutional training. ARMY INSTALLATION MANAGEMENT AGENCY 1-32. The Army Installation Management Agency (IMA) provides efficient and effective management of installations worldwide to support readiness and training. IMA contributes to training by— Providing planning, programming, and budgeting guidance and funding for installations. Developing installation operational plans and standards. Providing support to tenants and designated geographic area active component (AC) and reserve component (RC) units and activities. Providing installation supply management and support to all organizations. Maintaining real property, training facilities, and ranges. Supporting tenant and mobilizing organizations to enable them to prepare for and execute operational missions. ARMY MATERIEL COMMAND 1-33. The Army Materiel Command (AMC) is the Army’s primary provider of materiel readiness. It is a main source of technology, acquisition support, and logistics. AMC contributes to training by— Conducting specialized materiel readiness training. Serving as the HQDA G3 executive agent for planning and NET in coordination with the HQDA staff, TRADOC, FORSCOM, and other organizations. Assisting TRADOC and FORSCOM with the development of supply and maintenance concepts and doctrine. Assisting in the development and acquisition of specialized individual and collective training products. INSTITUTIONAL ARMY SUPPORT OF TRAINING 1-34. The challenge for the institutional Army is to provide synchronized schooling, doctrine, training, and training support to the correct organizational levels of the Army—from HQDA to the individual—at the correct time to support and enable operational commanders. Providing synchronized support includes, for example— Accessing and training new soldiers in the proper military occupational specialty (MOS) so they arrive in units at the right time trained in the right skills. Providing doctrinal tools for planning, executing, and assessing training at all levels. Creating new training courses and training support materials to keep pace with new doctrine and equipment. Providing installation and logistical support to enhance unit operations, regardless of their mission. Timing all activities to support and enable the training and operational requirements of commanders. 1-9 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ INDIVIDUAL SELF-DEVELOPMENT 1-35. Individual self-development, both structured and informal, focuses on taking those actions necessary to reduce or eliminate the gap between operational and institutional experiences. Individual self-development is continuous. It should be emphasized in both institutional and operational assignments. Commanders and leaders provide feedback to enable subordinates to identify their own strengths and weaknesses and to determine the reasons for them. Together the senior and subordinate prioritize the subordinate’s self-development goals and determine courses of action to improve performance. 1-36. Institutional and operational training and assignments and leader development programs alone cannot provide the insight, intuition, imagination, and judgment needed in combat. The gravity of the military profession requires comprehensive self-study and training. Individual self- development affects soldiers, civilian work force members, leaders, and supervisors of all grades, regardless of unit assignment, type of organization, current duty position, or location. The need for individual self-development requires commanders and leaders in the operational and institutional Armies, at all levels, to create an environment that encourages subordinates to establish personal and professional development goals. Successful self- development requires a team effort. 1-37. The ATLDM identifies an important interaction that trains soldiers now and develops leaders for the future. Self-development plays an important part in this. Initially focused on basic individual soldier/leader skills, self- development expands to sustain those skills and evolves to support new technical skills, tactical skills, leader skills, and personal education goals. The key to success is self-assessment with feedback provided by the leader or supervisor. 1-38. Self-development starts with an assessment of individual strengths, weaknesses, potential, and developmental needs. Commanders and leaders provide feedback that enables subordinates to determine the reasons for their strengths and weaknesses. Together, they prioritize self-development near- term and long-term goals and determine courses of action to improve performance. Self-development is— • A planned process involving the leader and the subordinate being developed. It enhances previously acquired skills, knowledge, behaviors, and experience; contributes to personal development; and highlights the potential for progressively more complex and higher-level assignments. Self-development focuses on maximizing individual strengths, minimizing weaknesses, and achieving individual personal and professional development goals. • Initially very structured and generally narrow in focus. The focus broadens as individuals understand their strengths and weaknesses, determine their individual needs, and become more experienced. Each soldier’s knowledge and perspective increases with experience, institutional training, and operational assignments, and is accelerated and broadened by specific, goal-oriented self-development actions. 1-10 _______________________________________________________________ How the Army Trains RESPONSIBILITIES 1-39. Leaders are responsible for their subordinate’s professional development as well as their own. Commanders must provide subordinates with the time and opportunity for self-development programs. The integration of self-development, leader development, and operational assignments comes from the feedback, coaching, mentoring, and guidance provided by leaders. 1-40. The pattern for Army civilian employees and leaders in operational or institutional assignments following their initial training and education is similar to that of their uniformed counterparts. The assignment path along which civilian employees generally progress consists of four broad phases: intern, supervisory, managerial, and executive. Because of the range of skills and entry positions of first-time-hire DA civilians and their career development models, they are not required to pass through each phase sequentially. This is where a carefully planned self-development program, closely coordinated with one’s supervisor, becomes critical. 1-41. Commanders and supervisors must understand why self-development activities are an integral part of their organizational training plan. Senior leaders are often judged by how well their subordinates perform as much as by how they themselves perform. INDIVIDUAL SELF-DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT OF UNIT TRAINING 1-42. Operational assignments translate theory into practice. They place soldiers, leaders, and civilians in positions to apply skills acquired during institutional training and education and self-development programs. Individuals learn and practice skills necessary for individual and collective training as they continually go through the planning, execution, and assessment phases of the self-development process. 1-43. Individual self-development is linked with both institutional and operational assignments— Individual self-development programs continue regardless of duty assignment. Individual self-development programs are transient and move with the individual between the various operational and institutional assignments. Institutional assignments provide resident self-development courses, distributed learning tools, and exportable educational technologies that support self-development. Operational assignments provide current and future self-development opportunities. Individual self-development reinforces the values, warrior ethos, ethics, and standards that permeate Army culture. Commanders, leaders, and supervisors in operational and institutional assignments provide the time, planning, and feedback individuals require for self-development. 1-11 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ RESERVE COMPONENT TRAINING 1-44. The Army consists of the active component (AC) and the reserve component (RC). The AC is a Federal force of full-time soldiers and DA civilians. The RC consists of the Army National Guard (ARNG), the United States Army Reserve (USAR), and their civilian support personnel. While each component is established under different statutes and has unique and discrete characteristics, all share the same doctrine and training management process, and they train to the same standard. However, the RC trains at lower echelons, and the number of tasks trained differs as a result of the organization and training time available. While the process is the same, there is a significant difference between AC and RC planning timelines. Commanders at all echelons in RC organizations and units assess training, provide guidance, and publish training plans. 1-45. The RC represents a large portion of the Army’s deterrence and warfighting power. They are an integral part of the force. However, available training time has a significant impact on RC training. RC units have a limited number of available training days. Geographic dispersion of units also impacts RC training. An average reserve battalion is spread over a 150 to 300 mile radius. Additionally, most reserve units travel an average of 150 miles to the nearest training area. Individual soldiers often travel an average of 40 miles to their training sites. 1-46. Some RC soldiers may be assigned to a unit prior to MOS qualification; therefore, the RC may have fewer MOS-qualified personnel assigned than their AC counterparts. Additionally, even though doctrine requires trained leaders to train units and soldiers, RC leaders may be unable to attend professional military education until after assignment to their units. Priority of training for RC units is given to individual duty military occupational specialty qualification (DMOSQ) and professional development to produce qualified soldiers and leaders. 1-47. Training readiness oversight (TRO) is the authority executed over assigned Army forces, including the RC forces, when they are not on active duty, and when they are on active duty for training (ADT). It includes authority to— Establish training criteria, and evaluate and oversee the training of assigned RC forces. Coordinate and approve participation by assigned RC forces in joint exercises and other joint training when on ADT or performing initial active duty for training (IADT). Obtain and review readiness and inspection reports of assigned RC forces. Review mobilization plans developed for assigned RC forces. PREMOBILIZATION AND POSTMOBILIZATION TRAINING 1-48. Mobilization is not the start point for planning battle focused training. RC units have premobilization readiness and postmobilization training requirements. Premobilization training plans must be developed and approved for the current fiscal and training year. Postmobilization training plans must be integrated with the premobilization training plans and updated and approved for each training year as well. 1-12 _______________________________________________________________ How the Army Trains 1-49. Premobilization training is directly linked to postmobilization training. A critical objective is to identify achievable, sustainable training requirements, which provide the focus for effective premobilization unit training. RC commanders train their units to standard on established premobilization tasks. 1-50. Postmobilization expands organizational training, raises the echelon trained, and increases the amount of multiechelon and combined arms training accordingly. Postmobilization plans are created at the same time as premobilization plans and are updated regularly as premobilization training and revised commanders training assessments are completed. PREMOBILIZATION TRAINING PLANS 1-51. Premobilization training focuses on company-level individual and collective tasks. Staffs train on individual and collective tasks at the level organized. Premobilization training plans identify training requirements, training events, equipment, and training support packages to train to sustain task proficiency. Proficiency in these tasks enables training to full METL proficiency when the unit is mobilized. The annual training (AT) plan generally focuses on preparation for and execution of AT. POSTMOBILIZATION TRAINING PLANS 1-52. Postmobilization training focuses on company-level and above collective tasks. These plans identify training requirements, training events, equipment, and training support packages needed to train the unit to full METL proficiency upon mobilization. Postmobilization plans are updated annually and reflect input from the execution of the premobilization plan. The commander who approves the unit’s METL and yearly training plan (YTP) also approves the postmobilization plan. The plan is then provided to the mobilization station commander where the postmobilization training will occur. 1-53. Garrison commanders are responsible for supporting the execution of postmobilization training activities. They determine resource requirements and develop plans to support the unit to reach its deployment training requirement. RC commanders conduct periodic visits with the supporting garrison commander to inspect training areas and facilities, identify and resolve support challenges, and clarify and refine training support requirements. SUMMARY 1-54. Army training has one purpose—to produce competent, confident, adaptive soldiers, leaders, and units, trained and ready to fight and win our nation’s battles. The ATLDM integrates the operational, institutional, and self-development domains into a training management system. The commander is responsible for unit training and integrates the operational, institutional, and individual self-development domains to train combat-ready units. Commanders are responsible for the wartime readiness of every aspect of their unit, while NCOs train individual soldiers, crews, and small teams. All training focuses on the METL, and all factors involved in training lead to unit readiness. Training is the Army’s number one priority. Training is “what we do, not something we do.” 1-13 Chapter 2 Battle Focused Training The key to fighting and winning is an understanding of “how we train to fight” at every echelon. Training programs must result in demonstrated tactical and technical competence, confidence, and initiative in our soldiers and their leaders. Training will remain the Army’s top priority because it is the cornerstone of combat readiness! General Carl E. Vuono 2-1. Commanders train their units to be combat ready. Training is their number one priority. Commanders achieve combat readiness using tough, realistic, and challenging training. At every level, commanders must train to the CONTENTS Army standard.

Using the Army Training Management Cycle, the commander continuously plans, prepares, executes, and assesses the state of training in the unit. This cycle provides the framework for commanders to develop their unit’s METL, establish training priorities, and allocate resources. 2-2. Commanders and leaders at all levels use the principles of training to develop and execute effective training. As commanders train their units on METL tasks, senior commanders reinforce training by approving and protecting training priorities and providing resources. PRINCIPLES OF TRAINING 2-3. There are ten principles of training. The principles are shown in figure 2-1. Commanders are Responsible for Training NCOs Train Individuals, Crews, and Small Teams Train as a Combined Arms and Joint Team Train for Combat Proficiency Realistic Conditions Performance-Oriented Train to Standard Using Appropriate Doctrine Train to Adapt Train to Maintain and Sustain Train Using Multiechelon Techniques Train to Sustain Proficiency Train and Develop Leaders Figure 2-1. Principles of Training 2-1 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ COMMANDERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRAINING 2-4. Commanders are responsible for the training and performance of their soldiers and units. They are the primary training managers and trainers for their organization, are actively engaged in the training process, and adhere to the principles of training. To fulfill their training responsibility, commanders and leaders at each echelon— Should be present and lead training. Base training on the METL. Provide the required resources. Train to the Army standard. Develop and execute training plans that result in proficient individuals, leaders, and units. Incorporate risk management into all aspects of training. Assess current levels of proficiency. 2-5. Commanders and leaders at all levels must be personally involved in training. Brigade commanders train battalion commanders and staffs. Battalion commanders train company commanders with their companies; company commanders train platoon leaders with their platoons; platoon leaders train squad leaders with their squads; and NCOs train individuals, crews, and small teams. The command sergeant major (CSM), first sergeant (1SG), and platoon sergeant (PSG) actively participate in leader training and leader development. A detailed discussion of leader training and leader development is found in appendix A. NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS TRAIN INDIVIDUALS, CREWS, AND SMALL TEAMS 2-6. Noncommissioned officers (NCOs) are responsible for conducting standards-based, performance-oriented, battle focused training. They identify specific individual, crew, and small team tasks that support the unit’s collective mission essential tasks. They plan, prepare, rehearse, and execute training; evaluate training, conduct AARs and provide feedback to the commander on individual, crew, and small team proficiency. Senior NCOs coach junior NCOs and officers to master a wide range of individual and leader tasks. They use the training management process to focus training on the most important individual tasks—those critical to the collective tasks being trained. 2-7. NCOs continue the soldierization process of newly assigned enlisted soldiers, and begin their professional development. Not all skill level 1 tasks can be trained in IMT. Skill level 1 tasks not trained in IMT must be trained in the units. The tasks trained by the unit vary by MOS, depending on the task’s complexity. NCOs are responsible for completing the training of newly assigned enlisted soldiers by training them to standard on the skill level 1 tasks not trained in IMT. 2-2 _____________________________________________________________ Battle Focused Training TRAIN AS A COMBINED ARMS AND JOINT TEAM 2-8. The Army provides the JFC with a trained and ready force able to execute full spectrum operations. This force provides the JFC with the capability to— Seize areas previously denied by the enemy. Dominate land operations. Provide support to civil authorities. 2-9. Army forces seldom operate unilaterally. Corps and division headquarters may serve as either a joint task force headquarters or as a joint or combined force land component headquarters to provide command and control of joint or coalition forces. Many of the tasks necessary to execute these missions are the same as for Army forces, but are based on joint and multinational doctrine. Corps and division headquarters train on these tasks periodically, based on MACOM guidance or contingency plans. 2-10. The basis for the organization and operation of Army forces is combined arms. Combined arms is the integrated application of several arms to achieve an effect on the enemy that is greater than if each arm was used separately or in sequence. Integration involves the arrangement of battlefield actions in time, space, and purpose for maximum effects of combat power at a decisive place and time. Commanders and their staffs integrate and synchronize the battlefield operating systems (BOS) to achieve combined arms effects and accomplish the mission. 2-11. Today’s Army doctrine emphasizes teamwork at all echelons. When committed to battle, each unit must be prepared to execute operations without additional training or lengthy adjustment periods. Leaders must regularly practice task organization of all combat, combat support (CS), and combat service support (CSS) units. Teams achieve combined arms proficiency and cohesiveness when they train together. Peacetime training relationships must mirror wartime task organization to the greatest extent possible. 2-12. Commanders are responsible for training all warfighting systems. The full integration of the combined arms team is attained through the task organization approach to training management. Task organizing is a temporary grouping of forces to accomplish a particular mission, and they are habitually associated for peacetime training. An example of a task- organized brigade and its warfighting systems is depicted in figure 2-2. 2-13. The commander is responsible for the training of all elements of the formation, and must develop a training plan that addresses two complementary challenges: the unit must both be proficient in the functional tasks and be able to conduct combined arms operations. For example, "attack" may be a corps or division METL task. The commander, with the task-organized subordinate unit commanders, develops training scenarios, events, and exercises that integrate the relevant functional tasks that support execution of an “attack.” 2-3 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 2-2. Brigade Combat Team Organization 2-14. Functional task proficiency of subordinate units is an essential prerequisite for effective combined arms training. Each supporting unit commander performs an analysis to determine specific functional and technical training requirements necessary for effective execution of a deliberate attack. For example, the corps or division engineer coordinator (ENCOORD) could identify “conduct mobility operations” as the critical engineer functional task. 2-15. The combined arms training challenge is the same for all echelons of command. The complexity, however, increases at each higher echelon. The tempo, scope, and scale of operations at higher command echelons increase coordination requirements for planning and executing staff, joint, interagency, and multinational training. Commanders, from company through corps, focus combined arms training based on their METL. Figure 2-3 illustrates the scope and scale of the combined arms training challenge from company to corps. 2-4 _____________________________________________________________ Battle Focused Training Figure 2-3. Combined Arms Training—Scope and Scale TRAIN FOR COMBAT PROFICIENCY 2-16. The goal of all training is to achieve the Army standard. Within the confines of safety and common sense, commanders and leaders must be willing to accept less than perfect results initially and demand realism in training. Commanders integrate realistic conditions such as imperfect intelligence; reduced communications; smoke; noise; rules of engagement (ROE); simulated nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) environments; battlefield debris; loss of key leaders; civilians on the battlefield; joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multiagency (JIIM) requirements; and varying extremes in weather. Commanders take every opportunity to move soldiers out of the classroom into the field, fire weapons, maneuver as a combined arms team, and incorporate protective measures against enemy actions. CTCs provide the most realistic and challenging training experience in the Army; however, they should not be viewed as an “end point” in the unit training life cycle. Rather, they provide a “go to war experience” that allows commanders to assess their METL proficiency and determine the effectiveness of their training program. Additionally, commanders must maximize resources and time by training in all available training environments—live, virtual, and constructive (L-V-C). Realistic Conditions 2-17. Tough, realistic, and intellectually and physically challenging training excites and motivates soldiers and leaders. Realistic training— Builds competence and confidence by developing and honing skills. Instills loyalty and dedication to the unit through a shared sense of accomplishment. 2-5 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Inspires excellence by fostering initiative, enthusiasm, and eagerness to learn. Develops aggressive, well-trained, disciplined soldiers. 2-18. Leaders must make conditions in training as close to wartime conditions as possible. Innovative leaders seize every opportunity to increase training challenges for soldiers, leaders, and units. Successful completion of each training event increases the capability and motivation of individuals and units for more sophisticated and advanced training. This is the commanders’ continuous quest. 2-19. Conducting realistic training is challenging business. Commanders incorporate risk management throughout their mission planning and execution to identify risk or other factors that will hinder mission accomplishment, and take action to reduce or mitigate the risk. Accordingly, risk management is a critical command and leader function that encompasses more than a single event or a learned process. It is both an art and a science. Risk management enables commanders and leaders to identify, control, and mitigate hazards proactively. 2-20. The scope of risk management extends well beyond the “enemy” in mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and civil considerations (METT-TC). Commanders must also consider potential risks, such as the experience of their soldiers and leaders, their training proficiency, adverse terrain, the weather, and the time available to accomplish the mission. Because training and combat conditions are dynamic, risk management must be a continuous process throughout training and combat operations and be embedded in the military decisionmaking process (MDMP). Performance-Oriented 2-21. Performance-oriented training is hands-on and conducts the task under the conditions and to the standard specified. Soldiers and leaders must be proficient in the basic skills required to perform their wartime missions under battlefield conditions. Units become proficient in the performance of critical tasks and missions by repeatedly practicing the tasks and missions to standard. Soldiers learn best through repetition, using a hands-on approach. 2-22. Soldiers train better, faster, and to a higher degree of proficiency when they know the task, condition, and standard. Likewise, training is more effective when it is performance-oriented and standards-based. Enforcing standards allows leaders to identify and correct training deficiencies, resulting in a more accurate assessment of combat capabilities. 2-23. The complexity of the conditions is increased as soldier performance levels increase, while the standard remains constant. Soldiers and leaders must execute the planned training, evaluate performance, and retrain until the Army standard is achieved under the most realistic conditions possible. They must evaluate and reinforce individual skills at each opportunity. 2-24. The same standard must be enforced whether performed individually or as part of a larger operation. For example, the squad leader enforces individual movement techniques during squad training as 2-6 _____________________________________________________________ Battle Focused Training well as when the techniques are executed as part of a company attack exercise. Soldier and leader task training must occur continuously and be fully integrated into the collective training plan. TRAIN TO STANDARD USING APPROPRIATE DOCTRINE 2-25. Training must be done to the Army standard and conform to Army doctrine. When mission tasks involve emerging doctrine or non-standard tasks, commanders establish the tasks, conditions, and standards using mission orders and guidance, lessons learned from similar operations, and their professional judgment. The next higher commander approves the standards for these tasks. FM 3-0 provides the doctrinal foundations. Supporting doctrinal manuals describe common TTP that permit commanders and organizations to adjust rapidly to changing situations. Doctrine provides the basis for a common vocabulary across the force. Therefore, units must train to the Army standard contained in ARTEP- MTPs and STPs, while applying Army doctrine and current regulatory guidance. 2-26. While serving as a joint headquarters and performing joint tasks, Army organizations use joint doctrine and TTP. Joint doctrine establishes the fundamentals of joint operations and provides guidance on how best to employ joint forces. Army doctrine is consistent with and nested in joint doctrine. TRAIN TO ADAPT 2-27. Commanders train and develop adaptive leaders and units, and prepare their subordinates to operate in positions of increased responsibility. Commanders intensify training experiences by varying training conditions, making them increasingly difficult and unpredictable. Repetitive and increasingly complex training gives soldiers and leaders a foundation that can be used to adapt to new situations. Commanders establish a training environment that encourages initiative and innovation, and recognize the benefits of allowing leaders the opportunity to learn from their mistakes. 2-28. Training experiences coupled with timely feedback build competence. Leaders build confidence when they consistently demonstrate competence in tasks. Competence, confidence, and discipline promote initiative and enable leaders to adapt to changing situations and conditions. Leaders improvise with the resources at hand, exploit opportunities, and accomplish the assigned mission within the commander’s intent in the absence of orders. Commanders at every echelon integrate training events in their training plans to develop and train imaginative, adaptive leaders and units. TRAIN TO MAINTAIN AND SUSTAIN 2-29. Maintenance is essential for sustained operations; therefore, maintenance must be a routine part of how the Army operates and trains. Soldiers and leaders are responsible for maintaining all assigned equipment in a high state of readiness to support training or operational missions. Units must be capable of fighting for sustained periods of time with the equipment they are issued. Soldiers must become experts in both the operation and maintenance of their equipment. This link 2-7 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ between operations and maintenance is vital to mission success and must be emphasized in training. 2-30. The standard for the Army is to train to maintain to the published standards in the technical manual (TM)-10 series and TM-20 series. Maintenance is vital to mission accomplishment. METL cannot be executed if essential equipment and systems (such as tracks, weapons, wheeled vehicles, or radios) are non-mission capable (NMC). Everyone— leaders, maintenance personnel, and operators—must be trained and involved in maintaining and sustaining the organization. 2-31. In war, soldiers and crews perform preventive maintenance checks and services (PMCS) under combat conditions. This requires equipment and vehicle operators and maintenance personnel who are proficient in their maintenance duties. Leaders must carefully plan training objectives for maintenance periods and ensure that the objectives are achieved. Leaders must train soldiers to meet Army maintenance standards. Success on the battlefield requires well-honed tactical and maintenance skills. 2-32. Commanders must ensure that the unit is prepared to maintain equipment under battlefield conditions. Organizations must train all levels of maintenance to include maintenance of— Individual soldier equipment, such as common table of allowances (CTA) 50, individual weapons, protective masks, and other individual NBC clothing, and equipment. Crew served weapons and equipment, such as NBC monitoring and detection equipment, night vision and position locating devices, etc. Major end items, such as tracked and wheeled vehicles, helicopters, shop vans and their associated subsystems (such as armament, automotive, communications, electronics, and computers). 2-33. Maintenance is training. Scheduled maintenance allows units to train to maintain and sustain. Time must be allotted for maintenance and other logistical personnel (for example, supply, cooks, medics, and mechanics) to maintain their equipment to standard. 2-34. The training schedule also includes PMCS, equipment services, and command maintenance periods. Soldiers must understand PMCS requirements and how they are executed. Leaders must train soldiers to maintain entire systems, not just pieces of a system. For example, a Bradley fighting vehicle (BFV) squad focuses on maintaining weapons, radios, basic issue items (BII), and NBC equipment, as well as the vehicle. Maintenance training periods must be planned, prepared, executed, and evaluated (have AARs conducted) with the same intensity as other training events. These periods should have clear, focused, and measurable objectives. Normally, they are informally evaluated by the chain of command. 2-35. The commanders, CSMs, and 1SGs instill in soldiers and leaders the importance of keeping equipment in the fight. The commander reviews the unit maintenance proficiency based on readiness standards, completion of scheduled equipment services, and identified training weaknesses. The commander adjusts the emphasis of the unit’s 2-8 _____________________________________________________________ Battle Focused Training maintenance training program to correct identified shortcomings during the weekly training meeting. TRAIN USING MULTIECHELON TECHNIQUES 2-36. Multiechelon training is the most effective and efficient way to sustain proficiency on mission essential tasks with limited time and resources. Commanders use multiechelon training to— Train leaders, staffs, units, and individuals at each echelon of the organization simultaneously. Maximize use of allocated resources and available time. Reduce the effects of personnel turbulence. 2-37. All multiechelon training techniques have the following distinct characteristics: They require detailed planning and coordination by commanders and leaders at each echelon. They habitually train at least two echelons simultaneously on selected METL tasks, associated battle tasks, or supporting collective and individual tasks. TRAIN TO SUSTAIN PROFICIENCY 2-38. Once individuals and units have trained to the required level of proficiency, leaders must structure individual and collective training strategies to retrain critical tasks at the minimum frequency necessary for sustainment. Sustainment training is the key to maintain unit proficiency through, for example, personnel turbulence, operational deployments, and NET. ARTEP-MTPs and STPs are tools to help achieve and sustain collective and individual proficiency. Sustainment training must occur often enough to train new soldiers as they arrive in the unit and minimize skill decay. Army units train to accomplish their missions by frequent sustainment training on critical tasks. Infrequent “peaking” of training for an event (CTC rotation, for example) does not sustain wartime proficiency. Battle focused training is training on wartime tasks. Many of the METL tasks on which a unit trains for its wartime mission are the same as those required for a stability or support operation. This prepares a unit for the entire spectrum of missions that it may execute. 2-39. Sustainment training enables units to operate in a Band of Excellence through appropriate repetition of critical tasks using a mixture of L-V-C training. The Band of Excellence is the range of proficiency within which a unit is capable of executing its critical wartime METL tasks. Training to sustain proficiency in the Band of Excellence includes training leaders, staffs, and units. Units fluctuate in proficiency because of many factors, such as training frequency, key personnel turnover, new equipment fielding, and resource constraints. The commander takes these factors into consideration when assessing the unit’s readiness and developing the training strategy. Well-trained units minimize peaking for selected events or at predetermined times. 2-40. An example of how a commander planned the yearly sustainment training to remain in the Band of Excellence is illustrated in figure 2-4. The solid black line shows the results of an effective unit training strategy that sustains training proficiency over time, maintaining it 2-9 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ within the Band of Excellence. The plan schedules critical training at the minimum frequency necessary for sustainment. The dotted black line shows an ineffective training strategy that often causes the unit to fall outside the Band of Excellence, requiring significant additional training before the unit is capable of executing its critical wartime tasks. Figure 2-4. Band of Excellence 2-41. This common sense approach of training to sustain proficiency precludes deep valleys in proficiency that would otherwise require a significant amount of resources and time to retrain the unit to standard on its wartime mission. This strategy keeps proficiency within the Band of Excellence. TRAIN AND DEVELOP LEADERS 2-42. Commanders have a vital role in leader training and leader development. It is their duty to teach subordinates how to fight and how to train. They also teach soldiers and leaders how to think, not what to think. They mentor, guide, listen to, and “think with” subordinates. They train leaders to plan training in detail, prepare for training thoroughly, execute training aggressively, conduct effective AARs, and evaluate short-term training proficiency in terms of desired long-term results. Training and developing leaders is an embedded component of every training event. Nothing is more important to the Army than building confident, competent, adaptive leaders for tomorrow. 2-10 _____________________________________________________________ Battle Focused Training COMMANDERS AND TRAINING 2-43. Effective training is the number one priority of commanders. The commander is the primary trainer. In war, training continues with a priority second only to combat or to the support of combat operations. Commanders and senior leaders must extract the greatest training value from every training opportunity. Effective training requires the commander’s continuous personal time and energy to accomplish the following goals: Develop and communicate a clear vision. Train one echelon below and evaluate two echelons below. Require subordinates to understand and perform their roles in training. Train all elements to be proficient in their mission essential tasks. Train and develop subordinates. Assist subordinates with self-development program. Involve themselves personally in planning, preparing, executing, and assessing training. Demand that training standards be achieved. Ensure proper task and event discipline. Foster a command climate that is conducive to good training. Manage training distracters. Incorporate risk management. DEVELOP AND COMMUNICATE A CLEAR VISION 2-44. The senior leader’s training vision provides the direction, purpose, and motivation necessary to prepare individuals and organizations to win in battle. It is based on a comprehensive understanding of the following: Mission, doctrine, and history. Enemy/threat capabilities. Operational environment. Organizational and personnel strengths and weaknesses. Training environment. TRAIN ONE ECHELON BELOW AND EVALUATE TWO ECHELONS BELOW 2-45. Commanders are responsible for training their own unit and one echelon below. Commanders evaluate units two echelons below. For example, brigade commanders train battalions and evaluate companies; battalion commanders train companies and evaluate platoons. REQUIRE SUBORDINATES TO UNDERSTAND AND PERFORM THEIR ROLES IN TRAINING 2-46. Because good training results from leader involvement, one of the commander’s principal roles in training is to teach subordinate trainers how to train and how to fight. The commander provides the continuing leadership that focuses on the organization’s wartime mission. The commander assigns officers the primary responsibility for collective training, and NCOs the primary responsibility for individual, crew, and 2-11 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ small team training (see figure 2-5). The commander, as the primary trainer, uses multiechelon techniques to meld leader, staff, and individual training requirements into collective training events, while recognizing the overlap in training responsibilities. Commanders teach, coach, and mentor subordinates throughout the training process. Figure 2-5. Overlapping Training Responsibilities TRAIN ALL ELEMENTS TO BE PROFICIENT ON THEIR MISSION ESSENTIAL TASKS 2-47. Commanders must integrate and train to Army standard personnel under all BOS—those both within and supporting their command—on their selected mission essential tasks. An important requirement for leaders is to project training plans far enough into the future and to coordinate resources with sufficient lead-time. TRAIN AND DEVELOP SUBORDINATES 2-48. Competent and confident leaders build cohesive organizations with a strong chain of command, high morale, and good discipline. Commanders create leader development programs that develop warfighter professionalism, skills, and knowledge. They mentor, guide, listen to, and “think with” subordinates to challenge their depth of knowledge and understanding. Commanders ensure that their subordinates know “how to think” instead of what to think. They develop their subordinates’ confidence and empower them to make independent, situational-based decisions. The goal is to develop subordinates who have an agile and adaptive mindset. 2-12 _____________________________________________________________ Battle Focused Training ASSIST SUBORDINATES WITH SELF-DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 2-49. Commanders assist subordinates with a self-development program and share experienced insights that encourage subordinates to study and learn their profession. Effective leader development programs continuously influence the Army as junior leaders progress to higher levels of responsibility. INVOLVE THEMSELVES PERSONALLY IN PLANNING, PREPARING, EXECUTING, AND ASSESSING TRAINING 2-50. Commanders resource training and protect subordinates’ training time. They are actively involved in planning for future training. They create a sense of stability throughout the organization by protecting approved training plans from training distracters. Commanders are responsible for executing the approved training to standard. Commanders are present (to the maximum extent possible) during the conduct of training, and provide timely, experienced feedback to all participants. DEMAND TRAINING STANDARDS BE ACHIEVED 2-51. Leaders anticipate that some tasks may not be performed to standard. They design time in the training events for additional training on tasks not performed to standard. Leaders cannot assume that time will be available to train to standard next time. It is better to train to standard on a limited number of tasks, rather than attempt and fail to achieve the standard on too many tasks, rationalizing that corrective action will occur during some later training period. Soldiers will remember the enforced standard, not the one that was discussed. ENSURE PROPER TASK AND EVENT DISCIPLINE 2-52. Senior leaders ensure that junior leaders plan the correct task-to- time ratio. Too many tasks guarantee that nothing gets trained to standard and that no time is allocated for retraining. Too many events result in improper preparation and recovery. FOSTER A COMMAND CLIMATE THAT IS CONDUCIVE TO GOOD TRAINING 2-53. Commanders create a climate that rewards subordinates who are bold and innovative trainers and offer support for honest mistakes. They challenge the organization and each individual to train to full potential. MANAGE TRAINING DISTRACTERS 2-54. The commander who has planned and resourced a training event is responsible to ensure participation by the maximum number of soldiers. Administrative support burdens cannot be ignored; however, they can be managed using an effective time management system. Senior commanders must support subordinate commanders’ efforts to train effectively by managing training distracters and reinforcing the requirement for all assigned personnel to be present during prime training time. 2-13 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ INCORPORATE RISK MANAGEMENT 2-55. The military profession is inherently dangerous. Commanders must train their units to tough standards under the most realistic conditions possible. Applying the risk management process does not detract from this training goal, but enhances execution of highly effective, realistic training. Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and controlling risks arising from operational factors, and of making decisions that balance risk costs with mission training benefits. Leaders and soldiers at all echelons use risk management to conserve combat power and resources in both peace and war. TOP-DOWN/BOTTOM-UP APPROACH TO TRAINING 2-56. The top-down/bottom-up approach to training is a team effort between commanders and their subordinate leaders. Commanders provide the training focus, direction, and resources, while subordinate leaders provide feedback on unit training proficiency, identify specific unit training needs, and execute training to standard in accordance with the approved plan. This team effort helps maintain training focus, establishes training priorities, and enables effective communication between command echelons. 2-57. Guidance, based on wartime mission and priorities, flows from the top down and results in subordinate units’ identification of specific collective and individual tasks that support the higher unit’s mission. Input from the bottom up is essential because it identifies training needs to achieve task proficiency on identified collective and individual tasks. Leaders at all echelons communicate with each other about requirements and planning, preparing, executing, and evaluating training. 2-58. Senior leaders centralize planning to provide a consistent training focus from the top to the bottom of the organization. However, they decentralize detailed planning and execution to ensure that the conduct of mission-related training sustains strengths and overcomes the weaknesses unique to each unit. Decentralized execution promotes subordinate leaders’ initiative to train their units, but does not mean senior leaders give up their responsibilities to supervise training, develop leaders, and provide feedback. BATTLE FOCUS 2-59. Battle focus is the concept used to derive peacetime training requirements from assigned missions. The priority of training in units is to train to standard on the wartime mission. Battle focus guides the planning, preparation, execution, and assessment of each organization’s training program to ensure that its members train as they are going to fight. Battle focus is critical throughout the entire training process and is used by commanders to allocate resources for training based on wartime and operational mission requirements. Battle focus enables commanders and staffs at all echelons to structure a training program to cope with non-mission-related requirements while focusing on mission essential training activities. Battle focus recognizes that a unit cannot attain proficiency to standard on every task, whether due to time or other resource constraints. The commander must focus on those critical tasks essential to mission accomplishment. 2-14 _____________________________________________________________ Battle Focused Training 2-60. A critical aspect of the battle focus concept is to understand the responsibility for, and the linkage between, collective mission essential tasks and the supporting individual tasks. The diagram in figure 2-6 depicts the relationships and the proper sequence to derive optimum training benefit from each training opportunity. 2-61. The commander and the CSM or 1SG work together to coordinate the collective mission essential tasks and individual training tasks on which the unit will focus during a given period. The CSM or 1SG identifies the supporting individual tasks for each collective task. The unit’s ARTEP-MTP provides an excellent resource for this process. It contains a comprehensive listing of all combat-critical collective tasks cross-referenced to supporting individual tasks by task number and title. Although NCOs have the primary role in training and sustaining individual soldier skills, officers at every level are responsible for training to established standards during both individual and collective training. Figure 2-6. Integration of Collective and Individual Training 2-62. Battle focus is applied to all missions across the full spectrum of operations. Units may be diverted from their primary wartime mission to execute stability or support tasks. Successful execution of stability operations or support operations is important in the pursuit of national objectives. Generally, MACOM and corps commanders know in advance of the requirement to perform stability or support missions and identify those organizations required to perform these critical missions. Commanders of these identified organizations are responsible for 2-15 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ conducting a mission analysis and, based on the results, for developing a METL for the directed mission. They identify and train to standard on the directed-mission METL. If time permits prior to deployment, units should execute a mission rehearsal exercise (MRE) with all participating units. 2-63. Upon being relieved from a directed mission, the unit reverts to its assigned wartime mission and associated METL. The commander uses the training management cycle first to identify specific training requirements, then to plan, prepare, and execute training that reestablishes proficiency in the unit’s wartime METL. Commanders recognize and take into account the additional time this reintegration process may take. ARMY TRAINING MANAGEMENT CYCLE 2-64. The foundation of the training process is the Army Training Management Cycle (figure 2-7). In the METL development process (chapter 3), training must relate to the organization’s wartime operational plans and must focus on METL tasks. The availability of resources does not affect METL development. The METL is an unconstrained statement of the tasks required to accomplish wartime missions. Resources for training, however, are constrained, and compete with other missions and requirements. Leaders develop synchronized long-range, short-range, and near-term training plans (chapter 4) to effectively utilize available resources to train for proficiency on METL tasks. After training plans are developed, units execute training by preparing, conducting, and recovering from training (chapter 5). The process continues with training evaluations that provide bottom-up input to organizational assessments. Organizational assessments provide necessary feedback to the senior commander and help the commander prepare the training assessment (chapter 6). SUMMARY 2-65. Commanders at all levels are responsible for training their units to standard. It is their number one priority. Commanders follow the ten principles of training, structure their training program using a top-down, bottom-up approach, and use battle focus to guide the planning, preparation, execution, and assessment of training. 2-16 _____________________________________________________________ Battle Focused Training Figure 2-7.

The METL development process links the unit’s wartime operational mission with its training. Battle focused training programs are based on wartime operational requirements. Army organizations, whether they are AC or RC, Modification Table of Organization and Equipment (MTOE) or Table of Distribution and Allowances (TDA), cannot achieve and sustain proficiency on every possible training task. The commander is responsible for identifying the tasks essential to accomplish the organization’s wartime operational mission. Battle focused METL identifies the tasks essential to accomplish the unit’s wartime operational mission and provides the foundation for the unit’s training program. All company- level and above units, AC and RC, MTOE and TDA, develop a METL. Staffs at each level also develop a METL that supports their unit’s METL. Detachments that are organized with a commander and under a distinct MTOE or TDA (for example, special forces detachments, explosive ordnance detachments, transportation port operation cargo detachments, and preventive medicine medical detachments) are examples of these units. 3-2. The METL development process is the catalyst to focus training on wartime operational missions. It— Uses the wartime operational mission and other inputs to METL development to focus the unit’s training on essential tasks. Provides a forum for professional discussion and leader development among senior, subordinate, and adjacent commanders concerning the linkage between mission and training. Enables subordinate commanders and key NCOs to crosswalk collective, leader, and individual tasks to the mission. Leads to “buy-in” and commitment to the organization’s training plan by unit leaders. 3-3. Figure 3-1 depicts the process commanders use to identify and select the mission essential tasks that make up the METL. 3-2 __________________________________________ Mission Essential Task List (METL) Development Figure 3-1. Mission Essential Task List Development Process INPUTS TO METL DEVELOPMENT 3-4. There are five primary inputs to METL development— Wartime operational plans. The most critical input to METL development is the organization’s wartime operational mission. Enduring combat capabilities. The fundamental reason for the organization and operation of Army forces is to generate effects of combined arms. Army commanders form combat, CS, and CSS forces into cohesive teams through training for combat proficiency. Enduring combat capabilities are the unique contribution each unit makes to ensure that the Army successfully accomplishes any mission, anytime, anywhere. Operational environment. The six dimensions of the operational environment are defined in FM 3-0, Chapter 1. They are: threat, political, unified action, land combat operations, information, and technology. Directed missions. Army organizations are frequently directed to execute a mission other than their assigned wartime operational mission. These missions can range from major combat operations to humanitarian assistance, security cooperation activities, or other types of stability operations or support operations, and often include a combination of all of these mission types. External guidance. External guidance serves as an additional source of training tasks that relate to an organization’s wartime operational mission. Some examples of these external sources of guidance are— Higher headquarters directives. ARTEP-MTPs. Mobilization plans. Installation wartime transition and deployment plans. 3-3 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Force integration plans. Army Universal Task List (AUTL). Universal Joint Task List (UJTL). 3-5. The UJTL (CJCSM 3500.04C) serves as a common language and common reference system for joint force commanders to communicate mission requirements. It is the basic language for developing a joint METL (JMETL). The UJTL defines tasks and functions performed by joint headquarters, the Army, and other service components operating at the operational and strategic levels of war. 3-6. The AUTL (FM 7-15) is a comprehensive listing of Army tactical- level collective tasks and functions for tactical units (company through corps) and staffs. It complements the UJTL. The AUTL provides a basis for establishing unit-specific ARTEP-MTP linkage to the UJTL. This mission-to-task-to-training linkage assists forces in training the way they intend to fight. The AUTL— Provides a common, doctrinal structure for Army tactical mission tasks. Articulates what the Army does to accomplish missions. Applies to all four types of military operations (offense, defense, stability, support). Lists collective Army tactical tasks subordinate to each of the seven BOS. 3-7. Figure 3-2 illustrates the UJTL, AUTL, and ARTEP-MTP relationship. Figure 3-2. UJTL–AUTL–ARTEP-MTP Crosswalk 3-4 __________________________________________ Mission Essential Task List (METL) Development 3-8. Unit-specific doctrinal manuals are primary sources for training tasks. The applicable ARTEP-MTP is a good starting point for selecting collective tasks to support the missions at the battalion and company levels. Leaders may develop task lists using the following sources when no ARTEP-MTP exists— MTOE. TDA. Tactical standing operating procedures (TSOPs). ARTEP-MTPs for other units with similar organization or a similar mission or task. Technical manuals (TMs). Training circulars (TCs). Combined Arms Center (CAC) Lessons Learned Data Base. Readiness standing operating procedures (RSOPs). State operational contingency plans for the ARNG. 3-9. METLs may vary significantly in similar types of organizations because of different wartime operational missions and geographical location. For example, a continental United States (CONUS)-based power projection organization may identify strategic deployment requirements as critical tasks while a like forward-deployed organization may identify tactical deployment requirements such as rapid assembly and tactical road march as critical tasks. Geography also influences the selection of different mission essential tasks for units. The presence of significant water obstacles; mountainous terrain; tropical, cold, or desert environments; indigenous population patterns; and other related demographics all have the potential to affect an organization’s METL. COMMANDERS’ ANALYSIS 3-10. To identify mission essential tasks, the commander conducts an analysis of the unit’s operational mission. In the absence of a directed operational mission, analysis is based on the unit’s assigned mission in wartime operational plans. In the absence of clear alignment with wartime operational plans, mission analysis is based on analysis of missions for which the unit was designed to accomplish in wartime, as established in the unit’s MTOE/TDA and how-to-fight doctrine. Higher commanders provide guidance to help their subordinate commanders focus their analysis. Mission analysis results in identification of specified and implied tasks the unit must perform and in a restatement of the unit’s mission. To provide battle focus, the commander identifies those tasks critical for mission accomplishment. These tasks constitute the organization’s METL. The next higher commander approves the METL. A change of operational mission requires the commander to analyze the mission again and adjust the unit’s METL accordingly. 3-11. The METL development process reduces the number of tasks on which the organization must train and focuses the organization's training efforts on the most important collective training tasks required to accomplish the mission. 3-5 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ METL DEVELOPMENT FUNDAMENTALS 3-12. The following fundamentals apply to METL development— The METL is derived from the organization’s war plans and related tasks in external guidance. Mission essential tasks must apply to the entire organization. METL does not include tasks assigned solely to subordinate organizations. Each organization’s METL must support and complement the METL of higher headquarters or the supported unit. The availability of resources does not affect METL development. The METL is an unconstrained statement of tasks required to accomplish wartime missions. METL is not prioritized; however, all tasks may not require equal training time. Commanders direct operations and integrate the BOS through plans and orders. The BOS are used to systematically ensure that the interdependent organizational tasks necessary to generate, sustain, and apply combat power are directed toward accomplishing the overall mission. 3-13. Figure 3-3 summarizes the fundamental concepts in the METL development process: ♦ METL is derived from the organization’s war plans and related tasks in external guidance. ♦ METL must apply to the entire organization. METL does not include tasks assigned solely to subordinate organizations. ♦ METL must support and complement the METL of higher headquarters. METL for CS and CSS units must also support and complement the supported unit METL. ♦ Resource availability does not affect METL development. METL is an unconstrained statement of tasks required to accomplish wartime missions. ♦ METL is not prioritized. However, all tasks may not require equal training time. ♦ Commanders use BOS to apply combat power. Figure 3-3. Fundamental Concepts Used in METL Development BATTLEFIELD OPERATING SYSTEMS 3-14. The battlefield operating systems (BOS) are— Intelligence. Maneuver. Fire support. Air defense. Mobility/countermobility/survivability. Combat service support. Command and control. 3-6 __________________________________________ Mission Essential Task List (METL) Development INTELLIGENCE 3-15. The intelligence system plans, directs, collects, processes, produces, and disseminates intelligence on the threat and the environment; performs intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB); and accomplishes other intelligence tasks. Intelligence is developed as a part of a continuous process and is fundamental to Army operations. MANEUVER 3-16. Commanders maneuver forces to create the conditions for tactical and operational success. Maneuver involves movement to achieve positions of advantage with respect to enemy forces. Through maneuver, friendly forces gain the ability to destroy enemy forces or hinder enemy movement by direct and indirect application of firepower or threat of its application. FIRE SUPPORT 3-17. Fire support consists of fires that directly support land, maritime, amphibious, and special operations forces in engaging enemy forces, combat formations, and facilities in pursuit of tactical and operational objectives. Fire support integrates and synchronizes fires and effects to delay, disrupt, or destroy enemy forces, systems, and facilities. The fire support system includes the collective and coordinated use of target acquisition data, indirect fire weapons, fixed-winged aircraft, electronic warfare, and other lethal and non-lethal means to attack targets. AIR DEFENSE 3-18. Air defense protects the force from air and missile attack and aerial surveillance. It prevents enemies from interdicting friendly forces while freeing commanders to synchronize maneuver and fire power. Weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and proliferation of missile technology increase the importance of the air defense systems. MOBILITY/COUNTERMOBILITY/SURVIVABILITY 3-19. Mobility operations preserve the freedom of maneuver for friendly forces. Mobility missions include breaching obstacles, increasing battlefield circulation, improving or building roads, providing bridge and raft support, and identifying routes around contaminated areas. Countermobility denies mobility to enemy forces. Survivability operations protect friendly forces from the effects of enemy weapon systems and from natural occurrences. NBC defense measures are essential survivability tasks. COMBAT SERVICE SUPPORT 3-20. Combat service support (CSS) provides the physical means with which forces operate, from the production base and replacement centers in CONUS to soldiers engaged in close combat. CSS includes many technical specialties and functional activities. It maximizes the use of host nation infrastructure and contracted support. 3-7 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ COMMAND AND CONTROL 3-21. Command and control (C2) has two components—the commander and the C2 system. The C2 system supports the commander’s ability to make informed decisions, delegate authority, and synchronize the BOS. Moreover, the C2 system supports the commander’s ability to adjust plans for future operations, even while focusing on current operations. Reliable communications are central to C2 systems. Staffs work within the commander’s intent to direct units and control resource allocations. Through C2, commanders initiate and integrate all BOS toward the common goal—mission accomplishment. METL DEVELOPMENT SEQUENCE 3-22. Commanders involve subordinate commanders, their CSM or 1SG, and key NCOs in METL development to create a team approach to battle focused training. Subordinate participation develops a common understanding of the organization’s critical wartime operational mission requirements so that METLs throughout the organization are mutually supporting. Subordinate commanders can subsequently apply insights gained during preparation of the next higher headquarters’ METL in the development of their METL. The CSM/1SG and other key NCOs must understand the organization’s collective METL so that they can identify individual tasks for each collective mission essential task. 3-23. The higher commander should use the METL for leader development. The senior commander can have a professional dialogue with subordinates on METL development, selection of battle tasks, and training. This dialogue gives the commander the opportunity to coach and mentor subordinates and train them for positions of higher authority. This mentoring and training should be done at all levels. BATTLE TASKS 3-24. After review and approval of subordinate organizations’ METL, the senior commander selects battle tasks. A battle task is a staff or subordinate organization mission essential task that is so critical that its accomplishment determines the success of the next higher organization’s mission essential task. Similar units may have different battle tasks selected, depending on their mission. Battle tasks are selected down to the company level. Company commanders are the lowest echelon commander that selects battle tasks. Battle tasks allow the senior commander to define the training tasks that— Integrate the BOS. Receive the highest priority for resources, such as ammunition, training areas, facilities (to include live and virtual simulators and constructive simulations), materiel, and funds. Receive emphasis during external evaluations. 3-25. Figure 3-4 depicts the higher-to-lower relationship of mission and METL. It illustrates the relationship the subordinate units’ METL has with the higher headquarters’ METL through the selection of battle tasks. Although an MTOE brigade is used as the example, the METL/battle/critical/leader/individual task construction is the same for 3-8 __________________________________________ Mission Essential Task List (METL) Development all units, including TDA, echelons above division, and echelons above corps— Battalions have METL tasks selected as brigade battle tasks. Companies have METL tasks selected as battalion battle tasks. Platoons have critical tasks selected as company battle tasks. 3-26. Figure 3-4 also shows the connection between a company METL and platoon, squad, leader, and individual soldier tasks. These relationships are examined in detail later in this chapter. Figure 3-4. Relationships between Mission, METL, Critical Tasks, and Battle Task BRIGADE METL DEVELOPMENT 3-27. The BCT commander involves all subordinate combat, CS, and CSS unit commanders, their CSM/1SG’s, and the BCT staff in the METL development process. Their participation ensures a better understanding of the BCT mission and METL, providing insights that can be applied when they develop their METL. The BCT commander follows the METL development sequence shown in figure 3-5. 3-9 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ METL DEVELOPMENT SEQUENCE: • Analyze brigade assigned mission and identify specified and implied tasks. • Analyze operational environment and external guidance. • Review division commander’s mission and METL. • Restate the brigade’s operational mission. • Identify collective tasks that support the brigade’s restated mission.

METL Crosswalk COMPANY METL DEVELOPMENT Description 3-33. The company commander involves the 1SG, all platoon leaders, and key NCOs in the company METL development process. Their participation ensures a better understanding of the company’s mission and METL, providing them insights that can be applied when they develop the platoon critical tasks and platoon-level leader tasks. The company commander follows the METL development sequence shown in figure 3-8. 3-12 __________________________________________ Mission Essential Task List (METL) Development METL DEVELOPMENT SEQUENCE: • Analyze company assigned mission and identify specified and implied tasks. • Analyze operational environment and external guidance. • Review battalion commander’s mission and METL. • Restate company operational mission. • Identify collective tasks that support the company’s restated mission.

Back-briefs the battalion commander and obtains approval of the company METL. The battalion commander selects specific company METL tasks as battalion battle tasks. Provides the approved METL to the platoon leaders and other subordinate leaders. 3-35. The importance of METL development followed by the collective task to individual task crosswalk at company, battery, and troop level and below cannot be over emphasized. Figure 3-9 illustrates the company commander’s analysis sequence used during METL development. The company commander pays particular attention to company METL tasks selected by the battalion commander as battalion battle tasks. The company commander must acknowledge the critical importance of achieving and sustaining proficiency on company METL tasks necessary to the battalion accomplishing its wartime operational mission. 3-13 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 3-9.

Brigade Support Medical Company METL Development PLATOON CRITICAL TASK AND DRILL LIST DEVELOPMENT Description 3-39. Platoon and below must perform critical tasks that are essential to company METL accomplishment. The development of the platoon critical tasks and drills list requires discussion between the company commander and platoon leader— The company commander and 1SG discuss the company mission and METL with the platoon leader and platoon sergeant (PSG). The platoon leader back-briefs the company commander on the platoon mission. The platoon leader, with the PSG, and using the appropriate ARTEP-MTP, selects platoon critical tasks and drills that support the company METL and platoon mission. The platoon leader discusses the proposed platoon critical tasks and drills list with the company commander. The company commander provides feedback on the selected platoon critical tasks and drills list. The company commander approves (modifies as necessary) the platoon critical tasks and drills list. The company commander designates platoon-level leader tasks that are essential for the platoon leader to execute platoon critical tasks and drills to standard. 3-16 __________________________________________ Mission Essential Task List (METL) Development 3-40. Figure 3-13 illustrates company commander, platoon leader, and PSG actions during selection of platoon critical tasks and drills and platoon-level leader tasks.

Selection of Medical Individual Soldier Tasks 3-23 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ STAFF METL 3-54. The staff consists of the battalion staff, and attached and direct support CS and CSS elements. Battalion staff and CS and CSS leaders develop mission essential tasks that support the battalion METL. They use the same process as the battalion and company commanders to develop their METL. Staff METLs are reviewed and approved by the battalion executive officer. 3-55. The battalion commander must ensure that the staff METL integrates combined arms tasks and functional tasks to enable the battalion to fight as a combined arms team. As additional assets are task- organized, they must be integrated into the staff. The process for developing the staff METL and associated staff officer tasks for the infantry battalion of the BCT is shown in figure 3-25. Figure 3-25. Infantry Battalion Staff METL Development 3-56. The BCT FA battalion commander—as the effects coordinator (ECOORD)—ensures that the staff METL integrates combined arms tasks and fire support functional tasks to enable the battalion to support the BCT commander’s maneuver operations. Figure 3-26 provides an example of how the BCT ECOORD might develop the BCT effects coordination cell (ECC), battalion fire support element (FSE), and FA battalion TOC and FDC staff METL tasks. 3-24 __________________________________________ Mission Essential Task List (METL) Development Figure 3-26.

Figure 3-28 provides an example of the development of staff METL and associated staff officer tasks for the BSB. Figure 3-28. Brigade Support Battalion (BSB) Staff METL Development SPECIALTY PLATOON CRITICAL TASK LIST DEVELOPMENT 3-59. The wide-ranging METL tasks of the battalion headquarters and headquarters company (HHC) to support the command, control, and logistics of the battalion include the critical tasks of specialty platoons. The collective tasks of the battalion’s specialty platoons directly support the battalion METL. The battalion commander could select one or more of these tasks as battalion battle tasks. Specialty platoon critical tasks are developed in the same manner as for other platoons. 3-60. The HHC commander is responsible for specialty platoon training, although the battalion commander may direct a key staff element to exercise oversight of a specialty platoon. C2 of specialty platoons while conducting wartime operational missions may vary greatly depending on the mission and type of organization. However, the process that identifies specialty platoon critical tasks and training requirements remains the responsibility of the HHC commander. RESERVE COMPONENT METL DEVELOPMENT 3-61. The METL development process is the same for AC and RC organizations. Battle focus is essential so RC commanders can concentrate their time on the most critical premobilization wartime training requirements. The associate AC chain of command assigns missions, provides wartime mission guidance, and approves the METL. The state adjutant general or regional support groups review and 3-26 __________________________________________ Mission Essential Task List (METL) Development coordinate RC METLs. They resource training and ensure that mission training tasks are executed and evaluated. Table 3-1 shows some typical relationships between the RC unit and its associated AC unit. Table 3-1.

ECHELON ABOVE DIVISION/ECHELON ABOVE CORPS METL DEVELOPMENT 3-62. Commanders of echelon above division (EAD) and echelon above corps (EAC) organizations use the same battle focus concept and METL development process previously described in this chapter to focus their training. TABLE OF DISTRIBUTION AND ALLOWANCES METL DEVELOPMENT 3-63. The METL development process for Table of Distribution and Allowances (TDA) organizations is the same as for MTOE organizations. For TDA organizations, the senior leader derives METL from the organization’s peacetime mission and any known wartime mission. The TDA organization’s METL represents those critical tasks that the 3-27 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ organization must be able to perform and provides focus for the organization’s training 3-64. The METL must reflect tasks derived by integrating required support mission tasks with warfighting skills. These tasks range from wartime mobilization requirements to support for disasters or local emergencies. 3-65. Some missions may not change for TDA units during wartime (including soldier and equipment support requirements for TRADOC schools and support of recurring garrison or installation tasks). For example, training battalions and companies will continue to train soldiers and leaders. 3-66. A sample garrison TDA METL is shown in figure 3-29. The garrison commander involves all subordinate directors in METL development. The mission and METL of subordinate directorates support the garrison’s mission and METL. This is the same relationship found between MTOE units. Note that subordinate directorate missions and METLs complement and support other directorates as well as the garrison mission and METL. Figure 3-29. Garrison METL Development METL DEVELOPMENT FOR DIRECTED CHANGE OF MISSION 3-67. When an organization is directed to conduct a mission other than its assigned wartime mission, such as a peacekeeping operation, the Army Training Management Cycle still applies. These missions can span the full spectrum of operations. For MTOE organizations, these missions 3-28 __________________________________________ Mission Essential Task List (METL) Development may include a range of operations from combat operations in a major theater of war to providing humanitarian assistance or other forms of support to civilian authorities. For TDA organizations, these missions range from mobilization-related operations to installation force protection operations. The unit’s wartime METL serves as a foundation upon which adjustments may be required. 3-68. Using the wartime METL as the foundation, commanders who are directed to change mission conduct a mission analysis, identify METL tasks, and assess training proficiency for the new mission. Any required adjustment to the unit’s METL for the new mission generates a similar requirement for subordinate units to adjust their METLs, critical task lists, and individual soldier task lists. 3-69. In cases where mission tasks involve emerging doctrine or non- standard tasks, commanders establish tasks, conditions, and standards using mission orders and guidance, lessons learned from similar operations, and their professional judgment. Senior commanders approve standards established for these tasks as part of the normal METL approval process. If time permits prior to deployment, units should execute a mission rehearsal exercise (MRE) with all participating units. TRAINING OBJECTIVES 3-70. After mission essential tasks are selected, commanders develop each METL task statement into a complete statement of required unit performance for mission success. Doing so establishes the training objective for each METL task consisting of— Task. A clearly defined and measurable activity accomplished by organizations and individuals. Condition(s). The circumstances and environment in which a task is to be performed. Standard. The minimum acceptable proficiency required in the performance of a particular training task. 3-71. Each time a METL task is selected as a training objective, the tasks and standards remain the same for different training events. However, conditions may be varied for different training events to match the skill level of the training audience at the time. TASK 3-72. After identifying battalion and company METLs, supporting platoon and squad collective tasks, and supporting leader and soldier tasks, leaders establish the conditions and standard for each task using the applicable ARTEP-MTP and STP. CONDITIONS 3-73. Commanders modify conditions to fit the training environment and their assessment of the units’ level of proficiency. By following a crawl- walk-run approach to training, commanders may decide to modify conditions to increase the level of difficulty under which a task is performed. This technique is particularly useful when moving from crawl to walk and eventually to run level training on a specific task. The goal is 3-29 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ to create a realistic and demanding training environment with the resources available. 3-74. To modify a condition statement, the commander takes the following steps: Reads the existing ARTEP-MTP or STP statement. (It is deliberately general because a more specific conditions statement may not apply to all units.) Reads the applicable references with suggested support requirements and identifies the resources needed to train the task. Considers the local situation—ammunition available, opposing force (OPFOR), time, terrain, ranges, TADSS, and weather conditions. Prepares a revised condition statement. Conditions established should be realistic and practical. 3-75. The condition statement includes comments on one or more of the following: Status and capability of threat forces. Equipment, material, tools, or other resources allocated for use in performing the task. References, checklists, and other memory aids for use during actual task performance. Physical or environmental conditions; for example, darkness, dense tropical forests, cold weather, or NBC conditions. Assistance available during performance of the task. Time allocated for task performance. Restrictions or limitations. STANDARD 3-76. The standard for most tasks is found in the applicable ARTEP-MTP and STP. The standard for task performance is the Army standard. For tasks without published training objectives, commanders establish task, condition, and standards using mission orders and guidance, lessons learned from similar exercises or operations, and their professional judgment. The commander who approves these specific tasks, conditions, and standards also approves the unit’s METL. Commanders may use the following documents to help develop appropriate tasks, conditions, and standards: ARTEP-MTP. STP. DA PAM 350-38. Deployment or mobilization plans. AUTL. UJTL. Army, MACOM, and local regulations. Local SOP. FMs. Equipment TMs and TCs. 3-77.

Training excellence requires mastery of Army doctrine by all leaders in the chain of command. Commanders must allow subordinates the freedom to develop their training programs in concert with their approved METL. Training meetings and training schedule lock-ins must work if excellence in training is to be attained. Commanders must establish discipline in the training management process and lock in training calendars in accordance with established doctrine. 4-2. Division and brigade-level commanders establish direction and focus for training. They allocate resources, ensure stability and predictability, protect training from interference, and discipline the training planning process. Division and brigade commanders ensure that ARTEP-MTP and STP standards are met during training; if they are not met, these commanders ensure that retraining is conducted until the tasks are performed to standard. They fence resources and shield prime time training from unprogrammed, last-minute, non-mission-related tasks. They reduce compliance training requirements in their command training guidance (CTG). They establish policies that allow exceptions to compliance training requirements to enable subordinates to focus on METL proficiency. Division and brigade commanders ensure that all subordinate leaders discipline the training management process. 4-3. Excellence in training requires excellence in both training management and training execution—but one cannot achieve excellence in training execution without excellence in training management. TRAINING PLANNING PROCESS 4-4. This chapter describes the training planning process of the Army Training Management Cycle and illustrates how leaders plan training. The training planning process links the unit’s METL with execution of battle focused training by emphasizing the connection of the unit’s METL assessment with the execution of battle focused training. Figure 4-1 depicts the training planning process used to develop battle focused training programs. Figure 4-1. Training Planning Process 4-2 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning 4-5. The training planning process is the same for long-range, short- range, and near-term training planning. Commanders at all echelons— AC and RC, MTOE, and TDA—assess training, provide guidance, and publish training plans. What differs is the complexity of assessment, the scope, scale, and form of the command guidance, and associated future planning horizons between command echelons in AC and RC organizations and units. These differences are by deliberate design and are intended to simplify how units and organizations address the common training challenge at all echelons—maintaining warfighting readiness. Organizations and units achieve warfighting readiness when commanders ensure that training is executed to the Army standard under realistic conditions. Maintaining warfighting readiness requires senior commanders to give subordinate commanders adequate time to plan, prepare, and execute training to standard. Senior commanders support execution of training to standard when they— Enforce and discipline the training management process. Emphasize comprehensive organizational and unit aggregate assessments. Develop training strategies that integrate combat, CS, and CSS unit training plans in the form of combined arms multiechelon training. Align training priorities and allocate available training resources with operational METL training requirements. Protect subordinate units from changes once training schedules are published. 4-6. Commanders integrate the risk management process with the training planning process to enable tough, realistic training. During the training planning phase, commanders identify training proficiency shortfalls that may create a risk hazard, as well as other safety hazards. They then establish controls to eliminate those hazards. Risk management is as integral to the operations process as it is to the training planning process. During operations, commanders identify enemy capabilities and other hazards that may prevent successful completion of the mission, and identify actions to reduce or mitigate those capabilities and hazards. In both training and operations, risk management is a continuous process. SECTION I. TRAINING ASSESSMENT 4-7. A training assessment begins the training planning process— whether one is developing long-range training plans, short-range plans, or near-term training schedules. Commanders assess their unit’s ability to execute mission essential tasks based on personal observations, training evaluation results, and input from subordinates. For battle tasks that support their METL, commanders collect performance assessments from responsible subordinates, key staff members, and NCO leaders. Additionally, commanders analyze all available evaluations of task proficiency from recent training events. Commanders use these evaluations, personal observations, and other feedback (such as CTC take home packages) to arrive at an overall assessment of the unit’s ability to perform each METL task. Results of the commander’s assessment represent training requirements—tasks on which performance needs 4-3 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ improvement and other tasks on which performance needs to be sustained. 4-8. Assessment links the evaluation of training that has been executed to the planning of upcoming training. The commander develops a strategy to improve proficiency on specific weaknesses and plans sustainment training on demonstrated strengths. Figure 4-2 highlights that the training planning process starts with the commander’s training assessment. Figure 4-2. Training Planning Process (Training Assessment) 4-9. A risk assessment parallels the training assessment. It identifies training proficiency shortfalls that could create a hazard and prevent achievement of the training objectives. Hazard controls in the form of education and training, physical safety measures, and avoidance are then established to enhance safety and promote realism. ASSESSMENTS BY COMMANDERS OF BATTALIONS, BRIGADES, AND ABOVE 4-10. Commanders of battalions, brigades, and above rely on their own firsthand observations as well as evaluation input and feedback from the following sources: Subordinate commander evaluations of their unit’s current proficiency on supporting battle tasks. Coordinating, special, and personal staff officer evaluations of their staff’s current proficiency on supporting staff battle tasks. NCO leader evaluations of their unit’s current proficiency on supporting critical individual, crew, and small team tasks. All leader’s evaluations of their subordinate leaders’ current proficiency on critical leader tasks. ARTEP external evaluations (EXEVALs), CTC rotation take- home packages, AT reports, operational and readiness deployment exercise AARs, Expert Infantry Badge (EIB) and Expert Field Medic Badge (EFMB) results, field training exercise (FTX) evaluations, etc. 4-4 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning Organizational Inspection Program (OIP) trend reports, and other reports, such as monthly unit status reports (USRs), etc. Subordinate commanders’ risk assessments of training shortfalls that could create a hazard. ASSESSMENTS BY COMMANDERS OF COMPANIES, BATTERIES, AND TROOPS 4-11. Company, battery, and troop commanders likewise rely on their own firsthand observations as well as evaluation input and feedback from the following sources: Subordinate leader evaluations of their unit’s current proficiency on supporting critical collective tasks. 1SG, PSG, and other key NCO evaluations of their unit’s current proficiency on supporting critical section, squad, crew, and individual soldier tasks. All leader’s evaluations of their subordinate leaders’ current proficiency on critical leader tasks. EXEVALs, CTC rotation take-home packages, AT reports, operational and readiness deployment exercise AARs, results and trends from higher headquarter’s OIP, and other reports such as monthly USRs, etc. Subordinate leader reports on risk management principles and potential training hazards. ASSESSMENTS BY NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS 4-12. NCOs may use a leader book and battle rosters to record section, squad, crew, and soldier tasks evaluations— Leader books. Leader books are a tool for the NCO to maintain up-to-date, easy-to-reference information on soldiers, training status, maintenance status, and equipment accountability. NCOs use these books to record and track soldier proficiency on mission- oriented tasks. The exact composition of leader books varies depending on the mission and type of unit. Leader books are used to— Track and evaluate soldiers’ training status and proficiency on essential soldier tasks. Provide feedback to the chain of command on the training proficiency of the squad or crew. Conduct soldier performance counseling. Battle rosters. Battle rosters are maintained at battalion level and below to track key training information on selected mission essential systems. The exact composition of battle rosters varies depending on the mission and type of unit. Battle rosters are used to— Track such pertinent training data as crew stability, manning levels, and qualification status. Track training and qualification status of backup operators or crew members assigned in other positions in the organization. Track key training information on selected weapon and support systems, such as tanks, howitzers, automated C2 systems, forklifts, etc. 4-5 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ ASSESSMENT RATINGS 4-13. The commander’s training assessment is required for each METL task. Task proficiency is rated as— “T” (trained): The unit is trained and has demonstrated proficiency in accomplishing the task to the Army standard. The leader judges task performance to be free of significant shortcomings. Training on “T” tasks is designed to sustain proficiency on that task. “P” (needs practice): The unit can perform the task with some shortcomings. Performance has demonstrated that the unit does not achieve the standard without some difficulty or has failed to perform some task steps to standard. The shortcomings are not severe enough to require complete retraining. Only refresher training is required. “U” (untrained): The unit cannot demonstrate an ability to achieve wartime proficiency. The leader prepares a comprehensive plan to train all supporting tasks not executed to standard. Unless the task is a new METL task, a rating of “U” indicates a serious training deficiency and reflects on the unit’s wartime readiness posture. EVALUATION RATINGS 4-14. Evaluation ratings are given for specific task proficiency and should not be confused with leader assessments. Evaluation ratings are ratings assigned directly to the performance of a specific task or component steps of a task. The standard evaluation ratings, discussed further in chapter 6, are as follows: “GO”: The task or performance step of a task was performed to standard. A rating of GO is normally awarded if all steps in the task are passed. “NO GO”: The task or any performance step in the task was not performed to standard. BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM COMMANDER ASSESSMENT EXAMPLE DESCRIPTION 4-15. The following discussion illustrates the conduct of the brigade commander’s assessment of the BCT’s overall training proficiency on the METL task “Conduct an Attack.” The example demonstrates the bottom- up feed of training assessments of individual task and collective tasks proficiency from three different battalions and the brigade staff. This bottom-up flow enables the brigade commander to develop a training strategy to improve the BCT’s proficiency. 4-16. An extract from the BCT commander’s overall METL assessment for the task “Conduct an Attack” is shown in Table 4-1. As shown, the BCT commander has rendered an overall assessment of the METL task “Conduct an Attack” as “P” (needs practice) based on the analysis of unit and staff evaluation input, personal observations, and other records and reports. 4-6 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning Table 4-1.

The BCT commander began the assessment of the METL task “Conduct an Attack” with a review of the METL crosswalk shown in figure 4-3. The BCT commander used this crosswalk as a start point to identify specific combined arms tasks and functional tasks on which evaluation input was required from battalions, separate companies, and staff sections. 4-18. Combined arms training presents commanders with unique assessment challenges. Combined arms training assessments require commanders to consider combined arms task and functional task evaluations to arrive at an accurate assessment of their organization’s METL proficiency. 4-7 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 4-3. METL Crosswalk BCT SUBORDINATE COMMANDERS’ ASSESSMENT INPUT 4-19. To arrive at the assessment in table 4-1, subordinate commanders identified specific battalion and separate company shortcomings. Some of the subordinate unit shortcomings they identified are— 1-77 IN: “P for “Assault an Objective.” “U” for “Breach an Obstacle.” FA battalion: “P” for “Coordinate Fire Support.” “P” for “Acquire Targets.” “P” for “Deliver Fires.” MI company: “P” for “Conduct Collection Management (CM) and Intelligence Production and Dissemination (IP&D).” “P” “Perform Target Development.” “P” for “Conduct All Source Analysis System (ASAS) Operations.” Engineer company: “P” for “Conduct Engineer Planning and Coordination.” “P” for “Conduct Mobility/CounterMobility/Survivability (M/CM/S) Operations.” Brigade Signal Company (BSC): “P” for “Establish Common Operational Picture (COP).” “P” for “Install, Operate, Maintain & Troubleshoot (IOMT) FBCB2, EPLRS & SINCGARS.” “P” for “Employ, Operate & Maintain (EOM) AN/TSC-154 TACSAT.” 4-8 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning BSB: “P” for “Defend Against Level I and II Threats.” “P” for “Provide Direct Support (DS) Level CSS.” 4-20. The following subsections walk through the bottom-up feedback the subordinate commanders used to provide their combined arms task(s) and functional task(s) evaluation input to the BCT commander’s overall assessment of the METL task “Conduct an Attack.” For purposes of brevity, the examples highlight only selected input from the 1-77 IN battalion, the FA battalion, the BSB battalion, and the BCT staff training assessments. These assessments conclude in the brigade commander’s training assessment and begin the development of the BCT training strategy. Infantry Battalion Assessment Input 4-21. The 1-77 IN commander assesses “Breach an Obstacle” as “U”, and “Assault an Objective” as “P”. Figure 4-4 provides a simple illustration of bottom-up feedback and input the commander receives and considers in determining the unit’s current proficiency on this particular METL task. Figure 4-4. “Bottom-Up” Input (Conduct an Attack) 4-22. Tables 4-2 through 4-5 illustrate the detailed, bottom-up input the infantry battalion commander uses to assist in the BCT commander’s assessment. 4-23. Squad leader input. The bottom-up input starts with the squad leader’s evaluation of the team leaders’ and soldiers’ ability to perform supporting critical leader and individual tasks. Note that these leader 4-9 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ and individual tasks are common to almost all potential critical squad collective tasks and drills. The squad leader reviews the team leader’s and individual soldier’s training records and identifies the following shortcomings: Individual tasks: “P” for engaging targets (day and night) with M16A2, M203, and M249 SAW. “U” for “Move as a Fire Team Member.” Fire team leader tasks: “P” for “Control Organic Fires.” “P” for “Conduct Squad Maneuver.” “P” for “Analyze Terrain.” “P” for “Conduct Troop Leading Procedures.” “P” for “Identify and Assess Hazards.” 4-24.

The BCT commander uses the assessments shown in figures 4-21 and 4-22 to develop a training strategy to improve the BCT’s overall training proficiency on the METL task “Conduct an Attack.” The following section describes and illustrates training strategy development for the BCT and subordinate units. SECTION II. TRAINING STRATEGY OVERVIEW 4-58. Commanders use the training strategy concept to describe the ends, ways, and means to achieve and sustain training proficiency on METL tasks. Figure 4-8 illustrates that the training strategy links the commander’s training assessment with the commander’s training guidance in the training planning process. 4-27 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 4-8. Training Planning Process (Training Strategy) 4-59. Training strategies are based on the concept of mission command. The training strategy, like mission command— Allows decentralized decisionmaking and execution within an overarching intent. Provides a point of common reference for subordinates to exercise initiative to develop complementary and supporting training strategies. Allocates resources. 4-60. The training strategy defines the ends (specific METL tasks to be trained to improve and sustain training proficiency), outlines the ways (specific training objectives linked to sequenced training events to achieve those ends), and allocates the means (resources to execute the ways). A training strategy does not specify “how” to train. Subordinate commanders, staffs, unit officers, and NCO leaders have the responsibility to decide “how” to execute the training strategy. 4-61. The training strategy is an essential part of training guidance. Comprehensive training assessments provide commanders with a logical start point for describing the training strategy ends. Commanders at every echelon need relevant, timely feedback and input from subordinate commanders and leaders in order to describe the training strategy ends accurately. Figure 4-9 illustrates the connection between the ends, ways, and means of the training strategy. 4-28 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning Figure 4-9. Training Strategy ENDS 4-62. Training strategy ends are fixed and unwavering—they are to achieve and sustain METL proficiency. Commanders define training strategy ends in terms of specific METL tasks and training proficiency levels. WAYS 4-63. The ways of any given training strategy are specific training objectives linked with specific sequenced training events to achieve the stated training strategy ends. Commanders outline the ways of the training strategy when they— Identify specific training tasks that achieve and sustain METL proficiency for leaders, units, and individuals. Identify the training audience for each specific training task. Develop the training objectives for each specific training task. Identify and select training event(s) that train the designated training audience. Link and sequence training events and objectives with crawl- walk-run training to achieve the training proficiency specified in the training strategy ends. Specify frequencies for executing specific training task events and exercises. Plan for retraining tasks not performed to standard. MEANS 4-64. Commanders develop the means of the training strategy when they identify and allocate the resources needed to execute the ways of the 4-29 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ training strategy. Commanders identify the required means of the training strategy based on the training event and task conditions needed to achieve and sustain training proficiency on selected training tasks. Training strategy means identify and allocate resources such as— Time, training areas, fuel, TADSS, OPFOR, and OC to support training event/exercises. Ranges and ammunition for live fire exercises, weapons qualification, and gunnery. Virtual simulators and constructive simulations to support various leader, individual, crew, squad, unit, and staff training exercises. 4-65. The means does not specify “how” to train. Subordinate commanders, staffs, and other unit officer and NCO leaders have the responsibility to decide how to execute the training strategy. 4-66. Commanders must be prepared to adjust the training strategy when available training resources cannot support the planned training strategy. In these situations, commanders may revise the strategy by— Prioritizing training tasks and objectives. Modifying training objectives. Combining, re-sequencing, or modifying training events. Re-allocating available resources. 4-67. An effective training strategy— Provides clear, simple, meaningful guidance that logically links objectives, events, and resources with METL training proficiency. Achieves and sustains METL proficiency. COMBINED ARMS TRAINING STRATEGY (CATS) 4-68. The CATS is a strategy that describes the ends, ways, and means to achieve and sustain warfighting readiness for the average unit, when coupled with the weapons training strategies published in Standards in Training Commission (STRAC). CATS and STRAC are developed by TRADOC proponents for each type unit based on a set of assumptions about doctrinal design tasks, average skill decay, unit personnel turbulence, training methodologies, available TADSS, and other factors common to that type unit. CATS and STRAC strategies are the “doctrinal templates” of training events, event frequency, and associated resources that a commander uses in developing a unit training strategy. After assessing the unit’s METL proficiency, personnel turbulence, resource constraints, and other factors, the unit commander uses the CATS and STRAC strategies as tools to develop a training strategy for the unit. The events in the CATS and STRAC are the common building blocks for the commander’s plan. TRAINING ADAPTIVE LEADERS AND UNITS 4-69. The training strategy supports organizational and unit goals and objectives and provides direction for training programs. A standing goal for all organizations is to train and develop adaptive leaders and units. 4-70. Commanders train and develop adaptive leaders and units, and prepare subordinates to operate in positions of increased responsibility. 4-30 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning Commanders recognize that doctrine provides the foundation for training adaptive units, staffs, leaders and individual soldiers. Repetitive, standards-based training provides relevant experience and enhances understanding, application, and execution of tactical doctrine. Commanders intensify training experiences by varying training conditions. Training experiences, coupled with organized and timely feedback, build competence. Leaders build unit, staff, and soldier confidence when they consistently demonstrate competence. Competence, confidence, and discipline promote initiative and enable leaders to adapt to changing situations and conditions. They improvise with the resources at hand, exploit opportunities, and accomplish assigned missions in the absence of orders. Commanders underwrite honest mistakes, reward innovation, and create an environment to aggressively correct training deficiencies through retraining. Figure 4-10 illustrates the linkage between doctrine and adaptive leaders, and the critical role of training. Figure 4-10. Training Adaptive Leaders and Units 4-71. Commanders at every echelon integrate training events and specific training exercises in their training plans to develop and train imaginative, adaptive leaders and units. Commanders vary training event and exercise scenarios to— Reflect the uncertainty inherent in conducting full spectrum operations. Provide battle command experience. Develop subordinates’ understanding of commander’s “intent” and “concept of operation” two levels up. Encourage use of mission orders and promote initiative. Develop decentralized decisionmaking and execution. 4-31 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ 4-72. Figure 4-11 expands on the relationships between doctrinal concepts and training to develop and train adaptive leaders and units. Figure 4-11. Training Adaptability LIVE, VIRTUAL, AND CONSTRUCTIVE TRAINING 4-73. Commanders’ training strategies use a mix of live, virtual, and constructive (L-V-C) training to achieve and sustain unit and staff proficiency on selected METL tasks and supporting unit and staff battle tasks within the Band of Excellence. The goal is to train mission essential tasks to standard and sustain a wartime readiness posture. Battalion level units and below attain and sustain warfighting proficiency and develop soldier fieldcraft primarily through live training. Brigades and higher organizations rely more on virtual-constructive (V-C) training events to attain and sustain warfighting proficiency. Commanders at battalion level and lower plan and execute standards-based training in V- C simulations to— Prepare for live “in the dirt” training. Rehearse selected staff and unit battle tasks, and squad, team and crew drills. Train on selected unit battle tasks, on supporting squad, team, and crew critical tasks, and on leader and individual soldier tasks evaluated as either “P” or “U”. 4-74. Battalion commanders leverage V-C training events to accelerate junior leader mastery of tasks directly related to tactical competence, confidence, and proficiency. Similarly, battalion and company commanders look to CSM, 1SGs, and key NCO leaders to leverage V-C training events to develop junior NCO and soldier mastery of individual 4-32 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning tasks directly related to technical competence, confidence, and proficiency that supports small unit, crew, leader, and individual soldier tasks. 4-75. Table 4-16 provides some of the possible options available to commanders to train soldiers, staffs, leaders, units, and themselves using a mix of L-V-C events to support crawl-walk-run training. (This topic is discussed further in chapter 5.) The commander selects the tools that will result in the unit receiving the best training based on available resources. V-C training cannot replace live training. They can, however, supplement, enhance, and complement live training to sustain unit proficiency within the Band of Excellence. Table 4-16.

Virtual (V)—Training executed using computer-generated battlefields in simulators with approximate characteristics of tactical weapons systems and vehicles. Virtual tactical engagement simulation training permits units to maneuver over much larger areas. Constructive (C)—Training that uses computer models and simulations to exercise the command and staff functions of units from platoon through echelons above corps. 4-76. Now, and even more importantly in the future, commanders will use L-V-C to train all units of a particular organization, combined arms team, or JTF simultaneously. Assembling all units of a task-organized force involved in live training at the same time and place is becoming increasingly difficult. Recognizing the numerous training options, an integrated training strategy describing the use of available L-V-C training resources is required. CATS and STRAC are useful strategies that integrate TADSS and L-V-C training into training events. 4-77. Training devices in L-V-C are designed to be fully integrated into a near-seamless training system. Technology provides the real-time capability to link maneuver, air defense, aviation, engineer, and fire support into a comprehensive training environment. A unit may potentially conduct an exercise with elements training in L-V-C 4-33 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ simultaneously using semi-automated forces and simulations. With improvements in the facilities available for training, units can realistically train soldiers for new and more complex missions. Commanders can tailor a variety of training tools to mission and local circumstances and/or take advantage of networked systems to enhance training and rehearse missions. By leveraging technology and information systems, commanders minimize role player and support requirements and maximize the training of as many leaders, staffs, units, and soldiers as possible.

The following is a description of the participants in the various training events identified in the A/1-77 IN commander’s training strategy (see figure 4-18): ➑ Platoon TEWT: This training event links the platoon training with the company commander’s training strategy. This is platoon leader-led training and includes the platoon leader, platoon sergeant, squad leaders, platoon FO, medic and combat engineer squad leader participation. The platoon leader focuses on three critical squad tasks and drills that directly support improving the platoon’s proficiency on the critical task “Assault an Objective.” The platoon leader emphasizes “Integrating Direct Fires,” “Controlling Squad Fire,” and “Treat and Evacuate Casualties” during each TEWT. The three critical squad tasks and drills are— ♦ “Breach an Obstacle.” ♦ “Enter/Clear Trench Lines.” ♦ “Knock Out a Bunker.” ➒ Platoon FTX: This training event is where the platoon trains critical platoon tasks that support the company’s proficiency on the METL task “Assault an Objective” and critical squad tasks and drills that support the platoon critical task of “Assault an Objective.” ➓ Squad STX: This training event is the first part of the A/1-77 IN commander’s evaluation of the squads. This is force on force training using engagement simulations. The platoon weapons squads are the dedicated OPFOR. The squads execute three STXs for the squad critical tasks and drills trained during the platoon TEWT and FTX. The squads execute these STXs during day and night. ➓ Squad LFX: This training event is the second part of the A/1-77 IN commander’s evaluation of the squads. The squads execute three LFXs for the squad critical tasks and drills trained during the platoon TEWT, FTX and squad STXs. The squads execute these LFXs during day and night. 4-92.

Figure 4-20 illustrates a sample BSB commander’s strategy to improve training proficiency for the battalion METL tasks of “Defend Against Level I and II Threats” and “Provide DS Level Combat Service Support.” 4-43 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 4-20. Selected Training Tasks to Improve 1-77 IN METL Proficiency for METL Tasks: “Defend Against Level I and II Threats” and “Provide DS Level Combat Service Support” 4-94. The commander’s training strategy is continuously refined throughout the planning process. The training strategy results in the CTG, links the METL with upcoming training events, and matches available resources to training requirements. Figure 4-21 summarizes key points of a training strategy. Training strategy provides broad guidance that— ♦ Defines the “ends”: Improve and sustain METL proficiency. ♦ Outlines the “ways”: Specific training objectives linked with specific sequenced training events to achieve and sustain METL proficiency. o Select training tasks and determine training audience for each task. o Develop training objectives (task, condition, and standard) o Identify and select training events. Link training objectives to each training event. o Sequence selected training events and objectives. Link with training proficiency levels and crawl-walk-run skill levels. ♦ Allocates the “Means”: Identify resource requirements and link resources to specific training events and task conditions needed to achieve and sustain proficiency on selected training tasks. o Time, training areas, fuel, TADSS, OPFOR, and OCs to support live field training event/exercises o Ranges and ammunition for LFXs, weapons qualification, and gunnery. o Virtual simulators and constructive simulations to support various leader, individual, crew, squad, unit and staff training exercises. Figure 4-21. Training Strategy Summary 4-44 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning SECTION III. COMMAND TRAINING GUIDANCE 4-95. The command training guidance (CTG) is published to document the organization’s long-range training plan. It must be read and understood by all commanders, staff officers, and senior NCOs. The CTG is used as a ready reference when planning, preparing, executing, and evaluating training throughout the long-range planning period. 4-96. Commanders formulate the training guidance after completing the assessment. Figure 4-22 shows that the CTG links assessment with the unit’s training plan. Figure 4-22. Training Planning Process (Commander’s Guidance) 4-97. The CTG supports the higher commander’s training guidance; identifies training requirements based on the commander’s assessment; and includes the training strategy. The training strategy provides a common focus and direction for the unit’s training program. The CTG serves as a basis for detailed parallel planning at all levels. 4-45 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ SECTION IV. TRAINING PLANS 4-98. Training plans are the output of the training planning process and are the basis for executing training. Figure 4-23 illustrates the three categories of training plans— Long-Range. Short-Range. Near-Term. Figure 4-23. Training Planning Process (Training Plans) 4-99. Planning for training is a continuous, integrated process done in parallel at all organizational levels.

Commanders coordinate long-range planning calendars with subordinate commanders, support agencies (such as medical), and any other organizations that might generate training distracters if they are not fully integrated into the long-range plan. The long-range planning calendar provides direction and a point of common reference for coordinating training resources. 4-47 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ 4-101. The following four steps are suggested for preparing the long- range planning calendar. Applying these four steps is an iterative process—the steps are adjusted to synchronize plans and coordinate activities as resources are refined. The example depicts only the second quarter of the long-range planning calendar. RC units should modify or re-sequence steps to fit the needs of the command. STEP 1—POST REQUIRED TRAINING EVENTS ON THE CALENDAR 4-102. The first step is to post required training events on the calendar. These are requirements that are directed by higher headquarters. These events provide excellent training opportunities for the battalion commander and subordinate leaders. Commanders and leaders must take full advantage of these events to select training objectives to be accomplished. The dates of these events should be annotated. Commanders and leaders should use blocked window periods if exact exercise dates are tentative or unknown at the time of publication. RC units must post AT and IDT dates first. Examples of required training events are— Scheduled operational deployments. CTC training rotations. External evaluations. Map exercise (MAPEX), EXEVAL TEWT, CPX, CFX, FCX, and FTX. EIB/EFMB. OPFOR support and training. Gunnery periods. Security reaction force duty. Contingency deployment ready unit. RC support (for AC units). STEP 2—SCHEDULE OTHER REQUIREMENTS 4-103. The second step is to identify and schedule other requirements that impact on training. Commanders reduce training distracters by properly identifying required events early in the planning process. Some examples of other requirements are— Announced inspections, such as organizational inspection program (OIP) inspections. New equipment fielding to include new equipment training (NET). Community and installation support events; for example, parades and displays, support taskings, and directed administrative requirements such as pantographic x-rays and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening. STEP 3—SCHEDULE UNIT-CONTROLLED EXERCISES AND OTHER TRAINING 4-104. The third step is to schedule unit-controlled exercises and other training. Commanders schedule the events based on the unit’s training strategy. These unit-controlled exercises are designed to improve or sustain the unit’s METL proficiency and support higher headquarters’- directed training requirements. For example, the battalion commander 4-48 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning could schedule a TEWT, a CPX, an FCX, and STXs prior to a brigade FTX. 4-105. The long-range planning calendar is staffed with outside agencies that can impact on training. It is coordinated with subordinate and higher commanders, installation commanders, and supporting CS and CSS units. (Similarly, short-range and near-term training plans are coordinated with these same staff agencies.) 4-106. This coordination ensures that supporting CS and CSS units and activities are prepared to support organizational and unit training plans. Timely coordination assists in the integration of supporting CS and CSS unit training plans. STEP 4—POST THE TIME MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 4-107. The fourth step is to post the time management system, which highlights prime time training periods available to the unit and support periods. Commanders then focus their resource and exercise planning to take advantage of prime time training, and look for other opportunities for small unit, crew, and individual training during support periods. TIME MANAGEMENT 4-108. Time management systems are designed to protect training time for subordinate units. Time management systems identify, focus, and protect prime time training periods and the resources to support the training so that subordinate organizations are able to concentrate on mission essential training. In order to be effective, division and brigade commanders must enforce time management systems throughout the command. These senior commanders must ensure the training planning process is disciplined, and that all members of the command support prime time training. Without the support of the senior commanders, companies, platoons, and soldiers will not be able to train. 4-109. Specific activities vary between installations according to the local situation and requirements. Time management periods are depicted on applicable long-range planning calendars. 4-110. Various types of time management systems are used throughout the Army. Some systems consist of three cycles— Green: The training focus of organizations in Green periods is multiechelon, collective training that leads to METL proficiency. This period coincides with the availability of major training resources and key training facilities and devices. Organizations in Green periods conduct planned training without distraction and external taskings. Amber: The focus of units in Amber periods is on training proficiency at the individual, leader, crew, and squad levels. Individual self-development is maximized through the use of installation education centers and through distributed learning. Organizations in Amber periods are assigned support taskings beyond the capability of those units in the Red period, but commanders strive for minimal disruption to Amber organizations’ training programs. 4-49 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Red: The training focus of units in Red periods is on maximizing self-development opportunities to improve leader and individual task proficiency. Units in Red periods execute details and other administrative requirements and allow the maximum number of soldiers to take leave. Commanders maintain unit integrity when executing administrative and support requirements. Maintaining unit integrity exercises the chain of command and provides individual training opportunities for first line leaders. 4-111. Figure 4-24 describes a Green-Amber-Red time management system and lists some of the training and support concepts that generally characterize each period. ➲ Green Cycle • Training focus is primarily on collective tasks with individual and leader tasks integrated during multiechelon training. • Maximum soldier attendance at prime time, mission essential training. • Coincides with availability of major resources and key training facilities or devices. • Administrative and support requirements that keep personnel from participating in training is eliminated to the maximum extent possible. • Leaves and passes are limited to the minimum essential. ➲ Amber Cycle • Small unit, crew, and individual training is emphasized. • Provides time for soldier attendance at education and training courses. • Some sub-organizations may be able to schedule collective training. • Periodic maintenance services are scheduled. • Selected personnel are diverted to support requirements when all available personnel in organizations in Red period are completely committed to support requirements. ➲ Red Cycle • Diverts the minimum essential number of personnel to perform administrative and support requirements. • Sub-organizations take advantage of all training opportunities to conduct individual, leader, and crew training. • Support missions/details accomplished with unit integrity to exercise the chain of command and provide individual training opportunities for first line supervisors, as time permits. Unit taskings can be used to reduce the number of permanent special duty personnel within installations and communities. • Leaves and passes are maximized. When appropriate, block leave may be scheduled. • Routine medical, dental, and administrative appointments are coordinated and scheduled with installation support facilities. Figure 4-24. Green-Amber-Red Time Management System 4-112. Other time management systems may consist of two cycles— Green: The focus of training is on collective task proficiency, with leader and individual tasks integrated during multiechelon training. These organizations conduct planned training without distraction and external taskings. Red: The focus is on maximizing leader and individual self- development opportunities, executing details and other administrative requirements, and allowing the maximum number 4-50 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning of soldiers to take leave. All administrative and support requirements should be accomplished with unit integrity. The training in these periods is on small unit, crew, leader, and individual proficiency. Figure 4-25 is an example of a Green-Red time management system. ➲ Green Cycle • Training focus is primarily on collective tasks with individual and leader tasks integrated during multiechelon training. • Maximum soldier attendance at prime time, mission essential training. • Coincides with availability of major resources and key training facilities or devices. • Administrative and support requirements that keep personnel from participating in training is eliminated to the maximum extent possible. • Leaves and passes are limited to the minimum essential. ➲ Red Cycle • Diverts the minimum essential number of personnel to perform administrative and support requirements. • Small unit, crew, and individual training emphasized. • Sub-organizations take advantage of all training opportunities to conduct individual, leader, and crew training. • Periodic maintenance services are scheduled and performed. • Support missions/details are accomplished with unit integrity to exercise the chain of command and provide opportunities for first line supervisors, as time permits. Unit taskings can be used to reduce the number of permanent special duty personnel within installations and communities. • Provides time for soldier attendance at education and training courses. • Leaves and passes are maximized. When appropriate, block leave may be scheduled. • Routine medical, dental, and administrative appointments are coordinated and scheduled with installation support facilities. Figure 4-25. Green-Red Time Management System 4-113. Time management systems provide dedicated, uninterrupted training time to subordinate commanders to concentrate on mission essential training. Senior commanders are responsible for managing local installation and external support taskings in order to minimize—to the greatest extent possible—the potential impact on unit training programs. The senior commander determines the duration and sequence of major subordinate command (MSC) prime time training periods based on planned events, such as— CTC rotation schedule. Scheduled operational deployments. New equipment fielding and training programs. Other major planned exercises. 4-114. Commanders at all levels can use time management systems. They are especially important for units in a support cycle. For example, a battalion commander whose unit is in the support cycle may direct that during the first week of the support period, Charlie Company will not receive support taskings until Alpha and Bravo Companies have been tasked to the limit of their capability. The commander then rotates the companies through the battalion’s internal support cycle. Normally, the 4-51 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ company that the battalion commander identifies as “fenced” from support taskings will have an opportunity to train on soldier, crew, and small-unit collective critical tasks and drills. The unit in the “Green” cycle requires training resources that must be supported, even when the unit is a subordinate element of an organization in the Red cycle. 4-115. There are training opportunities during every period of the time management system. Specific periods lend themselves to certain types of events. The following shows training events typically conducted in the Green-Amber-Red time management system: Post support—Red. Gunnery—Green. FTX—Green. Holiday half-day—Red. Weapons qualification—Amber. Combined arms live fire exercise (CALFEX)—Green. CTC—Green. CTC OPFOR Augmentation Support—Amber. While the battalion may be in Amber cycle, a subordinate company selected for augmentation support could be Green. 4-116. Many CSS units have support missions that are synonymous with their operational mission and do not lend themselves readily to a training management system. Commanders must develop innovative ways to align or synchronize their training with the supported unit to identify and protect priority training times. 4-117. RC unit commanders can also use either the Green-Amber-Red or Green-Red time management system. When using the Green-Amber-Red system, most of the AT period should be Green cycle training on collective tasks; most of the IDT periods should be Amber and focus on small unit, crew, leader and individual soldier training; and one or two IDT periods should be Red for mandatory training/administrative requirements. When using the Green-Red system, the AT and the preponderance of IDT periods should be Green; only one or two IDT periods should be Red for mandatory training/administrative requirements. In all training periods, DMOSQ training for soldiers who are not MOS-qualified is the first order of business. The chain of command must assist subordinate commanders by consolidating scheduled training distracters, such as HIV testing, panographic x-rays, or inspections, during one or two IDT periods during the year. This reduces administrative impact on prime time training periods. LONG-RANGE PLANNING 4-118. The long-range plan, based on the CTG, synchronizes supporting units and agencies by allocating dedicated training time for organizations and units to train on METL tasks (see Figure 4-26). Long-range planning goes out as far as 10 years at the MACOM level to 1 year at the company level for the AC, and 3 to 5 years for the RC. Commanders prioritize training resources to maximize efficient use of available training areas, ranges, simulators and simulations, and ammunition during execution of the long-range plan. Depending on the organizational level, commanders integrate plans and resources through: joint training plans, NETT 4-52 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning schedules, worldwide training conferences, CTC scheduling, mobilization requirements, school scheduling and requirements, STRAC, long-range budget forecasts, and range construction and modification plans. Long- range planning concludes with the publication of the CTG. Figure 4-26. Training Planning Process (Long-Range Planning) 4-119. Commanders publish CTGs and long-range planning calendars sufficiently in advance to give subordinate commanders adequate time to plan training properly. Tables 4-18 and 4-19 summarize AC and RC long- range planning cycles. Commanders publish their CTG and planning calendars in accordance with timelines listed in these figures. 4-53 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Table 4-18.

SHORT-RANGE PLANNING 4-122. Short-range planning refines the long-range calendar (see Figure 4-28). It defines in greater detail the broad guidance on training events and other activities outlined in the senior commander’s CTG and depicted on the long-range calendar. Short-range planning looks out from 3 to 6 months for the AC, and 12 months to 20 months for the RC. Commanders must publish the short-range training guidance with sufficient lead-time to ensure that subordinate commanders have time to develop their own short-range training plans. They conclude with training briefings in which commanders review and approve the training plans of subordinate units. 4-56 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning Figure 4-28.

The division commander’s quarterly training guidance (QTG) refines planning and execution guidance outlined in the CTG and long- range planning calendar based on quarterly METL assessments. Figure 4-29 depicts major training events for a sample 2nd quarter, FY XX training calendar based on a 1st BCT’s support of a 2nd BCT EXEVAL. 4-125. The 1st BCT’s support of the 2nd BCT EXEVAL is used as the sample situation throughout the remaining discussion of short-range planning in this chapter (see figure 4-29 through figure 4-36). Figure 4-29. 52nd Infantry Division (Mech) Major Training Events, 2nd Quarter, FY XX 4-58 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning 4-126. The division commander provides additional guidance in the 2nd QTG to focus planning efforts of the staff and subordinate MSCs. The guidance— Emphasizes specific training objectives for major training events. Provides direction for OC, evaluator, and OPFOR preparation. 4-127. The following are sample extracts from a division commander’s 2nd QTG for some of the major training events depicted in figure 4-29: ➋ Battalion TEWT: This training links the BCT and battalion commanders’ training strategies. This is battalion commander-led training that includes the battalion commander and staff, company commanders, specialty platoon leaders, and NCO leaders participation. The battalion conducts a TEWT of the tasks “Assault an Objective” and “Breach an Obstacle.” Additionally, the battalion confirms and/or adjusts tentative plans developed during the BCT commander’s TEWT. The battalion executes orders and plans in the BCT CPX that will be developed during this TEWT. ➎ Company TEWT: This training links the battalion and company commanders’ training strategies. This company is commander-led training that includes the participation of the company commander, platoon leaders, company FSO, NCO leaders, and mortar section sergeant. The company conducts a TEWT of the tasks “Assault an Objective,” “Breach an Obstacle,” Integrate Indirect Fires” and “Treat and Evacuate Casualties.” ➏ Battalion COMEX: Includes battalion TAC, main, and rear CPs, company CPs, and specialty platoon headquarters. The training focus of this exercise is: ♦ Battalion R&S team training on “Developing an R&S Plan” and battalion targeting team training on “Execute Targeting Process.” ♦ ABCS and FBCB2 systems operator training. ➐ Battalion CPX: Includes battalion TAC, main, and rear CPs. The training focus is on full staff interaction with higher, adjacent, supporting, and subordinate unit staffs; critical interactive staff processes (for example, “Develop an R&S Plan” and “Execute the Targeting Process”); and ABCS and FBCB2 systems operator training. 4-59 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ 4-128. The division commander also establishes training event resource “lock in” dates. Figure 4-30 illustrates lock-in dates that the division commander establishes to support the 52nd Infantry Division (Mech)’s 2nd quarter, FY XX major training events. Figure 4-30. 52nd Infantry Division (Mech) Short-Range Planning Cycle 4-129. Division commanders may provide guidance on the frequency and focus of small unit, crew, and individual training. Such training time should be devoted to the small-unit leader (such as a squad leader or a vehicle commander) to train assigned individual and small units. This training enhances readiness and cohesion; it also allows the junior NCO to learn and exercise the Army's training management system at the lowest level. The key is to train the trainer so that the junior NCOs can train their soldiers. This concept requires the NCO to identify essential soldier, small-unit, and team tasks (drills) that support the unit METL. The NCO then must— Assess strengths and weaknesses. Formulate a plan to correct deficiencies and sustain strengths. Execute the training to standard. 4-130. However, while NCOs plan, prepare, execute, and evaluate individual, crew, and small unit training, officers retain the ultimate responsibility for training. The following extract of the 52nd Infantry Division (Mech) commander’s 2nd QTG illustrates how the division commander guides the training of NCOs: 4-60 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning Individual Training. Noncommissioned officers have the lead to execute and monitor our progress in this area. This is a crew, team, and squad leader responsibility. Preparation and proficiency of the NCOs is critical. ♦ Weapons training and qualification, and physical training provide the foundation for a competent and confident soldier. The standards are— o All soldiers qualify on their individual weapon semi-annually. o Every soldier passes the semi-annual Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT), meets height/weight standards, and meets the division standard for the four-mile run in 36 minutes. o Infantry units, division cavalry squadron ground troops, brigade reconnaissance troops, and battalion scout platoons are required to conduct a 12-mile foot march with combat load in three hours every quarter. ♦ I expect NCOs to integrate NBC defense, first aid combat/lifesaver, hot and cold weather injury prevention, and safety into all training. Training and safety are inseparable. Our equipment continues to provide us with incredible capabilities. However, our equipment is increasingly complex. Complex equipment requires constant attention to detail to operate safely. ♦ 3rd BCT units deploying to SFOR XX need to stress anti-terrorism, force protection, and rules of engagement (ROE)- related tasks as well. BCT Command Training Guidance 4-131. The example scenario described in this section illustrates the short-range planning process for the 1st BCT and subordinate commands, including the 1-77 Infantry battalion and the 1st BSB. In this example, the 1st BCT commander conducts the 2nd quarter, FY XX QTB while still deployed in Kosovo. The 1st BCT commander develops the BCT’s training strategy to use the OC support mission for the 2nd BCT’s EXEVAL as an opportunity to start BCT and battalion staff and leader training for the NTC rotation in the 4th quarter (Aug XX). The 1st BCT has undergone key staff and leader changes at all command echelons since the BCT’s redeployment from KFOR XX in December. 4-132. The BCT commander’s 2nd QTG identifies the shaping operations exercise directed by the commanding general (CG) and the BCT-directed CFX as ideal opportunities for combined arms multiechelon training. These events are key parts of the BCT commander’s training strategy. The detailed assessments at the start of the training planning process provides the foundation for the BCT and subordinate battalions and separate companies training strategies. This detailed assessment also outlines the linkage of a particular METL task (for example, “Conduct an Attack”) with— BCT and battalion staff tasks. Battalion and company METL tasks. Critical platoon, squad, and crew collective tasks drills. Individual soldier tasks that support the collective tasks. 4-61 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ 4-133. This common linkage provides an excellent opportunity for multiechelon training. Figure 4-31 summarizes key points of multiechelon training. ♦ Commanders: o Provide guidance on the use of multiechelon training to plan and refine training events. o Determine which tasks the unit will train on during which training event. ♦ Must occur during all collective training. ♦ Subordinate commanders and leaders must view every training event as a multiechelon training opportunity. ♦ Commander and subordinate leader assessments determine which collective, leader, and individual tasks will be trained. ♦ Selected training tasks must support training objectives of the commander directing the training event. Figure 4-31. Multiechelon Training 4-134. The BCT commander decides to conduct a CFX as a rehearsal for BCT leaders who will serve as OCs and evaluate 2nd BCT units and staffs. The designated OPFOR will use the 1st BCT’s CFX as their final rehearsal. The BCT commander and subordinate battalion and separate company commanders will conduct a series of TEWTs and CPX staff exercises prior to the CFX. 4-135. The BCT commander will work MDMP drills based on the 2nd BCT EXEVAL scenario and supporting division orders with the staff to develop BCT plans and orders. The BCT will then conduct TEWTs to validate or adjust those plans and orders. Finally, the BCT will execute some of the plans in the CPXs. The BCT TEWTs, CPXs, and CFXs will involve subordinate battalion commanders and their staffs, separate BCT companies, a divisional AH-64 battalion, and United States Air Force (USAF) tactical air control party (TACP) and close air support (CAS) sorties. Figure 4-32 highlights these 1st BCT training events. 4-62 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning Figure 4-32. 1st BCT Major Training Events, 2nd Quarter, FY XX 4-136. Figure 4-33 overlays the short-range training guidance described in the sample scenario above with training event resource “lock in” dates that support both the 52nd Infantry Division (Mech)’s and 1st BCT’s 2nd quarter, FY XX major training events. Figure 4-33. 1st BCT Short-Range Planning Cycle 4-63 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ 4-137. Similarly, BCT subordinate battalion and separate company commanders develop unit-specific training strategies that are consistent with the BCT commander’s training strategy. The detailed training assessments help them identify specific company, battery, and troop METL tasks; critical platoon level collective tasks; squad and crew critical collective drills; and critical individual soldier tasks they will train during the BCT CFX and the shaping operations exercise. 4-138. Figure 4-34 depicts the 1-77 IN’s 2nd quarter major training events. Figure 4-34. 1-77 Infantry Battalion Major Training Events, 2nd Quarter, FY XX 4-139.

The training planning process is identical for both AC and RC; however, the timelines are different. The process links the unit METL with execution of battle focused training. The following examples (figure 4-37 and figure 4-38) depict the short-range training plans for RC combat arms units and CSS units. They parallel the AC examples described in the previous two sections of this manual. These examples show major training events for illustrative purposes and do not represent a complete AT plan. The focus of these examples is on premobilization training over 1 fiscal year. The timelines for RC short-term plans have been adjusted to meet the criteria in table 4-21 (short-range planning), as well as the lower organizational level of training focus. The battalion mortar platoon is used as an example of specialty platoon training in the combat arms example. 4-66 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning Figure 4-37. RC IN Battalion and Company Short-Range Training Plans (Major Events) Figure 4-38. RC BSB, Forward Maintenance Company, and Medical Company Short-Range Plans (Major Events) 4-67 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ 4-142. In the RC CSS example in figure 4-38, the company-level planning on the lower portion of the chart has been modified to illustrate more details of the following platoon and squad tasks: “Defend Against Level I and II Threats,” “Supervise Assigned Field Maintenance Operations” (forward maintenance company), and “Provide Ground Ambulance Evacuation Support” (brigade support medical company). QUARTERLY AND YEARLY TRAINING BRIEFINGS 4-143. The short-range training briefing is a conference conducted by senior commanders to review and approve the training plans of subordinate units. It is conducted before the time period addressed in the quarterly training briefings (QTGs) or yearly training briefings (YTGs). AC units conduct QTBs. RC units conduct YTBs. 4-144. Training briefings produce a contract between the senior commander and each subordinate commander. As a result of this contract, the senior commander agrees to provide resources, including time, and to protect the subordinate unit from unprogrammed taskings. The subordinate commander agrees to execute the approved training plan and to conduct training to standard. This shared responsibility helps maintain priorities, achieve unity of effort, and synchronize actions to achieve quality training and efficient resourcing. The QTB or YTB, as appropriate, is the forum in which contracts for that training period are discussed and confirmed. Training guidance flows from the top down and requirements for planning and execution of tasks flow from the bottom up. 4-145. Division commanders receive the short-range training briefing from subordinate brigades and all battalions in the division. The brigade commander and CSM personally present the overview of the brigade training plan. Subordinate battalion commanders and CSMs present detailed briefings of their training plans. All habitually-associated commanders participate in preparing and conducting the training briefing— The QTB is conducted 6 to 8 weeks prior to the beginning of the quarter. The YTB for RC units is normally presented to the next higher peacetime commander. The YTB is conducted prior to the start of the fiscal year in RC units. 4-146. After approval by the higher commander, the training guidance and calendar are published. Figure 4-39 summarizes the purpose of QTBs and YTBs. 4-68 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning ♦ Designed to discuss past, present, and future training. ♦ Result in a training contract between senior and subordinate commanders. ♦ Senior commander agrees to provide resources and protect subordinate unit from unprogrammed taskings. ♦ Subordinate commanders agree to execute approved training to the Army standard. ♦ Senior commander ensures that training is the exclusive focus of QTBs and YTBs. Figure 4-39. Purpose of Quarterly and Yearly Training Briefings 4-147. The training briefing is a highlight of the senior commander's leader development program. It provides the commander an opportunity to coach and teach subordinates on the fine points of the commander’s philosophy and strategies on all aspects of warfighting, to include doctrine, training, force integration, and leader development. It enables subordinate commanders, who may be new to the organization, to gain a better understanding of how their mission essential training relates to the battle focused training programs of their senior commanders and peers. 4-148. The senior commander determines the format and content of the briefing. (See Appendix F for sample.) However, the format should be flexible enough to allow subordinate commanders, CSMs and 1SGs to highlight their strengths, weaknesses, initiatives, and priorities. Figure 4-40 lists the minimum briefing topics for commanders. ♦ Training that was planned and briefed at a previous QTB or YTB, but not conducted, and why. ♦ Organization’s METL and assessment of proficiency levels. ♦ Unit’s training focus and objectives for the upcoming training period. ♦ Organization’s short-range planning calendar. ♦ Upcoming training events. ♦ Officer leader development programs with emphasis on warfighting skill development. ♦ Self development. ♦ Risk management. ♦ Plans for training trainers and evaluators. ♦ Force integration plans for the upcoming period. ♦ Resource allocation. Figure 4-40. Commanders’ Quarterly and Yearly Training Briefing Topics 4-149. The CSM/1SG normally briefs after the commander. CSMs/1SGs provide feedback regarding the unit’s individual soldier training proficiency, and discuss the unit’s individual soldier training, MOS training, NCOES status (for example, the Primary Leadership 4-69 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Development Course [PLDC] and Basic NCO Course [BNCOC]), and education plans. Special emphasis must be placed on low-density MOS. Figure 4-41 highlights CSM/1SG topics of discussion— ♦ Individual training proficiency feedback received concerning previous short-range planning period. ♦ An assessment of the organization’s current individual training proficiency. ♦ Individual training events planned during the upcoming short-range planning period and strategy to prepare soldiers for these evaluations. ♦ A description of METL-derived individual tasks to be integrated with upcoming collective mission essential tasks. ♦ Marksmanship and physical fitness programs. ♦ NCO leader development program with emphasis on warfighting skill development. ♦ Self-development. ♦ NCO/Enlisted schools. Figure 4-41. CSM and 1SG Quarterly and Yearly Training Briefing Topics 4-150. Division and brigade commanders must ensure that supporting CS, CSS, and garrison leaders attend QTBs to integrate training plans. As a minimum, participants should include division staff and commanders of the direct support (DS) field artillery battalion, and BSB; appropriate garrison representatives such as range control, ammunition officer, etc, as well as commanders of the associated engineer, MI, ADA, and signal companies. The battalion commander ensures that the officer and NCO leaders listed in figure 4-42 prepare for, attend, and participate in the briefing. ♦ Command sergeant major. ♦ Executive officer. ♦ Company commanders and 1SGs. ♦ Specialty platoon leaders. (scouts, mortar, support and medical) ♦ Coordinating staff. (S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6) ♦ Special staff. (chemo, BMO, physician’s assistant [PA] and chaplain [UMT]) ♦ Direct support (DS) CS and CSS unit representatives. (FSO, engineer, ADA, MI, and BSB SPO) Figure 4-42. Suggested Battalion Quarterly Training Briefing Participants 4-151. The battalion QTB creates confidence throughout the command by ensuring that subordinate leaders at all levels understand the intent of the senior commander. Commanders can then make effective, 4-70 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning independent training decisions to meet that intent as they execute the approved training plan. 4-152. Battalion and company commanders use the briefing as a training management review process. Figure 4-43 summarizes some of the expected benefits of battalion QTBs. ♦ Reviews training strategy, training events, and training strengths and weaknesses. ♦ Discusses previously coordinated training events. ♦ Explains how the unit’s training program supports the higher commander’s goals and objectives. ♦ Highlights problem areas for discussion. ♦ Clarifies command responsibilities concerning training resource allocation. (Senior commanders recommend more efficient ways to use available resources.) ♦ Eliminates training distracters. Figure 4-43. Battalion Quarterly Training Briefing Benefits 4-153. As noted previously, the QTBs and YTBs produce a contract between the senior commander and each subordinate commander. The commander’s contract locks in resources to enable battalion and subordinate commanders to begin near-term planning. NEAR-TERM PLANNING 4-154. Near-term planning schedules and executes training specified in the short-range training plan, provides specific guidance to the trainers, and produces detailed training schedules (see figure 4-35). Training meetings are key to near-term planning. Near-term planning covers a period of— • 6 to 8 weeks prior to the execution of training for AC units. • 4 months prior to the execution of training for RC units. 4-71 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 4-44. Training Planning Process (Near-Term Planning) 4-155. Figure 4-45 summarizes key points about near-term training planning, conducted primarily at battalion and subordinate command levels. ♦ Schedule and execute training objectives specified in the short-range training plan to the Army standard. ♦ Provide specific guidance to trainers. ♦ Make final coordination for the allocation of resources to be used in training. ♦ Complete final coordination with other units that will participate in training as part of the task organizations. ♦ Prepare detailed training schedules.

A/1-77 Infantry Near-Term Planning Cycle Figure 4-47. A/1-77 Infantry Near-Term Planning Cycle (continued) 4-74 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning TRAINING MEETINGS 4-158. Training meetings are non-negotiable—they are key to near-term planning. Training meetings create the bottom-up flow of information regarding specific training proficiency needs of the small unit, staff, and individual soldier. Training meetings are planned and appear on the training schedule. The purpose of the training meeting is to— Identify leader and unit training tasks. Review preparation for upcoming training to include, for example— Leader and unit preparatory training. Rehearsals for trainers, evaluators, and OCs. OPFOR training and preparation. Training site preparation. TADSS issue, and maintenance. Provide a forum for leaders, trainers, and evaluators to give feedback on the training executed during the past week. Provide commanders with a continuous source of “bottom-up” input for periodic training assessments. 4-159. At training meetings, each echelon reviews recently conducted training. They also refine and plan training for the next 6 to 8 weeks. At battalion level, the following agenda may be used: Review QTG or YTG. Review recently conducted training (briefed by company commanders), to include— Assess training conducted since the last meeting. Review reasons for training planned, but not conducted. Update the current status of training proficiency. Brief near-term training to— Discuss any new guidance received from higher commanders. Publish training scheduled for the next 4 to 6 weeks (next 4 months for RC). Review and complete pre-execution checks (document training distractors from higher headquarters). Issue commander’s guidance for training scheduled 6 to 8 weeks out (4 months out for RC). Review preparations for multiechelon training. Review the short-range plan. Review projected resources. 4-160. At company training meetings, the following agenda may be used: Review recently conducted training (briefed by platoon leaders and sergeants) to— Assess training conducted since the last meeting (collective and soldier tasks). Review reasons for training planned, but not conducted. Determine the current status of training proficiency. 4-75 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Brief near-term training to— Apply new guidelines from higher commanders, especially new or unscheduled requirements. Review pre-execution checks for training scheduled for the next 4 to 6 weeks (next 3 months for RC). Ensure that platoon leader and sergeant recommendations are included in training scheduled 6 to 8 weeks out (4 months out for RC). Identify key soldier changes and resource needs. 4-161. At platoon training meetings, the following agenda may be used, focusing on the details of training tasks required: Review recently conducted training (briefed by squad or section leaders) to— Assess training conducted since the last meeting (collective and soldier tasks). Review reasons for training planned, but not conducted. Determine the current status of training proficiency. Brief near-term training to— Apply new guidelines from higher commanders, especially new or unscheduled requirements. Review pre-execution checks for training scheduled for the next 4 to 6 weeks (next 3 months for RC). Identify essential soldier, leader, and collective training needs to be sent up the chain of command through the next higher-level training meeting. Ensure that information passed out at company training meetings reaches every soldier through their platoon chain of command 4-162. Training meetings, discussed further in appendix B, provide guidance to ensure the quality of training. Well-structured, organized, and recurring training meetings impact directly on the unit’s mission. Training meetings should last no more than 1 hour and nothing should be discussed but training (leaders should not discuss readiness status issues, nor treat the meeting as a command and staff meeting, etc.). Training meetings provide the forum to plan and coordinate training that is mission-focused and demanding. Training meetings are conducted weekly for AC, and monthly for RC at battalion and company level. Figure 4-48 summarizes important points about training meetings. 4-76 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning Training meetings: ♦ Are non-negotiable at battalion and company level. ♦ Focus on: o Battalion level: training management issues for the next 6 to 8 weeks. o Company, battery, troop level: specifics of executing scheduled training to standard. o Platoon and squad level: Identify essential platoon/squad/crew collective, leader, and individual soldier task(s) training requirements. Input those identified platoon/squad/crew, leader, and individual soldier training requirements. Brief and review published training schedules with the platoon/squad/crew. ♦ Are conducted by commanders; CSMs and 1SGs assist commanders. o Post unit training schedules. o Are routinely scheduled on the same week day and same time. o Follow a published agenda and do not exceed allotted time. o Are conducted weekly for AC and monthly for RC at battalion and company level. ♦ CSMs and 1SGs ensure that individual soldier training supports collective unit training. ♦ Are a vehicle for leader development. ♦ Are a forum to: o Ensure that training is METL-related. o Solicit evaluation feedback. o Solicit training requirement input from platoon leaders and platoon sergeants. o Assess current status of training proficiency. o Identify key soldier changes and resource requirements. o Review commander’s current training guidance, short-range plan, and projected resources. o Provide guidance on pre-execution checks. o Ensure that risk management is integrated into pre- execution checks. o Monitor pre-execution checks. o Resolve problems identified during pre-execution checks updates. o Identify and coordinate multiechelon training opportunities. o Share training tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). o Allocate resources and approve ongoing near-term training. ♦ Result in a coordinated and locked-in training schedule Figure 4-48.

Figure 4-50. Suggested Company Training Meeting Participants 4-164. When appropriate, RC commanders may want to include participants from the AC associate organization. RC commanders should take necessary actions to ensure that companies attend battalion-level training meetings when geographic dispersion is a challenge. Essential training information can be exchanged using video teleconference (VTC), email, or other means, but there is no substitute for face-to-face discussions during training meetings. TRAINING SCHEDULES 4-165. Near-term planning results in detailed training schedules. The training schedule is the unit’s primary management tool to ensure that training is conducted in a timely manner by qualified trainers, with the necessary resources, to the Army standard. At a minimum, the training schedule should— Allocate adequate time for training preparation. Specify when training starts and where it takes place. 4-78 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning Allocate adequate time for scheduled training and retraining as required. Specify the individual, leader, and collective tasks to be trained. Provide concurrent training topics that efficiently use available training time. Specify who conducts the training and who evaluates the training. Provide administrative information concerning uniform, weapons, equipment, and references. 4-166. Draft training schedules and pre-execution checks must be initiated at least 6 to 8 weeks (4 months for RC) prior to the training. This ensures that resources are coordinated and external support is requested. For AC, training schedules are published 4 to 6 weeks prior to execution; for RC, 3 months prior. 4-167. The company commander signs the training schedule, which identifies the specific unit training needs that have been planned. The battalion commander then signs the training schedule, thereby giving it final approval. The battalion commander’s signature finalizes the training “contract,” and verifies that necessary resources will be provided. Once the battalion commander approves and the signs the training schedule, it is locked in and constitutes an official order. Only the approving authority can authorize changes to the training schedule. For example, the battalion commander is authorized to approve changes to an approved and signed company, battery, or troop training schedule. Higher headquarters must protect subordinate units from unprogrammed events, activities, and other distracters. 4-168. Leaders must ensure that daily training is conducted to standard and adheres to the training schedule. CSMs, 1SGs, and other NCO leaders are key to ensuring that training is conducted to standard. 4-169.Commanders establish procedures to minimize changes to the training schedules. Figure 4-51 summarizes the commanders’ responsibilities. ♦ Division commanders: o Review selected training highlights. o Visit and assess selected highlighted training events. ♦ Brigade commanders: o Review published training schedules. o Visit and assess selected training. ♦ Battalion commanders approve training schedules. Their signature validates the company plan and provides required resources. Approved and signed training schedules lock in training and constitute an official order. ♦ Company commanders sign training schedules and submit them to the battalion commander for final approval. ♦ All commanders establish procedures to minimize training schedule changes. Figure 4-51. Commander Responsibilities: Training Schedules 4-170. Training schedule development is the primary focus of training meetings at battalion level.

Figure 4-52. Training Schedule Development (Weeks T-8 to T+1) 4-80 ________________________________________________________________________ Planning 4-171. Training schedule development at company level focuses on the specifics of training to be conducted for the next 6 to 8 weeks. The training schedule provides detailed information necessary for executing training to the Army standard, as shown in figure 4-53. Training schedules should: ♦ Specify when training starts and where it takes place. ♦ Allocate adequate time for scheduled training and retraining as required to correct anticipated deficiencies. ♦ Specify individual, leader, and collective tasks to be trained. ♦ Provide concurrent training topics that will efficiently use available training time. ♦ Specify who conducts the training and who evaluates the training. ♦ Provide administrative information concerning uniform, weapons, equipment, references, and safety precautions. Figure 4-53. Training Schedule Content 4-172. Near-term planning culminates when the unit executes the training on the training schedule. Detailed discussion and examples of near-term planning and its associated activities are included in chapter 5. SUMMARY 4-173. The training planning process links the unit METL with the execution of battle focused training (figure 4-54). Planning for training is a continuous, integrated process done in parallel at all organizational levels for long-range, short-range, and near-term planning. The planning process culminates with the publication of training schedules and leads to training execution. 4-81 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 4-54.

Leaders must ensure that their units train as they will fight. Training for warfighting is a responsibility shared by all leaders in the force—AC and RC; operational and institutional—and it is not for the faint of heart. Every leader shares the responsibility of imbuing soldiers and units with a warfighter’s tenacity for victory in battle. 5-2. Training for decisive warfighting means focusing training events to achieve realistic, doctrinally-sound, and performance-oriented training outcomes that closely approximate the stress and rigors of combat. Training for battle must be rigorous, mission-focused, METL-based, and conducted to realistic wartime conditions and standards based on METT-TC. 5-3. Competence in units is built on the mastery of fundamentals, steeled by a warrior ethos, and honed by rehearsed precision. Commanders must plan, prepare, and execute training events with the following in mind: train hard, fight easy. SECTION I: TRAINING EXECUTION 5-4. All good training, regardless of the specific collective, leader, or individual soldier tasks being executed, must comply with certain common requirements. These include adequate preparation, effective presentation, practice, and evaluation. (Evaluation is discussed in chapter 6.) The execution of training includes preparation for training, conduct of training, and recovery from training (figure 5-1). These components are applicable at all echelons, from a high-level staff participating in a joint training exercise to a first-line leader’s individual training of the team. Training execution is the same for both AC and RC. Commanders and NCO leaders use the training execution phases to train the unit, staff, and individual soldier to standard. Figure 5-1. Training Execution 5-2 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution THE ROLE OF COMMANDERS 5-5. Training planning is centralized to align training priorities at all levels of an organization. Training execution is decentralized. Decentralization tailors training execution to available resources and promotes bottom-up communication of mission-related strengths and weaknesses of each individual soldier, leader, and unit. 5-6. Commanders must personally observe and evaluate training execution to the maximum extent possible. Through personal observation of and participation in training, commanders communicate to subordinate units and leaders the importance of training. Commanders are the training managers for their commands and evaluate how leaders and soldiers perform. Based upon their evaluations, commanders provide feedback to the chain of command, to the trainers, and to those being trained. More importantly, commanders conduct a realistic and accurate assessment of unit training based upon personal observation and feedback from unit leaders and soldiers. Personal observation allows commanders to— Observe and evaluate the quality of training at all echelons down to the lowest levels of the organization. Receive feedback from subordinate leaders and soldiers during training visits. Identify and resolve problems in training planning, leadership, management, support, and other functions. Check the adequacy of external training support and require prompt and effective corrective action. Maintain awareness of key risk management actions throughout the course of training execution. THE ROLE OF NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS 5-7. CSMs, 1SGs, and key noncommissioned officers (NCOs) select and train specific individual soldier tasks that support the units’ collective mission essential tasks. NCOs are responsible for— Training individual soldiers, crews, and small teams. Conducting standards-based, performance-oriented training. Cross-training to ensure critical wartime skills within the unit. Explaining how individual soldier task training relates to the unit’s collective mission essential tasks. Planning, preparing, rehearsing, and executing training, conducting AARs, and providing bottom-up feedback. Maintaining awareness of ongoing risk management actions that support individual, crew, and small team training. SERGEANTS TIME TRAINING 5-8. Sergeants time training (STT) is standards-based, performance- oriented, battle focused training. Commanders emphasize individual soldier training in support of collective METL training by allocating dedicated training time for NCO’s using STT. STT recognizes the NCO’s primary role in conducting individual, crew, and small team training. 5-3 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ STT requires dedicated time on the training schedule and must be planned, resourced, rehearsed, and executed with no external distracters. 5-9. STT develops junior leaders and builds cohesive teams. NCOs select specific individual, crew, and small team tasks that support the unit’s METL, based on their training assessment and platoon leader guidance. Once these tasks are approved, they plan, prepare, rehearse, and execute the training. Training to standard, not to time, is paramount. Commanders approve the selected tasks, provide the resources, allocate time to prepare, and monitor the training. CSMs and 1SGs supervise the training, and they coach, teach, and mentor junior NCOs. CRAWL-WALK-RUN TRAINING 5-10. Ideally, training is executed using the crawl-walk-run approach. This allows and promotes an objective, standards-based approach to training. Training starts at the basic level. Crawl events are relatively simple to conduct and require minimum support from the unit. After the crawl stage, training becomes incrementally more difficult as the training progresses through the walk stage, requiring more resources from the unit and home station, and increasing the level of realism. At the run stage, the level of difficulty for the training event intensifies. Run stage training requires optimum resources and ideally approaches the level of realism expected in combat. Progression from the walk to the run stage for a particular task may occur during a 1-day training exercise or may require a succession of training periods. Crawl-walk-run training provides repetition to ensure that soldiers are proficient at the task. Achievement of the Army standard determines progression between stages. 5-11. In crawl-walk-run training, the task and the standard remain the same, but the conditions may vary. Commanders change the conditions by increasing— The difficulty of the conditions under which the task is being performed. The tempo of the task being trained. The number of tasks being trained. The number of personnel involved in the training. 5-12. All leaders and soldiers need to understand the stage they are currently training and understand the Army standard. Figure 5-2 summarizes key aspects of crawl-walk-run training. 5-4 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution Crawl Walk Run Soldiers Soldiers Soldiers ♦ Train each task step. ♦ Train to training ♦ Train collectively to ♦ Train task steps in objective standard. achieve and sustain sequence. ♦ Train with more proficiency. ♦ Train complete task until realism. ♦ Train under done correctly. ♦ Learn transfer conditions that skills that link simulate actual other tasks. combat. ♦ Work as crews or ♦ Develop effective small units. team relationships.

Figure 5-2. Crawl-Walk-Run Training EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE TRAINING 5-13. The commander’s understanding of crawl-walk-run training enables the development of a training plan that is efficient and effective. For example, the unit commander sequences individual and collective training using a mix of virtual training (for example, STX with MILES) and live training (LFXs) to execute selected tasks under increasingly demanding conditions. 5-14. Efficient training ensures that training resources are properly used. This includes the irreplaceable resource of time—efficiently executed training makes full use of every participant’s time. Continuing advances in training technology enhance the commander’s ability to hone warfighting skills and are increasingly required to balance constraints on training, such as environmental protection considerations and the availability of training areas and ranges. Similarly, TSS products and services, such as SATS and TADSS, are critical resources to assist the commander in planning, executing, and assessing training. TSS not only provides a means for initial and sustainment training on warfighting fundamentals, but also provides relatively inexpensive preparation for resource-intensive training events. Although TSS products provide excellent virtual and constructive training supplements, there is no 5-5 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ substitute for live training. TSS products and services are addressed in appendix G. 5-15. Today’s resource-constrained training environment and complex training tasks demand the right mix of training methods and tools to achieve and sustain unit training readiness. The term “mix” refers to the types and order of L-V-C training used to train from squad to battalion task force and BCT level. 5-16. Optimizing training and training resources requires a comprehensive plan for the mix of L-V-C training. Given current and anticipated constraints, optimizing the training mix and AT event frequency is necessary to sustain proficiency within the Band of Excellence. Live training is essential for building and sustaining lethal crews, squads, platoons, and company teams, batteries, and troops. Virtual and constructive training supplements live walk-stage training in preparation for run-stage training events. Live training “in the dirt” is the best place for battalions and below. Higher echelons may rely on virtual and constructive training to enhance combat readiness. 5-17. Effective training builds proficiency, teamwork, confidence, and cohesiveness. Effective training is competitive. Although individuals and organizations may compete against one another, they should always compete to achieve the Army standard. If they do not initially achieve the standard, trainers take corrective actions so that the proper performance level results. 5-18. Efficient and effective training is well-structured. In the examples that follow, training events and exercises are sequenced to increase individual soldier and leader task proficiency before and during training on collective critical tasks. The example training plans included later in this chapter contain a mix of crawl-walk-run training and L-V-C training to obtain the maximum training benefit from available resources. PRESENTATION OF TRAINING 5-19. Trainers execute training using three basic methods of presentation. They are— Demonstration (the preferred method). Conference. Lecture (the least preferred method). 5-20. These methods may be used in any combination to present training. The trainer’s selection of a specific method depends on the complexity of the task(s) and proficiency of the soldiers (or unit) being trained. 5-21. Demonstration is the preferred method of presentation used at company level and below. Demonstrations accelerate the learning process. The impact of a brief visual demonstration showing the correct method of execution of a given task to standard cannot be overstated. Seeing a task performed correctly provides greater understanding than any amount of explanation. Demonstrations stimulate soldier interest by providing realism that other techniques do not offer. Demonstrations— Save time by showing soldiers the correct way to perform a task. Use the leader as the primary trainer whenever possible. 5-6 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution Present information in a manner that properly motivates. Conclude when soldiers understand the task. 5-22. Trainers conduct demonstrations with very simple, basic tools such as map boards, dry-erase boards, and sand tables, or with more advanced tools such as simulations and simulators. The sand tables and terrain models can be used to conduct rock drills to demonstrate tasks before and after executing them on the ground during squad and platoon training. Sand tables and terrain models can also be used during STX and LFX rehearsals and AARs. Some basic guidance for effective use of sand tables, terrain models, and rock drills includes— Keep the model simple. Cardboard cutouts, pieces of wood, or rocks may represent equipment and units. Keep the training informal. Soldier participation is essential because soldiers learn from one another. Present information that soldiers and leaders need to perform the task. Trainers should check for soldier understanding by asking questions. The trainer should explain the task again, as required, until all soldiers understand the task. 5-23. Conference provides soldiers the opportunity to discuss the information presented. The trainer initiates and guides the discussion. Conferences are most effective when soldiers are familiar with the subject, when there is more than one correct technique or solution, and when time is not critical. Conferences normally do not require hands-on performance. An example of a conference is an AAR. 5-24. Lecture presents information with little discussion other than a question and answer period at the end of the training. Lectures are used when time is limited, when soldiers know little about the subject, and when the lecture is preparing them for demonstration and practice. Lectures are appropriate only if there is a large group to be trained. An example of a lecture is a pre-deployment briefing. Lectures are the least preferred method of training. SITUATIONAL TRAINING EXERCISES 5-25. Situational training exercises (STXs) are mission-related, limited exercises designed to train one collective task, or a group of related tasks and drills, through practice. STXs teach the doctrinally-preferred method for carrying out a task. STXs usually include drills, leader tasks, and individual soldier tasks. To ensure standardization, institutional schools and units develop STXs to teach the doctrinally-preferred way to perform specific missions and tasks. STXs may be modified based on the unit’s METL, or expanded to meet special mission requirements. 5-26. STX training is especially helpful for training specific METL tasks. It is a useful technique primarily for training company team level and smaller units on a series of selected soldier, leader, and collective tasks using specific terrain. The concept provides an effective way to standardize TTPs and develop and rehearse tactical standing operating procedures (TACSOPs). STXs are a perfect opportunity to use crawl- walk-run training. Commanders narrow the focus and select specific collective tasks for the training. STX training may be resource-intensive, so commanders must maximize the benefit. 5-7 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ 5-27. STX training under varying conditions gives the unit a distinct advantage when executing combat operations. STX training at night and during adverse weather provides a training opportunity to execute critical tasks and drills under naturally occurring light and weather conditions, and enhances training realism. Reverse cycle training should be planned to take advantage of every opportunity to replicate a 24-hour operational environment. 5-28. STX training is structured to expose leaders and soldiers to unexpected situations, favorable and unfavorable. Tasks must be executed confidently and competently during the fog of battle. Tough, realistic training challenges leaders and soldiers to overcome the hardships and uncertainties of combat. Challenging training inspires excellence by fostering initiative, enthusiasm, confidence, and the ability to operate in all elements of the operational spectrum. Even if a unit accomplishes the assigned task to standard, the unit may retrain the exercise with more difficult conditions. Figure 5-3 illustrates the general flow of STX training. Figure 5-3. STX/LFX Training LIVE FIRE EXERCISES 5-29. Live fire exercises (LFXs) closely replicate battlefield conditions and provide significant advantages. LFXs— Develop confidence and esprit-de-corps. Provide soldiers with a realistic experience of the danger, confusion, and speed of combat operations. Require demonstrated proficiency at lower echelons before LFXs are conducted at higher echelons. 5-8 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution STAFF TRAINING 5-30. Staff training develops and sustains planning, coordination, and other staff functions related to operational mission requirements. The staff derives its training objectives from the staff METL. The common training challenge for the staff is to synchronize and integrate BOS functions. Commanders must integrate staffs horizontally and vertically. Horizontal integration involves intra-CP cell coordination and inter-CP coordination at the same command echelon. Vertical integration involves inter-CP functional coordination among two or more command echelons. 5-31. Commanders accomplish horizontal and vertical integration by focusing staff training on C2 processes and procedures. These processes and procedures help staffs provide commanders with accurate, relevant, and timely information. Staffs use the MDMP and IPB to help commanders visualize and describe the current and future situations, and to establish and maintain an accurate COP. 5-32. Additionally, selected staff members must master various staff processes. Staff processes assist planning, coordinating, and monitoring operations. Staffs use these processes to help commanders direct operations during preparation and execution. Examples of staff processes are “Develop a R&S Plan,” “Execute the Targeting Process,” “Conduct A2C2 Activities,” and “Conduct Civil-Military Operations (CMO).” 5-33. The importance of ABCS and FBCB2 systems operator training to maintaining a staff’s METL proficiency cannot be overstated. ABCS and FBCB2 systems provide digital automation support to help the staff visualize and describe the situation for the commander, and direct execution of the commander’s decision through a COP. Staff training must sustain staff members and various ABCS and FBCB2 systems operator proficiency to optimize the staff’s METL proficiency. 5-34. Staff training includes the following: Staff section, CP cell, and cell element— Training focuses on achieving individual, section, CP cell, and cell element task proficiency before progressing to staff group and full staff training. Staff group training and drills focus on critical inter-CP cell staff control processes that contribute directly to full staff competency. Examples of inter-CP cell staff control-oriented processes are “Develop an R&S Plan,” “Execute the Targeting Process,” and “Conduct A2C2 Activities.” Full staff training focuses on critical command-oriented staff processes that directly affect full staff proficiency. MDMP and IPB are examples of critical command-oriented staff processes. Multiechelon staff— Training focuses on full staff interaction with higher, subordinate, and adjacent unit staffs. Involves inter-CP functional coordination among two or more command echelons. Includes full staff, staff group, CP cell, cell element, and staff section training. 5-9 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ 5-35. Figure 5-4 organizes CP cell/cell element/staff section, staff group, full staff, and multiechelon training exercises into crawl-walk-run skill proficiency training levels. Figure 5-4.

At brigade level and higher, staffs conduct most of their training in the constructive environment, with limited use of virtual simulations. Effective staff training produces commanders and staffs capable of synchronizing operations across the full spectrum of operations. 5-10 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution SECTION II: PREPARATION FOR TRAINING 5-38. As discussed in chapter 4, formal near-term planning for training culminates with the publication of the unit training schedule. Preparing for training is the vital step between planning for and conducting training. Preparation is key to ensuring the optimum use of resources and to providing quality training to standard. In the digital environment, preparation becomes especially important with the need to set message handling tables to ensure the proper flow of information to the right places at the right times. During preparation for training, commanders identify and eliminate potential training distracters. Commanders also stress personnel accountability to ensure maximum attendance at training. Figure 5-6 illustrates the core training preparation tasks. Figure 5-6. Training Execution (Preparation for Training) 5-39. Subordinate leaders—using bottom-up feedback from training meetings—identify and select the collective, leader, and individual soldier tasks necessary to support the identified training objectives. Commanders identify the resource requirements for preparatory training, concurrent training, and training execution. At a minimum, the commander should address the following training resource requirements: Confirmation of training areas and locations. Training ammunition allocations. Required training support packages (TSPs) and terrain database availability. Training simulations and simulators availability. Transportation requirements. Soldier support items. Risk management/assessment. Assignment of responsibility for the training. 5-11 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Designation of trainers responsible for training. Allocation of time and other necessary resources to support retraining. 5-40. Preparation for training includes— Select tasks. Identify and select training tasks as a result of bottom-up feedback and commander’s assessment. Plan the training. “Who.” Identify the units, staffs, leaders, and individual soldiers to be trained. “What.” —Specify the training objectives and the types of training events. —Link training objectives to the METL with specific critical collective, leader, and individual soldier tasks. “When.” —Specify sequence of the training tasks and events. —Consider crawl and walk stages of training and individual soldier training needs required prior to run stage of training events. “Where.” Coordinate ranges, training areas, simulations and simulators, and other essential equipment to support identified training tasks and events. Back-brief higher commander on major training events. Brief higher headquarters on major events (FTXs, CPXs, etc.). Provide detailed objectives, scenarios, support requirements, and timelines. Provide initial risk/management assessment. Train the trainers. Identify leaders, trainers, evaluators, OCs, and OPFOR to be trained to standard and rehearsed prior to the conduct of training. Prepare leaders, trainers, evaluators, OCs, and OPFOR to evaluate leader, unit, staff, and individual soldier performance in accordance with specific ARTEP-MTP or soldier MOS-specific task(s). Prepare OPFOR leaders and units to replicate desired threat situations; designated OPFOR leaders and units should use specific ARTEP-MTP or soldier MOS-specific tasks. Allocate time on the training schedule for preparation tasks to occur. Recon the site. Conduct a reconnaissance of the range and/or training site. Execute “rock drills” and “walk-throughs” for trainers, evaluators, OCs, and the OPFOR, as required. Conduct risk management/assessment. For details on the conduct of risk assessment, refer to appendix H and FM 100-14. 5-12 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution Issue the training plan. Clearly identify the responsibilities for the conduct of the training. Issue the training plan as an OPORD, training directive, or training schedule. Rehearse. Conduct rehearsals for trainers, evaluators, OCs, and the OPFOR. Allocate time on the training schedule for adequate rehearsals. Conduct pre-execution checks. Continue informal planning and detailed coordination until the training is conducted. Ensure that the chain of command identifies and fixes responsibility for pre-execution checks. Continue coordination during training meeting. Include preparation of individuals to be trained, trainers who will execute and evaluate training, and training support required. Ensure that all planning and prerequisite training (leader, collective, and individual soldier) is conducted prior to the execution of training. Provide attention to detail needed to use resources efficiently. 5-41. Preparation for training in RC units can require complex pre- execution checks. RC trainers must often conduct detailed coordination to obtain equipment, TSS products, and ammunition from distant locations. In many cases, RC pre-execution checks may require coordination for AC assistance from the numbered continental United States Armies (CONUSAs), divisions (training support), and associated units. TRAIN THE TRAINER 5-42. Although addressed briefly in paragraph 5-40, train the trainer is so important that it requires elaboration. Leadership by example is especially important for trainers. Trainers must demonstrate task proficiency before teaching a task to others. Commanders and leaders must ensure that trainers are thoroughly prepared to conduct performance-oriented training. Trainer competence and confidence is contagious. 5-43. Commanders and leaders ensure that trainers are prepared to conduct performance-oriented training to standard when they provide specific guidance and resources. They ensure adequate preparation time so the trainer can— Review references, such as ARTEP-MTPs, soldier’s manuals, FMs, and TMs to understand tasks, conditions, and standards. Gather and prepare training support items. Conduct a reconnaissance of the training site. Prepare the training. Conduct a risk assessment Schedule rehearsals for the trainer. 5-13 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Conduct rehearsals to— Verify trainer task proficiency (technically and tactically). Identify any weak points in the training presentation. Coach the trainer on effective training techniques. Determine how the trainer will evaluate soldier/unit performance, and have the trainer demonstrate evaluation procedures. Promote trainer confidence. Verify trainer ability to conduct AARs. Ensure appropriate use of the T&EO— Whenever possible, use a published T&EO. If a T&EO must be developed, use appropriate MTPs, soldier’s manuals, drill books, and similar publications. Use the T&EO to guide soldier, leader, and collective training. Use the T&EO to specify training objectives. 5-44. Figure 5-7 provides a trainer preparation checklist. Prepare Yourself ♦ Know how to perform the task being trained (master the task). o Rehearse training. o Back-brief the chain of command on your training plan and get their feedback. ♦ Know how to train others to perform the tasks. o Ensure that training is performance-oriented. o Conduct yourself in a confident manner. o Accurately answer your soldier’s questions. o Train an assistant who can conduct the training to standard in your absence. ♦ Know how to set up and conduct an AAR. ♦ Prepare the resources. o Identify and request TADSS. o Get equipment and materials before rehearsal. o Operate the equipment to become familiar with it, and check for completeness and spare parts. ♦ Ensure that training support personnel (to include OPFOR)— o Understand their support roles. o Know their roles as evaluators, OCs, and the OPFOR. o Are equipped and prepared to perform the tasks to standard. o Conduct reconnaissance and rehearsals. ♦ Prepare the soldier. o Identify the soldiers to be trained. o Evaluate levels of training proficiency. o Train any prerequisite tasks or skills first. o Motivate the soldiers. (Tell them why the task is important and how it relates to their METL.) Figure 5-7. Trainer Preparation Checklist 5-14 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution CONDUCT PRE-EXECUTION CHECKS 5-45. Pre-execution checks are the informal coordination conducted prior to the conduct of training. They are developed by the chain of command to prepare individual soldiers, leaders, trainers, and units systematically, and to ensure that training is resourced and conducted properly. They become increasingly detailed as training schedules are developed. Pre- execution checks provide the attention to detail needed to use resources efficiently. These checks are developed and responsibilities for them are fixed. Pre-execution checks are an important component of both preparation for training, and conduct of training. Figure 5-8 shows a sample pre-execution checklist. ♦ Are soldiers trained on prerequisite tasks prior to conduct of training? ♦ Have ranges and facilities been requested; has a reconnaissance been conducted? ♦ Are leaders certified to conduct range operations? ♦ Have convoy clearances been submitted and approved? ♦ Have TADSS been identified and requested? ♦ Have Class I, III, V supplies been requested and have pickup times and turn-in times been coordinated? ♦ Has transportation been requested? ♦ Are there risk assessments for each training event? ♦ Has the backbrief for the chain of command been coordinated? ♦ Is time scheduled for retraining? Figure 5-8. Sample Pre-Execution Checklist PREPARATION FOR TRAINING EXAMPLES 5-46. This section provides three different, detailed training preparation examples— The first example follows the A/1-77 IN company’s training preparation to execute infantry squad evaluations and squad LFXs. The A/1-77 IN training preparation plan is based on the A/1-77 IN company and the 1-77 IN battalion commanders’ assessment and training strategy presented in chapter 4. The second example follows the 1st BSB’s training preparation for the BSB FTX as part of the BCT’s CFX. The 1st BSB training preparation plan is based on the 1st BSB and 1st BCT commanders’ assessment and training strategy presented in chapter 4. The third example details BCT staff training preparation for the BCT’s shaping operations exercise immediately following the BCT CFX. The BCT staff training preparation plan is based on the BCT commander’s staff assessment and training strategy presented in chapter 4. 5-15 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ A/1-77 IN SQUAD EVAL AND LFX Select Tasks 5-47. This is the first task involved in preparing for training. Recall that in chapter 4 the A/1-77 IN commander conducted an assessment of the METL task “Assault an Objective” and identified the company’s training requirements. The A/1-77 commander reviewed platoon critical collective tasks, drills, and individual soldier task evaluations that impacted on the company’s proficiency to execute the METL task “Assault an Objective.” The company commander conducted the review with the 1SG, rifle and MGS platoon leaders, company FSO, mortar section sergeant, and other key NCOs. The company medic and a representative from the BSB S2/3 were also present. The company commander identified the following shortcomings: Rifle platoons: “P” for “Assault an Objective.” “U” for “Breach an Obstacle.” “P” for “Attack by Fire.” “P” for “Conduct an Area Recon.” MGS platoon: “U” for “Support by Fire.” Mortar section “U” for “Fire a Priority Target.” “P” for “Fire Immediate Suppression.” All platoons and sections: “P” for “Treat and Evacuate Casualties.” Platoon leader tasks: “P” for “Integrate Indirect Fire Support.” “P” for “Analyze Terrain.” “P” for “Conduct TLPs.” “P” for “Conduct Platoon Maneuver.” “U” for “Call for/Adjust Indirect Fire.” 5-48. The 1st squad leader of the 1st platoon began this task selection process with an evaluation of the team leaders’ ability to perform supporting critical leader tasks and the soldiers’ ability to perform supporting individual soldier tasks. This evaluation was based upon the squad leader’s personal observations, feedback from the team leaders, and feedback from external sources, for example, the platoon leader and platoon sergeant. The squad leader identified the following shortcomings: Individual soldier tasks: “P” for engaging targets (day and night) with M16A2, M203, M249 SAW and M 240 machine gun (MG). “U” for “Move as Part of a Fire Team.” Fire team leader tasks: “P” for “Control Organic Fires.” “P” for “Conduct Squad Maneuver.” “P” for “Analyze Terrain.” “P” for “Conduct TLPs.” “U” for “Call for/Adjust Indirect Fire.” 5-16 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution 5-49. The 1st platoon leader reviewed evaluations of squad collective tasks, drills and individual soldier tasks that impacted on the platoon’s proficiency to execute the critical task “Assault an Objective” with the platoon sergeant and squad leaders. The platoon leader identified the following shortcomings: Rifle squads: “P” for “Enter/Clear a Trench.” “P” for “Knock Out a Bunker.” “U” for “Support by Fire.” “U” for “Breach an Obstacle.” Weapons squad: “U” for “Support by Fire.” Squad leader tasks: “P” for “Control Organic Fires.” “P” for “Conduct Squad Maneuver.” “P” for “Analyze Terrain.” “P” for “Conduct TLP.” “U” for “Call for/Adjust Indirect Fire.” “U” for “Call for/Adjust Indirect Fire.” 5-50. Figure 5-9 highlights training tasks the A/1-77 IN commander selected to improve the company’s METL proficiency for METL tasks “Assault an Objective” and “Integrate Direct & Indirect Fires.” The A/1- 77 IN commander selected these tasks based on bottom-up feedback and input received from the platoon and squad leaders that was considered in assessing the unit’s current proficiency on these particular METL tasks. Figure 5-9. Selected Training Tasks to Improve A/1-77 IN METL Proficiency for METL Tasks: “Assault an Objective,” “Integrate Indirect Fire Support,” and “Breach an Obstacle” 5-17 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ 5-51. The A/1-77 IN commander now develops a company training strategy consistent with the 1-77 IN commander’s training strategy described in chapter 4. Figure 5-10 illustrates the A/1-77 IN commander’s strategy to improve the company’s training proficiency for the company METL task “Assault an Objective.” Figure 5-10. A/1-77 IN Commander’s Training Strategy 5-52. Notice that the A/1-77 IN commander selects squad STXs and LFXs as two of the training events to improve A/1-77 IN training proficiency for the METL task “Assault an Objective.” STXs and LFXs are common training events included in many unit training strategies. They are designed to maintain proficiency on METL tasks related to attack operations. 5-53. The company commander decides to build the squad STXs and LFXs around critical rifle squad tasks and drills that support the platoon critical task “Conduct an Assault.” The commander selects two specific tactical tasks—“Breach an Obstacle” and “Follow and Support.” Also, the commander selects two specific rifle squad drills—“Knock Out a Bunker” and “Enter/Clear a Trench Line.” 5-54. The company commander recognizes that the mortar section has not conducted a LFX since before their deployment to Bosnia. However, the company mortar section has conducted a gunner’s skills test and FDC proficiency training during mission training while deployed. The commander decides that the mortar section must train on “Fire Priority Target,” and “Fire Immediate Suppression.” 5-55. This completes the A/1-77 IN commander’s selection of tasks to be trained. The commander reviews these tasks in the appropriate ARTEP- MTP with the key leaders present. 5-18 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution Plan the Training / Issue the Training Plan 5-56. The A/1-77 IN commander bases the near-term training plan on the 1-77 IN commander’s 2nd quarter training plan. Major events of the 1-77 IN and 1st BCT 2nd quarter training plan are highlighted in figure 5-11. Figure 5-11. 1st BCT and 1-77 IN 2nd Quarter Training (Major Events) 5-57. The A/1-77 IN commander reviews the battalion’s major training events for the 2nd quarter with the 1SG, rifle and MGS platoon leaders, company FSO, mortar section sergeant, and other key NCOs. They also review the preparation for training tasks (figure 5-6), and tasks associated with planning and preparing for the STX and LFX training. Figure 5-12 illustrates the STX/LFX training plan. 5-19 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 5-12. STX/LFX Training Plan 5-58. The company commander determines the leader and unit training required for the rifle squads and mortar section to execute the selected training tasks. The commander, with the 1SG, rifle and MGS platoon leaders, company FSO, mortar section sergeant, and other key NCOs, identifies the following leader tasks: “P” for “Analyze Terrain.” “P” for “Conduct Troop Leading Procedures.” “U” for “Call for/Adjust Fire.” 5-59. The company mortar section sergeant reminds the company commander that the company mortar section is scheduled to execute two LFXs in the second quarter. The platoon leaders recognize this is an opportunity for them and the squad leaders to train “Call for/Adjust Fire.” The company FSO notes the A/1-77 IN FIST will be training on those tasks in the GUARDFIST II simulator. The FSO suggests that the platoon leaders and squad leaders train on “Call for/Adjust Fire” along with the company FIST; platoon leaders and squad leaders can then conduct “Call for/Adjust Fire” missions during the company mortar section LFXs with the A/1-77 IN FIST. The company commander concurs. 5-60. The company commander recognizes that the platoon leaders need leader training on platoon critical collective tasks that support “Assault an Objective.” The company commander knows that they will execute this task both day and night during the BCT CFX as part of A/1-77 IN company’s preparation to provide OC support to a sister infantry company during the 2nd BCT EXEVAL. 5-20 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution 5-61. The commander decides to conduct leader training with the platoon and mortar section leaders and company FSO during a company TEWT for the following tasks to support the task “Assault an Objective.” The company commander plans to train TLPs, and emphasizes— Company R&S planning. Specific actions of assault, breach, and support elements. Details of direct fire execution. Details of integrating indirect fires. Conduct during both daylight and limited visibility conditions. Supporting critical platoon and squad collective tasks and drills. “Knock Out a Bunker.” “Enter/Clear a Trench Line.” “Breach an Obstacle.” “Conduct an Area Recon.” 5-62. The company commander and 1SG recognize that all leaders will continue to work on preparing risk assessments. The company commander emphasizes that “risk assessment” is not a euphemism for “avoid any and all risk,” but that detailed risk assessments allow the company to enhance training realism. Risk assessment is an active, ongoing process during training, which reinforces the understanding that risk assessment is conducted in operations to mitigate risks that may impact on accomplishing the mission. 5-63. Figure 5-13 summarizes planned leader training for A/1-77 IN to support the unit squad STXs and LFXs. Figure 5-13. A/1-77 Leader Training 5-21 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ 5-64. Most important, planning the training must address unit preparation training to execute the squad STXs and LFXs. A/1-77 IN will start with individual soldier training focused on weapons qualification on live fire ranges. The training will emphasize individual soldier tactical movement techniques, NBC training, and first aid-related tasks during dedicated squad leader training periods. 5-65. Rifle squads will practice supporting squad critical tasks and drills during squad training. Figure 5-14 highlights A/1-77 IN training events that are designed to prepare the rifle squads for the STXs and LFXs. Figure 5-14. A/1-77 IN Near-Term Training Plan (Jan-Feb XX) 5-66.

Prepares a risk assessment. Rehearses the team leaders to ensure that they are proficient on all training tasks. Conducts pre-execution checks. Team leaders draw, inspect, and test EST 2000 equipment. 5-69. The squad leader executes the training session as follows: Conducts pre-execution checks. Team leaders set up training site and ensure that all training aids and reference publications are on hand. Squad members draw individual weapons and NBC equipment. Squad members perform pre-operations checks on the equipment. Team leaders inspect individual soldiers. Squad leader updates the risk assessment with the team leaders. Executes training. Starts the training session with a review of the task, conditions, and standard for each task. Demonstrates each task under the specified conditions. Conducts a “hands-on” walk-through of the task performance measures and steps for each training task. Squad members conduct individual hands-on practice with the squad leader and team leaders providing one-on-one coaching with individual squad members. Squad leader then evaluates each squad member on each training task. Retrains at first opportunity. Team leaders provide retraining for individual squad members who do not meet the standard during the squad leader’s evaluation. Squad leader re-evaluates individual squad members after completing retraining. The training period is completed only after all squad members earn a “GO” on the training tasks. Conducts AAR of the training session with the team leaders. The squad leader provides each team leader with an individual evaluation of their presentation of training and coaching of individual squad members. Train the Trainers, Evaluators, and Observer/Controllers / Recon the Site 5-70. The A/1-77 IN company uses internal evaluation for the squad STXs and LFXs. Therefore, planning leader training supports training trainers, evaluators, and observer/controllers (OCs), and conducting rehearsals. The squad STXs are conducted on the same terrain on which the company conducted the TEWT. Figure 5-16 highlights trainer, evaluator, and OC preparation and rehearsals. 5-25 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 5-16. A/1-77 IN Trainer, Evaluator, and OC Training (Squad EVAL Force on Force Phase and LFX) Train the OPFOR 5-71. OPFOR training and rehearsals are necessary in order to replicate threat conditions. The company commander, with the rest of the company leaders, decides that the rifle platoon weapons squads will be the OPFOR for the squad EVAL STXs. 5-72. OPFOR tasks, conditions, and standards are often contained in applicable ARTEP-MTPs, and are cross-referenced to the T&EOs that require OPFOR support for training. The commander identifies and selects OPFOR training tasks and training objectives. The selected OPFOR collective task is “Prepare a Squad Defense.” The commander also identifies supporting training tasks. Those tasks are— “Select Primary, Alternate, and Supplementary M 240 MG Positions.” “Prepare and Camouflage M 240 MG Positions.” “Prepare M 240 MG Range Cards.” “Position and Emplace Tactical and Protective Mined Wire Obstacles.” 5-26 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution 5-73. The commander also selects leader training tasks for the weapons squad leaders. Those tasks are— “Prepare Squad Fire Plan/Sector Sketch.” “Control and Direct Squad Fires.” “Select and Establish Observation Posts/Listening Posts (OPs/LPs).” 5-74. The weapons squads’ training sequences the following events: Conduct preliminary M 240 MG training in the EST 2000 simulator. Conduct M 240 MG qualification (10 meter and transition range; day and night) Train preparing range cards and squad fire plans; train controlling and directing squad fires (EST 2000, and under day and night conditions).

The BSB commander will use a mix of crawl-walk-run training events to improve training proficiency in the METL tasks “Defend Against Level I and II Threats” and “Provide DS Level Combat Service Support.” This training includes officer professional development (OPD) events, noncommissioned officer professional development (NCOPD) events, TEWTs, and FTXs. The capstone event for this training period will be a battalion FTX in which the BSB will provide support to BCT units participating in the BCT CFX. Using the appropriate ARTEP-MTP, the BSB commander, in coordination with key subordinate leaders, develops training objectives for the tasks that will be trained. 5-94. The BSB’s company commanders develop training strategies that are consistent with the BSB commander’s strategy. Figure 5-24 highlights the training strategies for the headquarters and distribution company, the forward maintenance company, and the brigade support medical company to improve proficiency for the BSB METL tasks “Defend Against Level I and II Threat” and “Provide DS Level Combat Service Support.” The company commanders select training tasks based on bottom-up feedback and input from their subordinate leaders. 5-36 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution Figure 5-24. BSB Company Commanders’ Training Strategies 5-95. Each company commander uses crawl-walk-run training events to improve training proficiency on their respective company METL tasks that support the BSB METL tasks. These events include individual soldier training, M16 qualification range, company TEWTs, platoon STX, and company FTX. Using the appropriate ARTEP-MTP, each company commander, in coordination with key subordinate leaders, develops training objectives for the tasks that will be trained. Plan the Training / Issue the Training Plan 5-96. The BSB commander bases the near-term training plan on the BCT commander’s 2nd quarter training plan. The BSB commander reviews the BCT’s major events for the 2nd quarter with the CSM, staff, company commanders and 1SGs, and other key officers and NCOs from the battalion. Maneuver battalions locate their field trains in the brigade support area (BSA). Therefore, the BSB commander also includes the HHC commanders and 1SGs of the BCT’s maneuver battalions in this planning meeting. The battalion commander recognizes that the battalion S2/3 and SPO will participate in the BCT TEWT. The BSB commander decides to conduct battalion-level OPD/NCOPDs, a TEWT in conjunction with the 1st BCT JANUS exercise, and a battalion FTX in conjunction 5-37 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ with the 1st BCT CFX. Major events of the BCT and BSB 2nd quarter training plan are highlighted in figure 5-25. Figure 5-25. 1st BSB and 1st BCT 2nd Quarter Training (Major Events) 5-97. The BSB commander, with the CSM, staff, and company commanders, reviews the leader training to be conducted during the battalion-sponsored OPD/NCOPD. They identify the following leader/staff tasks to be trained: “Direct Response to Threat Actions.” “Establish Platoon Defense.” 5-98. The BSB commander views the constructive simulation of the BCT’s JANUS exercise as an ideal vehicle to train the staff and company commanders in a TEWT training format. Along with the staff, company commanders CSM, and 1SGs, the BSB commander selects the following tasks to be trained during the TEWT: Staff tasks: “Conduct Threat Order of Battle (S2/3).” “Develop Intelligence Estimate (S2/3).” “Prepare Operations Plan/Operations Order and Annexes (S2/3).” “Operate Base Cluster Operations Center (S2/3).” “Coordinate Base Cluster Response to Threat (S2/3).” “Coordinate Class III Support (SPO).” “Coordinate Maintenance Support (SPO).” 5-38 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution “Coordinate Combat Health Support (SPO).” “Coordinate Ground Transportation Support (SPO).” Company leader tasks (all): “Supervise Set-Up of Company Defensive Sector.” “Direct Response Against a Level I Threat.” Headquarters and distribution company: “Supervise Petroleum Operations.” Forward maintenance company: “Supervise Assigned Field Maintenance Operations.” Brigade support medical company: “Supervise Combat Health Support Activities.” 5-99. The battalion FTX will reinforce the tasks trained in the OPDs and TEWTS, but under more difficult and complex conditions. In addition, these tasks will be externally evaluated by elements of the division support command and by evaluators provided by the 1-77 IN battalion. 5-100. The 1st BSB S2/3 analyzes how the battalion could improve its training proficiency on the BSB METL task “Defend Against Level I and II Threats” with BSB company and other BCT battalion field trains commanders. The HHC/1-77 IN commander notes that many critical rifle platoon, squad, and individual soldier tasks inherent in preparing and executing company and platoon level defenses are tasks BSB companies need training on to improve on this particular METL task. The HHC/1-77 IN commander indicates that there is an opportunity to “piggyback” training with the 1-77 IN battalion, particularly regarding the BSB METL task “Defend Against Level I and II Threats.” The HHC/1-77 IN commander advises the BSB S2/3 that the 1-77 IN rifle companies plan to conduct squad EVAL STXs. The commander also states that the A/1-77 IN commander is planning to use the rifle platoon weapons squads as OPFOR. The BSB S2/3 briefs the BSB commander and is directed to determine what training BSB units could do with the 1-77 IN battalion. 5-101. The BSB S2/3 contacts the 1-77 IN S3 and inquires about the A/1- 77 IN weapons squads planned OPFOR training. The 1-77 IN S3 contacts the A/1-77 IN commander. The A/1-77 IN commander briefly explains the weapons squad training plan and offers to conduct “train-the-trainer” training for BSB NCOs on platoon- and squad-level defensive tasks. The 1-77 IN S3 calls the BSB S2/3. They discuss the A/1-77 IN weapons squad training and the A/1-77 IN commander’s willingness to conduct the “train-the-trainer” program. 5-102. The 1-77 IN S3 asks the 1st BSB S2/3 what arrangements have been made for OPFOR during the BCT CFX to provide the BSA a training opportunity to practice the BSB METL task “Defend Against Level I and II Threats.” The BSB S2/3 replies that the BCT CFX is to be an OPFOR rehearsal for the 2nd BCT EXEVAL. So, the designated OPFOR for the 2nd BCT’s EXEVAL plans to conduct rehearsals for designated Level I and II threat events. 5-103. However, the BSB S2/3 wants additional OPFOR activity. The 1- 77 IN S3 sees this as an opportunity to train platoon- and squad-level patrols against the BSA. The BSB S2/3 tentatively agrees. The BSB S2/3 briefs the 1st BSB commander and the 1-77 IN S3 briefs the 1-77 IN 5-39 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ commander. The 1-77 IN and 1st BSB commanders agree that this is a good training opportunity that fits the training calendars of both units. 5-104. The three company commanders in the BSB base their near-term training plan on the BCT and BSB commander’s 2nd quarter training events (figure 5-25). Each company commander reviews the battalion’s major training events for the 2nd quarter with the 1SG, platoon leaders, platoon sergeants, and other key NCOs. The three company commanders each identify training events that would need to be accomplished to prepare their units for the battalion FTX (figure 5-26). These include individual soldier training, M16 qualification range, TEWTs, squad/section training, platoon STXs, and company FTXs. Figure 5-26.

Based on feedback from the squad/section leaders, individual soldier training will focus on the following tasks— “Engage Targets with M16A1/2.” “Construct Individual Fighting Position.” “Prepare Range Card.” “Operate Pump and Filter Separator (Fuel Section).” “Operate Boom/Hoist, Wheeled Recovery Vehicle (Recovery Section).” “Open Airway (Ambulance Squad).” “Manage Convulsive and/or Seizing Patient (Ambulance Squad).” 5-106. The BSB S2/3 informs the battalion and company commanders that A/1-77 IN will be executing OPFOR training for squad and platoon 5-40 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution defense, and that “train-the-trainer” training has been arranged for the BSB companies. Each company commander and 1SG recognizes that their platoon leaders, platoon sergeants, section leaders, and squad leaders need training on the tasks that support “Defend Unit Area.” Each commander knows that they will execute this task both day and night during the battalion FTX. The company commanders decide to capitalize on the A/1-77 IN training opportunity and conduct leader training using a TEWT on “Defend Unit Area” with emphasis on the following: Platoon and section/squad collective tasks: “Set up Section/Squad Defense.” —“Select Primary, Alternate and Supplementary M 240MG, M 249 MG, MK-19s and M 203 Grenade Launcher Positions.” —“Prepare and Camouflage M 240 MG, M 249 MG, MK-19s and M 203 Grenade Launcher Positions.” —“Prepare M 240 MG, M 249 MG, MK-19s and M 203 Grenade Launcher Range Cards.” —“Position and Emplace Protective Mined Wire Obstacles.” “Set up Platoon Defense.” —“Defend Against Level I Attack.” Supporting leader tasks: “Reorganize Section/Squad Following Enemy Contact While in the Defense.” “Supervise Set-Up of Platoon Defensive Sector.” “Prepare Platoon and Squad Fire Plan/Sector Sketch.” “Select and Establish OPs/LPs.” “Conduct Defense by a Platoon.” —“Control and Direct Squad Fires.” —“Call For and Adjust Indirect Fires.” 5-107. Based on feedback from their subordinate leaders, each company commander identifies the need for squad training on functional tasks that support critical platoon tasks. These tasks include the following: Fuel section (headquarters and distribution company): “Conduct Petroleum Operations.” “Supervise Pump and Filter Separator Operations.” Recovery section (forward maintenance company): “Perform Recovery Operations.” “Coordinate Recovery Operation with Unit Using Analog or Digital Communications.” Ambulance squad (brigade support medical company): “Operate Ambulance Exchange Points (AXPs).” “Supervise establishment of AXPs.” 5-108. Using feedback from subordinate leaders, each company commander determines that the training focus for the platoon STX will be “Defend Platoon Sector.” The STX will focus on the following 5-41 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ section/squad and platoon critical collective tasks and critical leader tasks: Critical collective tasks: “Set Up Section/Squad Defense.” “Select Primary, Alternate, and Supplementary M 240 MG, M 249 MG, MK-19s, and M 203 Grenade Launcher Positions.” “Position and Emplace Protective Mined Wire Obstacles.” “Set Up Platoon Defense.” “Defend Against Level I Attack.” Supporting leader tasks: “Reorganize Section/Squad Following Enemy Contact While in the Defense.” “Supervise Set-Up of Platoon Defensive Sector.” “Prepare Platoon and Squad Fire Plan/Sector Sketch.” “Select and Establish OPs/LPs.” “Conduct Defense by a Platoon.” “Control and Direct Squad Fires.” “Call for and Adjust Indirect Fires.” Individual solider tasks: “Prepare and Camouflage M 240 MG, M 249 MG, MK-19s, and M 203 Grenade Launcher Positions.” “Prepare M 240 MG, M 249 MG, MK-19s, and M 203 Grenade Launcher Range Cards.” 5-109. Finally, based on the feedback from subordinate leaders, the company commanders determine that the company FTX, scheduled just prior to the battalion FTX, will focus on the company METL task “Defend Unit Area.” This focus will reinforce and retrain the tasks trained during the platoon STX and address the following company METL and leader tasks: “Defend Unit Area.” “Supervise Set-up of Company Defense.” “Direct Response Against a Level I Threat.” Train the Trainers, Evaluators, and Observer/Controllers / Recon the Site 5-110. The 1st BSB will use external evaluation for the BSB FTX. The division support command (DISCOM) headquarters will provide CSS functional task evaluators and OCs. These evaluators and OCs will focus evaluation on tasks that support the BSB METL task “Provide DS Level Combat Service Support.” The 1-77 IN battalion will provide evaluators and OCs to support the evaluation of tasks associated with the BSB METL task “Defend Against Level I and II Threats.” At the DISCOM commander’s direction, the DISCOM evaluators and OCs will participate in the BSB planned leader training (for example, OPD/NCOPDs, map exercises [MAPEXs], and TEWTs). Train the OPFOR 5-111. OPFOR training and rehearsals are necessary in order to replicate threat conditions. For the BSB FTX (BCT CFX), the OPFOR will be provided by two distinct, but coordinated elements. Because the BCT CFX is a rehearsal for the OPFOR for the 2nd BCT EXEVALs, this 5-42 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution OPFOR will conduct two Level I activity events against the BSA. Additionally, the BSB S2/3 is coordinating with the 1-77 IN S3 to have the A/1-77 IN commander train platoon- and squad-level area reconnaissance patrols against the BSA. 5-112. For the platoon STXs and company FTXs, the BSB commander decides to resource the OPFOR internally by using the battalion quick reaction force (QRF). This as an opportunity to train the QRF on the following tasks: “Dismounted Movement Techniques.” “Assault an Objective.” “Attack by Fire.” 5-113. The BSB S2/3 coordinates with 1-77 IN S3 and A/1-77 IN commander to “piggyback” the QRF training with planned squad and platoon training in A/1-77 IN. Figure 5-27 summarizes the BSB QRF OPFOR training and preparation. Figure 5-27. BSB QRF OPFOR Preparation for 2nd Quarter Training (Major Events) Prepare the Training Site / Conduct Pre-Execution Checks 5-114. The commanders conduct pre-execution checks and monitor progress during updates at company and battalion training meetings. The battalion’s pre-execution checks are focused on TADSS, supplies and equipment, maintenance, and readiness. Figure 5-28 highlights some of the key pre-execution checks. 5-43 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 5-28. 1st BSB Pre-Execution Checks for BSB FTX 5-115. Near-term planning for RC units follows the same process as for AC units, but extends over 4 months. Figure 5-29 shows RC timelines and the level of organizational training for near-term planning in the BSB and two subordinate companies. This RC example is a continuation of the discussion in chapter 4. 5-44 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution Figure 5-29. RC BSB Near-Term Training Plan (Major Events) 1ST BCT STAFF TRAINING EXAMPLE 5-116. The 1st BCT shaping operations LFX is a multiechelon training event. This event immediately follows the BCT CFX. This is the BCT staff’s opportunity to synchronize live fires of the DS FA battalion, AH-64 Attack helicopter units, and USAF CAS sorties. This staff training example focuses on two staff tasks: “Develop an R&S Plan” and “Execute the Targeting Process.” Select Tasks 5-117. “Select Tasks” is the first step in preparing for staff training. In this example, the BCT commander has reviewed staff-related task and drill evaluations, personal observations, and other reports related to the BCT staff training proficiency to execute the METL task “Conduct an Attack” and identified the staff training requirements (chapter 4). The BCT commander organizes these evaluations and other sources of feedback as follows: Full staff. Staff groups. Main CP cells. CP cell elements. Staff sections. 5-118. Additionally, the BCT commander analyzes individual staff officer, NCO, and soldier evaluations involving ABCS and FBCB2 systems proficiency. The BCT commander conducts this review with— BCT XO. 5-45 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Coordinating staff officers (S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6). Special staff officers. Air defense coordinator (ADCOORD). Air liaison officer (ALO). Aviation coordination (AVCOORD). Chemical officer (CHEMO). Electronic warfare officer (EWO). ENCOORD. Military police liaison officer (MPLNO) Fire support coordinator (FSCOORD). This individual is called the effects coordinator (ECOORD) in some BCT organizations. Psychological operations (PSYOP) officer. Personal staff officers. Chaplain. Public affairs officer (PAO) when required. Staff judge advocate (SJA). 5-119. The BCT commander, based on input and feedback from the XO, and coordinating, special, and personal staff, identifies staff training requirements and selects the following specific training tasks to improve the BCT’s proficiency for the METL task “Conduct an Attack:” “P” for “Plan Operations Using the MDMP.” “P” for “Develop an R&S Plan.” “P” for “Execute the Targeting Process.” “P” for “Establish (and Maintain) a Common Operational Picture.” 5-120. Figure 5-30 and figure 5-31 summarize selected main CP cell and CP cell element training tasks to improve the BCT staff R&S and targeting teams’ proficiency on the tasks “Develop an R&S Plan” and “Execute the Targeting Process.” 5-46 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution Figure 5-30. Selected Main CP Cell and Element Training Tasks to Improve R&S Team Proficiency on the Staff Group Task: “Develop an R&S Plan” Figure 5-31. Selected Main CP Cell and Element Training Tasks to Improve Targeting Team Proficiency on the Staff Group Task: “Execute Targeting Process” 5-121. The BCT commander knows that the organization needs to link training proficiency assessments and the training plans of other BCT battalions and separate companies with staff assessment and training. 5-47 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ The BCT commander recognizes that improving staff R&S and targeting team proficiency on the tasks “Develop an R&S Plan” and “Execute Targeting Process” depends on the FA battalion, MI company, and signal company proficiency. Each unit has a critical role to play in improving proficiency on one or more of the BCT staff tasks previously rated as “P”. 5-122. FA Battalion. The BCT commander and the ECOORD recognize that proficiency on the task “Develop an R&S Plan” is a necessary prerequisite to achieving proficiency in “Execute the Targeting Process.” The BCT staff must identify and track potential threat targets. The ECC is responsible for integrating the FA battalion’s organic target acquisition (TA) platoon into the BCT R&S plan. 5-123. The ECC at the main CP is responsible for integrating fires and effects into the BCT commander’s plan. The ECC is organized into four inter-dependent elements. They are— Fires and Effects Element Targeting and Counter-Fire Element Information Operations Element Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) 5-124. The targeting and counter-fire element has the requirement to achieve and maintain proficiency on the critical ECC task “Execute the Targeting Process.” Proficiency in this task allows the targeting and counter-fire element to translate ECC planning and coordination into actual execution of continuous and synchronized fires and effects in support of BCT operations. 5-125. The ECOORD provides the assessment of the ECC and TA platoon to the BCT commander. The ECOORD bases the assessment on feedback and input from the DECOORD, ALO, and other ECC element chiefs’ personal observations, records, and reports— “P” for “Coordinate Fire Support.” “P” for “Develop Attack/Effects Guidance Matrix, Target Selection Standards, and Tasks/Effects Synchronization Matrix.” “P” for “Execute Targeting Process.” “P” for “Manage Counter-Fire.” “P” for “Integrate PSYOP and CA Effects.” “P” for “Conduct CAS Planning and Coordination.” “P” for “Conduct A2C2 Planning and Coordination.” “P” for “Conduct AFATDS Operations.” 5-126. Figure 5-32 summarizes the ECOORD’s assessment of ECC, FA battalion TOC and FDC, and TA platoon training tasks to improve the BCT targeting team’s proficiency on the task “Execute Targeting Process.” 5-48 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution Figure 5-32. Selected Training Tasks to Improve BCT Targeting Team Proficiency on Staff Task: “Execute Targeting Process” 5-127. MI Company. The MI company supports the BCT intelligence staff. The MI company uses the requirements management (RM) process to develop R&S plans. The R&S plan integrates and synchronizes the BCT’s organic and supporting intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, supports the BCT commander’s CCIR, and helps gain and maintain situational understanding. The MI company commander assesses the unit’s proficiency on the METL task “Provide Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Support” as a “P”. The BCT MI company commander bases the assessment on bottom-up feedback and input received from the integration and analysis platoon leaders. 5-128. The integration platoon leader evaluates all the critical tasks and identifies these tasks as shortcomings: “P” for “Conduct Collection Management (CM).” “P” for “Produce an ISR Plan.” 5-129. The integration platoon leader evaluates all the critical tasks and identifies these tasks as shortcomings : “P” for “Conduct Intelligence Production & Dissemination.” “P” for “Conduct IPB.” “P” for “Perform Requirements Management (RM).” “P” for “Perform Target Development.” “P” for “Conduct ASAS-RWS Operations.” 5-130. Figure 5-33 summarizes the BCT MI company commander’s assessment. 5-49 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 5-33. Selected Intelligence Cell and BCT MI Company Training Tasks to Improve BCT Staff Proficiency for “Develop an R&S Plan” 5-131. Brigade Signal Company. The BCT’s signal company establishes, installs, operates, maintains, and troubleshoots (IOMT) communications and computer systems and networks organized to help the BCT commander exercise effective C2 during planning, preparation, and execution of BCT operations. The BSC provides continuous links to any and all near-real time ISR assets in order to build and maintain an accurate and timely shared COP. The brigade signal company (BSC) commander evaluates the unit’s overall proficiency on the METL task “Provide Signal Support to BCT Operations” as “P”. The BSC commander bases the assessment on bottom-up feedback and input received from the network operations (NETOPS) section leader, nodal platoon leaders, and signal support platoon leader. The platoon leaders evaluate all the critical tasks and identify these tasks as shortcomings : “P” for “Maintain & Troubleshoot a Tactical Operations Center (TOC) Local Area Network (LAN).” “P” for “Install/Operate/Maintain/Troubleshoot (IOMT) the Global Broadcast Service/Battlefield Awareness and Data Dissemination (GBS/BADD) System.” “P” for “Operate/Maintain/Troubleshoot (OMT) FBCB2, EPLRS and SINCGARS.” “P” for “Establish/Operate/Maintain (EOM) Tactical Satellite (TACSAT) Terminal AN/TSC-154.” “P” for “Establish/Maintain/Troubleshoot (EMT) Battlefield Video Teleconference (BVTC) Network.” 5-132. Figure 5-34 highlights training tasks the BCT commander selects to improve the BCT’s METL proficiency for METL tasks “Conduct an 5-50 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution Attack” and staff tasks “Develop an R&S Plan” and “Execute Targeting Process.” The BCT commander selected these tasks based on bottom-up feedback and input received from the XO, coordinating, special and personal staff officers, the brigade MI company, the BSC, and other key NCOs. Figure 5-34. Selected Training Tasks to Improve BCT METL Proficiency for METL Task: “Conduct an Attack” 5-133. The BCT commander along with the XO, coordinating, special and personal staff, and separate company commanders, develops a staff training strategy that meets two goals— Supports the 52nd IN division commander’s training strategy. Trains the BCT staff on “Planning Operations Using the MDMP,” “Develop an R&S Plan,” and “Execute the Targeting Process” tasks. 5-134. Figure 5-35 illustrates the BCT commander’s strategy to improve the staff’s training proficiency for the BCT METL task “Conduct an Attack” (chapter 4). 5-51 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 5-35. 1st BCT Commander’s Training Strategy Plan the Training / Issue the Training Plan 5-135. The BCT commander bases the near-term training plan on the 52nd IN Division Commander’s 2nd quarter training guidance and calendar. Major events of the 52nd IN Division and 1st BCT 2nd quarter training plan are highlighted in figure 5-36. 5-52 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution Figure 5-36. 52nd IN Division and 1st BCT 2nd Quarter Training (Major Events) 5-136. The BCT commander reviews the division’s and brigade’s major training events for the 2nd quarter with the XO, coordinating, special, and personal staff, and separate BCT company commanders. The BCT commander wants to focus staff training on command-oriented and staff control-oriented processes and procedures during staff section, staff group, full staff and multiechelon staff training opportunities in the upcoming quarter. They decide to design the BCT staff training plan around a cyclical sequence of main CP/cell element/staff section, staff group, full staff, and multiechelon staff training exercises. 5-137. Figure 5-37 highlights a cyclical sequence of BCT staff training events designed to prepare the main CP for the shaping operations LFX. 5-53 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 5-37. 1st BCT Main CP Staff Near-Term Training Plan (Jan-Mar XX) 5-138. CP cell, cell element, and staff section training focuses on achieving and sustaining— Individual staff officer and NCO proficiency. Staff officers and NCOs routinely conduct a review of the unit’s tactical standard operating procedures (TSOP). The purpose of their review is to ensure that the TSOP reflects current Army doctrine and incorporates the Army’s most current TTPs. Individual ABCS/FBCB2 systems operator proficiency. 5-139. ABCS/FBCB2 systems are critical assets that help staff officers find relevant and accurate information and present that information to the commander in a timely and understandable manner. ABCS/FBCB2 systems operator training must go beyond system(s) setup, operation, and PMCS. The staff officer and NCO must ensure that the operator understands the particular process or processes their ABCS/FBCB2 system supports. Operator training on pre-formatting messages and message management (CP information flow) is essential. 5-140. Figure 5-38 lists specific ABCS/FBCB2 systems operator training tasks necessary for the BCT main CP to plan, prepare, execute, and assess shaping operations. Additionally, this figure highlights selected BSC training tasks that support establishing, installing, operating, maintaining and troubleshooting communications and computer systems and networks. These are the systems and networks that the BCT relies on for connectivity to any and all near-real time ISR assets in order to build and maintain an accurate and timely shared COP. 5-54 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution Figure 5-38. 1st BCT Main Command Post ATCCS/FBCB2 Systems Training to Support R&S and Targeting Teams’ Preparation for Shaping Operations Exercise 5-141. CP cell, cell element, and staff section task proficiency is critical for automated systems. These are tasks that only a specific CP cell, a specific element within a CP cell, or a specific staff section performs. These tasks can and often do support other CP cell tasks or even entire CP tasks. “Conduct A2C2 Planning and Coordination” is an example of such a task. The air defense and airspace management (ADAM) cell has primary responsibility for performing this task. However, this ADAM cell-specific task affects R&S planning and execution, employment of UAVs, Army aviation, and CAS, to name a few. 5-142. Figure 5-39 lists specific main CP cell, cell element, and staff section training tasks that improve proficiency on identified BCT staff shortcomings. 5-55 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 5-39. 1st BCT Main Command Post CP Cell, Cell Element, and Staff Section Training Tasks 5-143. Staff group training focuses on achieving staff group critical task proficiency. A critical staff group task requires interaction between two or more CP cells, cell elements, or staff sections, and integrates critical tasks from each involved CP cell, cell element, and staff section to achieve group task proficiency. An example of a critical staff group task is “Develop an R&S Plan.” The core of the R&S team is composed of representatives from the S2, S3, and ECC. The S2 has the lead in developing R&S plans. Effective R&S plans accurately answer the commander’s critical information requirements (CCIR) in a timely manner. The S3 has the following four key responsibilities: Keep the R&S team updated on the current situation through the COP. Keep the R&S team updated on future operations planning. Translate the R&S plan into unit R&S-specific missions. Monitor execution of the plan and recommend and coordinate changes to the R&S plan during execution. 5-144. The ECC is responsible for integrating FA and selected USAF assets into the BCT R&S plan. For example, the ECC integrates the DS FA battalion’s TA platoon and—with the BCT ALO—the battalion TACPs into the R&S plan. These are just selected examples. All CP cells, cell elements, and staff sections give input to, and coordinate with, the S2 during the development and execution of the R&S plan. 5-145. Figure 5-40 lists specific training tasks for selected main CP cells, cell elements, and staff sections that support training the R&S team on the task “Develop an R&S Plan.” This figure also illustrates the linkage of selected BCT organic ISR unit training tasks that support the main CP R&S team. 5-56 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution Figure 5-40. Staff Group Training—R&S Team Task: “Develop an R&S Plan” 5-146. The ECC is also responsible for executing the targeting process. CP cells, cell elements, and staff sections provide input to and coordinate with the ECC targeting and C/F element during execution of the targeting process. 5-147. Figure 5-41 lists specific training tasks for selected main CP cells, cell elements, and staff sections that support targeting team training on the task “Execute the Targeting Process.” This figure also illustrates the linkage of selected BCT organic ISR unit training tasks that support the main CP targeting team. 5-57 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 5-41. Staff Group Training—Targeting Team Task: “Execute Targeting Process” 5-148. Full staff training focuses on achieving full staff critical task proficiency. Full staff training involves intra-CP cell coordination and inter-CP coordination. A critical full staff task integrates at least one CP cell, cell element, and staff section task to achieve full staff task proficiency. “Plan Operations Using the MDMP” is an example of a full staff critical task. 5-149.Multiechelon training trains more than one echelon on different tasks simultaneously. Multiechelon staff training focuses on achieving and sustaining proficiency among higher, subordinate and adjacent unit CPs and staffs. This training involves inter-CP functional coordination among two or more command echelons. Multiechelon staff training also includes full staff, staff group, CP cell, cell element, and staff section training. 5-150.Figure 5-42 highlights one of the multiechelon training events depicted in the 1st BCT main CP staff near-term training plan (figure 5-31). This particular event is designed to train— BCT main CP R&S team on “Develop an R&S Plan.” BCT main CP targeting team on “Execute Targeting Process.” Main CP ABCS and FBCB2 systems operators. BSC on IOMT ABCS and FBCB2 systems and other supporting communications systems. BCT MI company on tasks related to R&S planning and targeting. R&S planning and targeting.

Multiechelon Training Event in the 1st BCT Main CP Staff Near-Term Training Plan Train the Trainers, Evaluators, and Observer/Controllers / Recon the Site 5-151. The 1st BCT is providing OCs and other evaluators for the 2nd BCT’s EXEVAL. The CG, 52nd IN Division gave specific guidance to the division staff and the 1st BCT commander concerning preparation for this event. Specific actions directed by the CG include— “The division staff will develop the EXEVAL scenarios, operate as the EXEVAL controlling headquarters, and issue the exercise directive.” “1st BCT will provide OC and evaluator support for this EXEVAL. 1st BCT will validate the EXEVAL scenario. At a minimum, OCs, evaluators and OPFOR need to conduct MDMP staff drills, reconnaissance, and TEWTs based on exercise orders the 2nd BCT will plan, prepare, and execute during the actual EXEVAL. These actions are key to ensure that the right evaluator and OC is at the right location and time to observe and evaluate critical planning, preparation, and execution tasks during the exercise.” 5-59 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ “2nd BCT and 1st BCT staffs will focus on the tasks ’Develop an R&S Plan’ and 'Execute the Targeting Process’.” “Use the shaping operations exercises to ensure that the TSOP are current and compatible with the joint TTPs outlined in selected joint publications.” 5-152. The BCT commander identifies the CFX as a rehearsal for BCT leaders who will serve as OCs and evaluate 2nd BCT units and staffs. The 1st BCT commander, along with the staff and subordinate battalion and separate company commanders, will conduct a series of TEWTs and JANUS staff exercises prior to the CFX. The BCT commander will work MDMP drills based on the 2nd BCT EXEVAL scenario and supporting division orders with the staff to develop BCT plans and orders. The BCT will then conduct TEWTs to confirm or adjust those plans and orders. Finally, the BCT will execute some of the plans in JANUS exercises prior to the CFX and shaping operations exercises. 5-153. Figure 5-43 highlights the trainer, evaluator, and the OC preparation rehearsal for the 1st BCT CFX and shaping operations exercises. Figure 5-43. 1st BCT Staff Trainer, Evaluator/OC Training (2nd BCT EXEVAL) Train the OPFOR 5-154. OPFOR training and rehearsals are necessary in order to replicate desired threat conditions. TF 4-77 IN, the designated OPFOR for the 2nd BCT EXEVAL, will use the 1st BCT CFX as a dress rehearsal.

In this case, the BCT pre-execution checks focused on requirements to run the BCT and battalion level JANUS simulations and OPFOR defensive preparations for the CFX. Figure 5-45 highlights some of the more important CPX, CFX, and shaping operations exercises site preparation and pre-execution checks. 5-61 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 5-45. Site Preparation and Pre-Execution Checks for 1st BCT Shaping Operations Exercise SECTION III: CONDUCT OF TRAINING 5-156. Conduct of training involves actions taken to execute the unit’s training strategy outlined in the commander’s QTG. Conduct of training begins with the execution of pre-combat checks and inspections. Conduct of training ends when designated training objectives for the particular training event or exercise are performed to the Army standard. Unit commanders and other trainers review results of the conduct of training during weekly training meetings and adjust training plans if necessary. Figure 5-46 illustrates the core conduct of training tasks. 5-62 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution Figure 5-46. Training Execution (Conduct of Training) CONDUCT PRE-COMBAT CHECKS 5-157. Pre-combat checks are detailed final checks that units conduct immediately before and during the execution of training and operations. These checks are usually included in unit SOPs. They are normally conducted as part of troop leading procedures and can be as simple or as complex as the training or operation dictates. Pre-combat checks start in garrison and many are completed in the assembly area or in the training location; for example, applying camouflage, setting radio frequencies and distributing ammunition. Commanders must allocate sufficient time for subordinate leaders to execute pre-combat checks and inspections to standard. Examples of pre-combat checks are shown in figure 5-47. 5-63 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ ♦ OPORD briefed. Leaders and soldiers know what is expected of them. ♦ Safety checks and briefings completed. ♦ All required TADSS are on hand and operational; for example, MILES equipment zeroed. ♦ Before-operations PMCS completed on vehicles, weapons, communications, and NBC equipment. ♦ Leaders and equipment inspected; for example, compasses, maps, strip maps, and binoculars. ♦ Soldiers and equipment inspected and camouflaged; for example, weapons, ID cards, driver’s licenses. ♦ Soldier packing lists checked and enforced. ♦ Medical support present and prepared ♦ Communications checks completed. ♦ Ammunition (Class V) drawn, accounted for, prepared, and issued. ♦ Vehicle load plans checked and confirmed; cargo secured. ♦ Rations (Class I) drawn and issued. ♦ Quartering party briefed and dispatched. ♦ OPFOR personnel deployed and ready to execute their OPORD. Figure 5-47. Sample Pre-Combat Checks EXECUTE TRAINING 5-158. Performance-oriented, standards-based training is the result of detailed planning and preparation. The proper execution of training to standard is a rewarding process. It places a significant burden on the trainer in terms of preparation and evaluation of performance. The payoff for properly executed training is a unit trained to standard on its wartime operational mission. Division and brigade commanders and their staffs, must be actively involved in the execution of battalion and company training. A unit executes training the same way it executes a combat mission. The chain of command is present, in charge, and responsible. 5-159. Using the principles of training discussed in chapter 2, commanders ensure that properly executed training is well-structured, realistic, safe, and effective. Other important considerations include the following: Focus on the fundamentals. Units must be proficient on basic tasks before progressing to the more complex tasks. All basic tasks provide the foundation on which to build performance of individual soldier tasks, drills, and METL tasks to standard. C2, logistics operations, and NBC must be incorporated into all training. Night and adverse weather training. Night training and adverse weather training are keys to success in combat. All units in the U.S. Army, not just combat units, must be proficient in operating at night and during adverse weather conditions. Routine training under these conditions gives units a distinct advantage in combat operations. 5-64 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution Tough, realistic training. Training must be structured to expose soldiers and leaders to unexpected situations, both favorable and unfavorable. Tasks must be executed confidently and completely during the fog of battle. Tough, realistic training challenges leaders and soldiers to overcome the hardships and uncertainties of combat. Leaders must teach soldiers that combat cannot be reduced to a set of calculations or checklists. Challenging training inspires excellence by fostering initiative, enthusiasm, confidence, and the ability to apply learned tasks in the dynamic environment of combat. Competition. Effective training can be competitive. Although soldiers, leaders, and units may sometimes compete with one another, they should always compete to achieve the Army standard. Once units can perform a task to the Army standard, leaders progressively increase the difficulty or conditions under which the task is executed. During competition, leaders should recognize soldiers or units exceeding established standards. Competition can be used to stimulate soldier interest and morale, select participants for higher level competitions, encourage higher levels of performance, and provide an event for a rigorous training period. CONDUCT AFTER ACTION REVIEWS 5-160. A significant part of learning occurs as a result of after action reviews (AARs), which ensure that the training audience understands when they have not performed to standard and how they must perform to do so. Accordingly, whenever possible, AARs are conducted immediately following performance during training sessions. AARs are covered in detail in chapter 6 and appendix C of this manual. They are also discussed in detail in TC 25-20. RETRAINING 5-161. Retraining must be conducted at the first available opportunity. Commanders must program time and other resources for retraining as an integral part of their long-, short-, and near-term training planning cycle. Training is incomplete until the task is trained to standard. The critical question for commanders and trainers is, “When do you conduct retraining?” In short— Retraining is conducted as soon as possible after the AAR. Commanders determine when retraining will be conducted based on current training plans and available resources. Commanders program time and other resources for retraining 5-162. Figure 5-48 provides examples that illustrate the relationship among three variables—scope of training, training event, and retraining method—commanders and trainers consider when deciding when to conduct retraining. 5-65 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 5-48. Retraining SECTION IV: RECOVERY FROM TRAINING 5-163. The recovery process is an extension of training and once completed, signifies the end of the training event. While recovery tasks vary depending on the type and intensity of training, most include maintenance training, turn-in of training support items, inspection of equipment, and the conduct of AARs that review the overall effectiveness of the training just completed. Figure 5-49 illustrates the core recovery from training tasks process. 5-66 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution Figure 5-49. Training Execution (Recovery from Training) 5-164. The following is a sample list of recovery activities: Perform post-operations preventative maintenance checks and services. Ensure sensitive item accountability. Ensure accountability of organizational and individual equipment. Ensure that Class IV, V, TADSS, and other support items are maintained, accounted for, and turned in. Close out training areas and ranges. Conduct AARs of the training event and exercise just completed. Allow time for the individual soldier to recover personal equipment and conduct personal hygiene. Conduct final inspections. CONDUCT AFTER ACTION REVIEWS DURING RECOVERY 5-165. AARs conducted during recovery focus on collective, leader, and individual task performance, and on the planning, preparation, and conduct of the training just completed. Unit AARs focus on individual and collective task performance, and identify shortcomings and the training required to correct deficiencies. AARs with leaders focus on tactical judgment. These AARs contribute to leader learning and provide opportunities for leader development. AARs with trainers, evaluators, OCs, and OPFOR provide additional opportunities for leader development. 5-166. Figure 5-50 provides a guide to help the unit commander, key officer, and NCO leaders make an assessment of the overall training proficiency of the organization and determine the overall effectiveness of the training strategy. The essential questions are, “Did the training 5-67 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ strategy improve the unit’s METL proficiency, and if not, why not? What changes need to be incorporated in the company’s training strategy?” ♦ Did the unit’s performance during this training exercise/event improve training proficiency on selected training tasks and objectives? ♦ Did the unit’s training strategy— o Select the right type of events and exercises? o Select the right mix of live and virtual simulators? o Select the right “who,” “what,” “when,” and “where”? ♦ Did the unit’s preparation for training— o Select the right leader and unit training tasks? o Select and sequence the right leader and unit training events and exercises? o Adequately prepare trainers, evaluators, and OCs? o Adequately prepare the designated OPFOR? o Require changes to the unit’s pre-execution checks? Figure 5-50. Overall Training Effectiveness AAR 5-167. The AARs conducted during recovery, along with the AARs that took place during the conduct of training, enhance future training. They provide the feedback that contributes to the development of training plans to correct identified deficiencies. Finally, these AARs contribute to the commander’s overall evaluation of training effectiveness and unit assessment. However, AARs are not in themselves the end state of recovery. Recovery from training is complete when the unit is again prepared to conduct its assigned mission. SUMMARY 5-168. Training execution includes preparation for training, conduct of training, and recovery from training (figure 5-51). Pre-execution checks are developed by the chain of command and provide the attention to detail needed to use resources efficiently. Completion of recovery from training is not the end of training. The assessment of training proficiency is critical to determining the effectiveness of the preparation and conduct of training just completed. 5-68 ________________________________________________________________________ Execution Figure 5-51.

The AAR is a powerful tool that makes the U.S. Army unique with respect to all other armies. It provides the means to attain and sustain the Army’s readiness and to ensure that deficiencies in performance are corrected. Effective, mission-focused, standards-based feedback to unit leadership through the AAR process should parallel the performance- oriented counseling and mentoring process commanders owe their subordinates as a cornerstone of the Army’s commitment to leader development. 6-2. All commanders have an obligation to teach subordinate leaders how to conduct an effective AAR and how to create an effective mentoring environment in their units. The benefits of effective counseling and mentoring programs are manifested in a variety of ways. Not only are 6-1 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ they critical for both personal and professional development, but they are essential to building unit cohesion and esprit-de-corps. They also provide a great forum for teaching leaders what “right” looks like, to see beyond the “scores” in marksmanship and gunnery, and to understand the underlying principles of training and warfighting. 6-3. This chapter uses the following key terms: assessment, organizational assessment, training assessment, training evaluation, and certification. These terms are closely related but not interchangeable. The following definitions provide the meaning and proper context in which these terms are used: Assessment. Assessment is the commander’s responsibility. It is the commander’s judgment of the organization’s ability to accomplish its wartime operational mission. Organizational Assessment. Organizational assessment is a process used by Army senior leaders to analyze and correlate evaluations of various functional systems, such as training, logistics, personnel, and force integration, to determine an organization’s capability to accomplish its wartime mission. It is applicable to battalion and above and is based on an aggregate of multiple evaluations. Training Assessment. Training assessment is the commander’s and leader’s responsibility. It is a process used to analyze training evaluations and other sources of feedback to determine the current level of training proficiency on mission essential tasks. Training Evaluation. Training evaluation is the process used to measure the demonstrated ability of individuals and units to accomplish specified training objectives. Commanders and leaders at every level conduct evaluations to determine progress toward, or achievement of, the Army training standard. Certification. Certification is a measure of individual technical proficiency. It may also be used to confirm a unit’s collective training proficiency to perform a specific mission or task. Certification requirements are normally specified in Army or MACOM regulations. ASSESSMENT 6-4. Assessment is the commander’s responsibility. It is the commander’s judgment of the organization’s ability to accomplish its wartime operational mission. Assessment is a continual process that includes evaluating training, conducting an organizational assessment, and preparing a training assessment. The commander uses experience, feedback from training evaluations and other evaluations and reports, and personal observation to arrive at the assessment. Assessment is essential at both the beginning and the end of the training management cycle. ORGANIZATIONAL ASSESSMENT 6-5. Battalion and higher-level commanders perform organizational assessments that aggregate a large number of evaluations. They include such diverse systems as training, force integration, logistics, and personnel. 6-2 ______________________________________________________________________ Assessment 6-6. Commanders establish a command assessment program that— Fixes responsibility within the staff and subordinate units for gathering and analyzing evaluation data and preparing recommendations. Concentrates on the effectiveness of leader and organizational training. Utilizes the CSM and other senior NCOs to gather feedback on individual, crew, and small team training. Allows the higher commander to monitor outcomes and take action to reshape priorities, policies, or plans to overcome assessed weaknesses and sustain demonstrated strengths. 6-7. CTC take-home packages are an excellent source of feedback to include in an organizational assessment. These packages consist of videotapes and written documentation of AARs, a report of unit strengths and weaknesses as noted by OCs, and recommendations for future home station training. Some important sources of feedback for the senior commander’s assessment of the organization’s ability to accomplish wartime missions are listed in figure 6-1. ♦ Personal observations of training. ♦ Assessment and feedback from higher headquarters. ♦ Staff visit reports. ♦ Unit status reports. ♦ Training briefings. ♦ Training evaluations. ♦ EXEVALs. ♦ CTC take-home packages. ♦ AARs from FTXs, gunnery periods, or other major training exercises. ♦ AT reports. ♦ CTT results (component of ITEP). ♦ UCOFT/MCOFT results. ♦ AAR-generated reports from training activities, to include those from virtual training activities. ♦ Emergency deployment readiness exercise (EDRE) reports. ♦ Maintenance and logistical evaluations and technical inspection results. ♦ Inspector General (IG) general and special inspections. ♦ Commander's Organizational Inspection Program. ♦ Force integration reports and feedback. ♦ Army Audit Agency reports. ♦ APFT scores. ♦ Weapons qualification records. ♦ Division (training support) assistance input. Figure 6-1. Sources of Evaluation Data for Organizational Assessments 6-3 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ TRAINING ASSESSMENT 6-8. To identify training needs, the commander assesses the ability of the unit to perform METL tasks prior to planning training—whether for long-range plans, short-range plans, or near-term training schedules. In assessing whether the unit can perform a METL task to Army standard, the commander considers all sources of information, such as recent evaluations of performance during training, personal observations of training, and assessments of supporting battle tasks by subordinates. Commanders cannot personally observe all training in their organizations; therefore, they gather feedback from their subordinate commanders, senior staff officers, and NCOs. Based on all available information, the commander rates each METL task as either “T”, “P”, or “U”. TRAINING EVALUATION 6-9. The unit commander is responsible for assessing the readiness of the unit to execute its wartime mission. A critical component of this assessment is evaluation of training. The evaluation process is continuous, and must be planned for all training and considered as a way of life in the unit. Training evaluation is integral to standards-based training and is conducted by leaders at every level. 6-10. The analysis of the information is the key mechanism that commanders use in their assessment. Commanders can use evaluations to synchronize all unit functions. To evaluate training proficiency, commanders— Select the type of evaluation. Develop an evaluation plan. Conduct evaluation of training. Conduct AARs. Provide feedback up and down the chain of command. 6-11. All training is evaluated to measure performance against the Army standard. The evaluation can be as fundamental as an informal, internal evaluation performed by the leader conducting the training, or the evaluation may be a very complex EXEVAL. In either case, evaluation is conducted specifically to enable the unit or individual undergoing the training to know whether the training standard has been achieved. Commanders establish a climate that encourages candid and accurate feedback for the purpose of developing leaders and trained units. 6-12. Evaluation of training is not a test; it is not used to find reasons to punish leaders and soldiers. Evaluation tells the unit or the soldier whether or not they achieved the Army standard, and therefore assists them in determining the overall effectiveness of their training plans or execution of training. Evaluation produces disciplined soldiers, leaders, and units. Training without evaluation is a waste of time and resources. 6-13. Each training event is evaluated during training execution. Planning for training must include resources (such as leader time, preparation, evaluators, and equipment) to facilitate evaluation. Leaders use evaluations as an opportunity to coach and mentor subordinates. A key element in developing leaders is immediate, positive feedback that coaches and leads subordinate leaders to achieve the Army standard. This is a tested and proven path to develop competent, confident, adaptive leaders. 6-4 ______________________________________________________________________ Assessment 6-14. As discussed in chapter 4, evaluation ratings are assigned by evaluators and should not be confused with leader assessment ratings. Evaluation ratings are ratings assigned directly to demonstrated task proficiency. Using T&EOs, evaluators observe the designated training tasks and grade the performance “GO” or “NO GO,” as defined below— “GO:” The task or performance step of a task was performed to standard. A rating of GO is normally awarded if all steps in the task are passed. “NO GO:” The task or any performance step in the task was not performed to standard. 6-15. The completed T&EOs, with appropriate written comments, formal and informal AAR comments, coaching, and mentoring provide the participating leaders and soldiers with both immediate and documented feedback on demonstrated performance. Commanders later use the evaluator ratings as one source of input when making their training assessment ratings of T, P, or U for each METL task. 6-16. Evaluations are used to— Provide feedback on training proficiency, both strengths and weaknesses, to those participating in the training event. Determine METL task proficiency. Develop lessons learned for distribution throughout the command and the Army, when applicable. Shape future training plans. Coach and mentor subordinates Enhance leader development. TYPES OF EVALUATIONS 6-17. Evaluations may be informal, formal, internal, external, or any combination of these. 6-18. Informal evaluations take place whenever a leader conducts training with the unit; for example, when a squad leader trains the squad to assault an objective. Another example is when a leader visits ongoing training, such as when a battalion commander observes company training. This type of evaluation provides real time feedback on the training environment and the proficiency resulting from training. Informal evaluations are most commonly used at battalion level and below. They are— Conducted by all leaders in the chain of command. Continuous and ongoing. 6-19. Formal evaluations are resourced with dedicated evaluators or OCs, and are generally scheduled in the long-range or short-range calendars. Formal evaluations are normally highlighted during short- range training briefings. To the maximum extent possible, headquarters two levels higher conduct formal external evaluations. For example, division commanders evaluate battalions, brigade commanders evaluate companies, battalion commanders evaluate platoons, and company commanders evaluate squads. Other examples of formal evaluations include EIB and EFMB. 6-20. Internal evaluations are planned, resourced, and conducted by the unit undergoing the evaluation. 6-5 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ 6-21. External evaluations are planned, resourced, and conducted by a headquarters at an echelon higher in the chain of command than the organization undergoing the evaluation or a headquarters outside the chain of command. 6-22. The four types of evaluations can be combined to meet the particular needs of the units or soldiers being evaluated. Figure 6-2 shows the application of each combination. Regardless of the type of evaluation, leaders must be present at all training to supervise and evaluate the training personally. Informal Internal External ♦ Is a function of unit leadership ♦ Is conducted by leaders during whenever training is conducted. visits to training of subordinate For example, squad leader checks units. For example, CSM spot- vehicle PMCS. checks soldiers’ range cards. Formal Internal External ♦ An evaluation of squad and below ♦ An evaluation of battalion / proficiency. For example, squad company / platoon proficiency. For leaders evaluate the squad example, battalion evaluates individual and collective tasks. platoon ARTEP training events. Figure 6-2. Uses of Types of Evaluations 6-23. Evaluation of individual and small-unit training normally includes every soldier and leader involved in the training. For large-scale training events, evaluators sample a number of individuals and subordinate organizations to determine the likelihood of the entire organization to perform specific mission essential tasks to standard. 6-24. During and after formal evaluation, evaluators prepare their findings and recommendations. Evaluators provide these reports to the evaluated unit commander and higher commanders as required by the headquarters directing the evaluation. Evaluation documentation can range from an annotated T&EO for an internal training evaluation to a comprehensive report on RC units during AT periods. PLANNING FOR EVALUATIONS 6-25. The evaluation of collective training is critical to assessing a unit’s capability to perform its METL tasks. For evaluation to be effective, it must be thoroughly planned and rigorously executed. Leaders must plan and prepare to ensure an accurate evaluation. For formal evaluations, commanders must ensure that the evaluators are trained and prepared to assume those duties. For informal evaluations, commanders must ensure that training plans prepare subordinate leaders to conduct the evaluation of their own units. 6-26. RC commanders may request assistance from their state adjutant general, regional readiness command, or affiliated unit to assist in planning, preparing, and evaluating training. However, the RC chain of command remains responsible for the evaluation. 6-6 ______________________________________________________________________ Assessment 6-27. The following information is required to facilitate long-range evaluation planning: Type of exercise (battalion FTX, company FTX, company STX, TEWT). Date(s) of exercise. Type of evaluation (formal, informal, internal, external, or a combination). Support requirements (internal and external). Coordination for EXEVAL support. 6-28. To enhance effective short-range planning, the commander and key leaders develop and provide the following information: Commander’s intent and focus for the exercise. Pre-execution checklist. Level of evaluation; for example, down to platoon level. Dates for training the evaluators. Plan for conduct of evaluator training. ARTEP-MTP or T&EOs. 6-29. The commander and key leaders also provide a completed evaluation and control plan. The plan contains information drawn from the sources shown in figure 6-3. ♦ Intent of the exercise and the evaluation. ♦ Evaluation procedures. ♦ Exercise scenario. ♦ Training objectives. ♦ Resource guidance. ♦ Required coordination. ♦ Discussion of evaluator’s role in safety. ♦ Rules of engagement. ♦ Exercise operating procedures (ExOP). ♦ Reference—SMs, FMs, MTPs, and SOPs. ♦ Evaluation checklists and T&EOs. ♦ Guidance on conduct of AARs. Figure 6-3. Contents of Evaluation and Control Plan 6-30. Evaluation planners use an evaluator worksheet, such as the example shown in figure 6-4. This worksheet aids in developing the best evaluator organization. 6-7 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Type of Exercise: FTX Duration of the Exercise: 2 days Frequency of Exercise: 2 platoons per day (4 platoons, 1 per company) Level of Evaluation: Platoon and below. Tasks Selected for Evaluation: (See evaluation matrix, table 6-1) Types of Evaluation: (See evaluation matrix, table 6-1) Availability of Evaluator Personnel with Appropriate Skills: • Platoon level—2 CPT staff officers. • Squad/crew level—2 platoon sergeants and/or staff NCOs. • Soldier Level—All of the above. Suggested Organization Based on the Above Information: • Chief Evaluator(s)—Battalion commander/CSM. • Platoon Evaluators—1 officer/senior NCO evaluator per platoon. • Squad Evaluators—1 NCO evaluator per squad. Notes: 1. Each platoon has two evaluators at all times. 2. Evaluations are conducted during the TF 1-77 FTX. 2. AARs are conducted at the conclusion of each event. 3. The chemical officer or NCO evaluates during cross-contaminated area task. Figure 6-4. Sample Evaluator Group Organization Worksheet 6-31. Refinement of the evaluation plan continues up to and during execution. This accommodates changes made to the events, the evaluation plan, and the resource allocations. The task evaluation matrix in table 6-1 is used to help plan the evaluation. OCs are not able to observe all training, so selected elements from the training unit are designated for evaluation. For a defend task, evaluators provide a formal evaluation of an entire platoon. This consists of overall formal evaluations for two squads with specific focus on one fire team within each squad. In this manner, a limited number of evaluators can develop a good snapshot of the platoon’s overall proficiency. 6-8 ______________________________________________________________________ Assessment Table 6-1.

Evaluators—whether a unit leader conducting an internal, informal evaluation or an external evaluator conducting a formal evaluation— must be properly trained and qualified to enhance the training experience for the evaluated unit by providing valid, credible observations. Evaluators should be equal or senior in rank to the leader being evaluated. Ideally, evaluators should have held the position themselves because it lends credibility to their role. Evaluators must also be trained as facilitators to plan, prepare, and conduct AARs that elicit maximum participation from those being trained. 6-33. External evaluators must be certified in the tasks they are evaluating and normally are not dual-hatted as a participant in the training being executed. Leaders, soldiers, and units learn from the evaluator. Evaluators learn by observing the unit. Unit leaders who serve as internal evaluators must also be certified in the tasks they evaluate. Some basic guidelines for the evaluator are listed below— Be trained (tactically and technically proficient) and rehearsed in the tasks to be evaluated. Know the terrain. (Conduct reconnaissance of the training area.) Know the evaluation standards. Follow the tactical and field SOPs for the organization being evaluated. Apply relevant information about the evaluated unit, such as wartime missions, METL, personnel turbulence, leader fill, and equipment status. Identify strengths as well as weaknesses. Patiently observe all actions of a unit. (Do not jump to conclusions.) Always use the chain of command. (Do not take command of the unit.) Coach unit leaders. Assist the commander and leaders in training safely. Be aware of specific safety considerations applicable to the training. Be flexible; base evaluation on the unit’s reaction to the tactical situation, not on personal knowledge of the preplanned scenario. 6-9 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Do what the soldiers do. Experience the same conditions as the evaluated unit. Know the OPFOR training objectives. EVALUATOR TRAINING 6-34. Evaluators must be trained prior to conducting evaluations. Evaluator training is planned and executed during the preparation phase of training execution. Training ensures that the evaluators are technically and tactically competent and understand their responsibilities during evaluations. Evaluator training should include the elements listed in figure 6-5. ♦ Pertinent Army doctrine. ♦ Safety and environment considerations. ♦ Conduct of required evaluator rehearsals. ♦ Purpose and scope of the exercise. ♦ Training objectives. ♦ T&EOs. ♦ Enemy situation (per OPORD). ♦ OPFOR organization. ♦ Participating units’ task organization and METL and how it supports the higher headquarters METL. ♦ Participating unit’s TSOPs. ♦ Communications plan/network architecture. ♦ Rules of engagement (ROE). ♦ Exercise operating procedures (ExOP). ♦ Intelligence plans. ♦ Controller duties. ♦ Reconnaissance. ♦ Communications responsibilities and checks. ♦ Required records and reports. ♦ Casualty and damage assessment. ♦ AARs Figure 6-5. Evaluator Training Topics CERTIFICATION 6-35. Certification is a measure of individual technical proficiency and is normally found in Army or MACOM regulations. Certification is not a normal part of day-to-day training. The decision to require certification is made at a higher headquarters and is the result of a deliberate process. Certification requirements for OCs and individuals to supervise live-fire ranges, driver licensing, etc., are examples of individual technical proficiencies that commanders may require to support training. Certification is more often applied to processes and procedures that support operations and training, such as destruction of classified documents or outdated medicines. Certification can also be validation of professional skills in such fields as law and medicine. 6-36. Commanders may require certification to confirm a unit’s collective training proficiency to perform a specific type of mission or task. 6-10 ______________________________________________________________________ Assessment Certification of an infantry squad that has been tasked to conduct a specific stability or support task is an example of unit collective certification. Higher headquarters on a “by exception” basis normally directs this confirmation requirement. AFTER ACTION REVIEW 6-37. The after action review (AAR) provides feedback for all training. The AAR is a structured review process that allows training participants to discover for themselves what happened, why it happened, and how it can be done better. The AAR is a professional discussion that requires the active participation of those being trained. The AAR is not a critique. It has the following advantages over a critique: Focuses directly on key, METL-derived training objectives. Emphasizes meeting Army standards rather than pronouncing judgment of success or failure (AARs do not determine winners or losers). Uses leading questions to encourage participants to self-discover important lessons from the training event. Allows a large number of soldiers and leaders (including OPFOR) to participate so that more of the training can be recalled, and more lessons learned can be shared. 6-38. The AAR consists of four parts— Review what was supposed to happen (training plan). The evaluator, along with the participants, reviews what was supposed to happen based on the commander’s intent for the training event, unit training plan, training objectives, and applicable T&EOs. Establish what happened. The evaluator and the participants determine what actually happened during performance of the training task. A factual and indisputable account is vital to the effectiveness of the discussion that follows. For force on force training, OPFOR members assist in describing the flow of the training event and discuss training outcomes from their points of view. Determine what was right or wrong with what happened. The participants establish the strong and weak points of their performance. The evaluator plays a critical role in guiding the discussions so that conclusions reached by participants are doctrinally sound, consistent with Army standards, and relevant to the wartime mission. Determine how the task should be done differently next time. The evaluator assists the chain of command undergoing the training to lead the group in determining exactly how participants will perform differently the next time the task is performed. This results in organizational and individual motivation to conduct future sustainment training to standard. 6-39. Leaders understand that not all tasks will be performed to standard and, in their initial planning, allocate time and other resources for retraining. Retraining allows the participants to apply the lessons learned during the AAR and implement corrective action. Retraining should be conducted at the earliest opportunity to translate observation and evaluation into training to standard. Commanders must ensure that 6-11 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ units understand that training is incomplete until the Army standard is achieved. 6-40. The AAR is often “tiered” as a multiechelon leader development technique. Following an AAR with all participants, senior trainers may use the AAR for an extended professional discussion with selected leaders. These discussions usually include a more specific AAR of leader contributions to the observed training results. Commanders use this opportunity to teach, coach, and mentor subordinate leaders to master current skills and to prepare them for future responsibilities. 6-41. During the recovery phase of training execution, a final AAR is conducted. This AAR includes the evaluators or OCs, OPFOR, and unit leaders to review the training just performed and to discuss the overall conduct of the exercise. Training weaknesses or shortcomings identified during AARs are included in future planned training. A detailed discussion and example of an AAR is included in appendix C. LESSONS AND LESSONS LEARNED 6-42. As the Army continues to grow and learn, it is necessary to maintain doctrinal currency and relevancy. Maintaining currency and relevancy means collecting, assessing, sharing, and integrating into training and education the observations, insights, lessons, and TTPs learned during training exercises and operational deployments. 6-43. Commanders and other leaders, while assessing training exercises and operational deployments, or at the conclusion of any AAR, may note issues that should be shared with the rest of the Army. The outputs from an AAR—what worked and what did not work—are lessons learned. In many cases, these lessons may be significant beyond just the unit involved in the training. 6-44. Conducting AARs and integrating TTP and lessons learned from those AARs back into ongoing training and operations are an inherent command responsibility. Important or significant observations, insights, lessons, and TTP should be shared with the rest of the Army by sending them to the Center for Army Lessons Learned (CALL) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. CALL shares this information with the Army through a variety of electronic and paper-based products. 6-45. Although CALL has the lead to gather and disseminate lessons learned, CALL cannot cover every BOS or operational deployment without help from commanders and units. Branch proponents work with in-theater commanders to gather lessons in general, and lessons about BOS in particular. EXAMPLE TRAINING ASSESSMENTS 6-46. To illustrate the concept of training evaluations and assessments, the following examples from the A/1-77 IN FTXs, and portions of the 1st BSB FTX EXEVAL (see chapter 4 and chapter 5) are provided. Evaluations for selected tasks from each exercise are explained and then linked to the commander’s assessment. Although the A company commander is conducting internal/informal evaluations, and the BSB elements are undergoing a formal/external evaluation, the basic process remains the same. 6-12 ______________________________________________________________________ Assessment 1/1/A/1-77 IN EXAMPLE 6-47. The platoon leader back-briefs the platoon sergeant and squad leaders on what was discussed at the company training meeting and guidance given by the company commander. The platoon leader focuses comments on the squad STX and LFX scheduled for the last 2 weeks in February. The platoon leader states that the company commander wants to select squad tasks and drills that will improve the platoon’s proficiency on the task “Conduct an Assault” and the company’s proficiency on the task “Assault an Objective.” The company commander selected two particular squad tasks and drills for informal/internal evaluation during the squad STX and LFX. The company commander selected these particular tasks based on bottom-up feedback provided by squad and platoon leaders. The tasks were “Knock out a Bunker” and “Clear a Trench Line.” The platoon leader gives guidance for the squad leaders to plan and prepare for these two training exercises. 6-48. At the next platoon training meeting, the 1st squad leader provides the platoon leader and platoon sergeant with an updated assessment of the squad’s proficiency on the selected tasks and the training plan to improve the squad’s proficiency. First, the squad leader reminds the platoon leader that the squad had not done these particular tasks since before the unit’s preparation for the KFOR rotation. Next, the squad leader points out the good news—the squad had trained on entering buildings and room clearing-related tasks and drills as part of KFOR preparation. The squad leader further notes that these tasks are similar to but not the same as “Clearing Trench Lines” and “Knock Out Bunkers.” However, many of the leader and individual tasks and skills for urban terrain assaults are the same for these particular squad tasks and drills. Next, the squad leader highlights the personnel turnover in the squad since the company returned from the KFOR rotation in mid- December. The 1st squad has one new team leader, two new M249 SAW gunners, one new anti-armor gunner, and one new M203 gunner. The 1st squad leader’s training plan focuses on two things— Quickly evaluate the new team leader and other new squad members’ proficiency on selected leader and individual tasks. If they are not proficient, get them proficient on those selected leader and individual tasks. Get the squad working as a team on “Clearing Trench Lines” and “Knock Out Bunkers.” 6-49. The platoon leader approves the squad leader’s plan and incorporates it into the platoon’s training schedule. The squad leader then focuses on training the team leaders and soldiers and conducting pre-execution checks. 6-50. The following three annotated T&EOs show the results of the company commander’s internal/informal evaluation of three tasks: “Knock Out a Bunker (Infantry Platoon/Squad)” (Task #07-3- 1113.07-CMTP) “Clear a Trench Line (Infantry Platoon/Squad)” (Task #07-3- 1114.07-CMTP) “Conduct Risk Management (Infantry/Mortar/Reconnaissance Platoon/Squad)” (Task #17-3-6465.07-CMTP) 6-13 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ TASK: Knock Out a Bunker (Infantry Platoon/Squad) (07-3-1113.07-CMTP) (FM 3-22.37) (FM 3-21.9) (FM 3-21.71) (FM 7-8) ITERATION 1 2 3 4 5 M (circle) TRAINING STATUS T P U (circle) CONDITION: The platoon is conducting operations as part of a larger force and has received an operation order (OPORD) or fragmentary order (FRAGO) to knock out a bunker at the location specified.

From the AAR feedback, the BSB commander finds that the unit has improved considerably on the following tasks: “Provide DS Level Combat Service Support.” “Conduct Petroleum Operations.” “Conduct Field Maintenance Operations.” “Provide Ground Ambulance Support.” 6-55. The unit, however, still had challenges responding to a threat to the BSA. The AAR reveals that many soldiers in the battalion need refresher training on basic combat tasks. From the training evaluation results, AARs, and personal observation, the BSB commander assesses the proficiency of the METL tasks “Defend Against Level I and II Threats,” and “Provide DS Level Combat Service Support” as shown in table 6-2. 6-56. Feedback from all AARs, coupled with the evaluation results, and inputs from senior officers and NCOs provide information the BSB commander needs to complete the training assessment and develop a plan for corrective action. After assessing the unit’s level of proficiency on METL tasks, the commander develops a training plan to emphasize the following tasks: “Basic Combat Skills.” “Conduct Petroleum Operations.” “Conduct Field Maintenance Operations.” “Provide Ground Ambulance Support.” “Direct Response to the BSA Threat.” 6-57. This revised training strategy, along with the associated supporting documentation, is shared up and down the chain of command for planning future training. 6-26 ______________________________________________________________________ Assessment Table 6-2.

Commanders ensure that evaluations take place at each level in the organization. They ensure that every training event is evaluated as part of training execution and that every trainer conducts evaluations. Commanders use evaluations to focus command attention by requiring evaluation of specific mission essential tasks. They also take advantage of evaluation information to develop appropriate lessons learned for distribution throughout their commands. 6-27 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ 6-59. The use of evaluation data can have a strong effect on the command climate of the organization. Therefore, commanders make on-the-spot corrections, underwrite honest mistakes, and create an environment for aggressive action to correct training deficiencies through retraining. 6-60. Commanders use training evaluations as one component of a feedback system. To keep the training system dynamic, they use feedback to determine the effectiveness of the planning, execution, and assessment portions of the training management cycle. These feedback systems allow the senior commander to make changes that lead to superior training results, and to teach, coach, and mentor subordinate leaders. To be effective, this feedback flows between higher and subordinate headquarters, within each command echelon, and among a network of trainers that may cross several command lines. Sources of training feedback may include— Training plan assessments. QTB (AC). YTB (RC). Program Budget Advisory Committee (PBAC). Range conferences. Evaluation data. Staff visits. Leader development discussions. Personal observations. CTC take-home packages. 6-61. Commanders perform organizational assessments that aggregate training evaluations and other evaluation feedback to determine training proficiency as measured against the standard specified in the appropriate ARTEP-MTPs or other STPs. 6-62. The commander’s assessment is not the end of training. It is the link that ties the training evaluation to planning future training. The Army Training Management Cycle (figure 6-7) is a continuous process. Battle focus drives METL development, allowing the commander to narrow the scope of the training challenge to make it manageable. Careful planning, based on assessment, allows scarce resources to be used to sustain training strengths and correct weaknesses. Throughout the training management process, feedback is essential. NCOs identify individual soldier and small unit training needs to the commander. Feedback enables the commander and subordinate leaders to focus on executing tough, challenging, realistic training to standard. 6-28 ______________________________________________________________________ Assessment Figure 6-7. Army Training Management Cycle SUMMARY 6-63. The Army Training Management Cycle (described in detail in FM 7-0) and Operations Process (described in detail in FM 3-0) share the same dynamic “plan, prepare, execute, and assess” activities (see figure 6- 8). The training cycle trains soldiers, leaders, and units so that they are prepared to execute the operations process to standard when called. The training cycle produces competent, confident, adaptive soldiers, leaders, and units and enables the commander to assess the organization’s ability to accomplish its wartime mission. The operations process enables soldiers, leaders, and units to execute their assigned operational missions. 6-64. This manual has provided techniques and procedures to plan, execute, and assess training (figure 6-9). The success of training, however, depends on competent and dedicated leaders who are personally involved in ensuring that training is vigorously executed to standard. Through battle focused training, leaders ensure that soldiers and units are combat ready and prepared to execute their wartime mission in defense of our nation. 6-29 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure 6-8.

Confucius 6-30 Appendix A Leader Training and Leader Development in Units Leaders are made by the day-to-day practice and fine tuning of leadership talents, because leading is an art as well as a science and is best developed by application. Leaders are made by the steady acquisition of professional knowledge and by the development of 24-karat character during the course of a career. General John Wickham, Jr. PURPOSE A-1. The purpose of this appendix is to provide integrated leader training and leader development guidance to all Army leaders. It describes the concepts that apply to leader training and leader development, and builds on the training and leader development concepts discussed in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 of FM 7-0 and FM 7-1—specifically, the ten principles of training. For complete coverage of leader training and leader development, see FM 22-100. OVERVIEW A-2. Because it deals directly with soldiers, leadership is the most dynamic element of combat power. Confident, audacious, and competent leadership focuses the other elements of combat power and serves as the catalyst that creates conditions for success. Leaders who embody the warrior ethos inspire soldiers to succeed. They provide purpose, direction, and motivation in all operations. Leadership is key, and the actions of leaders often make the difference between success and failure, particularly in small teams, staffs, and units. A-3. The continuously changing operating environment has major implications for the Army’s leader training and leader development requirements. Full spectrum operations, non-linear and non-contiguous battlefields, asymmetric threats, technological advances in C4ISR and changes in Army organizations demand higher order cognitive skills, including the rapid synthesis of information, intuitive assessments of situations, and rapid conceptualization of friendly courses of action. On the battlefield, leaders are geographically distributed, heightening the need for a shared understanding of the commander’s intent, and teamwork built on trust. Operation orders are intent centric; rehearsals are both physical and virtual; and static CPs give way to battle command on the move. In this type of operational environment, leaders must be able to think critically, define their information requirements clearly, and, most importantly, develop and effectively communicate their intent. Integration within JIIM and with SOF teams are expected requirements that place further demands on leaders at all levels. A-4. Commanders are responsible for training and developing subordinate leaders. This responsibility is important to the collective A-1 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ readiness and warfighting competence of their teams, staffs, and units, as well as to the individual’s long-term development. Army warfighting doctrine recognizes leadership as an essential element of combat power. Commanders cannot leave leader training and leader development to chance. They must deliberately plan, prepare, execute, and assess leader training and leader development, just as they do for collective tactical and technical training and other individual training. A-5. Leader training and leader development occur in the institutional, operational, and self-development domains. Leader training focuses on attaining the competence (knowledge, skills, and abilities) required for a leader’s current duty position and level of responsibility, whereas leader development focuses on attaining the competencies required to perform increased responsibilities in the future. Leader training is just one portion of leader development. Leader training is driven by specific requirements and competency development. A-6. The ultimate goal of the Army’s leader training and leader development programs is to develop leaders who are self-aware, adaptive, competent, and confident. Figure A-1 shows a path for changing the way commanders must think as they train and develop leaders, in order to obtain the desired leaders of the future. Figure A-1. The Goal A-7. Leader training and leader development programs are successful when commanders effectively communicate the purpose and intended outcome to subordinate leaders. A critical component of that communication process is imparting the terms of reference for leader training and leader development. Understanding the meaning of the concepts and definitions the Army uses to describe leader training and A-2 _________________________________________ Leader Training and Leader Development in Units leader development is essential for planning and executing a unit development plan that trains leaders while simultaneously developing them for future responsibilities. DEFINITIONS A-8. Leadership: Influencing people—by providing purpose, direction, and motivation—while operating to accomplish the mission and improve the organization. A-9. Leader training: The expansion of basic soldier skills that qualify soldiers to lead other soldiers. A-10. Leader development: The deliberate, continuous, sequential, and progressive process, grounded in Army values, that grows soldiers into competent and confident leaders capable of decisive action. It is the developmental process oriented on teaching leaders how to think in complex environments. It is achieved through the lifelong synthesis of the knowledge, skills, and experiences gained through the synergy of the three domains of the Army Leader Training and Development Model— institutional, operational, and self-development. A-11. Competency: The knowledge, skills, and abilities that impact leader behavior and performance. CONCEPTS A-12. Developing agile and adaptive leaders: Leaders must develop an agile and adaptive mindset. Developing agile and adaptive leaders requires scenarios, opposing forces, and supporting training aids, devices, simulators, and simulations (TADSS) to fight realistically in a training environment. This mindset can be achieved by— Conducting leader training and leader development focused on executing fewer events with more complexity. Training combined arms at the lowest level. Empowering junior leaders to plan and conduct more training, and allowing them to develop creative solutions and ideas through decentralized execution. Leaders should add uncertainty and friction throughout all training events. The essence of leader success is being able to identify and adjust to completely new conditions rapidly, and to accomplish the mission with minimum disruption in the operation. A-13. Competencies: Competencies are not the technical requirements or specific knowledge and skills needed to perform a particular job. Rather, they are characteristics that indicate performance success across a variety of tasks and environments in an organization. Competencies are usually not directly observable—they show themselves through actions and behavior. Leaders lead soldiers and units into uncertain, ill-defined, and ever-changing operating environments using the foundation of broad- based leader competencies. A-14. Self-awareness and adaptability: The ambiguous nature of the operational environment requires Army leaders who are self-aware and adaptive. Self-aware leaders understand their operational environment; they can assess their own capabilities, determine their own strengths and A-3 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ weaknesses, and actively learn to overcome their weaknesses. Adaptive leaders must first be self-aware; then have the additional ability to recognize change in their operating environment, identify those changes, and learn how to adapt to succeed in their new environment. Self- awareness and adaptability are linked. A self-aware leader who is not adaptive cannot learn to accept change and modify behavior brought about by changes in the environment. However, adapting without self- awareness is changing for change’s sake—without understanding the relationship between abilities, duties, and the environment. A-15. Inculcation of the warrior ethos: Leaders have the responsibility to embody the warrior ethos and to instill that disposition in their subordinates. The warrior ethos forms the foundation for the American soldier’s spirit and total commitment to victory, in peace and war, always exemplifying ethical behavior and Army Values. Soldiers put the mission first, refuse to accept defeat, never quit, and never leave behind a fellow American. Their absolute faith in themselves and their comrades makes the United States Army invariably persuasive in peace and invincible in war. A-16. Self-development: The self-development domain in the Army Training and Leader Development Model (ATLDM) defines a critical area where self-development training occurs. Understanding how the self- development process occurs focuses on creating professionals who are constantly challenging and improving themselves. This domain is a self- directed, competency-based, progressive, lifelong process leaders use to augment institutional training and unit experience to attain proficiency at their current rank/assignment, and to prepare for promotion and higher-level responsibilities. Self-development is an individual responsibility, assisted by first line leaders and commanders, to identify training requirements based on assessment and feedback. Development activities are planned to meet specific individual training goals and needs. The Army also assists the individual in his or her self-development by providing the training and education products for the individual to learn—specifically, TSPs, assessment tools, reach-back and reach- forward capabilities, professional reading programs, and tuition assistance. A-17. Lifelong learning: Lifelong learning is the individual, lifelong choice to pursue knowledge, the comprehension of ideas, and the expansion of depth in any area actively in order to progress beyond a known state of development and competency. A-18. Leaders—as members of the profession of arms—are responsible for maintaining and expanding their professional knowledge. They must accept and commit to lifelong learning as a key leader development strategy. This strategy must integrate training and education content and materials with operational experiences, assessments, and feedback to ensure effective learning of required skills, knowledge, and abilities. The singlemost critical element of lifelong learning is feedback. Feedback sets the basis for increasing self-awareness and identifying individual leader development needs. A-19. Assessment and feedback: Assessment and feedback are key to developing competent, confident, self-aware, and adaptive leaders who can see first, understand first, act first, and finish decisively. An A-4 _________________________________________ Leader Training and Leader Development in Units important factor in growing leaders is implementing and sustaining an assessment and feedback process at all levels of leadership and in the three domains of leader development (institutional, operational, and self- development). To be effective, this assessment and feedback process must be formal and informal and must be reinforced with feedback through counseling and coaching. It must also include situational exercises and experiential learning. Formal assessment and feedback tools help improve leader skills, facilitate leader development, promote self- awareness and adaptability in leaders, and enhance leaders’ skill in building morale, teamwork, and cohesion. The results support improvement in the individual, the organization, and the Army. COMMANDER’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR LEADER TRAINING AND LEADER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS IN UNITS A-20. Commanders are responsible for leader training and leader development programs in their units. They alone are responsible for providing a climate in which learning can take place. These programs are for all officers, noncommissioned officers, and civilians in leadership positions. They help ensure that leaders are trained for current assignments, are exposed to a variety of perspectives, and are prepared for future positions. A-21. Commanders enhance leader development by evaluating unit training plans and ensuring that leaders are first trained to execute leader tasks to standard before they engage in collective events. Operational demands require leaders at all levels to apply their individually-developed competence to enable teamwork. Very-high- performing leader teams must develop teamwork, team decisionmaking, and team leadership. The development of these abilities starts with comprehensive leader training and leader development programs in units that create confident leaders and soldiers. A-22. Commanders are also responsible for the safety of their units. They are obligated to embed safety into the conduct of all operations and to ensure that subordinates execute risk management. The commanders fulfill this responsibility during the preparation phase of training by conducting a leader’s reconnaissance and risk assessments, and by following the risk management process. During the training execution phase, continual assessment and management of risk helps the commander make informed decisions. A-23. Requirements ultimately drive a commander’s decision regarding a leader’s assignment. However, the commander should progressively prepare the leader for new assignments by assigning him or her more complex and demanding duties—but should not overwhelm him or her. The commander should base reassignment on the leader’s level of development and demonstrated potential. Commanders also assess leader performance against the Army standard and leader competencies, and provide the leaders with information on strengths, weaknesses, and development needs. Finally, commanders create conditions for success and assist leaders in their preparation to achieve maximum growth. A-24. Leader training programs are mission-focused and consist of individual or position-level (for example, all platoon leader) training plans that ensure that leaders are competent in their current duty A-5 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ positions. Units may want to focus leader training on specific designated tasks. Leader training can include OPD, NCODP, and training programs that are based on an evaluation of supporting leader tasks for METL tasks that will be trained in the future. A-25. Leader development programs, such as officer professional development (OPD) and noncommissioned officer professional development (NCOPD), prepare leaders for increased responsibilities. The central element of a leader development program is an individually structured leader development action plan. The leader development action plan should be an individual assessment and implementation plan created jointly by the individual and the rater. Counseling and evaluation support forms are used to document this process. The leader development action plan should have a process to adapt to the changing needs of the leaders being developed. The commander should assess and provide feedback in accordance with counseling guidelines. Commanders should design leader development programs with the following characteristics: Battle focused. Focus on the leaders’ abilities to train, deploy, and lead their soldiers and units in combat. Consider the future and systematically develop skills and attributes successful leaders require in follow-on assignments. Comprehensive. Include more than tactical and technical competence. Although these skills are essential, a program to develop leadership potential should also enhance self-awareness; adaptability; conceptual, interpersonal, physical, mental, and emotional competence; and it should clarify and enrich the expected values for leaders of character. Inclusive. Apply to all leaders in the unit, from the newest corporal to the unit commander and CSM. Regardless of the level of expertise and experience, leaders are never completely developed—they are continually developing. Supportive. Include individual self-developmental goals. Support individual goals identified (and linked to unit training and readiness) in developmental action plans whenever possible. Leaders commit more readily to unit goals that also satisfy their personal goals. LEADER TRAINING AND LEADER DEVELOPMENT ACTION PLAN A-26. The leader training and leader development action plan consists of three phases: reception and integration, basic competency development, and leader development and sustainment. Figure A-2 is an example of a phased individual leader training and development action plan. The plan can be expanded or modified in order to conform to the organization’s METL or individual requirements.

Figure A-2. Key Elements of Leader Training and Leader Development Action Plan RECEPTION AND INTEGRATION PHASE A-27. Prior to the arrival of new leaders, the commander or key NCOs review the officer record brief (ORB) or the enlisted record brief (ERB) and DA Form 2-1 (Personnel Qualification Record-Part II). The commander or CSM/1SG interviews the new leader as soon as the leader arrives to define the training and developmental requirements clearly. They discuss the leader's assigned duty position, previous experience, training, education, personal desires, and possible future assignments. A-28. In addition to the records review and interview, the commander or CSM/1SG may use a diagnostic test to identify the new leader’s strengths and weaknesses. Units also use training programs to ensure that leaders are trained to the Army standard to serve in potentially hazardous and high-impact leadership positions. An example is certifying a leader to perform the duties of a range OIC or NCOIC. The information gathered during the reception and integration phase is used to design a formal training and developmental program tailored to the individual leader's requirements. After the interview with the commander or CSM/1SG, the leader participates in the unit orientation and the development of the leader training and leader development action plans. A-7 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ BASIC COMPETENCY TRAINING PHASE A-29. The leader then progresses to the second phase of the program, the basic competency training phase. This phase occurs within the first few months. It ensures that the new leader attains a minimum acceptable level of competency in the critical skills and tasks necessary to perform the mission. The responsibility for this phase lies with the rater, assisted by other key officers and NCOs in the unit. LEADER DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING SUSTAINMENT PHASE A-30. The last phase is the leader development and training sustainment phase. This phase involves sustaining those tasks already mastered and developing proficiency in new competencies. The commander develops the leader by using additional duty assignments, and technical and professional courses to broaden the leader’s perspective and skills for future duties. A-31. Also during this phase, the leader starts a self-development program. It is designed with the assistance of the commander and senior NCOs. Together, they prioritize self-development goals and determine courses of action to improve individual performance. Self-development starts with a competency-based assessment of previously acquired skills, knowledge, and experience. The leader then identifies his or her strengths, weaknesses, and development needs. Goals are categorized into near-term, short-range, and long-range actions and efforts. Near- term goals are remedial and focus on correcting weaknesses that adversely affect performance of current duty assignment requirements. Short-range goals focus on acquiring skills, knowledge, and experience needed for the next operational assignment. Long-range goals focus on preparing soldiers and leaders for more complex duties beyond their next operational assignment. A-32. Future assignments are important in a leader’s action plan. The commander uses assigned duties to assess performance and provide junior leaders with the experience and feedback required for professional and personal development. The commander should know his or her leaders so well that the commander can identify when they have mastered their current assignment responsibilities and either increase their responsibilities, expose them to developmental activities, or move them to positions of greater responsibility, as appropriate. SUMMARY A-33. Every leader has a professional responsibility to train and develop subordinates and himself or herself continually. All leaders should deliberately plan and execute subordinate leader training and leader development. Training and developing leaders requires investing in their long-term professional development while balancing the short-term mission essential operational requirements of the unit. The long-term development of leaders is the focus. It is a responsibility shared by the leader, the direct supervisor, the commander, and the Army. There is no greater or longer-lasting contribution a commander can make to improve the unit and shape the future of the Army than to train and develop future leaders. A-8 Appendix B Company Training Meeting The American soldier best performs his mission if he is well informed and knows the purpose of that mission. SMA Silas L. Copeland OVERVIEW B-1. Training is the Army’s number one priority. Company training meetings are key to near-term planning and are non-negotiable. Accordingly they appear on the weekly training calendar. Training meetings create the bottom-up flow of information regarding specific training proficiency needs of the unit and individual soldiers. Training meetings are conducted by leaders to review past training, identify and plan necessary retraining, plan and prepare future training, and exchange timely training information between leaders B-2. Feedback is an important aspect of training meetings and is used to refine the training plan. This feedback takes many forms, for example, personal observation, after action reviews (AARs), and informal evaluations. The training meeting is a primary forum for discussing training assessments. OBJECTIVE B-3. Company training meetings review completed training, deconflict training issues, plan and prepare future training, and exchange timely training information between participants. Training meetings are not a forum for discussing administrative operations and activities. Training is the sole topic. The training meeting focuses on three key tasks— Assessing completed training to determine the effectiveness of individual, leader, and collective training conducted since the last training meeting. Coordinating near-term training to confirm specific instructions and details to conduct the training. Planning for short-range training to develop future training plans that refine the short-range training plan B-1 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ PARTICIPANTS B-4. Leader participation is essential for a successful company training meeting. Figure B-1 shows a list of participants in company training meetings. ♦ Company commander. ♦ Executive officer. ♦ First sergeant. ♦ Platoon leaders. ♦ Platoon sergeants. ♦ Master gunner/Chief of firing battery/Shop supervisor. ♦ Maintenance team chief. ♦ Supply sergeant. ♦ NBC NCO. ♦ Others as required. o Food service NCO. o Direct support, unit representatives. (FSO, ALO, Engineer, ADA, MI and BSB) Figure B-1. Suggested Company Training Meeting Participants RESPONSIBILITIES B-5. Participants in company training meetings have the following responsibilities: The company commander is responsible for the efficient conduct of the training meeting. The XO coordinates training for all the soldiers in sections or attachments without platoon leaders or platoon sergeants. The 1SG assists the commander with individual soldier training assessments, provides guidance and advice on training plans, and reviews pre-execution checks discussed during the training meeting. Platoon leaders brief the collective task proficiency of their platoon, provide the commander and other members of the company with feedback on details of near-term training, and recommend collective training tasks for short–range training. Platoon sergeants brief individual soldier tasks, brief specific essential pre-execution checks for near-term training, and recommend individual soldier tasks for short-range training. Key NCOs, such as master gunners, attend training meetings and advise the commander on specialized training. For example, the master gunner works with the 1SG to track individual and crew- served weapon qualification, and helps leaders with gunnery training assessments. Maintenance team chiefs coordinate the maintenance efforts of the company and work with the commander and XO to ensure that timely support is provided. The maintenance team chief provides input on the status of maintenance training in the company, B-2 ___________________________________________________________ Company Training Meeting recommends maintenance-related training, and informs the commander of scheduled services and inspections. Supply sergeants advise the commander on supply-related issues, inspections, and inventories. Supply sergeants also work with the XO and 1SG to coordinate necessary support from outside sources. B-6. Attached leaders attend training meetings to coordinate their training efforts with those of the company. To “train as you fight,” commanders fully integrate the training of all habitually-associated units. B-7. RC companies may have AC associate personnel attend the training meetings. These personnel bring valuable experience and the latest training techniques from AC units. TRAINING MEETING TIME AND PLACE B-8. The company meeting follows the battalion training meeting by no more than 2 days. Company training meetings generally are conducted on the same day and time each week. B-9. Selecting a time to conduct training meetings depends on several factors. The main considerations include— Enabling leaders to attend. Minimizing training disruptions. Allowing subordinate leaders time to prepare. Local policy. B-10. Selecting a time for RC companies to conduct training meetings is more challenging. There are three alternatives— Conduct the meeting during a regularly scheduled drill session. Conduct the meeting during an additional training assembly (ATA). Conduct the training meeting during a “for points only” or non-paid assembly. TRAINING MEETING AGENDA B-11. There are three phases to company training meetings. They are assessment of the training completed, preparation for near-term training, and planning for short-range training. The agenda maintains a focus for all to see, understand, and follow. A sample company training meeting agenda is shown in figure B-2. B-3 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ TRAINING MEETING AGENDA * ROLL CALL * ASSESSMENT OF COMPLETED TRAINING * Strengths * Weaknesses * How to Improve * PREPARATION FOR NEAR-TERM TRAINING * Future Training Already Planned and Resources Verified * Risk Management * PLANNING FOR SHORT-RANGE TRAINING * Plan for Future Unscheduled Training * Supports for Training Assessment * Equipment and Resources Identified * Effective Use of Training Time * Risk Management * MISCELLANEOUS * FEEDBACK Figure B-2. Sample Training Meeting Agenda TIME REQUIREMENTS B-12. Company training meetings should not exceed 1 hour. Occasional situations may require meetings to last more than 1 hour, but these are the exception. The key is for the commander to achieve the meeting objectives as quickly and efficiently as possible. A recommended time line for training meetings is shown in table B-1. Table B-1. Time Requirements for Training Meetings Action Time Assessment of Completed Training 15 Minutes Preparation for Near-Term Training 30 Minutes Planning for Short-Range Training 15 Minutes ASSESSMENT OF COMPLETED TRAINING B-13. Commanders begin the meeting by discussing the training completed (see figure B-3). The bottom-up input by the platoon leaders and platoon sergeants is critical to the assessment of the collective, leader, and individual training proficiency of the unit. B-4 ___________________________________________________________ Company Training Meeting Assessment of Completed Training * PLATOON ASSESSMENT * Collective, Leader, and Soldier Training * ”T”, “P”, “U” Snapshot * TRAINING SHORTFALLS * Training Planned but Not Conducted * Reason for Not Executing * Retraining Plan * METL UPDATE * Training Assessment Guide Sheet * Platoon Input * Personal Observation Figure B-3. Assessment of Completed Training B-14. Assessment of completed training may reveal training that is incomplete or not conducted to the Army standard. Retraining should be conducted at the first opportunity—ideally, during the conduct of training. However, when this cannot happen, it may be necessary to adjust subsequent training planning to retrain on those tasks that were not performed to standard. B-15. In reviewing retraining requirements, company leaders consider a number of factors— The number of soldiers or elements involved. If the retraining is sequential to other planned training—does the retraining need to be accomplished before completing a future task? Resource availability (ranges, instructors, logistics, etc.). Original planning for the task and modification as necessary. When and where to reschedule the training at the first available opportunity. B-16. When assets are available, retraining takes priority over training new tasks. PLATOON ASSESSMENTS B-17. Platoon leaders and platoon sergeants assess collective and soldier proficiency since the last training meeting. This assessment is a “T”, “P”, “U” snapshot of all training conducted by the platoon. The sources of the platoon assessment may be formal or informal. B-18. As each platoon completes the training assessment, training shortfalls are addressed. A training shortfall occurs when training has been planned, but is not conducted. Platoon leaders must explain to the commander why the training was not executed, and show the plan to reschedule the missed training. METL UPDATE B-19. After all platoons complete their training assessments and discuss any training shortfalls, the commander updates the company METL assessment. B-5 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ PREPARATION FOR NEAR-TERM TRAINING B-20. The next step in the company training meeting process is to apply new training requirements, and to conduct pre-execution checks for the planned training. An outline of this portion of the training meeting is shown in figure B-4. Preparation for Near-Term Training * COMMAND GUIDANCE * New or Unscheduled Requirements * Only Training-Related Issues * PRE-EXECUTION CHECK REVIEW * Informal Planning * Detailed Coordination * AC Commanders – 4 to 6 Weeks out * RC Commanders – Next 3 Months * Focus is on Details * Risk Assessment Figure B-4. Preparation for Near-Term Training B-21. Pre-execution check review. A critical part of the training meeting is the discussion of pre-execution checks. Pre-execution checks include the informal planning and detailed coordination conducted during preparation for training. Pre-execution checks are developed by the chain of command and responsibilities for them are fixed to ensure that training is resourced and conducted properly. They become increasingly detailed as training schedules are developed. Pre-execution checks provide the attention to detail needed to use resources efficiently. B-22. By reviewing key pre-execution checks, the commander ensures that training events are fully planned for and coordinated with all elements of the company. The AC commanders look 4 to 6 weeks out when reviewing pre-execution checks. For RC commanders, the time period is the next 3 months. Within these training windows, commanders review pre-execution checks in reverse order. The last week (AC) or month (RC) first, working down until the next training period is covered in detail. Commanders focus on specific details when reviewing pre-execution checks. B-23. The primary trainer indicated on the training schedule briefs pre- execution checks. If the primary trainer is not the platoon sergeant, then the platoon sergeant briefs the pre-execution checks during the training meeting. For almost every training event for platoons and below, the platoon sergeant is the key coordinator. The platoon sergeant coordinates the efforts of other NCOs in the platoon and ensures that training is thoroughly prepared. PLANNING FOR SHORT-RANGE TRAINING B-24. The commander must check the battalion long-range training calendar. Events indicated on the battalion calendar or found in the CTG are put on the company training schedule first. After these events are posted, the commander begins planning company training to train tasks B-6 ___________________________________________________________ Company Training Meeting necessary to support battalion training events. He plans training on company identified tasks and begins to develop pre-execution checks to fix responsibilities for the training. PLATOON LEADER/PLATOON SERGEANT INPUT B-25. Based on their training assessments, platoon leaders and platoon sergeants develop plans to improve training proficiency. These plans are prepared and briefed to the commander during the training meeting. TRAINING SCHEDULE DEVELOPMENT B-26. Commanders receive input from all platoons and other elements of the company before formulating the draft training schedule. Because of support limitations or other conflicts, the commander may have to disapprove a training event that a platoon requested, or move it to another week (AC) or month (RC). Once all conflicts are resolved, the commander develops a rough draft of the next training schedule. SUMMARY B-27. Forging a trained and ready force begins with the platoon and the company. The Army is no better than its platoons and companies. The company training meeting is an essential element to achieving a trained and ready force. If one can find time to think up a make-work project, one also has the time to better plan for training. SMA William G. Bainbridge, 1977 B-7 Appendix C After Action Review (AAR) We would be much better served if we could do a better job of accentuating the positive. Pat that young NCO on the back when he does it right. Better yet, have the guts to underwrite NCO mistakes and back up our junior NCOs. Finally, look for solutions and suggest them instead of problems to our commanders. SMA William A. Connelly DEFINITION AND PURPOSE OF AFTER ACTION REVIEWS C-1. After action reviews (AARs) are a professional discussion of an event that enables soldiers and units to discover for themselves what happened, and why. They provide candid insights into strengths and weaknesses from various perspectives, and feedback. They focus directly on the training objectives. C-2. AARs are a key part of the training process, but they are not cure- alls for unit-training problems. Leaders must still make on-the-spot corrections and take responsibility for training soldiers and units. The goal of the AAR is to improve soldier, leader, and unit performance. The result is a more cohesive and proficient fighting force. C-3. Because soldiers and leaders participating in an AAR actively discover what happened and why, they learn and remember more than they would from a critique alone. A critique gives only one viewpoint and frequently provides little opportunity for discussion of events by participants. The climate of the critique—focusing only on what is wrong—prevents candid discussion of training events and stifles learning and team building. C-4. The purpose of the AAR is to provide the feedback essential to correcting training deficiencies. Feedback should be direct and on-the- spot. Each time incorrect performance is observed, it should be noted, and—if it will not interfere with training—corrected. During individual training this is easy to do. In collective training, such as an STX, it may not be possible to interrupt the exercise just to correct a soldier who is performing an individual task improperly. This is why an AAR should be planned at the completion of each mission or phase to provide immediate feedback to the soldiers being trained. TYPES OF AFTER ACTION REVIEWS C-5. There are two types of AARs: formal and informal. A formal AAR is resource-intensive and involves the planning, coordination, and preparation of the AAR site; supporting training aids; and support personnel. Informal AARs require less preparation and planning. C-1 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ FORMAL C-6. Leaders plan formal AARs at the same time that they finalize the near-term training plan (6 to 8 weeks before execution). Formal AARs require more planning and preparation than informal AARs. They require site reconnaissance and selection, coordination for training aids (terrain models, map blow-ups, etc.), and selection, setup, and maintenance of the AAR site. C-7. During formal AARs, the AAR facilitator (unit leader or OC) provides an exercise overview, and focuses the discussion of events on the training objectives. At the end, the facilitator reviews key points and issues, and summarizes strengths and weaknesses discussed during the AAR. INFORMAL C-8. Leaders and OCs use informal AARs as on-the-spot coaching tools while reviewing soldier and unit performances during training. The informal AAR is extremely important, as all soldiers are involved. For example, after destroying an enemy observation post (OP) during a movement to contact, a squad leader conducts an informal AAR to make corrections and reinforce strengths. Using nothing more than pinecones to represent squad members, the squad leader and squad members discuss the contact from start to finish. The squad quickly— Evaluates their performance against the Army standard. Identifies their strengths and weaknesses. Decides how to improve their performance when training continues. C-9. Informal AARs provide immediate feedback to soldiers, leaders, and units during training. Ideas and solutions the leader gathers during informal AARs can be immediately put to use as the unit continues its training. AFTER ACTION REVIEW PLANNING AND EXECUTION SEQUENCE C-10. To maximize the effectiveness of AARs, formal or informal, leaders must plan and prepare. AAR planning is part of unit near-term planning (6 to 8 weeks out). During planning, commanders assign OC responsibilities and ensure the allocation of time and resources to conduct AARs. C-11. The amount and level of detail needed during the planning and preparation process depends on the type of AAR to be conducted and available resources. The AAR process has four steps— Step 1—Planning. Step 2—Preparing. Step 3—Conducting. Step 4—Following up (using AAR results). PLANNING THE AFTER ACTION REVIEW C-12. Commanders are responsible for planning, preparing, executing, and evaluating training. All training is evaluated. C-2 ___________________________________________________________ After Action Review (AAR) C-13. The AAR plan provides the foundation for successful AARs. Commanders develop an AAR plan for each training event. It contains— Who will observe the training and who will conduct the AAR. What trainers should evaluate. Who attends. When and where the AAR will occur. What training aids will be used C-14. OCs use the AAR plan to identify critical places and events they must observe to give the unit a valid evaluation. Examples include unit maintenance collection points, passage points, and unit aid stations. The AAR plan also includes who will observe and control a particular event. The OC is the individual tasked to observe training, provide control for the training, and lead the AAR. SELECTING AND TRAINING OBSERVER/CONTROLLERS C-15. When planning an AAR, commanders should select OCs who— Can demonstrate proficiency in the tasks to be trained. Are knowledgeable of the duties they are to observe. Are knowledgeable of current doctrine and TTPs. C-16. When using external OCs, commanders strive to have OCs who are at least equal in rank to the leader of the unit they will evaluate. If commanders must choose between experience and understanding of current TTPs or rank, they should go with experience. A staff sergeant with experience as a tank platoon sergeant will be a better OC than a sergeant first class that has no platoon sergeant experience. C-17. Commanders are responsible for training OCs to include training on how to conduct an AAR. Each OC leads AARs for the element the OC observes, and provides input to the OC for the next higher echelon. Ideally, inexperienced OCs should observe properly conducted AARs beforehand. REVIEWING THE TRAINING AND EVALUATION PLAN C-18. The commander must specify what the training is intended to accomplish, and be specific on what is to be evaluated. T&EOs provide tasks, conditions, and standards for the unit's training as well as the standard by which leaders measure unit and soldier performance. C-19. T&EOs are extracted from the ARTEP-MTP or developed from the ARTEP-MTP and appropriate STPs. A copy of the T&EO is given to the senior OC. The senior OC distributes the T&EO to the OC team members who review and use it to focus their observations. Using the evaluation plan, OCs can concentrate on critical places and times to evaluate unit performance. SCHEDULING STOPPING POINTS C-20. Commanders schedule time to conduct AARs as an integral part of training events. Commanders plan for an AAR at the end of each critical phase or major training event. For example, a leader plans a stopping point after issuing an OPORD, when the unit arrives at a new position, after consolidation on an objective, etc. C-3 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ C-21. Commanders should allow approximately 30 to 45 minutes for platoon-level AARs, 1 hour for company-level AARs, and about 2 hours for battalion-level and above. Soldiers will receive better feedback on their performance and remember the lessons longer as result of a quality AAR. DETERMINING ATTENDANCE C-22. The AAR plan specifies who attends each AAR. At each echelon, an AAR has a primary set of participants. At squad and platoon levels, all members of the squad and platoon should attend and participate. At company or higher levels, it may not be practical to have everyone attend because of continuing operations or training. In this case, unit and OPFOR commanders, unit leaders, and other key players may be the only participants. OCs may recommend additional participants based on specific observations. CHOOSING TRAINING AIDS C-23. Training aids add to an AAR’s effectiveness. Training aids should directly support discussion of the training and promote learning. Local training support center (TSC) catalogs list training aids available to each unit. Dry-erase boards, video equipment, terrain models, and enlarged maps are all worthwhile under the right conditions. For example, if reconnaissance reveals there were no sites that provided a view of the exercise area, the AAR facilitator may want to use a terrain table C-24. Terrain visibility, group size, suitability to task, and availability of electrical power are all things to consider when selecting training aids. The key is planning and coordination. The bottom line: use a training aid only if it makes the AAR better. C-25. See Appendix G for further discussion of home station TSC support and training aids available within the Army training support system. REVIEWING THE AAR PLAN C-26. The AAR plan is only a guide. Commanders and OCs should review it regularly to make sure it is still on track and meets the training needs of the units. The plan may be adjusted as necessary, but changes take preparation and planning time away from subordinate OCs or leaders. The purpose of the AAR plan is to allow OCs and AAR leaders as much time as possible to prepare for the AAR. PREPARING THE AFTER ACTION REVIEW C-27. Preparation is the key to the effective execution of any plan. Preparation for an AAR begins before the training and continues until the actual event. REVIEWING TRAINING OBJECTIVES, ORDERS, AND DOCTRINE C-28. OCs must review the training objectives before training, and again immediately before the AAR. Training objectives are the basis for observations and the focus of the AAR. OCs review current doctrine, technical information, and applicable unit SOPs to ensure that they have the tools to observe unit and individual performance properly. OCs read C-4 ___________________________________________________________ After Action Review (AAR) and understand all OPORDs and fragmentary orders (FRAGOs) the unit will issue before and during training in order to understand what is supposed to happen. The detailed knowledge OCs display as a result of these reviews gives added credibility to their evaluations. IDENTIFYING KEY EVENTS C-29. OCs identify which events are critical and make sure they are positioned in the right place at the right time to observe the unit’s actions. Examples of critical events include— Issue of OPORDs and FRAGOs. Troop-leading procedures (TLPs). Contact with opposing forces. Resupply and reconstitution operations. Passage of lines. OBSERVING THE TRAINING AND TAKING NOTES C-30. OCs must keep an accurate record of what they see and hear, and record events, actions, and observations by time sequence to prevent loss of valuable information and feedback. OCs use any recording system (notebook, prepared forms, 3-by-5 cards) as long as it is reliable, sufficiently detailed (identifying times, places, and names), and consistent. C-31. OCs include the date-time group (DTG) of each observation so it can be easily integrated with observations of other OCs. This provides a comprehensive and detailed overview of what happened. When the OCs have more time, they review the notes and fill in any details not written down earlier. C-32. One of the most difficult OC tasks is to determine when and where to observe training. The OC does not always need to stay close to the unit leader. The best location is where one can observe the performance of critical tasks and the overall flow of unit actions. The position cannot be a training distracter—the OC should look and act like a member of the unit (using individual and vehicle camouflage, movement techniques, cover and concealment, etc.). The OC cannot compromise the unit’s location or intent by being obvious. The OC should be professional, courteous, and low-key at all times. SELECTING AAR SITES C-33. AARs should occur at or near the training exercise site. Leaders should identify and inspect AAR sites and prepare a site diagram showing the placement of training aids and other equipment. Designated AAR sites also allow pre-positioning of training aids and rapid assembly of key personnel, thereby minimizing wasted time. C-34. The AAR site should allow soldiers to see the terrain where the exercise took place. If this is not possible, the trainer finds a location that allows them to see the terrain where the most critical or significant actions occurred. The OC should have a terrain model or enlarged map or sketch and a copy of the unit’s graphics to help everyone relate key events to the actual terrain. C-5 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ C-35. The OC should make soldiers attending the AAR as comfortable as possible by removing helmets, providing shelter from the elements, having refreshments available (coffee, water), thereby creating an environment where participants can focus on the AAR without distractions. Participants should not face into the sun, and key leaders should have seats up front. Vehicle parking and equipment security areas should be far enough away from the AAR site to prevent distractions. COLLECTING OBSERVATIONS FROM OTHER OBSERVER/CONTROLLERS C-36. The senior OC needs a complete picture of what happened during the training to conduct an effective AAR. OCs for subordinate, supporting, and adjacent units provide the senior OC with a comprehensive review of the unit they observed and the impact those units have on the higher unit’s mission. C-37. The senior OC also receives input from OPFOR leaders, players, and OCs. The enemy’s perspective is critical in identifying why a unit was or was not successful. During formal AARs, the OPFOR leader briefs the OPFOR plan and intent to set the stage for a discussion of what happened and why. ORGANIZING THE AAR C-38. The OC gathers all the information, organizing notes in chronological sequence in order to understand the flow of events. The OC selects and sequences key events in terms of their relevance to training objectives, and identifies key discussion and/or teaching points. C-39. The purpose of discussion is for participants to discover strengths and weaknesses, propose solutions, and adopt a course of action to correct problems. OCs organize the AAR using one of the following three techniques: Chronological order of events. This technique is logical, structured, and easy to understand. It follows the flow of training from start to finish. By covering actions in the order they took place, soldiers and leaders are better able to recall what happened. Battlefield operating systems (BOS). This technique structures the AAR using the BOS. Focusing on each BOS and discussing it across all phases of the training exercise, participants can identify systemic strengths and weaknesses. This technique is useful in training staff sections. Key events/themes/issues. Key events focus discussion on critical training events that directly support training objectives the chain of command identified before the exercise began. This technique is particularly effective when time is limited. REHEARSING C-40. After thorough preparation, the OC reviews the AAR format, and gets ready to conduct the AAR. The OC then announces to unit leaders the AAR start time and location. This allows enough time for the OCs to prepare and rehearse at the AAR site while unit leaders account for C-6 ___________________________________________________________ After Action Review (AAR) personnel and equipment, perform actions that their unit SOP requires, and move to the AAR site. CONDUCTING THE AFTER ACTION REVIEW C-41. The training exercise has reached a stopping point, AAR preparation is complete, and key players are at the designated AAR site. If necessary, the OC reviews the purpose and sequence of the AAR to ensure that everyone present understands why an AAR is conducted. It is now time to conduct the AAR. INTRODUCTION AND RULES C-42. The introduction should include the following thoughts: An AAR is a dynamic, candid, professional discussion of training that focuses on unit performance against the Army standard. Everyone must participate if they have an insight, observation, or question that will help the unit identify and correct deficiencies or maintain strengths. An AAR is not a critique. No-one, regardless of rank, position, or strength of personality, has all the information or answers. AARs maximize training benefits by allowing soldiers to learn from each other. An AAR does not grade success or failure. There are always weaknesses to improve and strengths to sustain. C-43. Soldier participation is directly related to the atmosphere created during the introduction. The AAR leader should make a concerted effort to draw in soldiers who seem reluctant to participate. The following techniques can help the OC create an atmosphere conducive to maximum participation. The OC should— Reinforce the idea that it is permissible to disagree. Focus on learning and encourage people to give honest opinions. Use open-ended and leading questions to guide the discussion of soldier, leader, and unit performance. Enter the discussion only when necessary. REVIEW OF OBJECTIVES AND INTENT C-44. The OC reviews unit training objectives the AAR will cover. The OC then restates the tasks being reviewed, including the conditions and standards for the tasks. COMMANDER’S MISSION AND INTENT (WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN) C-45. Using maps, operational graphics, terrain boards, etc., the commander/leader restates the mission and intent. The OC may guide the discussion to ensure that everyone present understands the plan and the commander’s intent. Another technique is to have subordinate leaders restate the mission and discuss the commander’s intent. C-7 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ OPFOR COMMANDER’S MISSION AND INTENT C-46. In a formal AAR, the OPFOR commander explains the plan to defeat friendly forces. Using the same training aids as the friendly force commander, participants can understand the relationship of both plans. SUMMARY OF EVENTS (WHAT HAPPENED) C-47. The OC guides the review using a logical sequence of events to describe and discuss what happened. The OC does not ask “yes” or “no” questions, but encourages participation and guides the discussion by using open-ended and leading questions. An open-ended question allows the person answering to reply based on what was significant to the soldier. Open-ended questions are much less likely to put soldiers on the defensive. Open-ended questions are more effective in finding out what happened. For example, it is better to ask, “SGT Johnson, what happened when your Bradley crested the hill?” than, “SGT Johnson, why didn’t you engage the enemy tanks to your front?” C-48. As the discussion expands and more soldiers add their perspectives, what really happened becomes clear. The OC does not tell the soldiers or leaders what was good or bad. The OC must ensure that specific issues are revealed, both positive and negative in nature. Skillful guidance of the discussion ensures that the AAR does not gloss over mistakes or unit weaknesses. CLOSING COMMENTS (SUMMARY) C-49. During the summary, the OC reviews and summarizes key points identified during the discussion. The OC should end the AAR on a positive note, linking conclusions to future training. The OC then leaves the immediate area to allow unit leaders and soldiers time to discuss the training in private. BENEFITS OF THE AAR C-50. AARs are the dynamic link between task performance and execution to standard. They provide commanders a critical assessment tool to plan soldier, leader, and unit training. Through the professional and candid discussion of events, soldiers can compare their performance against the standard and identify specific ways to improve proficiency. C-51. Leaders should not delay retraining except when absolutely necessary. If the leader delays retraining, the soldiers and unit must understand that they did not perform the task to standard and that retraining will occur later. C-52. One of the most important benefits of the AAR comes from applying results in developing future training. Leaders can use the information to assess performance and to plan future training to correct deficiencies and sustain demonstrated task proficiency. C-53. Time or the complexity of the mission may prevent retraining on some tasks during the same exercise. When this happens, leaders must reschedule the mission or training in accordance with FM 7-0 and FM 7- 1. As part of this process, leaders must ensure that deficient supporting tasks found during the AAR are also scheduled and retrained. C-8 ___________________________________________________________ After Action Review (AAR) REVISED STANDING OPERATING PROCEDURES C-54. AARs may reveal problems with unit SOPs. If so, unit leaders must revise the SOP and ensure that units implement the changes during future training. SUMMARY C-55. The AAR process makes the U.S. Army different from all others. The AAR is a key component in giving our nation the best trained Army in the world. C-9 Appendix D Training Exercise Development Use your brain, your imagination, your initiative. General Hamilton Howze PURPOSE D-1. The training exercise selection process is used by commanders to achieve and sustain METL proficiency. The purpose of this appendix is as follows: To illustrate how the training exercise selection process helps— Train commanders and their subordinates at all echelons to implement mission command. Develop and train staffs that can synchronize combined arms operations. To expand discussions on— Training adaptive leaders and units. Use of live, virtual, and constructive training discussed in chapter 4. Crawl-walk-run training discussed in chapter 5. DEFINITIONS D-2. Mission Command: The conduct of military operations through decentralized execution based upon mission orders for effective mission accomplishment. Successful mission command results from subordinate leaders at all echelons exercising disciplined initiative within the commander’s intent to accomplish missions. D-3. Mission Orders: A technique for completing combat orders to allow subordinates maximum freedom of planning and action to accomplish missions that leave the “how” of mission accomplishment to the subordinate. D-4. Nested Concept: Nested concepts provide the means to achieve unity of purpose whereby each succeeding echelon’s concept is nested in the other. TRAINING EXERCISE SELECTION PROCESS D-5. Commanders consider several key questions when selecting training exercises. As shown in figure D-1, commanders refer to their training assessment before they start the training exercise selection process to determine— What are the specific training tasks? What is the training audience for each specific training task? What is the overall training objective? D-1 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ D-6. Once commanders identify the training audience(s), they again refer to their training assessment to answer the following: What is the training audience’s current level of proficiency? What is the required level of training proficiency for this training audience on this particular task? Is it to— Acquire new skills? Familiarize skills? Practice and sustain skills? Validate skills? These questions help commanders determine whether to use a crawl, walk, or run training approach for any training exercise. Figure D-1. Training Exercise Selection Process D-7. Commanders determine specific training objectives, then consider conditions necessary to achieve the level of proficiency for the training audience. Commanders ask the following questions when considering conditions— What is the desired level of realism? What resources are available to achieve the desired level of realism? D-2 _______________________________________________________ Training Exercise Development D-8. Commanders select a particular training exercise or combination of exercises based on— Current level of proficiency compared with the required level of proficiency on specific tasks. Resources available to replicate conditions necessary to achieve and sustain required levels of proficiency. The answers to these questions, considered along with the decision on crawl, walk, or run training skill proficiency level exercises, help the commander determine whether to use live, virtual, or constructive training simulators and simulations, or a combination of the three, for desired exercise quality. DEVELOP COMPETENT, CONFIDENT, ADAPTIVE LEADERS AND SOLDIERS D-9. Mission command requires competent, confident, adaptive leaders and soldiers. It requires commanders to teach their subordinate commanders, leaders, and units how to train for mission command. Training for mission command requires the commander to train on the four elements of mission command outlined in FM 6-0— Commander’s intent. Mission orders. Subordinates’ initiative. Resource allocation. D-10. Commander’s intent provides— A unifying idea that allows decentralized execution within an overarching concept. Guidance and a point of common reference for subordinates to exercise initiative to accomplish overall goals. The basis for decentralized decisionmaking and execution when subordinates understand the commander’s intent two echelons up. D-11. A technique to train subordinates to understand the commander’s intent two echelons up is to design training scenarios using nested concepts. Nested concepts provide the means to achieve unity of purpose where each succeeding echelon’s concept is nested in the other. Commanders who use nested concepts in training exercises provide subordinates an opportunity to— Practice decentralized decisionmaking and execution. Exercise initiative within the commander’s intent. D-12. The nested concept method gives commanders— The opportunity to engage and exploit the talents and initiative of subordinate commanders and soldiers at every level. An effective technique to train their subordinates on the use of the four elements of mission command. D-13. Training for mission command requires commanders and leaders to emphasize use of mission orders along with nested concept training scenarios. Mission orders train subordinates to exercise initiative within the commander’s intent. Commanders develop an environment of mutual D-3 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ trust and understanding that sponsors and fosters decentralized decisionmaking and execution. Additionally, commanders must— Underscore each subordinates responsibility for their assigned mission in the context of their commander’s mission, intent and concept of operation. Help subordinates understand the leadership effect of combat power. Leaders decide where and when to generate effects of maneuver, firepower, and protection. D-14. Figure D-2 illustrates the use of mission orders with the nested concept technique. Figure D-2. Training for Mission Command—Nested Concepts D-15. MAPEXs and TEWTs are leader-oriented training exercises in which commanders can use mission orders based on nested concept scenarios to train staffs and subordinate commanders in mission command. These exercises provide staffs and subordinate commanders with opportunities to— Develop and expand their battle command experience base. Develop uniform understanding of key doctrinal concepts and terms, and use the doctrinal terms correctly. Develop their ability to understand the commander’s intent. D-16. The MAPEX uses troop leading procedures (TLPs) and the MDMP to— Give guidance (visualize). Prepare plans (describe). Issue orders (direct). D-4 _______________________________________________________ Training Exercise Development D-17. The TEWT provides an opportunity for commanders, staff officers, and other leaders to practice both the art and science of war. They— Practice the art of war by using discussions of tentative plans developed during MAPEXs to— Encourage initiative and decentralized decisionmaking and execution. Develop uniform tactical thinking among commanders at every echelon (for example, BCT through company). Improve mental agility of subordinate commanders. Practice the science of war by training leader and staff tasks related to— Direct fire planning, coordination, and preparation. Emplacing tactical and protective obstacles. Integrating indirect fires. “Walk-through” of selected CSS operations TTPs (for example, casualty evacuation [CAS EVAC]). D-18. Figures D-3 and D-4 illustrate how the 1st BCT and 1-77 IN commanders embed mission command training in sequenced training exercises. In these two examples, both commanders use a series of leader exercises and staff exercises with constructive simulations to prepare for a live multiechelon training exercise. Specifically, both commanders— Use a TEWT to execute leaders’ reconnaissance and adjust tentative plans prepared during a MAPEX. Execute plans refined during the TEWT in a constructive simulation to train their staff and subordinate commanders. Use constructive simulations as staff rehearsals for the BCT CFX. D-19. These exercises emphasize— Use of mission orders based on nested concept designed training scenarios to train the BCT leaders in the fundamental concepts of mission command. Subordinates’ exercise of initiative within the commander’s intent through decentralized decisionmaking and execution. Uniform tactical thinking and mental agility. Practicing effective communication methods and habits. D-5 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure D-3. Training for Mission Command (1st BCT) D-6 _______________________________________________________ Training Exercise Development Figure D-4. Training for Mission Command (1-77 IN) TRAIN STAFFS THAT CAN SYNCHRONIZE COMBINED ARMS OPERATIONS D-20. BCT and battalion commanders know staff training presents the same basic problem: How to plan home station training using available TADSS to help BCT and battalion staffs achieve and sustain combat proficiency within the Band of Excellence. D-21. The BCT commander factored in considerations of current training proficiency level, desired training proficiency level, training proficiency skill progression, available resources, and desired level of realism (training conditions) when he or she decided— What tasks the staff needed training on. Who needed training on these specific selected tasks. This helped the BCT commander determine the training audience. What type(s) of exercise(s) get the designated training audience training on selected tasks. Where to conduct selected training exercises. When to conduct selected training exercises (that is, in what sequence, and at what frequency). D-22. Figure D-5 illustrates different staff training exercises the BCT commander selected, sequenced, and repeated to achieve and sustain combat proficiency for two specific staff tasks— “Develop an R&S Plan.” “Execute the Targeting Process.” D-7 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Figure D-5. 1st BCT Main CP Staff Training Exercises D-23. The BCT commander knows he or she must link training exercises using virtual simulators and constructive simulations with live engagement simulation and live fire to train the BCT staff on these particular tasks. This integration of live, virtual, and constructive (L-V-C) training exercises into a single exercise is particularly useful for training digitally-equipped staffs. D-24. The next series of figures (figures D-6 through figure D-11) illustrates how the BCT commander might execute the BCT shaping operations LFX. Each figure in the series illustrates a few key points. In practice, the actions depicted in the individual figures occur simultaneously during the BCT shaping operations LFX. D-25. The BCT shaping operations LFX is a multiechelon event, and incorporates Service-sponsored interoperability training. Figure D-6 depicts the training audience for this exercise. D-26. The training audience consists of— BCT main CP (live). UAV platoon (live and virtual). FA battalion TOC and FDC (live). FA firing batteries (live fire). Target acquisition platoon (virtual). Attack helicopter battalion (constructive). Attack helicopter companies (live fire and virtual). BCT MI company (live). BCT signal company (live). USAF (live fire and constructive).

Linking a Tank Company and Battalion Task Force Home Station Training with Battalion Task Force Live Fire at CTC D-15 Appendix E Example Training Guidance E-1. The command training guidance (CTG) is published at division and subordinate levels. It conveys the commander’s written expression of training strategy, objectives, and priorities, and highlights training events to subordinate units. The commander’s training strategy provides the detail from which training schedules are developed. It lays out the sequence of training to be accomplished, and includes who, what, when, and where to train. It should not include a review of established unit policies and procedures. E-2. Examples of topics normally addressed in the CTG are— Commander’s assessment of METL proficiency. Training priorities and strategy to improve and sustain METL proficiency. Combined arms training. Organizational inspection program. JIIM training, as applicable. A cross-reference of training events and associated METL training objectives. Individual training. Leader development and leader training. Self development. Training of trainers and evaluators. Training evaluation and feedback. Force integration. Resource guidance. Training management. Risk management. E-3. This appendix provides examples of training guidance and associated calendars—the formats and contents may be used as guides when developing training documents. These documents also serve as source documents for most of the training examples used throughout this field manual. E-4. The training-related information and documents that follow are for a notional division, the 52nd Infantry Division (Mech), and a subordinate brigade combat team and infantry battalion. The 52nd Infantry Division is the force structure upon which the examples are based. The 1st Brigade Combat Team (BCT) and 1-77th Infantry Battalion (Mech) are the example brigade and battalion-level combat arms unit used to illustrate the training techniques and procedures. E-1 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ EXAMPLE DIVISION COMMAND TRAINING GUIDANCE DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HEADQUARTERS, 52nd INFANTRY DIVISION (MECHANIZED) FT RILEY, KS 66442-5000 LCWB-CG 15 January XXXX MEMORANDUM FOR SEE DISTRIBUTION SUBJECT: FY XX Command Training Guidance 1. Commander's Training Philosophy: a. The FY XX Command Training Guidance (CTG) is the foundation of my training philosophy. The CTG describes the division training model in detail and states the annual training objectives for the 52nd Infantry Division (Mech). Since the CTG endorses and expands upon 10th Corps and U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) requirements, it is the most important source document for trainers and commanders in this command. My quarterly training guidance will expand and refine the CTG and add precision to our training management; however, the annual CTG will be the basis for division quarterly guidance. b. Our overriding philosophy is to “train to fight and to win.” Our training doctrine is found in FM 7-0. The mission and reality of life at FT Riley requires innovative use of multiechelon training. Our most critical resource constraints are time and space, so we must take every opportunity to train as we expect to fight. The norm is training to standard with your battle team. c. The CTG is an opportunity for me to emphasize some principles that have emerged over the past few months. Training in the 52nd Inf Div (Mech) is focused on our mission to deploy rapidly, fight, sustain warfighting capability, and win the next battle. This mission must be accomplished in an environment of new weapons systems, devices to simulate their operation, new equipment, and a changing organization, all within a changing body of doctrine developed to defeat the enemy. To do this, our top priority is training that is— • Tough, realistic, and challenging. • Multiechelon and performance-oriented. • Focused on and carefully planned and coordinated with the combined arms team. • Based on the integration of collective and soldier tasks. • Vigorously executed and evaluated. d. We can accomplish these training goals if we understand, live, and breathe the idea that TRAINING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE DO. All functions, such as maintenance and care for our soldiers' safety, are part of our overall approach to training. Our training program is a reflection of our leadership. It requires that we understand how we train to fight at every echelon, remain focused on mission essential tasks and our wartime mission to ensure combat readiness. 2. Areas of Emphasis: All aspects of our training and training management program E-2 __________________________________________________________ Example Training Guidance contribute significantly to our combat readiness. I will address many of these in detail in my quarterly training guidance. My priorities for training this period are: a. Tasks on the METL not assessed as "T." b. Division battle tasks. c. 3rd BCT prep for SFOR and departure. d. Soldier, leader, and collective training which supports the METL. e. Combined arms training. f. Gunnery for 1st and 2nd BCTs. g. Training evaluations and feedback. h. Lessons learned. i. Integration of a total maintenance concept. 3. Training to fight and win on the mechanized battlefield is the reason for our existence. This division has always been a significant force in the FORSCOM structure. We must be trained and ready for war to ensure that we maintain a credible fighting force. Our mission is not easy, but our nation deserves nothing less. 4. Every leader will read and understand this document. 5. Training is our top priority, and don’t you forget it! SIGNATURE DIVISION COMMANDER 2 Encls 1. Division Long-Range Planning Calendar * 2. 52nd Infantry Division Task Organization (Omitted) DISTRIBUTION: A and B *The Division long-range calendar depicts a 2-year period. This enclosure includes only the first three quarters to show information normally found on the calendar. It is only an example, not meant to show the entire division long-range plan. The subordinate units from the 1st Brigade Combat Team (BCT), the 1-40 FA Bn from DIVARTY, and the 1st FSB from DISCOM, are shown because they are the example units used throughout the manual. The division's training and associated training calendars for 2nd quarter (Jan- Mar) provide the foundation for subordinate units planning.

References. a. FM 7-0, dtd Oct 02, Subj: Training the Force. b. FM 7-1, dtd XXX 03, Subj: Battle Focused Training, Battalion Level and Lower. c. Memo, 52nd Infantry Division (Mech), dtd 15 Jan XX, Subj: FY XX Command Training Guidance. 2. Purpose. The purpose of the QTG is to refine the guidance provided in the CTG and provide my current assessment of the division's capability to successfully execute its METL. This memorandum also provides a listing of major training events for the second quarter and outlines topics that must be covered during the brigade and battalion QTBs. 3. Training Assessment. a. Results of the division's simulation-driven command post exercise conducted last quarter convinced me the division can effectively execute its deployment mission. Leaders and soldiers of the division should be proud of their excellent performance during the CPX. We must continue to sustain deployment proficiency. b. Presently, the division cannot conduct certain tactical missions as effectively as it should. Accordingly, I assess the division as "P" on the following METL tasks; and expect special emphasis on them in our training. (1) Conduct an area defense. (2) Conduct a counterattack. 4. Training Events. Following are the division's major training events during the second quarter: • 02 Jan - 26 Mar: 1st and 2nd BCT gunnery training. • 03 Jan - 05 Jan: Div TEWT - Division through battalion commanders, staffs, and separate company commanders. • 08 Feb - 26 Feb: Division QTB. • 28 Feb: Division Radio Net Training. • 28 Feb - 29 Feb: MSE Training. • 15 - 18 Mar: 1st Brigade CPX. 5. Training Strategy. I want second quarter training to emphasize collective and soldier E-5 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ tasks which support the division's METL tasks listed as "P" in paragraph 3. Following are some points commanders need to consider during short-range and near-term planning: a. Red Cycle Training. in accordance with my strategy of shielding brigades from support duties during the 120 days prior to their NTC rotation, 1st Brigade will not be tasked with ordinary support duties after February. Units in the support cycle must continue to do soldier, crew, and small-unit training whenever possible. Unit integrity must be maintained when accomplishing support taskings. b. Task Force Training. Leaders must continue to find ways to strengthen the cohesion and interoperability between the brigade and battalion task force and their respective supporting elements. The 1st Brigade subordinate commanders should reinforce the combined arms training by routinely training as battalion task forces and company teams in preparation for the NTC. c. OPFOR. Units designated as OPFOR have an obligation to portray an OPFOR that is realistic and follows threat doctrine. OPFOR units have a tremendous opportunity to expand leaders' and soldiers' understanding of how the threat operates. Ensure that units designated to be OPFOR have adequate time to train for their roles. Both brigades will have opportunities to provide OPFOR support during this quarter. d. Maintenance Training. The division continues to lose too much operational time and spend too much money on repair parts because soldiers are not properly supervised when using and maintaining equipment, vehicles, and systems. Leaders must ensure that soldiers are adequately trained and supervised in maintenance techniques. Driver training programs must include tactical field driving test that is leader supervised and evaluated. e. Leaders must emphasize the following to maximize next quarter's training: (1) Maintain battle focus. (2) Train to standard, not time. (3) Major weapon training and qualification. (4) Train to support SFOR deployment and operations. (5) Use multiechelon training techniques. (6) Safety. 6. Quarterly Training Briefs. Quarterly training briefing dates are in the QTB memorandum of instruction dated 1 Sep XX and are depicted on the QTC. In addition to the standard topics, commanders will discuss the following areas during the briefings: a. Integration of task force elements into training. b. Maintenance training and driver training programs. c. OPFOR training program. 7. Risk Management. Combat operations are demanding, complex, and inherently dangerous. Our training for these must be tough, realistic, and instill the skills and judgment required to perform successful military operations. Managing risk requires educated judgment and professional competence. The risk management process enables commanders, leaders, and soldiers to make informed, conscious decisions to understand, control, and accept risks at acceptable levels. Leaders and soldiers, who E-6 __________________________________________________________ Example Training Guidance understand risk and how to manage it, instill confidence and discipline in themselves and their organizations to prevail in a hazardous operational environment. Risk management enables tough, realistic, challenging training. It ensures inherent risks are clearly recognized and mitigated to ensure battle focused training is achieved. With that said, leaders and soldiers at all levels will use risk management. 8. Conclusion. The second quarter will present many training challenges. Leaders must plan and execute training as if it is the most important thing they will ever do. The chain of command must vigorously execute the training schedules just as they would execute operations in combat – the way we train is the way we will fight. I am certain that the officers and noncommissioned officers of this division are equal to the task. 9. Every leader will read and understand this document. 10. Training is our top priority, and don’t you forget it!

This memorandum provides my vision of how the brigade will train during the next quarter. It outlines my assessment of our current level of training, major training events next quarter, and my training strategy for preparing soldiers, leaders, and units to execute their mission essential tasks. 3. Training Assessment. a. I am satisfied with the brigade's direction in training. Leaders are working hard to make training both interesting and productive. Our implementation of FM 7-0 and FM 7-1 in the BCT has greatly improved our training management system. The BCT's strategy of attempting to fence company-level training during the post red cycle appears to be working well. Significant progress is being made in raising the proficiency of soldier and collective tasks that support the brigade's METL. b. There is still much work to do. The brigade and the task forces have not had an opportunity to go to the field since the external evaluations last quarter. Based on last quarter's external evaluation and unit assessment during this quarter, the brigade's training status on its METL tasks is: • Move by Road/Rail to APOE/SPOE T • Prepare for Combat Operations T • Move to and Occupy Assembly Areas T • Conduct Relief in Place T • Conduct Area Defense P • Conduct Counterattack P • Conduct Movement to Contact T • Conduct Hasty Attack P E-9 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ 4. Training Events. Following are the major training events for the brigade during the second quarter: • 02 Jan – 9 Feb: 1st BCT Gunnery. • 03 Jan - 05 Jan: DIV TEWT. Includes BCT and BN commanders and battle staffs. • 08 Jan - 12 Jan: Command Inspection (1-2 Armor). • 22 Jan - 26 Jan: Command Inspection (1-3 Armor). • 29 Jan - 02 Feb: Command Inspection (1-77 Infantry). • 10 Feb: Division QTB. • 15 Feb: Brigade QTB • 28 Feb: Division Radio Net Training. • 28 Feb - 29 Feb: MSE Training. • 05 Mar - 09 Mar: TF 1-2 supports 2nd BCT TF EXEVAL. • 15 Mar - 18 Mar: BDE CPX. • 26 Mar - 31 Mar: 1-3 AR supports 2nd BCT TF EXEVAL. 5. Training Strategy. a. The division commander has emphasized the importance of task force and team training in preparation for the NTC at the end of the third quarter. He has also shielded us from support taskings after February. We must use this opportunity to the fullest. I expect leaders to maximize this training opportunity through: (1) Battle focused training. We must master our METL tasks during this training window. There is no time to waste. I expect a direct connection between all training and METL. (2) Combined Arms Team Training. Brigade and battalion training must integrate the task force elements. The BCT training guidance and associated training calendars will continue to reflect the battalion's peacetime modification table of organization and equipment (MTOE). However, I expect training to reflect the task organization at Enclosure 2. Commanders will assess task force and company team proficiency and plan, prepare, and execute training accordingly. This will require intensive coordination between TF 1-2 Armor, TF 1-77, and the 2-17 Armor, 3rd BCT, which will go to the NTC with the brigade. (3) Synchronization of Collective and Soldier Task Training. Soldier task training must support the METL. Integrate NCO leaders into the training planning process and ensure all leaders understand their soldiers' and units' roles in supporting higher unit's METL. (4) Training to Standard. Plan enough time to retrain and execute the tasks to standard. Use pretesting and post testing during training to determine when to move on to the sustainment phase. I expect to find leaders present at training ensuring that training is conducted to standard. b. We do not have time next quarter to train every task that I assessed as “P”. Following are brigade METL tasks that I expect the task forces to be able to support by E-10 __________________________________________________________ Example Training Guidance the end of the quarter. (1) Conduct area defense. (2) Conduct an attack. c. During this period, I want to emphasize the following: (1) Gunnery and Task Force FTX Period. This is the task force commanders' opportunity to conduct intensive task force and team training. Task forces will rotate between executing gunnery, and field training events. The order of rotation (starting with gunnery) will be 1-3 Armor, TF 1-77, and TF 1-2. UCOFT training will be intensively planned and managed to improve our gunnery. Brief me on your plans at the QTB. (2) Brigade CPX. The brigade and battalion command posts will deploy to the field to practice the two METL tasks, discussed above. The basis for the CPX scenario is our wartime OPLAN. The CPX will be supported by the Fort Riley’s simulation center. (3) Training Execution. I still see frequent examples of well-planned training being executed poorly. Give your trainers time to prepare training and provide feedback. Leaders—train the trainer! Ensure rehearsals are planned and conducted. Leaders must be involved in the execution of training. (4) Maintenance Training. Our vehicles and systems will be used extensively next quarter. Ensure all services are current and required services are scheduled and conducted in accordance with the training schedule. Emphasize maintenance training while at gunnery and in the field. d. A reminder—the brigade is not training to win at the NTC. We are training for war, and the NTC provides us the most realistic challenge short of war to assess the effectiveness of our training programs. 6. Quarterly Training Briefs. The battalion and company QTBs will be conducted as shown on the BCT training calendars. Battalions, task forces, companies, and teams will brief according to their wartime organization (for example, A Co, 1-2 Armor, briefs with other units of TF 1-77). Each company will have 30 minutes to brief. In addition to the normal required topics, I want to hear your plans for maintenance training and driver training programs. 7. Risk Management. Our business is demanding, complex, and inherently dangerous. Accordingly, our training for combat operations must be realistic, tough, and instill the skills and judgment required to perform successful combat operations. Managing risk requires educated judgment and professional competence. The risk management process enables commanders, leaders, and soldiers to make informed, conscious decisions to understand, control, and accept risks at acceptable levels. Leaders and soldiers, who understand risk and how to manage it, instill confidence and discipline in themselves and their organizations to prevail in a hazardous operational environment. Brigade leaders and soldiers at all levels will use risk management in planning and conducting training and exercise operations. E-11 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ 8. A final reminder, I want you to think, assess, plan, prepare, and execute training as a task force: work on your habitual associations. Train as if we were going to deploy tomorrow.

To provide training guidance for the 1st Bn, 77th Inf, for 2nd quarter, FY XX. 3. Training Assessment. a. I am very proud of the battalion's performance last quarter. The company EXEVALs were dynamic and productive. Proficiency improved on several METL tasks. However, we still need to improve our ability to execute several collective and soldier tasks. Following is my assessment of the battalion's METL proficiency: • Move by Road/Rail to APOE/SPOE P • Perform Tactical Road March P • Occupy Assembly Area P • Conduct an area defense P • Move Tactically T • Conduct an Attack T • Assault P b. The command sergeant major has assessed the following soldier tasks as "P" and need emphasis during the next quarter: • Treat and Evacuate Casualties. • Enter/Clear Trench Line. • Knock Out a Bunker. • Move as a Fire Team Member. • Engage Targets with an M16A2. • Construct Fighting Position (M203, M249 SAW, M60). • Designate Alternate and Supplemental Positions. E-15 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ c. I noticed great improvement in the soldier tasks assessed as "P" last quarter. Our NCO leaders have trained our soldiers well. However, some soldiers are still weak in the area of defensive and counterattack tasks. We need to show improvement in these tasks as we prepare for the NTC. We will emphasize constructing fighting positions this quarter. d. Our medics did extremely well in the EFMB last month. We must continue to draw upon the expertise of these soldiers during our preparation for the NTC. Our battalion will execute a mass casualty exercise to refine our SOP and evaluate the AXP concept with the 1st FSB. e. The battalion's effort during the red cycle was outstanding. All unit taskings and support requirements were filled. Dynamic management by the staff, CSM, and 1SGs freed up some unexpected training time for planned individual and small unit training. 4. Combined Arms Training. Cross attachment of A Co, 1-2 Armor, during the battalion FTX will provide an excellent opportunity for us to work as a combined arms team. The S3 has done an excellent job coordinating the calendar with supporting elements of the task force to integrate them into our collective and leader training. Additionally, A Company will have the opportunity to work with 1-2 Armor Battalion. I expect all commanders to use imagination and innovation to integrate the support elements into all training events. During battalion training meetings, I want you to show me how you are training as a team. 5. Training. a. The 2nd quarter is an all-out training effort for the battalion. We are not tasked with post support until after we return from the NTC. The quarter is jam-packed with outstanding collective training opportunities. I expect maximum effort at all echelons to use this training period effectively. The training highlights for the quarter follow: • 03 Jan - 05 Jan: Div TEWT (battalion and higher commanders and staff only). • 06 Jan - 09 Jan: BCT and battalion TEWTs. • 09 Jan – 20 Jan: Mortar Plt and CO Mortar Section LFX • 11 Jan – 30 Jan: Gunnery. • 29 Jan - 02 Feb: Bde CIP. • 17 Feb: Battalion QTBs. • 21 Feb – 23 Feb: Individual Weapons Qualification. • 28 Feb: Division Radio Net Training. • 28 Feb – 29 Feb: MSE Training. • 15 Mar – 18 Mar: BCT CPX. • 18 Mar – 28 Mar: Support to 2nd BCT TF EXEVAL. b. We will focus our training efforts on the following METL tasks, that I have assessed as "P": • Perform Tactical Road March. • Occupy Assembly Area. E-16 __________________________________________________________ Example Training Guidance • Conduct an Area Defense. • Assault. Additionally, we will train to sustain the Attack/Counterattack by Fire task. c. Gunnery. Our semiannual gunnery training is scheduled 11 through 30 January. Companies will be firing through tables XII. We will maximize the use of the UCOFT in accordance with the schedule published by the S3. Training must be well planned and properly coordinated to get maximum benefit from the UCOFT. d. TF FTX Periods. Companies will have the opportunity to conduct soldier and collective training on tasks that are assessed as substandard. Time will be allocated to conduct pre-combat checks, rehearsals, and retraining on tasks not trained to standard. e. Brigade CPX. This will provide the battalion staff and commanders the opportunity to train essential command and control tasks prior to the TF FTX. During this period, companies will have the opportunity to train essential collective and soldier tasks that require emphasis. 6. Quarterly Training Briefs. The QTB locked in all the training resources for the upcoming quarter. Company commanders QTBs for the third quarter will be conducted 17 February. Commanders will brief as company teams and must show how they integrate the support elements and maintenance training programs. The S3 has the details on when the support elements will be available. I specifically want each company training plan to be based on the commander’s assessment of the company METL. 7. Training Evaluation and Assessment. All training will be evaluated according to Army standard. AARs will be conducted throughout all training events, and upon completion of training. All AARs must highlight what is to be sustained and what needs to be improved. While conducting our AARs be alert to those issues that should be shared with the rest of the division. By sharing information or knowledge about what works and what does not work based on their training experience, soldiers and leaders can positively influence the learning of other soldiers and sister units. Finally, commanders must assess their units to determine overall proficiency. 8. Risk Management. Our training must be tough, realistic, and instill the skills and judgment required to be successful in combat. However, there is an inherent danger associated with what we do. Risk management supports tough, realistic, challenging training, but managing that risk requires educated judgment and professional competence. Leaders and soldiers at all levels will use risk management in planning and conducting training. 9. Our greatest responsibility in peacetime is to conduct safe, realistic training. Well- thought-out and well-planned training events will identify and strengthen our weaknesses and sustain our strengths.

The quarterly training briefing (QTB), which is used by active component (AC) units, and the yearly training briefing (YTB), which is used by reserve component (RC) units, are conferences on training conducted by senior commanders and battalion commanders. They are integral to the short-range training planning process described in chapter 4. The briefings allow for battalion and company commanders to discuss training concepts, philosophies, and challenges with the division and brigade commanders, respectively. This appendix provides slides, as examples only, for presenting briefing information. The exact format and content necessarily varies from command to command. F-2. The QTB and YTB produce a contract between the senior commander and the subordinate commander. In accordance with this contract, the senior commander agrees to provide resources, including time, and to protect the subordinate unit from unprogrammed taskings. Commanders must establish a command climate that protects prime time training from any interference. Commanders must enforce and protect the time allocated for training. The subordinate commander agrees to execute the approved training plan and conduct training to standard. F-3. The brigade and battalion long-range calendars should be posted in the meeting room for commanders to use as a reference throughout the briefing. F-4. Figures F-1 through F-22 show example slides that might be used in a training briefing that concludes in an agreement on the upcoming quarter’s training for AC units and year’s training for RC units. The most important aspects of the briefing are as follows: Describes the linkage between the METL, unit assessment, and upcoming quarter/year’s training. Describes the linkage between soldier training and the collective tasks to be trained. Shares lessons learned. Explains training distracters that may conflict with projected training.

Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity. General George Patton Jr. INTRODUCTION G-1. Training support is an essential element of Army training. It enables realistic and challenging battle focused training in all domains— institutional, operational, and self-development—by helping commanders create the proper conditions for training. G-2. The Training Support System (TSS) is a system of systems that provides products to assist the commander. The TSS includes training information infrastructures (TII); training aids, devices, simulators, and simulations (TADSS); training products; training services; and training facilities. Additionally, TSS provides a “reach-back” capability to the proponent schoolhouse that further expands training support to the commander. G-3. Commanders strive to make battle focused training realistic and challenging by using the integrated TSS to facilitate an operationally relevant training environment anytime, anywhere. Effective training support is integrated into each phase of the Army Training Management Cycle to help commanders create the optimum conditions for training. G-4. This appendix provides examples of the kinds of training support available to commanders to support their training mission at home station or when deployed. A training support center (TSC) is normally established, and collocated with deployed units, to ensure that continued training support and reach-back capability. PLANNING G-5. At the beginning of the training planning phase, commanders should establish contact with their home station or MACOM TSCs for coordination and support throughout the entire training cycle. Support Centers provide institutional knowledge of TSS, including linkage to Federal, DOD, Army-wide, industrial, and commercial support. G-6. Commanders plan and develop a training strategy to train individual, collective, and leader tasks in live-virtual-constructive (L-V-C) environments. Virtual-constructive training support products are used to supplement, enhance, and complement preparation for live training exercises and to sustain proficiency. Additionally, training support products enhance progression of the unit training strategy through crawl- walk-run training. Figure G-1 provides a sample listing of training support products and services. G-1 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Training Support Products and Services Note: A complete listing of these products and services is included in DA PAM 350-9, which is available online at: http://www.usapa.army.mil/pdffiles/p350_9x.pdf OFFICIAL DEPARTMENTAL PUBLICATIONS: Administrative Publications Drills Field Manuals (FM) Army Training and Evaluation Program Mission Training Plans (ARTEP-MTPs) Soldier Training Publications (STP) Technical Manuals (TM) Training Circulars (TC) INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE TRAINING SUPPORT MATERIALS: Battalion EXEVAL Career Model Combined Arms Training Strategy (CATS) Correspondence Courses Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI) Courseware Graphic Training Aids (GTA) Job Books Television Tapes (TVT) Training Support Packages TRAINING AIDS, DEVICES, SIMULATORS & SIMULATION (TADSS): A complete listing is included in DA PAM 350-9, which is available online at: http://www.usapa.army.mil/pdffiles/p350_9x.pdf FACILITIES: Ranges, Targets, Classrooms, Distributed Learning Facilities, Battle Simulation Facilities, Impact and Maneuver Areas SERVICES: Design and develop unit training and AAR briefing products. Design and produce unit specific training aids and devices. Figure G-1. Training Support System Products and Services G-7. As commanders examine their training strategy to determine who, what, when, and where to train, they determine what training support will be required. They consider the allocation of ranges for weapons qualification, gunnery, and other live fires; training areas for live engagement simulation exercises; simulators to support various levels of training exercises; simulations—both constructive and virtual—for staff and collective training; and training ammunition requirements for weapons training. Unit planning includes time and personnel required to execute accountability, maintenance and turn-in of specified training G-2 ___________________________________________________________ Training Support System (TSS) support products and facilities during the recovery from training. All these services, products, and facilities are considered part of the TSS. The broad scope of TSS is illustrated by the diversity of just one of its subsystems—TADSS. Figure G-2 provides a sample listing of TADSS commonly available. Figure G-2. Training Aids, Devices, Simulators, and Simulations (TADSS) Examples EXECUTION G-8. Transition from planning to execution includes confirmation of scheduled facilities, products, and services. This is also an opportunity for commanders to identify and acquire material not previously identified in the planning phase and to check all unit and training support material, including testing for fidelity, reliability, and availability. Planning, pre- execution checks, and recovery from training for training support items is an integral part of the weekly training meeting. ASSESSMENT G-9. The TSS provides resources such as T&EOs, and feedback tools in V-C training support products, that enable commanders to plan, prepare, and execute effective training assessments. These tools support development of evaluation plans by providing documentation to gather feedback on the performance of individual and collective training. INDIVIDUAL SELF-DEVELOPMENT G-10. Individual self-development, both structured and informal, is generally an extension of the proponent school, but can extend to local or extension colleges and universities. Leaders and subordinates share the responsibility for establishing individual self-development plans. G-3 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Proponent schools and the TSS develop self-development products, infrastructures, and tools that bridge and supplement institutional and operational experiences. Access to self-development products and registration for courses are provided through the Army Knowledge Online (AKO). This access also provides the mechanism for on-site and/or distributed learning, and grading. SUMMARY G-11. Effective use of the TSS can help commanders ensure that battle focused training is realistic and challenging. Training support should be considered and utilized in each phase of the Army Training Management Cycle to assist commanders in creating the proper conditions for training. G-4 Appendix H Risk Management The best form of soldier protection, if we are required to fight, is prior training conducted to the prescribed standards. Simply stated, if we accomplish our training requirements right, when needed, we will inflict more damage on the enemy than he can withstand, and subsequently the fighting will stop. SMA Julius W. Gates OVERVIEW H-1. This appendix describes how risk management is integrated into the Army Training Management Cycle and training planning. FM 100-14 provides the doctrinal framework for risk management and provides detailed guidance on the application of risk management across the wide range of Army operations. RISK MANAGEMENT AND TRAINING H-2. Army operations are demanding, complex, and inherently dangerous. Training must be tough and realistic, and must instill the skills and judgment required to perform successful military operations. Managing risk requires educated judgment and professional competence. The risk management process enables commanders, leaders, and soldiers to make informed, conscious decisions to understand, control, and accept risks at acceptable levels. H-3. Risk management identifies, assesses, and controls risks arising from operational factors and makes decisions to balance risk costs with mission benefits. All leaders and soldiers use risk management. The fundamental purpose of risk management is to enhance mission success by conserving combat power and resources. Leaders and soldiers, who understand risk and how to manage it, instill confidence and discipline in themselves and their organizations to prevail in a hazardous operational environment. Risk management enables tough, realistic, challenging training. It ensures inherent risks are clearly recognized and mitigated to ensure that battle focused training is achieved. H-4. Risk management is a continuous process, and it is integrated into each training event. Risk management is incorporated into training assessments, training plans, and training execution. H-5. Protection assessment identifies unit risk management strengths and weaknesses in relation to METL, BOS, and METT-TC. Based upon this assessment, the commander provides risk guidance that includes risk management goals, objectives, and priority actions that ensure the training risk is within acceptable levels of the unit training objectives. The commander’s guidance is then incorporated in long-range and short- range plans and near-term actions. During training execution, risk is H-1 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ managed through controls and procedures that ensure training is battle focused and realistic. A risk management performance assessment is performed after training is completed to determine how well unit or individual performance met risk guidance goals and objectives. This assessment results in feedback that provides a basis for updating unit SOPs, conducting further training, developing new procedures, or modifying the commander’s risk guidance. RISK MANAGEMENT PLANNING PROCESS H-6. The risk management process parallels the training planning process and is integrated throughout, as shown in figure H-1. It involves: identifying and assessing hazards, developing controls and making decisions, implementing controls, and supervising and evaluating training. The risk planning process is continuous and performed for long-, short-, and near-term training. Figure H-1. Integration of Risk Management and Training Planning Processes RISK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES H-7. The basic principles that provide a framework for implementing risk management are— H-8. Integrate risk management into training planning, preparation, and execution. Leaders and staffs continuously identify hazards and assess both accident and tactical risks. They then develop and coordinate control measures and evaluate the level of residual risk and impact on training. Control measures are integrated into training plans. Commanders assess the risks and the measures taken to control them. H-2 __________________________________________________________________ Risk Management Commanders then approve the risk control measures and leaders ensure that all soldiers understand and properly adhere to these controls. H-9. Make risk decisions at the appropriate level in the chain of command. The commander addresses risk guidance in the commander’s training guidance. The commander bases the risk guidance on the higher commander’s guidance, on doctrine, and on his or her own professional judgment of how the training should be executed. The guidance includes how much risk is acceptable and the level to which a risk decision is delegated. H-10. Accept no unnecessary risk. Commanders recognize that risk cannot be eliminated and that risk must not become a barrier to conducting tough, realistic training. Commanders compare and balance risks against training expectations and accept risk when the benefits outweigh the potential costs or losses.

guidance YTP yearly training plan SECTION II: TERMS active component (AC): That portion of the U.S. Army in which organizations are comprised of personnel on full time duty in the active military service of the United States. after action review (AAR): A method of providing feedback to units by involving participants in the training diagnostic process in order to increase and reinforce learning. The AAR leader guides participants in identifying deficiencies and seeking solutions. Air Defense Battlefield Operating System: Air Defense protects the force from air and missile attack and aerial surveillance. The weapons of mass destruction threat and proliferation of missile technology increase the importance of the air defense system. annual training (AT): The minimal period of annual active duty training a member performs to satisfy the annual training requirements associated with a Reserve Component assignment. It may be performed during one consecutive period or in increments of one or more days depending upon mission requirements. Army culture: The Army Culture is the Army’s shared set of beliefs, values, and assumptions about what is important. Army service ethic: The Army Service Ethic is commitment to serve honorably the Nation, the Army, its soldiers, and their families above self. This commitment is expressed by the willingness to perform one’s duty at all times and to subordinate personal welfare for the welfare of others, without the expectation of reward or recognition. The Army is equally committed to providing values-based leadership and well being of soldiers and their families. Army Training and Evaluation Program (ARTEP): The cornerstone of unit training. It is the umbrella program to be used by the trainer and training manager in the training evaluation of units. The ARTEP is a complete program enabling commanders to evaluate and develop collective training based on unit weaknesses, then train the unit to overcome those weaknesses and reevaluate. Success on the battlefield depends on the coordinated performance of collective and individual skills that are taught through the ARTEP-MTP. Army Training Management Cycle: The cyclic process of managing and executing training used by Army leaders to identify training requirements and sequentially plan, resource, execute, and evaluate training. Glossary-12 ________________________________________________________________________Glossary Army Universal Task List (AUTL): The AUTL is a comprehensive listing of Army tactical-level tasks, missions, and operations. The AUTL complements CJCSM 3500.04B, the Universal Joint Task List, by providing tactical-level Army-specific tasks. assessment: Assessment is the commander’s responsibility. It is the commander’s judgment of the organization’s ability to accomplish its wartime operational mission. Associate AC: Chain of command: The AC/RC Association Program establishes formal linkages between select RC units and an AC MTOE and TDA organization. Band of Excellence: The range of proficiency within which a unit is capable of executing its critical wartime tasks, with minimal refresher training, using appropriate repetitions of critical task training. battle focus: A concept used to derive peacetime training requirements from assigned and anticipated missions. battle roster: A listing of individuals, crews, or elements that reflect capabilities, proficiencies in critical tasks, or other information concerning warfighting abilities. battle task: A task that must be accomplished by a subordinate organization if the next higher organization is to accomplish a mission essential task. The senior commander selects battle tasks from the subordinate organizations' METL. Brigade Command Battle Staff Training Program (BCBST): This is a Title XI program that provides Enhanced, Divisional, and Strategic Brigades of the Army National Guard the opportunity to sharpen the battle command and battle staff skills. BCBST Program centers on a unit rotation consisting of two major training events: a Battle Command Seminar and a Brigade Warfighter Exercise (BWFX). battlefield operating systems (BOS): Seven groups of systems that are related by battlefield use or function. The seven BOS are: intelligence, maneuver, fire support, air defense, mobility/countermobility/survivability, combat service support, and command and control. certification: This is a measure of individual technical proficiency. It may also be used to confirm a unit’s collective training proficiency to perform a specific mission or task. Certification requirements are normally specified in Army or MACOM regulations. Combined Arms Training Strategy (CATS): The Army’s overarching strategy for current and future training of the force. It establishes unit, soldier, and leader training requirements and describes how the Army will train and sustain the Army standard in the institution, units, and through self-development. The CATS also identifies and quantifies the training resources required to execute training (AR 350-1) close combat tactical trainer (CCTT): A virtual simulator trainer that trains tank and mechanized infantry units from platoon to battalion task force including cavalry scout platoons and heavy cavalry troops on ARTEP-MTP collective tasks. Combat Service Support Battlefield Operating System: Provides the physical means with which forces operate, from the production base and replacement centers in the continental U.S. to soldiers engaged in close combat. CSS includes many technical specialties and functional activities. It includes maximizing the use of host nation infrastructure(s) and contracted support. Glossary-13 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ Combat Training Center Program: An Army program established to provide realistic joint service and combined arms training in accordance with Army doctrine. It is designed to provide training units opportunities to increase collective proficiency on the most realistic battlefield available during peacetime. The four components of the CTC Program are the— (1) National Training Center (NTC). (2) Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC). (3) Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC). (4) Battle Command Training Program (BCTP). combined arms live fire exercises (CALFEX): High-cost, resource intensive exercises in which player units move or maneuver and employ organic and supporting weapon systems using full- service ammunition with attendant integration of all CA, CS, and CSS functions. combined arms and services training: Collective training that is jointly conducted by associated combat, combat support, and combat service support units. combined training exercise (CTX): A multinational training event undertaken to enhance United States security interests. The exercise is designed to train and evaluate U.S. Forces interoperability with participating Allied nations. The exercise involves planning, preparation, and execution of military maneuvers or simulated wartime and other contingency operations among U.S. and other participating Allied nations. Command and Control (C2) Battlefield Operating System: Command and control has two components—the commander and the C2 system. The C2 system supports the commander’s ability to make informed decisions, delegate authority, and synchronize the BOS. Moreover, the C2 system supports commanders’ ability to adjust plans for future operations, even while focusing on current operations. Staffs work within the commander’s intent to direct units and control resource allocations. Through C2, commanders initiate and integrate all BOS toward a common goal—mission accomplishment. command field exercise (CFX): A field training exercise with reduced troop and vehicle density, but with full command and control and CSS units. command post exercise (CPX): An exercise in which the forces are simulated and may be conducted from garrison locations or in between participating headquarters. command training guidance (CTG): The long-range planning document published by division and brigades (or equivalents) in the Active and Reserve Components to prescribe future training and related activities. commander/leader assessment: Commanders assessments are subjective in nature and use all available evaluation data and subunit leader input to develop an assessment of the organization’s overall capability to accomplish the task. Commanders use the following ratings: (1) T—Trained. The unit is trained and has demonstrated its proficiency in accomplishing the task to wartime standards. (2) P—Needs practice. The unit needs to practice the task. Performance has demonstrated that the unit does not achieve the standard without some difficulty or has failed to perform some task steps to standard. (3) U—Untrained. The unit cannot demonstrate an ability to achieve wartime proficiency. commander’s intent: A clear, concise statement of what the force must do and the conditions the force must meet to succeed with respect to the enemy, terrain, and the desired end state. Glossary-14 ________________________________________________________________________Glossary competency: A set of knowledge, skills and abilities that impacts leader behavior and performance. condition(s): The circumstances and environment in which a task is to be performed. crawl-walk-run: An objective, incremental, standards-based approach to training. Tasks are initially trained at a very basic level in the crawl stage. Training becomes increasingly difficult in the walk stage. Training approaches the level of realism expected in combat during the run stage. deployment exercise (DEPEX): An exercise that provides training for individual soldiers, units, and support agencies in the tasks and procedures for deploying from home stations or installations to potential areas of hostilities. directed mission: Mission other than the assigned wartime operational mission. Directed missions may range from major combat operations to providing humanitarian assistance or other types of stability or support operations and may include a combination of both. discovery learning: Process that provides opportunity for input and feedback to identify systemic problems and share insights that offer effective solutions. distributed learning: The delivery of standardized individual, collective, and self-development training to soldiers, civilians, units, and organizations at the right place and time through the use of multiple means and technology. Distributed learning may involve student-instructor interaction in real time and non-real time. It may also involve self-paced student instruction without benefit of access to an instructor. (AR 350-1) doctrine: Concise expression of how Army forces contribute to unified action in campaigns, major operations, battles and engagements; describes the Army’s approach and contributions to full spectrum operations on land; authoritative but requires judgment in it’s application; rooted in time-tested principles but is adaptable to changing technologies, threats and missions; detailed enough to guide operations, yet flexible enough to allow commanders to exercise initiative within the specific tactical and operational situation; to be useful, doctrine must be well know and commonly understood. education: Instruction with increased knowledge, skill, and/or experience as the desire outcome for the student. This is in contrast to Training, where a task or performance basis is used and specific conditions and standards are used to assess individual and unit proficiency. (AR 350-1) effects coordinator (ECOORD): The field artillery battalion commander serves as the SBCT effects coordinator (ECOORD). He is responsible for all fires and effects planning and coordination for the SBCT. He advises the SBCT commander on the capabilities and employment of fires and effects and is responsible for obtaining the commander’s guidance for desired effects and their purpose. The ECOORD is part of the command group and locates where he can best execute the SBCT commander’s intent for fires and effects. enduring combat capabilities: The unique contribution each unit makes to ensure the Army successfully accomplishes any mission, anytime, anywhere. engineer coordinator (ENCOORD): The engineer coordinator is the special staff officer for coordinating engineer assets and operations for the command. The ENCOORD is usually the senior engineer officer in the force. exercise operating procedures (ExOP): training safety and engagement rules and procedures. field training exercise (FTX): An exercise conducted under simulated combat conditions in the field. It exercises command and control of all echelons in battle functions against actual or simulated opposing forces. Glossary-15 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ fire coordination exercise (FCX): An exercise that can be conducted at platoon, company/team, or battalion/task force level. It exercises command and control skills through the integration of all organic weapon systems, as well as indirect and supporting fires. Weapon densities may be reduced for participating units, and sub-caliber devices substituted for service ammunition. Fire Support Battlefield Operating System: Fire support consists of fires that directly support land, maritime, amphibious, and special operations forces in engaging enemy forces, combat formations and facilities in pursuit of tactical and operational objectives. Fire support integrates and synchronizes fires and effects to delay, disrupt, or destroy enemy forces, systems, and facilities. The fire support system includes the collective and coordinated use of target acquisition data, indirect fire weapons, fixed-winged aircraft, electronic warfare, and other lethal and non-lethal means to attack targets. fire support coordinator (FSCOORD): The fire support coordinator is the special staff officer for coordinating fire support and field artillery assets and operations in the command. The FSCOORD is the senior field artillery officer in the force. force integration: The process of incorporating new doctrine, equipment, and force structure into an organization while simultaneously sustaining the highest possible levels of combat readiness. Green-Amber-Red: See time management system. inactive duty training (IDT): Authorized training performed by an RC member not on active duty or active duty for training, and consisting of regularly scheduled unit training assemblies, additional training assemblies, or equivalent training periods. initial military training (IMT): Training presented to new enlistees with no prior military service. It is designed to produce disciplined, motivated, physically fit soldiers ready to take their place in the Army in the field. This training consists of BCT, AIT, OSUT, and pre-basic training courses. institutional training: Training, either individual or collective, that takes place in Army service schools, Army training centers, or other total Army school system locations. Intelligence Battlefield Operating System: System plans, directs, collects, processes, produces, and disseminates intelligence on the threat and the environment; performs intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB) and other intelligence tasks. Developed as a part of a continuous process and is fundamental to Army operations. intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB): A systematic approach to analyzing the enemy, weather, and terrain in a specific geographic area. It integrates enemy doctrine with the weather and terrain as they relate to the mission and the specific battlefield environment. This is done to determine and evaluate enemy capabilities, vulnerabilities, and probable courses of actions. interagency coordination: Within the context of Department of Defense (DOD) involvement, the coordination that occurs between elements of DOD, and engaged U.S. Government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and regional and international organizations for the purpose of accomplishing an objective. JANUS: An interactive, entity-level, multi-sided, tactical-through-brigade-level simulation used to train junior leaders and to provide staff training. joint mission essential task list (JMETL): A list of joint tasks considered essential to the accomplishment of an assigned or anticipated mission. leader development: is the deliberate, continuous, sequential and progressive process, grounded in Army values that grow soldiers and civilians into competent, confident and adaptive leaders capable of decisive action. Leader development is achieved through the life-long synthesis of the Glossary-16 ________________________________________________________________________Glossary knowledge, skills, and experiences gained through the developmental domains of institutional training and education, operational assignments, and self-development. leader training: Leader training is the expansion of basic soldier skills that qualifies soldiers to lead other soldiers. leadership: Leadership is influencing people—by providing purpose, direction, and motivation— while operating to accomplish the mission and improving the organization. Level I threat: A small enemy force that can be defeated by CS and CSS units operating in the rear or by the perimeter defenses established by friendly bases or perimeters. Level II threat: Enemy activities that can be defeated by a base or base cluster augmented by a responsive force. Level III threat: A threat beyond the defensive capability of both the base and base cluster and any local reserve or responsible force. live, virtual, constructive (L-V-C): Training environments involving use of simulations and simulators provide repetitive, iterative, intense, commander/leader, staff, unit and soldier experiences required to achieve and sustain proficiency on critical wartime tasks. The three training environments are— (1) Live. Training executed in field conditions using tactical equipment, enhanced by training aids, devices, simulators, and simulations (TADSS) and Tactical Engagement Simulation (TES) to simulate combat conditions. (2) Virtual. Training executed using computer-generated battlefields in simulators with approximate physical layout of tactical weapons systems and vehicles. Virtual TES training permits units to maneuver over much larger areas. (3) Constructive. The use of computer models and simulations to exercise the command and staff functions of units from platoons through echelons above corps. logistics exercise (LOGEX): Training exercise that concentrates on training tasks associated with the combat service support battlefield operating system. map exercise (MAPEX): A training exercise that portrays military situations on maps and overlays that may be supplemented with terrain models and sand tables. It enables commanders to train their staffs in performing essential integrating and control functions under simulated wartime conditions. mentorship: Mentorship refers to the voluntary developmental relationship that exists between a person of greater experience and a person of lesser experience. methods of presentation: The three methods of presenting training are— (1) Demonstration: The preferred method of presentation used at company level and below. Demonstrations accelerate the learning process. The impact of a brief visual demonstration showing the correct method of execution of a given task to standard. A rock drill is an example of a demonstration. (2) Conference: A trainer initiated and guided discussion. Conferences are most effective when soldiers are familiar with the subject, when there is more than one correct technique or solution, and when time is not critical. Conferences normally do not require hands-on performance. An example of a conference is an AAR. (3) Lecture: This method presents information with little discussion other than a question and answer period at the end of the training. Lectures are used when time is limited, when soldiers know little about the subject, and when the lecture is preparing them for demonstration and practice. Lectures are only appropriate if there is a large Glossary-17 FM 7-1 (FM 25-101) __________________________________________________________________ group to be trained. An example of a lecture is a pre-deployment briefing. Lectures are the least preferred method of training. military operations other than war (MOOTW): Operations that encompass the use military capabilities across the range of military operations short of war. These military actions can be applied to complement any combination of the other instruments of national power and occur before, during, and after war. mission: The commander’s expression of what the unit must accomplish and for what purpose. The primary task assigned to an individual, unit, or force. mission command: The conduct of military operations through decentralized execution based upon mission orders for effective mission accomplishment.
