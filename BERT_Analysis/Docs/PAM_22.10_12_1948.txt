SECTION I
RESPONSIBILITIES AND REQUIREMENTS OF
LEADERSHIP
What Is Leadership?
Leadership is the art of influencing human behavior. Put into
everyday words, it is the ability to handle men. It has been said that
leaders are born, not made; that leadership is intangible. These are,
at best, half truths. Leaders are born. Leaders are also made.
Leadership is intangible, but only to the extent that we make it so. •
It is one of the most definite characteristics in any man's life. In civil
life, it means success; in Army life, it means success, too-winning
battles, accomplishing the mission. The lack of it in civil life means
mediocrity. The lack of it in the Army means, in combat, getting
men killed unnecessarily and, in peace or war, failure.
Acquaintance with the elements of leadership can be a..cquired by
any reasonably intelligent and forceful individual, no matter how
inexperienced he may be. Any man with a reasonable amount of
intelligence and a little initiative can study, practice, and learn the
elements of leadership just as he can study, practice, and learn any
other human accomplishment. The man who tries with all his intelligence and energy, who profits from his mistakes, can learn faster.

Obj~ctives of Pamphlet
The objectives in preparing this pamphlet have been toProvide the reader with an introduction to leadership and a
knowledge of the responsibilities and duties of a military leader.
Present the qualities of intelligent leadership, their development,
and how they are best applied.
Show the results of effective military leadership-morale, discipline, and esprit de corps-and how these are attained and maintained.
.
Give the reader a yardstick for measuring the success of military
leadership.

Responsibilities of Leadership
The responsibilities of the military leader are twofold-the accomplishment of his mission and his duty to his men. No leader is fully
prepared for his job until he clearly understands. the dual nature of
1

his responsibilities and the underlying reasons for and importance of
their dual nature. Some seek to enjoy and expand the privileges and
prerogatives which go with rank without accepting its duties and
responsibilities. Such an attitude comes, most often, from inexperience and lack of knowledge of those duties and responsibilities. Privileges and prerogatives are given a leader to help him do his job, and
not to ex~lt his ego.
· '\
The primary responsibility'l,f the military leader is the accomplishment of the mission assigned him. Get the job done. Obviously,
everything else in the military service, even the welfare of the men,
must be subordinated to this. No individual-officer, noncommissioned officer, or private soldier-is prepared to undertake his assigned
duties until he understands the mission and the part he is to play in
accomplishing it. Orientation of all individuals in what is to be done
and the part each is to play in accomplishing it is a constantly
• recurring obligation of leadership. Here is the leaq~•-~ first dutythe briefing, instructing, and training of his men to the end that the
mission is accomplished.
The welfare of his men is a leader's second most important responsibility because of its effect on their morale and their consequent ability
to accomplish the mission. To summarize some of the main points,
all commanders must develop a sincere interest in everything affecting
their meri; their messes, clothing, equipment, sanitation, health,
recreation, entertainment, and personal problems. It is vitally
important that commanders give much more than lip service to these
·
things, and for two reasons:
First, active, sincere, and continuous interest promotes morale
and spirit within an organization, and morale and spirit are necessary
to the successful accomplishment of any military mission.
Second, because of the conditions inherent and necessary in the
military service, a soldier can do little to improve his own lot if his
leaders neglect him. In civil life, if dissatisfied, a man can quit his job
and take another. He can change his boarding house when the meals
are unpalatable, buy clothing to his liking, change his doctor, his
room and his entertainment to suit his tastes and his pocketbook.
He can take time off to seek advice and settle his personal problems.
A soldier can do none of these things. He is almost absolutely dependent upon his leaders. Therefore, his officers and noncommissioned
officers are in honor bound to do for him .the things he cannot do
for himself.
In the mess, food must be well prepared under the most sanitary
conditions, attractively served, and fairly apportioned, special effort
being made to insure that the men get the best that is possible, even
under adverse conditions. The preparation and storing of food, the
health and cleanliness of kitchen workers, the control of flies, the disposal of wastes, and the cleaning of utensils and other equipment are

2

'\..•.
\

matters which must be given close daily superv1s10n by the unit
commander. Officers should eat frequently at the unit mess.
When called upon to send men to food service schools, many officers
make the error of selecting those who have· be€n failures in other
assigned tasks. The chances then of their becoming assets to the
mess are very remote. A unit mess is so i!]U)ortant that only the best
men should be sent to these schools./ The commander then can
expect his cooks-and mess steward to be'assets to his mess and demon.
strate such qualities as imagination and ini.tiative. The Quartermaster Corps· provides the best quality foods, but slovenly, mediocre
cooks with no imagination,.or interest in their work will not turn out
palatable, attractive, well prepared, and varied meals.
Aside from detailing incompetents as cooks, the widespread
practice of serving "early chow" has done much to cause the quality,
attractiveness, and palatability of meals to deteriorate. With• "earlv
chow" for dirmer"~et, for example, at 1100, the mess steward will pla~
to have dinner ready at 1100. He, his cooks, and the relatively few
men who are told to eat early chow will get a hot meal. By 1200 the
bulk of the unit is served food which has been drying out in the oven
or on the back of the stove for an hour. It is far better to serve "late
chow", dried out and warmed over, to a few men, than to serve
toughened and unpalatable food day after day to almost the entire unit.
Clothing in the amount authorized for the men must be obtained
promptly, and unserviceable clothing and equipment salvaged and
replaced with equal promptness. The unit commander must devote
close attention to the fitting of clothing and not leave this important
morale factor up to a possibly careless or lazy supply sergeant. Great
emphasis is and should be placed on soldiers appearing well dressed,
but there is little they can do about it if their officers permit substitutes for their proper sizes to be thrown at them.
All military units liave a definite organization with squads, sections,
or platoons under officers and noncommissioned officers. These
subordinate elements are not solely for tactical purposes but should be
used for administrative efficiency as well. The commander of a
well run unit will place the maximum supply and administrative
responsibility on squad, section, and platoon leaders. They must be
held responsible for the clothing and equipment of their men and
insure that the latter have the required amounts in serviceable
condition. By using his organization to the full in all such matters,
the unit commander simplifies his own work, that of the unit executive,
first sergeant, and supply sergeant, and at the same time, develops
initiative and a se.nse of responsibility in his junior officers and noncommissioned officers.
Care of equipment must be constantly stressed as a necessary
means of conserving national resources and Government property and
as a habit which will insure dependable functioning under battle
3

~onditions. During the war, Saturday morning inspections were
considered less important than training and were in large measure
omitted. Formal Sat~day morning inspections, when well conduc_ted,
afford unit commanders an opportunity to familiarize themselves
with the condition of the clothing and equipmePt of their men and in
their storerooms. In addition, a. thorough weekly inspection has a
definite and highly desira.bt~disciplinary and morale effect on a. unit.
Each such inspection should'be so thorough that the entire morning
is needed. Gnit inspections completed in an hour,or an hour and a
half often indicate little planning and less attention to details. Regimental and battalion commanders should p,lso inspect, taking a different unit each week.
··
A successful leader is one who can develo~spirit and momle in his
unit. Both are based mainly on pride, pn.11.e of the individual in
himseK and in his unit. Each soldier must come tq believe that he is
a fine soldier and that his unit is the best in the Uriil.ed States or any
other Army. To develop this pride, the unit commander must be a
perfectionist in his attitude toward training and all military duties.
He must not be satisfied with mediocre performance. To start with
he may have to accept it for a. brief time, but he must never be satisfied with it. Men may complain a.bout being held to high standards
of appearance, training, discipline, and duty, but once attained, they
will take pride in them and look with a. patronizing attitude at individuals and units not up to their standard. The unit commander
must practice what he preaches. He IJ?,USt always set the example.
The old statement is unquestionably true, that while it is important
for a leader to be concerned over what his superiors think of him, what
his subordinates think of him is much more important. He can shirk
a duty or set a poor example and his superiors may never know it,
but his subordinates will.
Sick rates, including venereal, a.re indications.of a. unit's efficiency.
Sanitary conditions in kitchens, mess halls, sleeping quarters, wash
rooms, latrines, and other possible sources of infection must be watched
carefully. Instruction and insistence on the development of good
health habits are highly important, especially in the field. Constant
vigilance and frequent inspections are necessary.
Wholesome recreation and entertainment, must be provided, especially that which encourages active participation, physical development, and spirit. Spirit is built on sound training, efficient leadership, and on competition. By nature, man is a competitive animal.
He likes to win, to excel. Therefore, intelligently planned competitions, athletic, administrative, and military, play a great part in
promoting spirit. Colleges develop spirit by intercollegiate athletic
competition. Units and organizations in the Army can do the same,
but unit commanders must support their teams and encourage their
officers and men to do the same. Athletics and· competitions of all
4

kinds develop to a marked degree the will to win which will carry
over onto the battlefield. War is a competition, a very dangerous
competition, but a competition none the less. Hqwever, the value of
competitions of all kinds in developing the competitive spirit is largely
lost if unit leaders engage in or condone unfai11 practices.
Every soldier should feel that at any reasonable time he can get a
sympathetic hearing from his unit commander, and the old custom
of requiring him to obtain permission from the first sergeant before
h~ may speak to the company or battery commander should never
be permitted to interfere. A soldier's problems may often seem
trivi~l to his commander, but to him they are very real and very important. By a sympathetic and helpful attitude, the organization
commander can accomplish much in developing morale and spirit,
and in binding the loyalty of the soldier to his officer, his platoon,
and his company.
Leaves must be granted freely and not grudgingly, within authorized
limits. The pass privilege should be made available to all soldiers
except when it is wi~hheld under the 104th Article of War, or when
conditions are such that the commander must withhold pass privileges
for the good of the service. To promote morale, the soldier must
understand clearly any reason why pass privileges are being withheld,
and the commander in turn must withhold pass privileges as infrequently as possible.
These are some of the responsibilities of leadership. What are the
qualities which make a man master of them? How can you develop
the qualities within yourself which will make you equal to your responsibilities? How can you apply those qualities? How can you
measure the success of their applications? This pamphlet is devoted
to a study of some answen; to these important questions.
Let us go back to our definition of leadership-the art of influencing
human behavior, the ability to handle men. Man is the fundamental
instrument in war. Other instruments may change, but he remains
relatively constant. Unless his behavior and elemental attributes
are understood and appreciated, mistakes will be made in dealing
with him. The art of the leader is concerned with the desires, the
needs, and the mental states of individuals and groups-of men as
individual soldiers and as groups in military units. · Theoretical and
abstract knowledge of psychology is not essential to leadership, although any knowledge of it will be helpful. If the leader knows and
applies certain basic principles which control human behavior, if he
grasps the fact that most men react in fixed and definite ways under
a given stimulus or influence, if he recognizes, develops, and applies
the human qualities in himself which will produce the correct reaction
in his men, he will possess the basic tool for managing men. He will
become a leader.
Some men seem t-0 understand human nature more readily than
817136°-49---2

others and have the knack of leading men by practical application of
this knowledge. Such men are called natural leaders, but they are
rare. Most men develop through hard study and use of the qualities
of leadership. . Know the basic elements of leadership, develop them
in yourself, then apply. them in your daily work. Only through application and experience can they be made completely yours.

Prerequ·;Jtes for Leadership
There are certain prerequisites for leadership which are absolutely
necessary as a foundation. Every individual in a position of military
leadership should possess these prerequisites to an effective degree.
The first of these is character. It is the keystone and the bedrock.
Your men must have absolute confidence in. your good character.
Your word must be your bond. They must 'know that you would
not, be false to honor, duty, or country under any circumstances.
The second prerequisite is inulligence. You must -possess a degree
of intelligence. You must have the saving grace of common sense.
In garrison, in training, and in combat, you must have the intelligence
to apply fundamental principles to varied situatiQns. You must be
able at once to analyze a situation; see what needs to be done; and,
without hesitation, do it without having to be told. You must have
the intelligence to absorb knowledge, master it thoroughly, and prepare it purposefully for use in training your men.
The third prerequisite is alertness. There is no place in the Army
for the leader who cannot stir himself to timely action, either physical
or mental. It is the duty of every officer or noncommissioned officer
to prepare himself physically and mentally to do the job in hand at
the proper time. Every day presents oppoi:tunities for you to acquire
knowledge and prepare your mind for the responsibilities of leadership. There can be no excuse for slackness in this matter. You
must always be alert, both mentally and physically .
. These are the three prerequisites-character, intelligence, and alertness. When you possess these, then there are certain human qualities
which you can develop within yourself which will make you a wellrounded, self-confident individual-which will, in their expression
through acts, react upon and within your men to influence their
behavior. It takes all of this to be a leader.

Knowledge
\
,

Knowledge is one of the most important qualities any military
leader can possess. You may have been associated at some time in
your life with a man who had a very unattractive personality; who
at times, may have been tactless, even unjust; but in whom you
nevertheless had confidence simply and solely because you realized
that he knew his job. The well-rounded leader must possess the other
qualities which have been mentioned, but knowledge is the starting
point. Nothing will attract confidence and respect more quickly than
demonstrated knowledge and ability. There is no substitute for
knowledge in its ability to create self-confidence within the leader
himself.
We are not referring solely to professional knowledge. In addition, he should have as much or more general knowledge, and certainly should be just as well informed as his men on national and
international events.
Lack of knowledge of your job .is a disadvantage from the very
start. Worst yet is to lack knowledge of your job and then try to
make your soldiers believe you do know your job. It will not work
with American soldiers; they will find our very quickly, and you as
their leader will suffer a loss of their confidence and faith. Admit
lack of knowledge of the subject in question, and then take steps to
acquire. the information and regain the prestige lost through faulty
preparation.
Knowledge not only gains the respect and confidence of your men
and your fellow leaders, but even more important, it is the keystone
of confidence in yourself. You •should be so well informed on professional subjects that you will be able to act automatically in almost
7

any military situation with which you might be faced in garrison or
in the field.
A leader must not only train his troops well, he must also train
himself. He must teach himself to apply his knowledge. Knowledge
should not be used as a substitute for thinking. It should be but a
springboard for thought.
How can you insure that;'~ knowledge, you are keeping abreast of
developments in your profe.lion and in the world? Each leader
should maintain a military file and a small library. He should study
field manuals and other training literature, as well as general and
reference books. Each officer should read the service journal of his
branch and other professional publications; examples are The Infantry Journal, The Field Artillery Journal, and the Military Review.
Each leader should familiarize himself with ~at is going on in the
world by reading weekly magazines and the daily .newspapers. He
should attempt to evaluate current news events impartially and correctly. Serious conversation with other leaders can never be considered as time wasted. Make a point of discussing training and
combat situations with those with wider experience.
In short, be alert, study, observe, listen, and look things up. Study
your profession and study the world about you.
In military matters the acquiring of knowledge presupposes advance
]YUrposejul preparation for every task. This preparation brings
with it the resulting power of quick and sound decision-the qualities
of decisiveness and judgment.

Decisiveness
A leader must be decisive. In expressing all orders he must be
forceful and cl~ar. '\\nen he has to reach his own conclusions, he
makes up his mind, discarding other possible decisions according to
his sense of logic-his judgment.
The man who dawdles, who keeps his men waiting in idleness, who
repeated}y .changes without sound reason the courses and methods
he has once adopted, irritates his subordinates. A spirit of grumbling
is never cau~ed in a unit by work alone. As a matter of fact, good
troops do not mind hard work once they are at it and have an idea
of its purpose. But waiting around for a leader to make up his mind
is a potent source of griping. Perhaps only one other thing is worse,
and that is when work once started is repeittedly interrupted because
of the leader's inability to form a plan and follow it through.
Even a poor plan, if executed decisively, is better than no· plan at
all. Sometimes, of course, "do nothing" may be the best decision,
but it must then be expressed as a decision and not left to appear as
the lack of one. Whatever the plhn, the decision that puts it• into
effect must be unhesitating and positive.
8

A decision must be thought out. A habit of rushing ahead blindly
merely to be doing something is stupid-a stupidity which in battle
almost always results in needless danger and loss, and in training or
garrison to confusion and incoherence. Every situation, every problem, offers a variety of solutions. The leader develops his decisiveness
and his judgment so that, given the facts, he can inake an estimate
of the situation promptly and arrive at.a logical decision.
Decisiveness is much more a matter of practice and experience than
it may seem. A man who fin<ls it hard to make decisions can usually,
by practice, build up his decisive powers. Indecision comes, probably
more often than we like to think, from lack of knowlege. The leader
who does not have the fullest grasp of his own duties, the duties of
those under him, the duties of at least the next job above him, the
technique of the means of warfare his troops employ, is likely to find
himself lacking in decisiveness. If he is not fully prepared it is up
to him to study and acquire as rapidly as he possibly can the knowledge which wi11 give him decisiveness in meeting his responsibilities.
If he feels indecision, if indecision tends in the slightest to become
habitual, then he must force himself to reach decisions-he must,
in so many words, practice decisiveness with all his energy.
No leader should neglect the opinions and suggestions of others.
Any leader who will listen to nobody is a self-opinionated fool. • But
once he has heard the ideas of others, he alone must make the decision.
In other words, he must be confident of his ability to weigh the facts
and the opinions of others. At the same time, the leader must not
turn to his assistant for advice-on every minor matter.
A new lieutenant taking command of a platoon immediately makes
a number of decisions. Sizing up the platoon sergeant he decides
what manner of man he is. He makes this decision tentative, of
course. In the usual case, the platoon sergeant knows a great deal
aoout the platoon and often may be inclined to guard jealously his
own authority. The new officer may find himself in the delicate
position where his very first decisions are so important that they need
to be tentative. An attitude of appreciation, perhaps, of the platoon
sergeant's knowledge would be the best way to start off. "You know
the whole situation and I don't. I'll need all your help in getting
hold of things as fast as I can." The lieutenant should never start
in by dictating to the sergeant all the policies of a new regime and disregarding the sergeant's experience and findings on the same jobexperience often gained the hard way. Thus the new leader, from
the very beginning, practices decision in its broad aspect as·well as
in matters of detail,
An occasional wrong decision should never deter a leader from
making up his mind with reasonable speed or lead him further into
dawdling or excessive caution. Decisiveness for the most part is
more likely to produce good results than bad. And every leader •
9

with the needed alertness and energy will sometimes make a mistake.
Judgment is the leavening quality which enables the leader to take
the knowledge he has acquired by thorough preparation and apply
it with the decisiveness he has trained himself to exercise. Judgment
is the ability to make a wise choice of a policy or action. A man has
good judgment iri proport.io11 to his ability to make correct decisions.
Not only must he have coni~ete kno'."·ledge of the_ question involved,
but also he must have a cabl and fair mental attitude. We usually
say that a man who has a reputation for exercising good judgment has
common sense. A man of common sense will usually weigh both
sides of a question calmly and quickly and arrive at a sound decision.
He is the type who is looked to for advice.
1N e all know people whom we regard ~ "flighty" or "scatterbrained." They are the ones to whom we would not look for ad vice
or guidance. They are the ones who talk before theY.' think, who pass
judgment before they have studied both sides of a case, who have no
sense of proportion, and who go off "half-cocked." Obvious1 y, such
persons are not good leaders.
How can judgment be developed? The best way, again, is to
practice exercising it. When a situation arises for some other leader
such as your company or battalion commander, to make a decision,
use that opportunity to come to a conclusion of your own. If your
decision or plan is not in agreement with what was done, reason it
through and find out why.
Broaden you own point of view by studying those of the other men.
Form the habit of considering several points of view to the little social
arguments which occur every day.
When you are considering an important problem, argue it out with
a friend, and take the opposite view from that which you considered,
on first thought, to be correct. Develop mental calmness and selfassurance by increasing your store of knowledge. Learn from t(}e
mistakes of others.
In summary, decisiveness and judgment can be developed.
Develop mental calmness, self-assurance, and self-confidence by
increasing your knowledge.
Force yourself to reach decisions; practice decisiveness with all
your energy.
Check decisions you have made to determine if they are sound.
Check decisions made by others. If you do not agree, think
why, then determine if your reasons for disagreement are sound.
Broaden your viewpoint by studying the viewpoints of others.
Take advantage of social and official conversations and discussions to develop logical thinking and clear e.\.-pressions of thought.
Learn from the mistakes of others.

10

Initiative

Initiative is the ability and willingness to originate and carry through
a thought or act. It is the direct product of self-confidence and willpower. To do well just what he is told to do, but never to initiate
anything himself, to drag along with his interest solely on receiving
his pay and on keeping out of possible trouble-these are the trials
of military deadwood, the symbols of timidity, laziness, and
mediocrity.
·
Initiative does not belong exclusively to the leader. It is essential
in all grades. The commander must foster initiative among his subordinates by giving them duties commensurate with their grade and
then letting thein work out the details and finish the job unaided. He is a
supervisor, an executive. A company commander who i·s a busybody
and who will not trust his subordinates, who handles all details of the
orderly room, the kitchen, the supply room, who is the leader of every
squad, not only narrows his own vision and ability, but also kills the
pride, spirit, ambition, and initiative of every man in his unit.
This does not mean, however, that the leader can deal out the tasks
and then do nothing else. He must know, of course, how to handle the
jobs himself certainly well enough to check their performance-and he
must make such checks. Furthermore, he must retain for himself
those functions that are exclusively the commander's.
Thus it is an utterly vital matter for every leader to develop initiative in himself and in his subordinates. There is nothing that heightens the morale of troops more than the feeling that every· one of their
leaders, from the lowest acting-corporal to the highest co~mander,
has been trained to take care of his troops in unexpected circumstances
and to act and act fast when the need for action arises·. Soldiers unite
quickly behind a leader who meets a new and unexpected situation
with prompt action. Nor should training in the use of initiative be
limited strictly to leaders. Every promising private should be given
a chance whenever possible to use and develop his initiative.
Initiative, like most other qualities a true leader needs, can be
developed only through much practice. In training this means that
the leader must work up hundreds of situations covering many contingencies and must use such instruction almost daily in his training.
For this type of instruction he should not wait until his unit has
completed its basic tactical training. He should work such situations
into the daily training of his troops from the beginning.
In squad training, for example, even during close-order drill, the
privates should be allowed to command. In just one minute the
psychological effect of hearing his own voice shouting commands often
stimulates a healthy ambition for higher grade. Again, it is possible
to take a small map problem, terrain exercise, or combat situation and
give it at least twenty twists, every one of which will teach a different ·

11

•
I

lesson: Through such vanous means initiative can be developed
daily.
Closely allied with, and in its broader sense really a part of initiative,
is the quality of resourceful:Mss, the ability to deal with a situation in
the absence of normal means or methods. New situations, and the
absence of means due to ~nemy action or any other cause, demand
resourcefulness in a leader: ~\filitary supply. organization, and training are designed to meet aU'liormally expected situations, but they
sometimes fail, particularly under combat conditions where the unexpected is normal. Inactivity or passive acceptance of an unsatisfactory situation because of lack of normal means or ways of dealing
with it are never justified. · Initiative, then, under such conditions
calls for resourcefulness and ingenuity.

There is a clear distinction. of co•urse, betwe~ genuine initiative and
undue license. "Discipline," it has been said, "is instant and willing
obedience to all orders, and in fM absence of orders, to what you beliere
tM orders would have been." Here is the true essence of initiative.
How can you develop your initiative?
Check yourself for laziness, mental as well as physical.
Develop the habit of staying mentally and physically alert.
Form the habit of continually looking for what needs to be done
and doing it without having to be told, and without hesitation.
Conti-nually think ahf"!ld.
Develop your own initiative by teaching and training your
subordinate officers, noncommissioned officers, and enlisted men to
use initiative.

Tact
Few assets are more valuable to a leader than tact. Tact is the
ability to deal with men without generating friction, without gi,·ing
them offense. It is the common sense appreciation of when and how
to do things. In the field of human relations, it is the ability to say
and do the proper thing at· the proper time in such a way that a
responsive chord is touched. It is an understanding of human nature
and a consideration for the feelings of others. "It takes all kinds of
people to make the world," and your·unit is a little world-it has all
kinds of people in it. Every individual has peculiarities, and in order
to secure from him his best cooperation, he must be dealt with according to his nature.
Like many other qualities of leadership, tact may to a certain
extent come from natural endowment and upbringing, but it can be
acquired and developed. Intelligent analysis of personal acts which
have caused antagonism will bring out either that the time selected
was not good, or that the language, the approach, or the manner of
the act was unfortunate. And, too, tact undergoes an unconscious
and natural development as a byproduct of experience in handling
12

\

\

men. If a new leader is at first awkward in his dealings with his men,
he may develop tact without any direct attempt to do so, though he
will gain in leadership more rapidly if he tries to be fully aware of even
his minor lapses.
Lack of tact is always resented, even though the subordinate may
realize that there was no intent to hurt. The tactless superior,
sensing friction and opposition put f~ling that his act was based
upon his own best judgment, himself develops resentment, with
resulting damage to cooperation and efficiency. Every leader, no
matter how scant his experience, probably can recall times when his
tactlessness has brought him results the opposite of those he desired;
or where, conversely, the exercise of tact-the diplomatic choosing of
his time ·and manner of approach-has eased situations that might
have proved extremely difficult.
Tact is particularly called for in those contacts with subordinates
in which a personal element is. involved. For example, it may be
necessary to tell a hard-working, driving, subordinate leader that he
is asking a little more of those under him than they can reasonably be
expected to produce. The criticism has to be made in such a way
that what is meant will be clearly apparent, yet will neither cause
discouragement nor detract from the drive and energy of the subordinate. It might be wise to open up with a con.ipliment on work
well done, with the addition, perhaps, of a good smile, and then to
speak of the particular aspects of the subordinate's work which he
can improve. The compliment and the smile, sincerely given and
well deserved, are applications of tact.
Every leader of troops will also need tact in helping those men who
come to him with personal problems. These problems often involve
private mat~ers such as worries about family, sometimes about conditions over which some sense of embarrassment or shame is felt.
The leader has to avoid judging such situations purely on the basis
of his own personal experience and use common sense in making suggestions. But above all, tact is needed. Sometimes the highest
degree of tact is simply to listen with sympathetic attention and
interest, finding out what the soldier's own tentative solution is.
His solution may be confirmed or an alternate one suggested. "That
seems sensible," or "How would it be to do this instead of that?"
Subordinates are usually more tactful to leaders than leaders are
toward subordinates. The junior recognizes that antagonizing his
superior will bring results which are likely to· be immediate and
unpleasant, and certainly disadvantageous to himself. This brake
does not exist over the leader-the results of his tactlessness are more
remote and certainly less easy to recognize, at the moment. But
tact works from top down as well as from bottom up.
The wise junior leader will be just as tactful toward his subordinates
as toward his superiors. The tactful platoon leader will constantly
8!7136°---19--3

13

be alert never to belittle or embarrass the men of his command. You
must always be sincere in your dealings. The sincere and understanding person is usually a tactful person. You may make mistakes,
but if your efforts are sincere you will inevitably find understanding
and a willingness to cooperate. Remember always that a word of
pr~ise or of appreciation will normally accomplish more than all the
condemnation that could be~One of the best things to re~ember in trying to develop tact is that
the "Golden Rule" has proven the most successful basis for human
relations.
An important aspect of tact is courte81/, It, too, works from the
top down, as well as from the bottom up. Courtesy is simply politeness, a ci-.ility which a superior cannot affo~ to neglect in his relations with subordinates. It is the lubricant ofhuman relations. To
. demand it from a subordinate and to fail to return in full measure
is to indicate either arrogance or a lack of interest which true leadership never includes. The inexperienced officer or noncommissioned
officer often feels that politeness in a military leader implies softness;
or worse, that from a subordinate it smacks of bootlicking. Nothing
is further from the truth. Real courtesy is simply common everyday
civility.
Someone once compared politeness to an air cushion. He said that
there was nothing in it, but that it eased the joints of human contact
wonderfully. There may be nothing in it that can be grasped physically or converted directly into battlefield success, but it pays dividends
in the contentment, good will, mutual appreciation, and smooth
functioning of individuals and units.
Courtesy, naturally, is a matter both of words and of act.ions. One
proven leader may habitually bark out his orders, impe.-,onally and
abruptly. Another may habitually give his orders in a tone tinged
with a courtesy which implies the expectancy of obedience. Good
leaders who use either method may get obedience, but the second of
the two will get the more willing obedience and cooperation, and will
always be appreciated consciously or unconsciously by most subordinates.
In times of emergency, of course, abrupt rapid-fire orders become
desirable because they save time and there is no need to imply expected
obedience, no need to do anything but make yourself perfectly plain
and clear and forceful. There are times, too, when a forced tone can
well replace a courteous tone, but even then there is never any reason
for outright discourtesy. At most other times a leader will find that
a somewhat calm, courteous, though firm mode of address will bring
the readiest response. Thus tact and courtesy are closely tied m
with manner, language, and bearing.

it

14

How can courtesy and tact be developed and used in a practical
way? Here are some ideas:
Study the actions of successful leaders who enjoy a reputation
for being able to handle human relations skillfully.
Study the characteristics of different types of persons.
Develop the habit of cooperating in spirit as well as in fact.
Develop the habit of a cooperative spirit in your subordina"tes.
Check yourself for tolerance. If at fault, correct your habit.
Form the habit of applying "The Golden Rule," because it is
vital to teamwork.
Let not man, superior or subordinate, exceed you in courtesy,
simple politeness, and consideration for the feelings of others.
Manner and Bearing

\

::\Ianner, language, and bearing are very closely intermeshed, both
within the leader himsel( and in the effect they have upon his men.
]Janner is usually an accurate clue to the state of mind of any man, but
particularly to that of a leader. The manner of the leader has an
important influence on the response of those he leads. This is particularly true of an act of speech, for manner is so closely a part of
speech as to be inseparable (a fact which will be particularly emphasized a little later). An injury which is obviously unintended is
usually excused; but a calculated slight, even if trivial, is resented.
What is going on in the minds of men can often be understood without a word being spoken. Look, gestures, and tone-and even
physical attitude or tension-often, though not always, indicate their
thoughts. Thus the cultivation by leaders, and particularly by
officer leaders, of mastery and control of manner is essential. The
leader needs mastery over facial expression, control over voice and
gesture. With such mastery and control, the leader will often be
able to exercise a firmer and steadier influence, especially in combat.
The able leader even goes so far as to dramatize the high spirit of his
unit by his own bearing, by his voice, and by the vigor of his physical
actions. Aoting by itself cannot be the chief element in the manner
of the leader, but his appearance and manner must express a genuine
decision and competence, and must often give out a degree of confidence beyond that which he actually feels. ·
The leader must not adopt a patronizing attitude; to patronize or
talk down to men always arouses resentment. In talking to his men
or instructing them, he talks with assurance but with humor now
and then, avoiding a stiff, formal, pedantic and deadly serious manner
except on the rare occasions when this attitude may be appropriate.
He looks his men straight in the eye, and for some individuals who
have the habit-usually meaningless-of not looking directly at others,
this will take practice. He inspects or reviews his men with alertness
15

and exactness, but not without showing pride if their over-all appearance
deserves it.
Too much severity, austerity, and strictness of manner balk the
sympathy and confidence a leader must have from his men. Frequent
irritation, petulance, and uncontrolled displays of temper indicate
that a leader does not have., even himself in hand. Anger must be
co~trolled. Any deliberate s\ow of anger .. as such, is never justi~ed.
In sum, the manner of the leiiA.c:- toward lus men makes for or agamst
cooperation.
All human beings are imitati.e, and enlisted men of all grades tend,
as a general rule, t-0 copy and react to the outward expressions of their
leaders. Thus not only the thing to be done but the manner of doing it
may be conv~yed by suggestion. All drilluiasters realize that their
precision and bearing, and the snap and vigor of their commands, are
directly reflected in the drill of their units. .ill good leaders know
that their apparent confidence in themselves, in their troops, and in
the situation, is reflected by their men-whether the leader's manner
of e'.\l)ressing it is quit or openly vigorous.
This is even more true of an appearance of calmness on the leader's
part, when everything seems to be going ·wrong. Few things can
better maintain the morale of troops than the realization that their
leader, with full knowledge of the difficulties of a situation, neither
looks nor acts as worried as perhaps he has a right to. There is a
story told of a lieutenant general which illustrates this point. This
general commanded an airborne dh·ision in its D-<lay air-<lrops on the
eontinent. On D plus 1 the di,~ision command post was in and around
a group of farm buildings. The small area also contained an aid
station and a temporary enclosure for hundreds of German prisoners.
Contact with the airborne division had not yet been established by
the ground troops fighting inland from the beaches. The command
post came under German arti:!ery fire. There was a dive for coverby all except the general. He stood alone, bareheaded, surveying the
scene. Seeing a radio set across the court, he calmly said, "I tho,ught
they were ranging on the radio. You know, I think we ought to tell
them to move it. They might get hurt over there." With his troops cut
off, their strength dwindling, not knowing what might come next,
the commander superbly demonstrated, by his manner and by his
words, his complete assurance that all would be well.
Language is another of the outward marks by which a leader can be
judged and th.rough which he has an e,·er present influence on his men.
Wbat he says and his forms of e'.\l)ression giYe much information of his
mental state and materially influence the mental state· of his men.
The words the leader uses to his men should largely be chosen for
the thought or purpose he wants to express. Particularly when he
wants to emphasize something his words should be short, clear in
their meaning, and understandable to the man he is addre~ing.
16

\

\

"High-flung" words or technical terms are meaningless to a man
who may never before han heard those words.
This does not mean, however, that a leader must speak in words of
one syllable. He will seldom find uncultivated minds so lacking in
ordinary comprehension that he is justified in using the language he
would use to children. He should speak plainly and simply, and if
he must use terms which he thinks the man he is talking to may not
clearly understand, then he should make sure first that the meaning
of these terms is understood, even if the terms demand a full and
patient explanation. This has a direct bearing on the proper transmission of orders. Battle experience teaches that many orders are
misunderstood or misinterpreted; the main reason-inadequate or involved language.
_Sentences should be short, simple, and incisive. They should be
positive and direct; not uncertain, inconclusive, or negative. To say,
Jor example"· "I'm sure you can do it." "You're just the man to do
it," "'rhere must be some way to get there-I know you can find it,"
produces confidence, self-reliance, and determination. But such
directions as, ":Maybe you can make it," "See if you can't do it."
"I doubt if you can do it-but go ahead and try," all bring doubts and
waveries. Stumped for words, the leader may always rely on his ace
card, "Follow me!"
Cursing and profanity have always been common in armie;;;_.
Whether this is caused by excess energy pent up by military restrictions, by the absence of the tempering influence of women, or by the
mistaken idea that it is the sign of a he-man, is immaterial. Ignoring
purely ethical reasons, immoderate language habitually used toward
subordinates almost always produces unfavorable results both in the
individual and in the unit.
There are, of course, men whose use of profanity is so habitual that
it is recognized as entirely impersonal, and this is true of some very
able leaders who have led troops to high success in battle. But these
men are the exceptions. In general, to use profane or obscene language and to permit its use by subordinate leaders, especially in giving
orders, is to risk friction, resentment, quarreling, and even insubordination.
Swearing directly at men by their superiors is bitterly resented.
They are not only affronted, they are humiliated. For their selfrespect has been attacked, and military discipline prevents and frustrates the usually strong desire to retaliate, or at least to speak up
forcibly in protest. They feel, and rightly so, that the superior has
taken unfair advantage of his authority. Thus they may brood over
the insult, alone or with their friends. If hot-tempered, they may
be impelled to commit the serious offenses of disobedience or assault.
At the very least, the superior produces sullenness and animosity
among his subordinates. ~hd often he also produces a state of mind
17

.
/

in which the only escape from a seemingly int_olerable situation may
appear to be absence without leave or desertion.
The same applies to any immoderate language. The" bawling out"
of rr man or men is resented by most men as being a personal attack.
It is in fact more often an expression of anger than a proper and effective correction. The mor~ or less impersonal point at issue is lost,
and the matter becomes a mt\atal clash between individuals.
Likewise, the use of immd-rate language, or of any language, in
wholesale criticism and condemnation of a group is to be particularly
avoided. It is not likely that there will e,·er be a unit which will deserve a wholesale reprimand. The leader who dresses down his entire
unit for the derelictions of a few individuals is making a profound
error. There is nothing better calculated to ~uce the state of morale
than wholesale criticism and wholesale punishment. Nothing creates
resentment so readily in a subordinate as to be included unfairly
with others who may well deserve som.e disciplinary action. This is-,
of course, true not only of the leader's language but of all general
punishments.
To reprimand a subordinate leader, junior officer, or a noncommi_ssioned officer in front of his men is especially destructive of esprit
and morale. It lowers his prestige and correspondingly builds up resentment within the subordinate leader, and often also in those within
hearing. It is hard to imagine any circumstances when such treatment is justifiable. A leader must seek in every possible way to
build up the prestige of his junior officers and his noncommissioned
officers, not to tear it down.
Indeed, if violent language ever has any basis for use, that use
should be reserved for an extreme emergency of the battlefield. A
tongue-lashing then may have a stimulating and steadying effect which
is lost if such speech is habitual.
Sarcasm and irony are methods of speech which seldom bring good
results. There are many men to whom sarcasm and irony are not
readily apparent as such, and their use tends sooner or later to create
a kind of bewildered resentment. Such a man is never quite sure
what his leader means. Again, heavy sarcasm habitually used soon
creates a general resentment because men feel that their leader is
taking advantage of his position to be sarcastic. Even a bantering
tone should not often be employed.
This does not mean that a joke can never be used. But too much
wisecracking on the part of the leader will also inevitably result in
wisecrack replies from his troops. The American soldier is too used
to that kind of talk to resist cracking back if he thinks he can get
away with it. He will ha,·e reason to think he can get away with it
if he is habitually on the recei...-ing end of such remarks. At the same
time, any wise leader will know that in some circumstances a cettuin
18

\

amount of joking and wisecracking .is what the situation calls for.
When there is discouragement in the air, when exhausted troops must
be called upon for another effort, a flash of humor helps greatly.
It tends to give confidence in time of stress, even in the midst of
the most confused and strenuous combat. Indeed it is often the
American way of implying sympathy and understanding and even
cooperation in the midst of difficulty.
Bearing is the sum total of the obtward aspects of manner and
language. It is simply appearance and conduct. It is the outward
expression of the inward worth which the leader must possess. The
military uniform makes a, man conspicuous in the eyes of civilians.
An officer's insignia and his position of authority makes him conspicuous not only in the eyes of civilians but also in the eyes of his men.
He, therefore, must be doubly careful about his dress, his carriage,
and his behavior. He is looked upon by his men as an example of
what is right and correct.
There are of course certain basic, physical things required in a
leader's bearing. He is expected to and must present a smart appearance and maintain his clothing and equipment in a clean, neat,
and serviceable condition. He must conform strictly to regulations
so that he may establish the standard for the rest of his unit. His
carriage should be upright, and he should show life and energy in his
actions and movements.
A leader should at all times be dignified in his conduct. Dignity
is defined as a grave or stately bearing. It implies a state·of being
excellent, worthy, or honorable, and the avoidance of coarse behavior.
It requires the control of one's actions and emotions. Profanity and
its effect have already been mentioned. To be habitually profane,
boisterous, or "loud-mouthed" ·is to be coarse. To indulge in drink
to the loss of control is to be coarse. If you can't handle your liquor,
don't drink. A leader .who makes a spectacle of himself through
loudness, through drink, or through lack of control of his emotions,
quickly loses the respect of his men.
Here are some ways in which you can develop the manner, language,
and bearing of a leader:
Practice exercising control over voice, facial expression, and
gesture.
Cultivate an attitude of calmness, sincerity, and understanding.
:\faster your emotions so that you control them and they do not
control you.
Practice simplicity and directness of speech.
Never make wholesale condemnations; never reprimand your
subordinates in the presence of the men.
Observe and study leaders who enjoy the reputation of having
good bearing.
19

Know and adhere to regulations concerning dress and conduct.
Require the highest standard in yourself, as an example to your men.
Avoid coarse behavior, profanity, and vulgarity.
Courage

Courage is another element without which leadership can neither
be developed nor maintained~ X o man can be a leader who is not
courageous. He must set an 'txample for his troops.
We have just mentioned control over emotions. To understand
courage we must understand and control the emotion of fear. Fear
is an instinct, an animal emotion. It is an emotion excited by threatened evil or pain accompanied by a desire to avoid that which threatens. We all feel fear in varying degrees. Th~.. totally fearless person
does not exist. There are different kinds of fear. Sometimes a young
and inexperienced leader is afraid to accept resprlnsibility. He is
afraid of making mistakes and being subjected to ridicule or censure.
A man on the battlefield is afraid he will be killed. Also, an officer
may be afraid that, he will show fear in front of his men and thereby
lose their confidence and respect. Fear is a natural emotion which
directs us to avoid injury or pain.
Courage is not the absence of fear. Courage is a mental quality
which recognizes fear. but enables the individual to meet danger or
opposition with calmness and firmness. It is a quality of mind that
gives us control over our physical selves. It causes us to accept responsibility and to act in a dangerous situation. Courage is selfcontrol which comes from a process of reasoning.
There are two types of courage. There is moral courage and there
is physical courage.
1Ioral courage goes hand in hand with truthfulness and righteousness. It includes recognizing and standing for what is right in the
face of adversity and popular condemnation! It is also that quality
which brings a man to admit that he is wrong. Only a fool believes,
or even tries to give the impression, that he makes no mistakes. A
leader who has moral courage will accept responsibility in _administrative and training problems. He will admit his errors. He will
stand for what is right. He will enforce his decision.
This quality of moral courage is vitally important and must be considered and developed. Look for and readily accept responsibilities.
Never "pass the buck." Form the habit of accepting blame when the
blame is yours. Stand for what you believe to be right in the face of
popular condemnation.
Now let us consider the quality of physical courllge. What is
physical courage? In the strictly military sense, physical courage is
overcoming the impulse of fear. It is self-control. It is the control
of your mind over your physical self. The courageous man is one who,
when fared with great physical danger, can make his mental self say
20

to his physical self, "You may be afraid now, but if you knew where
I am going to take you, you would be a great deal more frightened."
It is that self-control which will make a man go after an objective or
hold on to a position even though he knows that it may cost his life.
The first thing that a man should do to develop courage is to study
and understand his emotion of fear. He should then endeavor to
develop mental control over that emQtion. No two individuals have
exactly the same reactions toward fetir, and therefore this resolves itself into a personal and individual problem.
However, there are one or two general rules that might be of value.
If you are afraid to accept responsibilities, begin today-right nowto accept minor responsibilities. Each success, no matter how small,
will give added strength and determination. From day to day, volunteer for and accept more important responsibilities.
If you are afraid of taking a jump on the obstacle course, go out
every day and make the jump until you no longer have any fear of it.
Make yourself do things of which you are afraid and do not give up
practicing them until you have conquered that fear.
Let us summarize the ways in which you can help yourself attain
and apply courage:
' Look for and readily accept responsibilities.
Form the habit of standing for what you believe to be right in
the face of popular condemnation.
Form the habit of never "passing the buck."
Form the habit of accepting the blame when the blame is yours.
Study and understand your emotion of fear.
Develop mental control of your physical self.
If you fear doing certain things in your daily life, make yourself
do those things until you conquer the fear.
Endurance

Endurance is physical and mental stamina. It is akin to courage
in that it involves withstanding physical and mental strain. A man
has endurance in proportion to his ability to stand pain, fatigue,
distress, and hardship without breaking or giving in. It is one of the
most important qualities in determining leadership ability. A leader
must have it in order to command the proper respect from his subordinates. A lack of endurance may be confused with a lack of courage;
and the leader who is in poor physical condition may be mistakenly
branded as a coward or lacking in "guts." He is no longer a leader.
His services are worthless.
Endurance implies the ability to stick to a job and see it through.
Physical endurance is much easier to achieve than mental endurance.
Mental endurance is not only more difficult to achieve, but is similarly more difficult to understand in its fullest ·sense. The manner
in which you retain the details of your training is a test of your mental

21

endurance. To receive the instruction is only the beginning. The
true value of your preparatory work can be measured only.in terms of
the amount you retain and apply. Physical and mental endurance
reach their highest state if you have learned and practiced the principles of leadership so thoroughly that when you are in the field their
application becomes second _nature. Only when that goal is accomplished "';11 you ha,e proved'lthat you stuck to your job and saw it
through to its completion.·
J
To develop physical enduran~, you must cultivate physical training hobbies that will harden and build up your body. At the same
time you must teach yourself to avoid practices and habits that are
detrimental to your physical health. To deyelop mental endurance,
form the habit of thinking and solving problems, both battle and
otherwise, which are likely to be encountered. To develop both
physical and mental endurance, form the habit of finishing every job
thoroughly instead of making excuses for skimped work.
To summarize, physical and mental stamina-endurance-must be
\
developed and applied throughAvoiding excesses which will lower both physical and mental
stamina.
Cultivating physical training habits that will toughen the body.
Leaming to stand punishment by undertaking hard physical
tasks.
Forming the habit of thinking of battle or training situations;
think them through; solve them; in each instance, make a decision;
form a plan; formulate an order for the executio·n of the plan.
Forcing yourself to study on occasions when you are tired and
your mind is sluggish.
Forming the habit of finishing every job regardless of obstacles.
Dependability

Dependability is one of the greatest assets one can possess. If
you are recognized as a dependable person, your superiors and subordinates will rely on you unhesitatingly. Dependability goes hand
in hand with loyalty. A dependable man is one who is loyal, to the
team, loyal to the cause, loyal to what is right. He is a man who
does not take advantage of a situation for personal pleasure, personal
gain, or personal safety at the expense of the group.
A dependable leader is one who considers official orders as sacred.
He enforces them to the letter in spirit and fact. Whether he agrees
or not, he will not criticize his superiors or their orders in the hearing
of others. He will never tell his men: "The old man says we have
got to do thus and so." He will never pass the buck for unpleasant
or hazardous orders. to his superiors, but wi.11 adopt them as his own
orders. To do otherwise undermines his own discipline, as subordi-

22

nates will take the same attitude toward his orders. When a leader
is convinced of an error, he should present his views in a dignified,
respectful manner to his next superior.
This matter of loyalty goes to the very heart of leadership and discipline; loyalty-the willing and volun~ary compliance with the plans
Loyalty is in no way merely a blind and
11 nd will of the superio.r.
st>r,·ile obedience to the letter of an orter. · It is an active, intelligent,
11 nd willing effort to carry out the intent of the commander to the
bt>st of the leader's ability.
There is within all men a strong desire to do things their own way
and to express that desire in words. It is fortunate, then, that there
1:i.rt> frw commanders who fail to listen to the suggestions of their subordinates. Thus there is normally open to subordinates a channel
for the expression of ideas. But once the commander has made his
dt•eision, compliance must be wholehearted, regardless of personal
\·iews. When the final decision has been made, the subordinate
must give complete, energetic support. If he can be depended upon
to carry out with zeal only those ideas which he himself approves,
be is unreliable and worthless in any organization.
The constitutional right to freedom of speech, the average man's
liking for his own thoughts, and the sound of his own voice combine
too often to produce loose criticism. Sometimes, indeed, upon
n•ceipt of an order there is an off-the-record attempt to tear it to
pieces and to show how another plan would have been better. Such
criticism may satisfy the ego of the individual concerned-but it
shattt>rs loyalty straight down through the organization. In unit
ginn to knocking, growling, and griping, the source of infei;tion
may often be found at the top. An officer who sets the example of
loose, destructive criticism, especially in the presence of his men,
cannot be surprised if he gets from his men a similar lack of loyalty.
At the same time, it is something of an American privilege to blow
olf stl'am; by no means is all griping an indication of disloyalty. It
takes no great common sense on the part of a leader to realize for
himself that an occasional expression of impatience, even strongly
worded, is only an American habit of which few individuals are free.
In the ordinary course of events these things mean nothing, and are
followed by fully as willing a cooperation and obedience as if the
cause of the impatience had been met with a smile. In wat the
average American soldier will take out his griping on the enemy, but
it cannot be expected that he will lose his habit of expressing an
occasional complaint.
Loyalty works both ways. Loyalty to one's own organization and
men is just as vital as loyalty to superiors. If a leader is proud of his
nwn, if he has in them the faith that real loyalty demands, they will
rt"turn his support and hacking a hundredfold. The leader who never
he,;itates when the occasion comes, as it sometimes \'Vill, to present the

a

23

/
case for his unit to his own superiors (when, for instance, his unit is
discriminated against through inadvertent administrative error) is
known to his men as a leader who watched out for them. This, of
course, can be overdone, can even become the habit of playing to the
grandstand, and can breed r_eal discontent in his own troops if the
leader ever makes a habit of showing that he feels that higher authority
may "have it in for him" or his'-putfit. The solution is simply a matter
of standing up within reason for one's unit.
Loyalty of the leader toward his unit and toward the men of the
unit makes the men feel confident in their reliance upon the leader.
Of vital importance is the security felt by subordinates in knowing
that their leader can be depended upon to do all that is possible for
them. This aspect of dependability means tJiat the officer or noncommissioned officer is constantly concerned about the care and welfare of the men, that he will do everything possible to improve their
lot. Once his men know this they will accept danger, discomfort, and
hardship, confident that such circumstances would not have been
imposed upon them if they were avoidable.
An over-riding and all-important aspect of dependability is the
leader's sense of duty. A military duty is an obligation to be performed, a task to be carried out. Thus a high sense of duty results in
a high standard of performance, a constant and continuous effort to
give the best a leader has in him to the completion of the task at hand.
Duty sacrifices personal interests in favor ·of military demands,
rules and regulations, orders and procedures, and the welfare of subordinates. Duty calls for devotion. In practice it means that a
leader pays careful attention to every detail of his job. His supervision is personal, sharp-eyed, and constructive; his inspections are
detailed, thorough, and complete. Even when utterly fatigued he
maintains a conscientious attention to his responsibilities. He
regards duty as a philosophy, perhaps even approaching a religion, and
his whole attitude is one of service to his country, his profession, his
unit, and his men. He never lets up. Duty is service-a privilege
not a compulsion. And duty well done brings to every· soldier,
whether officer or enlisted man, a glow of achievement and satisfaction.
The development of dependability, and of its twin keystones,
loyalty and devotion to duty, is based upon conviction and practice.
When given a job to do, form the habit of doing it now. Do not put
it off until some future time. Form the habit of doing well any job
assigned to you regardless of obstacles or hardships. Xever forget
that your ·men form the team with which you accomplish your job.
Constantly concern yourself with their welfare.
Here are some ways in which you can develop dependability:
Study and understand the quality of loyalty.
Develop within yourself a keen sense of loyalty.

24

Teach your men to be loyal to their 6rganization and to the cause
for which they serve.
Form the habit of doing every job assigned to you regardless of
obstacles.
Form the habit of being exact in details.
Form the habit of being punctual.
Practice constant consideration for the lot and general welfare
of your men.

Justice
Do not confuse justice with laxity, leniency, or kindliness; nor on
the other hand with harshness, bullying, or tyranny. Justice implies
the rendering of rewazd and the meting out of punishment in accordance with the merits of the case. Justice involves firmness and consistency. The ability to diagnose a case and to take proper measures
is the yardstick of a leader's justice.
Justice must be impersonal and absolutely impartial. There is no
place for personal likes or dislikes in the administration of justice.
Anger and other emotions must not enter into a situation. Prejudice
of race or creed must be avoided.
Few thmgs will disrupt the morale of an organization more quickly
than manifest unfairness or partiality of a leader toward a certain
man or group of men. Firmness without favorites or favoritism is
an essential quality of a leader.
As a company officer you are called upon to render justice in such
matters as promotions and 1eompany punishment. Your decisions
are a test of your fairness. For example, if a man goes AWOL for a
couple of days, do not let your sense of justice be influenced by preconceived opinion of the man. Consider how you would act toward
someone else who had done the same thing, but of whom you thought
differently. You cannot, if you are honest with yourself, punish
him more or less than you would punish your best friend or worst
enemy for the same offense under similar circumstances. It must
always be borne in mind that it takes a long time to build up a reputation among your men for being fair. One thoughtless error on your
part, or one injustice, can destroy a good reputation which may have
taken months to establish. Therefore, every decision you render
should be carefully weighed to see that justice has been done without
prejudice. In developing a sense of justice, check yourself to see if
you are free from prejudices.
In rendering justice a leader must understand human behavior.
He should make it a habit to study people with the idea of learning
why certain types behave the way they do under certain conditions,
and why others act differently under the same conditions. He should
analyze cases that have been decided, either correctly or incorrectly,
and determine what he himself would have done had he been the one

25

to make the decis10n. This; of course, is a private process and should
never be used as an occasion to criticize the decision of another leader.
A certain company commander was a most rigid disciplinarian.
Any enlisted man or officer under his command who violated a rule
was immediately called to account. However, even though exacting
in the extreme, no one could . sav that he ever showed prejudice or
partiality. \Vhen the time cartfe· for him to lead his men in battle he
gave. a very good account of hi'mself nnd his company did well. He
was killed by shell fire in his first campaign. The death of no officer
caused his men more genuine grief tfian did the loss of this ~ompany
commander. His men knew him to be a hard taskmaster but they
recognized that he was fair in all of his dealings with them. His outstanding quality was firmness tempered witb, fairness. His men
admired him because he was just.
In the simplest terms, justice means giving every man his due:
Search your mental attitudes to determine if you hold any prejudices and, if so, rid your mind of them.
Learn to be impersonal when imposing punishment or rendering
reward.
Learn to be absolutely impartial when performing these duties.
Form the habit of searching for the merits of the case.
Analyze cases which have been decided by leaders who have a
reputation for being just.
Study human behavior.

Enthusiasm
Enthusiasm is the spark which brings all the other qualities of
leadership to life. In its deepest sense, enthusiasm is the quality that
deals with feeling. If a man feels something deeply in his heart, he
will do something about it, and he will inspire others to action. The
leader must feel the worthiness of the service, the necessity for an
efficient and adequate defense of our nation in an unsettled and convulsive postwar world, and the part which America and her armed
forces must play in insuring world order and decency and the winning
of the peace.
Enthusiasm implies a cheerful and optimistic attitude toward life.
These attitudes are necessary in a leader because all men are imitative,
and the leader's example ,\ill be copied by those he leads.
Cheerfulness is the expression of inward optimism. Optimism in
turn is the ability to see and to emphasize the brighter side of things.
The cheerful leader is not ·a man who sees this world as the best of all
possible worlds-a man who foolishly insists, whether sincerely or not,
that everything that happens is for the best. Soldiers readily detect
sham and artificiality, and quite as readily detect foolish optimism.
The truly optimistic leader is one who sees and points out the hopeful
aspects of a situation.

26

On the other hand, the pessimist who dwells continually on the
dark side of every situation spreads apprehension, doubt, gloom, and
even despair when combat-or training and garrison duty-brings
doubtful or discouraging moments. A long face is seldom if ever the
face for a leader. It may be useful at rare times to tone down too
high a degree of optimism, but it often earp.s the nickname "Sourpuss"
among subordinates, a no.me that ine~bly carries with it the certain
implication that the troops find something wanting in their leader.
Cheerfulness, optimism, and enthusiasm do not require that the
leader wear a continual, and hence artificial, smile. The cheerfulness
of the words he uses, the expression of his eyes as he speaks, his entire
attitude can radiate cheerful confidence.
An important aspect, of enthusiasm is the performance of tasks with
vigor because of willingness and gratification in accomplishment,
rather then doing them half-heartedly merely because they have to be
done. All of us have had to undertake tasks in which we had no particular interest, for which we felt we had no particular aptitude, and
which therefore bored us quite thoroughly. As we became involved
in the task, we developed iI?-terest, we developed some aptitude, we
developed some· enthusiasm. This can be intensified and fostered
from the beginn1ng of each task. If you make a conscious effort to
develop, even to simulate, enthusiasm, if you project yourself' into
the task as an actor gets into his part, the enthusiasm will become real.
This is particularly important in instructing and training, where
through the contagion of force of example the instructor's interest and
enthusiasm are reflected by his men. If you consciously foster your
own enthusia~m and interest they will beGome contagious.
To summarize the quality of enthusiasm:
Cnderstand, know, and believe in the worth of your work.
Develop in yourself and apply to all your duties a cheerful and
optimistic attitude.
:'.\Ieet each task with vigor, willingness, and interest. Generate
enthusiasm for it.

Summary

Now let us summarize the qualities of leadershp:
Knowledge--professional, cultural, and general.
Decisiveness-the ability to make prompt and correct decisions.
Initiative--the ability to originate and carry through an action.
Tact-the ability to handle human relations.
Manner-including language and bearing: dignity and suitability
of conduct and appearance ..
Courage--the mental control of fear.
Endurance--physico.l and mental stamina.
Dependability-certainty of proper and loyal performance of
duty.

27

Justice-giving every man his due.
Enthusiasm-intense interest and belief in the job.
These are the ten qualities a. leader must possess. "'-hat is the
order of their importance? Not necessarily the order in which they
are listed. What are the three most important qualities? There is a
wide divergence of opinion, and this topic can start a lively discussion.
The~e. is no q':1estion t~a.t k~ledge is o~e of t~ese _most _important
qualities. It 1s essential to know your Job. ~othmg will develop
confidence and respect quicker than knowledge. Second, ,ve might
select that quality which is the spark plug, enthusiasm, the quality
which deals with feeling, the quality that ~rings life to all the other
qualities. Third, we might select that quality which indicates a
des_irable course of action and causes one to do_•it without having to be
told. That is initiative. Initiative is essential:'
But of course if a man has initiative and does not have the ability
to make prompt and correct decisions, the quality of decisii:eness, he
may fail as a leader.
• If a man has initiative and does not have tact, that is, true courtesy·
and thoughtfulness for his subordinates as well as his superiors, he
may likewise fail.
A lead~r must have endurance. If he does not have the physical
and ·mental stamina to enable him to meet hardship and adversity
without giving in, he won't last long.
Of course any leader must have a dignified and appropriate manner,
a military bearing, and must use restrained language.
He must set the example for his men in courage, both moral and
physical. He must controlhis emotions, particularly ahger and fear.
The leader must be dependable. His word must be his bond, and
he must do every job as nearly right as is humanly possible. He must
be· a perfectionist. There must be the certainty of proper and loyal
performance of duty. He must never let down his men or his commanding officer.
He must exercise justice. The leader must b.e just and give every
man his due, with absolute impartiality and impersonality.
All of these ten qualities must be combined to make a successful
leader of well-rounded character and ability.
Self-con.fide'nce has not been mentioned as one of the essential qualities, because self-confidence comes as •a result of them. If a man
possesses these qualities to a fair degree he will be a self-confident
individual, who accepts and fulfills his duties and responsibilities.

END PRODUCTS OF LEADERSHIP
Self-Analysis
Commenting upon the performance of an infantry regimental combat
team during tlu·ee separate campaigns, its commanding officer made
the following remarks about leadership:
T~e strange thing is that every officer thinks he is a leader. It
1s seldom. understood that lack of leadership in the military
profession is like halitosis-even your best friend won't tell you.
The young officer always waits for someone to tell him that he
is not a good leader, and never realizes that this will never
happen. What we lack, and need more of, is the worm's eye
view of leadership.
Do you wait for someone to tell you that you are not a good leader?
Do you wait for someone else to tick off the essential qualities of good
leadership for you and to tell you wherein you are lacking·? This will
rarely happen. Only you can analyze yourself and find out your
strong points and your failings, and recognize your capabilities and
limitations. Knowing his deficiencies, a leader can make a plan for
correcting them. No man reaches his full stature unless he knows
himself and works for improvement.
.
If you will recall the men you have known who have been really
successful, you will find them to be those men who have known their
weaknesses and have worked to improve them. They han decided
where they wanted to go in the, business or professional world and
have worked out a plan of study and development to attain that end.
This business of planned study has paid dividends and it will pay
dividends for you. There is nothing new about self-ana.).ysis. Benjamin Franklin at one period in his life checked upon himself every
week. When the temple was built to Apollo over twenty-four centuries ago, inscribed thereon was "KXOW THYSELF." Self-analysis
was used by wise men long before that. Any leader to obtain his
full growth must go beyond books and instructors; he must understand himself and he must correct his weak points.
Take the ten qualities essential for leadership and rate yourself on
them. Honestly decide where you excel, where you are passable,
and where you are deficient. You might use the standard sen·ice
ratings of superior, excellent, very satisfactory, satisfactory, and

29

How do you stack up? How do you rate yourself, in all honesty and
sincerity? Now that you know wha(your strength and weaknesses
are, plan to increase the former and eliminate the latter by developing
and practicing these qualities in the ways discussed in the preceding
sections.
The qualities of leadership were listed again at the beginning of this
section to bring them home to you, to spur you on to do something
about them.
'
You may wonder why it was chosen, so far in this pamphlet, to
stress the qualities of leadership, and how they are deYeloped and
applied, rather than discussing morale, esprit de corps, and discipline.
The a:qswer should be obvious by this time. If you possess and apply
those qualities, your unit will hare high morale, fine esprit, and good discipline. But there are certain helpful and specific ways-proven
ways-in which your application of leadership will establish morale,
esprit, and discipline. That is why the blunt, words of a seasoned combat leader were quoted at the beginning of this section. This section
and section IV will discuss leadership-morale, esprit, and discipline-from the ground up, from the view of the enlisted men, the men
in your unit. But first it is necessary to make clear what morale,
esprit, and discipline are.

Morale and Esprit de Corps
Morale is the mental attitude assumed toward Army life and everything associated with it by the individual man or groups of men.
Good morale is indicated by a positive drive on the part of the men, a
push beyond that which is e~ected, and an eagerness and enthusiasm,
almost an intuition, concerning the leader's desires. Sound psychology
and long experience indicate that the Ame.rican soldier responds best
to leadership which appeals to his pride in himself and his organization.
· Now right here is where esprit de corps (literally it means "spirit of the
body, of the group") enters into the picture. We foster morale by
fostering the esprit, the spirit, of the group through giving them something to be proud of, through creating conditions which bring pride in
group efforts and group standards and group achievements. Group
and individual morale and esprit go hand in hand. The group
feeling of pride increases the individual's feeling of strength because he
belongs-he recognizes himself as part of an outfit that gets things
done, as part ~fan efficient and distinguished organization of splendid
traditions.

31

The establishment of morale and spirit commences in a new organization even before training. Through such simple matters as insuring at once the proper fit of clothing, good food, clean and comfortable
quarters, and efficient arrangements, the men are made to feel that ,
the leaders are for them rather than against them. They are made
to feel, from the beginning, that they are a part of an efficient, wellrun oro-anization
in which e}·ervone
is pulling together toward a
"'
.
common goal. even though t at goal may not yet be made clear.
Thus morale is developed, in a small but extremely important way,
as a basis upon which to build.
In the further establishment and maintenance of morale, specific
goals or objectives must be established. The often quoted dictum
that "1forale is when a soldier feels that he belongs to the best damn
squad in the best damn platoon in the best damn company in the best
damn regiment in the ,vorld" is of little value unless there are concrete achievements to provide a firm basis for the "best damn"
feeling. Such a feeling can be established in relatively simple ways.
Have a platoon go through a long march without a single man\falling
out. Every man in the platoon, and the platoon as a group, will be
proud of that achievement. Competitions help. We live 1n a
competitive world and Americans are especially competitive-minded.
But competitions and their preparations should not be carried to the
point where their value is lost and their efficiency as a morale-builder
is impaired because they infringe on other important factors, such as
time off. The leader who is planning successive competitions between
groups must remember not ·to run competitions for first place
into the ground, for there can be only one first place. When competitions, particularly in training, tend to raise the morale of one unit
and lower that of five or six others, the purpose is obviously being
defeated. At such times, competitions to attain a certain standard
which all can reach, the competitive element being time or some other
such factor, are helpful in giving all groups a feeling of accomplishment aiid at the same time retaining the best morale-building elements
of the competitive spirit. Competitive athletics are invaluable
morale builders as well · as body builders. Intramural athletics
within regiment, battalion, or similar unit serve both of these purposes .•
Competitive athletics on a larger scale, 'Yith selected teams competing
against similar teams of.other units, foster morale because every man
in the team's unit identifies himself with the team and its successes.
In the fostering of good morale in the individual, and good morale
and high esprit in the unit, every detail of daily life, housekeeping,
administration, and training, play an important part. A good mess
plays its part because all men like to eat well and because the leader's
insistence that the food be well-prepared and appetizingly served in
clean and attractive surroundings, is a very concrete demonstration
32

of his interest in and comradeship with his men. Efficient, fair, and
thorough administration plays its part because it contributes to the
welfare and hence the contentment and happiness of the individual,
and because it demonstrates concretely that the leader has the interests
of the men at heart. Carefully planned, purposeful, and effective
training plays its part because the average man wants to learn, and
to prepare, a1_1d b_etter himself, and beca'¼88 it demonstrates concretely
the leaders mtense concern that the min and the unit receive every
possible measure to prepare them to accomplish their mission. :\[embers of a lrighly trained organization take great pride in that fact
alone.
Discipline
Discipline and morale are inseparable. The best discipline is selfdiscipline, the individual does what he knows is right because he
wants to do the right thing. True discipline, accordingly, is the result
of volition and is gained through building willingness, enthusiasm,
and cooperation-rarely through fear of punishment. It exists not
only while men are under the eyes of their superiors but while they are
off duty, because they want to do the things a soldier should do.
This;-discipline is voluntary; it is based on knowledge, reason, sense
of duty, and idealism. The American qualities of initiative and
resourcefulness function best when obedience is inspired by an understanding of the objective and loyalty to a cause, a leader, or a team.
Thus you see the relationship between discipline and morale. Discipline of this type pervades the life of the soldier from the courtesies
of daily association to the assault on the battlefield. It wins battles.
Habit plays a part in discipline and is one of the chief objectives of
training. Training is repeated so that, in spite of the noise, confusion,
and fear on the battlefield, men instinctively apply the good habits
inculcated on the training ground. Fear of punishment may also be
used,· but only as a powerful means of reminding the petty offender
that his actions are against the interests of the group, or .as a means of
eliminating entirely the contamination of a few incorrigibles. If the
leader has built up such a state of mind in his troops that they give
him their utmost in trust and support, the force of public opinionthe opinion of the group, of the other men in the unit-will almost
entirely supplant official compulsion. He rules his men not through
unlimited and autocratic power but through having developed in
them a cheerful and willing spirit which wants to respond, which
wants to carry out his orders, a spirit of mutual helpfulness and
confidence. The unit is regarded by its members as a cooperative
and mutual military business in the success of which every man is
personally interested as a shareholder.

33

J

Know Your Men

The leader must know his men. Since discipline is founded on
morale, and since morale means simply the mental attitude of the
men towatd Anny life and everything associated with it, the leader
must know his men individually as well as collectively. To be able
to influence their mental a~udes, to lead their minds, he must know
what they really think, and~ cannot possess this knowledge without
first having entered to a cerfoin extent into their lives, their hopes,
·
fears, joys, and sorrows.
A company officer must know every man in his orgaRization by
name. To hail an individual as "You :rrlan" or "Hey, you!" is belittling. The man feels that he is just anotp.er serial number, an unimportant cog in which his superior has no personal interest. Similarly, to use the name of a noncommissioned officer without his title
produces much the same effect. "Corporal Jones,".''Sergeant Kelly,"
is the right way. Every human being responds to the recognition of
his personality, his ability, achievement, or experience as if1dicated
by his grade.
'
The study of each individual in the unit should be a never-ending
process. Much .can be learned by studying service records and qualification cards, for through these the leader can get a comprehensive
picture of the make-up of his unit. But these alone are not enough.
The man himself must be studied. The leader should know each
man's sectional and temperamental characteristics, his weaknesses
and strengths, his hopes and apprehensions. He should know something of the lives of his men before they entered the Army, of their
families, and of their educational and vocational backgrounds. He
should constantly endeavor to know their states of mind, their attitudes toward the service, and all the minor things which tend to
raise or lower their morale.
The leader should weigh and consider every individual in his unit,
his physical,.mental, and moral qualities; his appearance; his manner
and performance of duty. This kind of sizing up is a task which is
-never completed. It is an unending job because first impressions are
often erroneous and because every man will inevitably become better
or worse. If a leader thus reviews his first impressions in the light of
later daily contact and observation, ,he will improve and perfect his
ability to analyze character.
Much of this knowledge can be obtained only from the men themselves. But if a man is formally questioned he will often have only a
minimum to say. He will react in the same way if he lacks confidence
in his leader. The ability of a leader to talk to a man in a way which
shows an understanding of him as a man is a sure way to his confidence.
When it seems appropriate, the official military relationship oan be

34

'

.

temporarily set aside and a man put at ease and invited to sit down and
talk things over.
Persoual information obtained from sources other than the man hi~self or the observations of the leader should be carefully weighed because such information may be heavily colored. In using it, the
leader must evaluate its source and consider the personality, character,
and attitude
the ~an whose opinions
being given, as well as ~he
man under d1scusston. Above all, e-vlfu the appearance of usmg
"snoopers" and "stool-pigeons," to gather information must be
avoided. Such practices are destructive of morale because they
st.rike at its very basis-pride and confidence in the leader.
Each leader must constantly remember that his own ideals of conduct may not be those under which a particular member of bis command has been brought up or accustomed to observe. For example,
a big-talking, loud-mouthed, bragging individual is not necessarily
nine-tenths made up of wind. He may simply be good and know it,
though he possesses the weakness of not being able to keep the news
to h i ~ . On the other hand, the mild-mannered, soft-spoken man
who seems uncertain of himself and is never to be found in the forefrontt. often creating in the leader's mind an appearance of ineffectuality, fuay simply be a man who avoids the limelight or who shrinks
from added responsibilities because he thinks they will give him extra
work. Such a man becomes a challenge to leadership to furnish incentives which will make him want to assume the responsibilities and
duties he is capable of handling.
Knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of his men is an element
of leadership which every leader cannot possess too fully, for its
results are always positile and never negative. The ability of a·teader
to predict a man's reaction m1der various conditions must be based
almost entirely upon his first-hand knowledge of the man. From
close observation of his unit he can often predict with accuracy how
the entire organization will react. He can thus not only forecast but
·even create reaction and conduct.

ve

Relations Between Officers and Men
The leader should adopt a sensible and natural attitude in dealing
with his subordinates. It is always a grave mistake for him to try to
gain popularity by undue familiarity, coddling, or currying favor, because it is an inescapable fact that too intimate an association tends to
destroy discipline and lower prestige. In the interests of good discipline, officers are required to wear distinctive insignia, to live apart
from the men, and to confine their social contacts in the Army to other
officers. This age-old distinction prevails in all armies. It has been
misnamed the "caste system" by thoughtless individuals, irritated by
isolated abuses of the essential separation between the leader and
35

j

those' he leads, and stung into hasty damnation by the mistakes of
officers who have accepted and improperly used privileges which are
granted only to further the better execution of duties and responsibilities. Those who speak against the so-called "caste system" ignore
the basic psychological principle upon which the dividing line between
commanders and subordinates is based. The commander-leader i,s the
indicidual upon whom is p~ed th. e inescapable and grave obligation of
ordering hw men to give life ltse{f, {f necessary, in the sen-ice of their
country. Sound psychology· requires that there be preserved. between the individual by whom this decision must be malle and the
individuals who will risk themselves at ~ word, a final line of separation to insure impartiality and obviate the least hint of favoritism.
This is the basis of that separation, no matter what the aspect of the
military service, no matter how remote from ·the front lines and combat the military unit may be. There are analogies along other lines
which support the necessity for separation between commanderleaders and subordinates. For example, the fact that general managers and day laborers, sea captains and able seamen, surgeons and
hospital attendants do not mi.~ socially is natural and unquestioned.
The inescapable and final reason for the ultimate dividing line in the
Army is the power of life and death. It cannot be otherwise. The
officer must avoid even the appearance of favoritism. :Maintaining
this line of demarcation between officers and men helps to a marked
degree•in avoiding the appearance and the actuality.
1Iost men instinctively understand and appreciate the reasons and
necessities which prevent undue familiarity with their leaders. They
have little but contempt for the officer or soldier who, forgetting his
own place, deliberately crosses the dividing line reserved for the other.
The wise leader will walk the thin line between friendship and familiarity, and at the same time be parent, brother, and father-confessor to
his men. It has been said that "a good leader has the patience of
Job, the loyalty of Jonathan, and ~itartha'8 willingness to serve."
This is never a one-sided relationship, because the application of
these qualities brings them out within the men in heightened morale
and in .strengthened self-discipline.
In the practical working of this line of demarcation between officer
and enlisted man, an important fact is that sucfr a system, more
efficiently than any other which has 11een developed, enables a designated leader who may have as yet only a moderate degree of leadership,
nevertheless to lead his troops in battle successfully. After all, that
is the primary end of any army of democracy, and unless that end
can be attained democracy cannot live.
The officer-leader's duty, then, is to bring himself as close to the
enlisted men as he can without impairing his own status and weakening
his authority. He should be on conversational terms with his men,
so that they can talk to him freely and frankly without embarrassment

36

or fear. This relationship should be personal, frank, mutual, and
not one-sided. :'.\filitary and social status have nothing to do with
it, for it is essentially the controliing relation between the head of a
family and its members. No back-slapping familiarity is needed on
either side. Relations should in general be close an<l cordial, but
they must be sympathetic rather than familiarly social.
The above is merely a general guide. i Common sense, for example,
should tell any officer-leader that a Present difference in military
status should not be permitted to affect a friendship of long existence
when relations need not be official. Nor should it operate to prevent
the occasional close association of an officer and· enlisted man who
have similar intellectual interests. :'.\fuch nonsense has been written
about our Army in this regard by writers seemingly ignorant of American armies and their discipline. One rule, however, must be remembered: in the presence of other enlisted men, the relationship
between friends who happen to be temporarily officer and enlisted
man must be purely military, whether to them it seems artificial or
not. If is always best for discipline that this be done. It avoids
even the appearance of favoritism, particularly in the application of
imp~nal, impartial justice .
.:

Complaint and Criticism

Because of its effect on morale and discipline, the handling of
complaints and criticisms is an extremely vital matter. A leader
should never wall himself off from his men. He should keep himself
accessible at all times. He should assure himself that subordinate
leaders are not denying his men access to him. Thoughtful consideration must be given to complaints. The man who makes a complaint
thinks he has suffered an injustice. If he has, the fault should be
remedied; if not, his faulty impressions should be corrected at once.
In this way no grievances, real or imaginary, will. be allowed to develop.
It is essential that the feeling be established on the part of every
man that his leaders are available to him, that he can go to them .with
his troubles, which are more often personal troubles than military
complaints. Here is a fine example of this side of leadership put into
effect by a regimental commander who is a highly successful combat
leader:
Shortly after taking over his regiment he found that there were
soldiers in it who had no idea they could go to their company commanders. Ile called his company commanders together, spoke
briefly on the vital need for personal leadership, and then said: "You
now have my order that you are to be directly available to your mento all of them. Y,ou will so announce to them. And you will further
announce that if they find at any time that your orderly room door
is shut to them they will find mine open."

37

j
This system worked well in this regiment and the privilege of seeing
the ~egimental commander on personal problems was not abused.
Company or battery officers must make themselves available to their
men for the solution of their problems. Some commanders have
regularly scheduled times for seeing men with personal troubles while
others find that solving the troubles as they are presented proves best
in their particular unit. Iii'any event the men must be made to feel
they they can get to see the ~'old man" without passing throngh the
hands of a lot of assistants.
· Another system that some commanders follow is to prohibit any
subordinate leader from saying, "No," 1'serving that decision unto
themselves. If the subordinate leader can say "Yes" to the request
of the soldier he is free to do so, but in all caks of refusal the matter is
referred to the higher commander for final decision.
The principal reason for leaders not making th~seh-es accessible
to their men, for failure to meet and handle their problems and complaints, is that they are not quite sure they will be able to handle
them. They have not developed within themselves the qualities of
leadership which were discussed in section II. A company commander may say to him·self, ".".\ly training duties are too important
for me to give time to every man in my outfit who wants to tell me
his troubles." Or he may say to himself, "I will never find time to
handle all the papers on my desk and make all the reports I'm ordered
to make if I have to spend time talking to my men about all the things
that worry them." These are just excuses, they are not the real
reasons. The real reason, almost always, is the uncertainty the leader
has regarding his ability to exercise personal leadership. The answer
is to develop your ability through applying and practicing the qualities of leadership. Always keep yourself accessible to your men.

Discontent
Discontent is carried and can be directed and instantaneously read
in a. man's face and in the hesitations and changes of manner which
indicate his reaction toward unpleasant things. As it becomes
magnified it takes articulate form in complaint and criticism. Since
these are the signs of impending trouble, and thus the warnings that
may precede some overt act of delinquency, the importance to any
leader of heeding them is apparent.
The ultimate expression of -discontent is delinquency, when it
breaks out openly in acts of dereliction, disorder, misbehavior, and
misconduct. If the leader is alert to signs of trouble, as a good leader
is, discontent will never be allowed to develop to the stage of delinquency. Remedial action after delinquency 9ccun; becomes a
complex matter. It usually has to include punishment, as well as
everything which should have been done before-the removal of
38

the original aggravation, destroying the existing bad mental state, and
building up a new and desirable one.
According to its degree, discontent affects physical efficiency just
as do physical depression, fatique, and exhaustion. Undesirable
mental and physical states act similarly in reducing snap and effort,
in lessening initiative and persistence. As interests and desire wane
there develops wavering attention, senEiitiveness, impatience, and'
resentment, with the slovenliness and indifterence which express them.
Si.nee discontent may be due to an infinite number of causes, there is
no general remedy for it. Each case has to be considered as to nature,
cause, aud seriousness. Thus, the finding of a solution, in final analysis,
is usually the problem of the leader r and of all leaders the company
commander most often has such problems to solve. Discontent is
of course nothing but low morale, since it is a negative or unhealthy
attitude toward some aspect of Army life or something associated
with .Anny life.
Discontent, of a quite different kind can be a helpful stimulus
to improvpnent. The discontent at the basis of hope and ambition is
a constructive force, for complete satisfaction with a condition
means.t'stagnation. This kind of discontent can· bring efforts to
improve surroundings and conditions, and it can spur an individual
to lift himself into a more desirable status. Thus the problems
of leaders in general, and particularly the company commander, is
not only to discover and check the undesirable influences which tend
toward pessimism and inefficiency but also to stimulate the discontent
that expresses itself in ambition and higher efficiency.
Because soldiers live in extremely close contact, group discontent
can spread much more rapidly than in civil life. ~Iajor causes which
will not yield to determined and skillful leadership are extremely
rare. Even a minor grievance or fault, if real, may serve as a nucleus
about which a number of imaginary difficulties tend to crystallize.
These petty difficulties can be appreciated and solved only by considering them from "t/i,e 1;iewpoint of the man himself. It is his state
of mind, not the commander's, whu:h needs imprmn.ng.
Summary

Morak is the mental attitude of the man or men to Army life and
everything associated with it. We foster good morale by fostering
the spirit and pride of the individual and of the group. The little
things mean a very great deal in their effect on morale.
Discipline and morale are inseparable because the best discipline is
self-discipline; the individual does what he knows is right because he
wants to do the right thing. Discipline of this type pervades the life
of the soldier from the courtesies of daily association to the assault
on the battlefield. It wins battles.
39

Know your men. To be able to influence their mental attitude, to
lead their minds, you must know what they think and how they feel;
you must enter into their lives, their hopes, fears, joys, and sorrows.
In his relations with his men the wise leader walks the thin line
between friendship and familiarity and at the same time is parent,
brother, and father-confessor to his men.
The leader must keep ~self accessible at all times to the men
of his unit. He must assur~ himself that subordinate leaders are not
denying his men access to him. Through this accessibility and
through thoughtful consideration of complaints and personal difficulties, no grievances, real or imaginary~ will be allowed to develop.
Discontent must be watched for and' handled before it develops
into delinquency.

SECTION 1y
SUMMARY OF LEADERSHIP
The principles of practical leadership have been discussed in the
preceding chapters from a military point of view. Before summarizing
the fundamentals of good leadership, it is considered advisable to give
a few typical statements to test the reader's knowledge or to assist one
in conducting a discussion on the subj~ct. The statements below are
based upon the fundamental doctrine of leadership, and .they have
been carefully selected from numerous surveys conducted within the
Army in the interest of establishing better human relationships. The
thoughts contained in these statements could well be made as positive
statements of fact; however, to stimulate interest and discussion it is
preferable to allow the reader to arrive at this own conclusion. The
answers are comparatively easy. The big question is: "Do you, as a
leader, apply them, or does your leader apply them?" Read·and.study
each of the following statements carefully and indicate your answer in .
the space provided.

To summarize briefly the principal points ·coveted in this pamphlet:
Leadership is the art of influencing human behavior through abilitv
to directly influence poeple and direct them toward a specific goal.
Any person with reasonable intelligence can study, learn, and practice
the elements of 1€adership, just as one can learn other accomplishments of human endeavor. If one learns the elem€nts of leadership
and applies them diligently in dealing with other people, he will
eventually become profic½{lt in the field of leadership.
The responsibility of a leader is two-fold; first, the accomplishment
of his mission; and second, the welfare of members of his unit or group.
There are certain prerequisites for leadership. A successful leader
must be of good character, intelligent, and mentally and physically
alert under all circumstances involving his mission and members of
his unit. The maintenance of good human relationships within and
without his unit is another prominent factor for the leader to remember. The saying, "Follow the leader," truly works well when members
of a unit or group have complete confidence and turst in the ability
of their leader.
Briefly~ a leader should possess the_ f~llowing qualifications:
1. Knowledge.-He must know his Job and should possess a background of general knowledge to lead his group in thought and action.
2. Decisiceness.-Ability to promptly make appropriate decisions.
3. Initiative.-Ability to originate the required procedure to
accomplish his mission.
4. Tact.-Ability to foster and maintain good human relationships.
5. Gonduct.-A.bility to maintain dignity, bearing, and manner
above reproach.
6.-Both phys·ical and mental control over fear.
7. Endurance.-Physical and mental stamina.
8. Dependability.-Reliable and loyal to performance of duty.
9. Justice.-A sense of fairness in decisions affecting other
Persons.
10. Enthusiasm.-Keen interest and belief in the job to be done.
The leader is deeply concerned with discipline ·and morale within
his group. These two factors are ever ·present in an organization.
Sometimes poor morale in an organization will increase the disciplinary problem, and again poor disciplinary action will be the cause of
poor morale. A good leader must analyze these matters that affect·
the maintenance of morale and discipline in his unit.· No leader can
afford to neglect the maintenance of proper morale and discipline
within his unit.
In maintaining good human relationship within his unit, the wise
leader will find a wav to know the members of his unit. He will
make himself avail'abfe for consultation, and in effect, make himself
the personal counsellor for each member. This procedure affords hiin
an opportunity to find out what his group thinks.

Conclusion:
Know and do your job.
Know and care for members of your group.
