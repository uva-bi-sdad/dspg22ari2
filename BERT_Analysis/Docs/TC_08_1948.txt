(2) In units the size of a battalion and larger, a staff la provided to the

for forE'sighted, lmnglnntlve, and Inspirational leadership.
(4) Dl\'ision nml higher commanders, like battalion and regimental com·

.or the problem. The leadership requirement of a map terralp. e:rerclee will not
he f1Jl('Clficnlly de11lgnnted In advance as a leadership requirement. This ls not
for the purpose of Indicating that the requirement ls not a matter of leaderebfp,
but to !!how that leadership ls an Integral part of tactics and admlnlstratlon
