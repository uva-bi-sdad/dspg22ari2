ur Army is made up of people, doctrine, organizations,
weapons, and equipment. It is leadership, however, that
brings all these together and makes them work.
The purpose of this manual is to help leaders operating
at the working level: companies, troops, batteries, squadrons,
and battalions. Those leaders include sergeants, warrant
officers, lieutenants, captains, and :field grade officers. Therefore, the manual has three major uses:
• To help you learn what a leader must be, know, and do.
• To help you teach, coach, and counsel your subordinates.
• To help you develop cohesive, disciplined, well-trained units
that can win under the great stress of battle.
If you have the necessary desire, you can develop into
an increasingly effective leader. What must you do to develop
as a leader? What must you be, know, and do to lead the
soldiers in your unit? How can you motivate soldiers to serve
their unit and support the ideals of our nation? Careful study
of this manual will help you learn the answers to these
questions.
Good leaders develop through a never-ending process of
self-study, education, training, and experience. This manual
will help you go through that process. It provid'es a guide
for developing yourself, your subordinates, and your unit.
The best way to use it is to read a chapter or two at a
time, then discu.ss the points of those chapters with seniors,
subordinates, and others who are also reading the manual.
In time of war you must be able to inspire your soldiers
to sacrifice self-interest-possibly to sacrifice their lives-to
carry out missions for the greater good of the unit, the
Army, and the country. To inspire your soldiers to fight for
higher motives, there are certain things you must be, know,
and do. These things do not come naturally, but are acquired

Introduction _____________________________________________________________

through continual work and study. The best leaders are
continually working and studying to improve their leadership. You can improve yourself as a soldier and as a leader
by studying and discussing this manual.
How can you develop your be, know, and do leadership
attributes? How can you become the kind of leader who can
make the right decisions and take the right actions even
under the enormous stress of combat?
First, you must have a mental picture of the demands of
battle on leaders and soldiers. Once you have this picturethis mental map to guide you-you will understand what
goals to set for yourself, your subordinates, and. your unit.
Without actually being in combat, there is only one way to
get this realistic picture of what battle is like. You must
study what combat has been like for past leaders and troops.
The rigors of battle and human nature have not changed.
The fears, emotions, and motivations of soldiers of past battles will be experienced again by leaders and troops in future
battles.
The be, know, and do attributes of our leaders provide
the key to mission accomplishment, winning battles, and protecting the ideals of our nation. Our most threatening
potential enemies greatly outnumber us. They can oppose
us with huge numbers of soldiers, tanks, infantry carriers,
artillery, airplanes, and nuclear weapons. Creative and
inspiring leadership is required to motivate our troops to
deter or defeat any military threat to this nation's security.
To give you a picture of the great demands of battle on
soldiers-leaders as well as troops-this manual begins with
two cases of soldiers in combat. These cases illustrate what
a leader must be, know, and do to lead soldiers in battle.

As you read this case, focus on the following
questions:
• How did the leaders carry out their major responsibilities-accomplishing the mission while looking out
for the well-being of their soldiers?
• How did the leaders on both sides influence their
soldiers' courage and will to fight?
• What leadership actions caused one side to be
defeated?
• What leadership actions caused success?

Chapter 1

The Face of Past Battle
The fight at Little Round Top on 2 July 1863
between the 20th Maine Regiment and two Alabama
regiments-the 15th and the 47th-provides a case
study of leadership and unit cohesion in battle. It gives
us a picture of leadership in one of the most significant
small-unit actions in the Civil War.
The 20th Maine marched more than 100 miles in the
5 days before the fight. On 1 July, they had just
stopped to bivouac when a staff officer galloped up
with orders to continue the march immediately. There
was no time to eat. The situation was urgent. A decisive battle had begun that day between General Lee's
invading Confederate Army and the Union Army at
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. All Union Army units were
badly needed by the next day.
The soldiers would always remember that strange
night. A rumor ran through the ranks that the beloved
Gener.al McClellan was back in command of the Union
Army. A more incredible rumor was that General
George Washington's spirit had been seen riding with
them on a white horse! Both rumors raised morale.
At about 0200 they stopped to sleep. At 0400-again
without food-they continued their march, reaching
Gettysburg around noon. They were allowed to rest for
several hours.
The 20th Maine was one of four regiments in the
brigade commanded by Colonel Strong Vincent. About
1600, as the 20th Maine was moving to its assigned
defensive position, an officer rode up and spoke excitedly to Colonel Vincent. There was much gesturing
toward a rocky hill called Little Round Top. The
soldiers of the 20th Maine did not know it then, but
because of a series of mistakes, this key terrain was
unprotected.
General Buford's two cavalry brigades had been
defending it, but after taking over 50 percent losses the
previous day, they were allowed to withdraw. The Army
commander assumed that the cavalry commander wou!d

replace Buford's unit. But the cavalry commander" did

not think he was supposed to replace it, Wrong
assumptiOns, failure to communicate clearly, and failure
to check had left Little Round Top unguarded.
At about 1545 General Warren, the Army's chief
engineer, climbed to the top of Little Round Top to ·
observe enemy movements. He saw its importance to
the battle and, to his horror, realized it was unguarded.
General Warren sent for help. This led to a staff officer
going to Colonel Vincent and explaining the need for
troops on the hill. Colonel Vincent immediately :vol11117'',:
teered his brigade to defend Little Round T9P·
·. . ·

Chapter 1

The soldiers of the 20th Maine watched as Colonel
Vincent gave orders to his staff, galloped to Little
Round Top, and disappeared into the trees. During the
15 minutes remaining before the Confederates attacked,
Colonel Vincent did an outstanding job of reconnaissance of terrain and selection and occupation of a
defensive position. His brigade followed him up Little
Round Top.
Colonel Vincent led the 20th Maine to its position.
He told Colonel Chamberlain, "This is the left of the
Union line. You understand. You are to hold this
ground at all costs!"1
Chamberlain quickly gathered his company commanders and stressed the importance of their mission.
He ordered them to move into a defensive line with the
right flank company firmly anchored on the 83d Pennsylvania Regiment and the left flank on a large boulder that he pointed to. He showed them the trace of
ground he wanted defended. He ordered them to move
into a line by using a battle drill maneuver to form a
defensive line two ranks deep. This ensured that all companies were tied in on their flanks and that a soldier
was ready to fight the moment he was in position.
After placing his regiment, Chamberlain's thoughts
turned to his exposed left flank. He studied the terrain
there, dominated by Big Round Top. The soldiers saw
him gazing intently at Big Round Top. They remembered past battles where he had shown a skill common
to all good combat leaders. He could study the terrain
closely, imagine the possible dangers, and take actions
in advance to guard against them.
He realized the disaster that would occur if the
enemy got around his weak left flank. So he ordered
Captain Morrill to take B Company toward Big Round
Top for 100 or 200 meters, screen the left flank, and
take appropriate actions. Captain Morrill positioned his
company behind a stone wall at the base of Big Round

To11. They were soon joined by 14 US sharpshooters
who had been driven back from their earlier positions
by General Hood's attacking division.
The 20th Maine's defensive line was barely in position when they were fiercely attacked all along their
front. An officer reported to Chamberlain that he had
seen a large body of troops .moving behind the attacking Confederates. Climbing up on a rock, Chamberlain
saw the force moving to attack his exposed left flank.
B Company would not be able to stop this large force.
Chamberlain had to think fast and creatively. Nothing in the tactical manuals covered this type of situation. His companies were in a defensive line, two ranks
'·
deep, as shown below.

Quickly analyzing the situation, he ordered his company commanders to extend left and back to block the
flank attack. Pointing to the large boulder at the left
end of the line, he ordered the new line to be formed
there-at right angles to the existing line. (See dashed
line in diagram on page 7 .) This meant that each company would cover twice the norm.al defensive frontage.
Their defense would be thin-one rank deep. To deceive
the enemy, Chamberlain directed that the maneuver be
achieved while continuing the same volume of fire to
the front.
The noise of heavy fire made normal voice control
impossible. Still, the regiment performed this difficult,
unpracticed tactic with remarkable speed and coordination ~ It was as if the entire regiment had seen the
move diagramed and had rehearsed it several times.
Each soldier and squad moved together, keeping up the
fire and avoiding gaps in the defense. After the battle,
the survivors of the 20th Maine would always marvel
at how well and how quickly they accomplished that
maneuver under fire.2 It was a unique combination of
tactical battle drills-created in the mind of Colonel Chamberlain to fit the particular situation on that day.
Minutes after the new line was formed, it was
attacked by the fierce, battle-hardened soldiers of the
15th Alabama Regiment. (This regiment and the 47th

Alabama Regiment were under the command of Colonel
Oates.) Because they had marched all night and all
day, they were tired. And because they were unable to
wait for a lost watering party sent out just prior to the
attack, they were thirsty. Even so, they attacked with
great courage and violence.
From this point on, the battle was so fierce that
none of the participants were able to describe exactly
what happened. For the soldiers involved, the battle
took on the quality of a dream. Chamberlain saw that
»Pullen, p 118.,

Chapter 1

a cross fire had demolished the center >of his line. The
color bearer and a single comrade were gallantly
defending the entire . center. Chamberlain filled the gap
with his brother and an orderly.
The Alabama Regiments charged at least six times.
Chamberlain said that at times there were more . of·the
enemy around him than of his own soldiers. Squads of
attacking Confederate soldiers bayoneted their way
through the defenses, but somehow they were thrown
back by the determined Maine men. Many soldiers on
both sides were killed or wounded during this phase of
the battle. Chamberlain was wounded in the foot by a
flying shell fragment. His thigh was severely bruised
where a bullet had struck his sword scabbard.
A lull in the battle came after the sixth violent
charge. Chamberlain knew he was outnumbered and
that each of his soldiers had only one or two rounds of
ammunition. He then showed his ability to analyze the
important forces in a situation and to choose the
course that had the best chance of success. He learned
that the Confederates were forming for another charge.
He knew his unit, out of ammunition, would be overpowered by the superior numbers and firepower of
another Confederate assault. To withdraw would cause
the defeat of the Union Arrrty.
His mind sea~ched for a solution and it came. He
would fix bayonets and charge-:--not for heroics, but
because that was their best chance for success. He
reasoned his unit would have the advantage of attacking downhill. Furthermore, the surprise and violence of
the attack might take the initiative from the enemy
and give the 20th Maine the psychological advantage.
That decision left Chamberlain with a tactical problem that the manuals did not address. He had to keep
the two halves of his :regiment together. Therefore, he
ordered the left flank to charge first, anchoring its
right flank company in place.

9

Chapter 1

When the left half of the regiment was abreast of
the right half, the entire regiment was to charge down
and to the right-like a great swinging door-the right
flank company firmly hinged on the 83d Pennsylvania
Regiment.
After Chamberlain gave the order, young Lieutenant
Melcher leaped in front of his company, sword flashing
in the sun. Already under attack, the left half of the
regiment charged, driving the Confederates before
them. When the left half of the regiment was abreast
of the right, Chamberlain strode forward, leading his
men down and to the right. The regiment was a raging
body, charging toward the Alabama soldiers 30 yards
a way. Before the Alabamans could fire, the 20th Maine

was upon them. At point-blank range a Confederate
officer fired his pistol at Chamberlain. He missed and
handed his sword to Chamberlain in 'surrender-as

Round Top. They had not been able to see the 15th Alabama moving to attack Chamberlain's left flank. After
the 20th Maine's charge, however, the retreating Alabamans came into view. Captain Morrill's force started
firing into the flank and rear of the Confederates.
According to Colonel Oates, it was the devastating
surprise fire of B Company that caused panic in his
soldiers. They thought a large force of Union cavalry
was attacking their rear-even though there was no
Union cavalry in the battle. Colonel Oates and his company commanders thought they were surrounded. He
ordered a retreat-each man to break out as best he
could. At that point the two Alabama regiments panicked and ran. They did not realize that one more attack
could have started the entire Union line tumbling like
a house of cards.

Chapter 1

Colonel Oates said later that General Lee was never
so close to victory as that day on Little Round Top. He
also said that he never knew a greater regiment than
the 20th Maine, or a greater leader than their gallant
colonel.
The 20th Maine swept their brigade's entire front.
They wanted to keep attacking General Lee's whole
army. Some were yelling that they were "on the road
to Richmond.' 13 That Colonel Chamberlain was able to
stop them is a tribute to the discipline of the unit. They
had captured about 400 prisoners from four different
Confederate regiments. The slopes of Little Round Top
were littered with hundreds of dead bodies-blue and
gray. The 20th Maine started the battle with 358 riflemen; they suffered 90 casualties. Forty were killed or
died of wounds.
For a few moments, the fate of an Army and a
nation rested on the shoulders of 358 farmers, woodsmen, and fishermen from Maine. They were led by a
colonel who had been a teacher of languages less than
a year before the battle.
Colonel Chamberlain's leadership at Little Round
Top demonstrates the kind of creative, thinking leadership we will need, at all levels, to succeed on the
modem battlefield.
It is important to trace the development of Chamber-

lain, his subordinate leaders, and the 20th Maine. They
came together as a volunteer regiment in August
1862-knowing little about war. They knew only that
someone was trying to break up the Union, and that
was unacceptable to them. Most had a deep belief in
the Union and in the ideals of America.
Initially, Chamberlain was the lieutenant colonel of
the regiment under Colonel Adelbert Ames. Ames had
won the Medal of Honor at the First Battle of Bull
Run. He was a professional.
8Willard M. Wallace, Soul of the Lion, p 103.

18

Chapter 1

Ames was a }iard, f11jr disciplinarian and an excellent trainer. He led by exam·ple,,. He taught the officers
and NCOs how to be professional leaders. He set up an
individual training program called the school of the soldier and a collective training program, the· school of the
company and regiment He trained the trainers.
Every night after taps Ames gave Chamberlain a
special course in tactics. Together, Chamberlain and
Ames read and discussed books such as Jomini's Art of
War. Colonel Ames put the regiment through hundreds
of hours of dusty, complex battle drill so they could
function as a team under the enormous stress of battle.
This paid off when they had to extend and protect their
left flank at Little Round Top.
The regiment fought in two battles prior to Little
Round Top, and the soldiers gained real respect for
Ames, Chamberlain, and their other officers and NCOs~
At Antietam in September 1862, and at Fredericksburg
in December 1862, ·the leaders led by example, heading
off panic through cool, imaginative thinking, giving the
unit real confidence.
In April 1863, ColQnel Ames was promoted to general and given command of a brigade. At that time
Chamberlain assumed command ofthe 20th Maine and
was promoted· to~· colon~L
Between battles, the 20th Maine trained constantly.
Sound leidership, good training, and tough combat experience developed the unit into a cohesive, disciplined
regiment. By the time Chamberlain took command, he
and ·his subordinates were professionals. They had mastered the knowledge and skills required of soldiers at
that time. In addition, they had developed a consciousness of the regiment. They felt a part of something bigger and more important than themselves. Strong bonds
of confidence, trust, and respect made them a cohesive
unit that fought well throughout the war.

14

Chapter 1

For his day of courage and skill at Little Round Top,
Joshua Chamberlain received the Medal of Honor. He
became one of America's most remarkable soldiers.
Fourteen horses were shot out from under him, and he
was wounded six times. At Petersburg, leading his brigade in a charge on a strongly fortified Confederate position, he was severely wounded in both hips. General
Grant promoted him to brigadier general for his bravery-the only instance of on-the-field-of-battle promotion
in the war.
Five months after his terrible wound, Chamberlain
left the hosp_ital against doctors' wishes and returned
to the front, barely able to walk or ride. From January
1865 through the surrender at Appomattox in April
1865, Chamberlain suffered terrible pain and seriously
weakened health. But his was a triumph of spirit and
character over the body. His heroic leadership during
the campaign in March and April 1865 led to crucial
Union victories at Quaker Road and Five Forks.
In the battle on Quaker Road on 29 March, Chamberlain was leading his brigade in an attack on the
Confederate defenses. A bullet passed through the large
muscle of his horse's neck, hit a metal mirror in his
shirt pocket, penetrated the skin, followed his ribs
around to his back, and came out the other side of his
coat. Horse and rider slumped, bleeding profusely.
When he regained consciousness, Chamberlain saw
the entire right of his attacking brigade retreating,
about to panic. Hat gone, blood all over his chest and
head, he spurred his bleeding horse to the center of the
retreating troops-ordering them to turn and attack.
Awed by his courage and will, they attacked and won
the battle.
That victory-made possible by Chamberlain's leadership-seriously weakened the Confederate position. It
was critical in leading to General Lee's surrender within

15

Chapter 1

2 weeks. For his "conspicuous gallantry" on the Quaker
Road, General Grant promoted Chamberlain to major
general.
Grant chose Chamberlain to command the special
honor division of veteran brigades formed to receive
the surrender of arms and colors of General Lee's
Army at Appomattox. The 20th Maine was among the
units chosen for this honor. At the surrender, Chamberlain saw the once great Confederate Army, dejected in
defeat, starting to march past his division. Feeling
deep respect for the great Confederate soldiers, Chamberlain shocked the world by ordering his division to
present arms. This gesture of human compassion
sparked pride and an answering respect from the Confederates. Those who were there thought Chamberlain's
gesture a fitting end to the tragic struggle to save the
Union.

Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain had the professional
values and character traits that we seek to instill in
today's soldiers and leaders. He was tactically and
technically proficient. He was an expert soldier. He
understood human nature. He focused his attention on
accomplishing his mission while looking out for the
well-being of his soldiers. He had the attributes of honorable character, professional knowledge, and inspirational leadership that are explained and illustrated in
this manual.
We can develop leaders like Joshua Chamberlain in
our schools and in our units. You can become this
kind of leader, and you can teach your subordinates to
be this kind of leader. This is your challenge and responsibility.

Chapter 1

Why did the men of the 20th Maine fight so heroically? They were utterly exhausted and reeling from
heavy casualties. Why did they rise up and charge into
what seemed like certain death? The way of retreat
and safety lay open behind them. Sergeants did not
prod them forward with bayonets. Chamberlain and
his subordinates did not lead by coercion and fear.
Ponder these questions as you read about Bravo and
Charlie Companies in the next case, "The Face of
Future Battle."

FUTUR E BATTLE
This case has a fictional setting-a future battlefield. The characters are fictional. They were developed, however, from real soldiers (officers, NCOs, and
troops). Events such as the panic and the heroic attack
are fictional, but are based on real events that have
occurred many times in history. All the leadership situations are based on factual incidents.
The major point of this story is that the human
dimension in battle-confidence, morale, courage, will
to fight, and the leadership required to inspire these
qualities of the human spirit-have not changed since
the beginning of warfare. In that sense you should
view this story as real. Its purpose is to give you a

clear view of leadership requirements on the modern
battlefield.
As you read this case, focus on the following
questions:
• How did the leaders carry out their major responsibilities-accomplishing the mission while looking out
for the well-being of their soldiers?
• How did the leaders of Bravo and Charlie Companies influence their soldiers' courage and will to fight?
• What leadership actions contributed to the panic?
• What leadership actions contributed to the successful
attack?

Chapter 1

The Face of Future Battle
At 0300 on 10 April, Major Jack Williams was awakened by the Chief of Staff's driver. "The Chief needs to
see you. Something about a panic down in the 1-383d."
Willia~, Assistant Inspector General of the Division, raised himself to a sitting position and fumbled
for his flashlight. He dressed quickly and walked to the
Chief's tent.
The Chief sat behind a field table littered with messages. He had aged since the enemy attack at dawn
3 days ago. The first attack penetrated the division's
sector, but the division reserve counteratt,acked and
pushed them back to the east. It appeared 1there would
be a lull of a day or two before the enemy would make
another move. Williams felt as though t1'e war had
already lasted a year.
"Jack, I've got a job for you. We though~ the 1-383d
was our best battalion. We put them where we expected
the main attack. As you know, that's where it came."
Using his situation map the chief explained what happened in the 1-383d.

Chapter 1

"They defended with A and B Companies forward
and C Company in reserve. All three companies dug in
on good positions. A and B Companies took the same
heavy artillery barrage; both survived with light casualties. The odd thing is this-Alpha fought well and
held their ground, but Bravo panicked and ran at the
first sight of enemy tanks. They left a big hole in the
division line, allowing the enemy to penetrate 3,000 meters into our area before we could stop them.
"When it looked like the enemy might roll right over
the battalion, the battalion commander ordered Charlie
Company to move through a gap in the enemy first
wave. They were to ambush the flanks of the follow-on
battalion before it could pour through the gap. Charlie
Company pulled it off. In about 10 minutes, they
destroyed some 30 percent of the enemy tanks and infantry carriers, and then withdrew to friendly lines with
light casualties. Damndest thing I ever heard of'! Looks
like Bravo Company nearly caused a defeat for the division, then Charlie Company saved the day.
"I want to know why B Company panicked and
what to do about it. Get down there and find out exactly
what the battle was like. We've moved back up to our
original positions. Ask the officers, noncoms, and
troops to recreate the battle. The key questions are:
What caused Bravo Company to panic? Is there a leadership problem? Why did Charlie Company fight s~
well? What tactics did they use?
"The battalion commander is Lieutenant Colonel
Ross, but he is in the field hospital due .to a concussion
he suffered from an artillery round as the battle ended.
The exec is missing, so the 83 is in charge until Ross
returns. The doctors say he'll be able to go back to the
battalion in a day or so, but we can't wait that long to
find out what we need to do. Go straight to the battalion. They know you're coming; so does the brigade commander. I expect they'll all cooperate, with the possible

19

Chapter 1

exception of the B Company commander. When you finish there, inform Ross and the brigade commander of
your findings.
"Do your best to get the truth. Our success in future
battles may depend on it. Get the answers back to me
as soon as possible. Questions?"
"No, sir."
Willia!lls and the Chief had worked together for
2 years. Williams understood what the Chief wanted to
know, and he knew how to get truthful answers. Riding forward to the battalion positions, he thought, "Any
officer or NCO who understands and respects soldiers
has no trouble learning the truth as the soldiers see it."
Williams found Captain Alden, the B Company commander, in his bunker. Alden gave Williams a defensive
look, resenting division for sending Williams to check
up on him. Trying to put him at ease, Williams a$ked
him to describe the battle.
Alden began hesitantly. "I didn't like the ground the
83 gave us to defend. He and I don't get along. He
gave me the worst company position, but I told the platoon leaders to do the best they could. Our battle position was several hundred meters forward of the others.
That exposed us.

"I had to put the antitank weapons several hundred
meters out on the flanks so they could get long-range
shots. The gunners were afraid when I gave them the
mission, but I told them ·,tic> get out there and to quit
acting like cowards. I told them I'd court-martial them
if they didn't do well.
"I'm bringing formal charges against the two antitank section leaders who caused the panic. They fired
one round apiece, missed, and withdrew. The- men on
the line saw them withdraw, and they panicked. That
caused a ripple effect, all because those damn gunners
didn't do their job!

20

Chapter 1

"I tried to call the platoons, but the radios were
jammed. Artillery was falling everywhere. Tanks were
bearing down on us. Everyone thought it was time to
delay to the next position, but they weren't sure which
position to go to or what routes to take. The troops
were exposed, and we lost a lot of them. That made
things worse.
"I told them to recon the delay routes. I told them
not to start the delay without word from me. If we lost
radio contact, they knew the signal for delay was two
white star clusters. I ... " His voice broke. "I .... ah
... lost control for a moment. I just couldn't communicate. My squad leaders lost control. Tl}ey're all weak."
Alden wrestled with his emotions. His face flushed;
tears started flowing. "The truth is, I haven't ever been
able to trust most of my NCOs and troops or even one
of my platoon leaders. Most of the soldiers came off
the streets. They have street values. They're stupid. The
only way to lead people like that is by fear. That's all
they understand.
"I had good control of my company until five of my
worst soldiers complained to the IG. They said I run
the company by threats and Article 15s. As a result of
those complaints, the battalion commander told me to
ease off on Article 15s. He told me to have 'leadership
seminars' with the sergeants and troops and to talk
things over with them! I tried that. All they did was
complain. It wasted my time. My mistake was easing
off on them.
"They'll only fight if they're more afraid of me than
the enemy. I failed because I haven't made them fear
me enough. I know my career is on the line. But if
Colonel Ross and the brigade commander give me
another chance, I'll get control. I'll make sure my company never runs again."
Williams thanked him, then went around the company talking to the platoon leaders, NCOs, and troops.
Two platoon leaders who had survived the battle and

21

Chapter I

the ,single remaining platoon .sergeant told stories similar to Alden's.: They related how quickly everything
happened. They shared the anxiety they had felt before
the battle. None of them had had confidence in the outcome. They knew of the company commander's feud
with the SS. They thought perhaps Captain Alden was
right about the S3 giving B Company the most dangerous battle position. They had no alternate means of
communication if the radios went out.
They r~ceived a terrifying artillery barrage. They
looked and saw tanks, tanks, tanks! The sight struck
terror into the troops. A rumor spread that their withdrawal routes were about to be cut off. Suddenly the
word came-delay to the next battle position. They tried
to control the movement, but that proved useless. Fear,
chaos, and death took over from the moment the rear.:.
ward movement started.

POOR TRAINING
CAUSES LACK OF
CONFIDENCE
WHICH CAN LEAD
TO PANIC

22

-----------------------------Chapter 1

From his interviews, Williams pieced together a picture of Alden as a leader. Captain Alden was hardworking and dedicated to duty, and he wanted an excellent company. Though his punishments were harsh, he
always tried to be consistent and fair. He was competent with the weapons and equipment. Outwardly, he
was the picture of a leader. His bearing and appearance
were always sharp.
But he did not trust anyone, so he tried to do everything himself. He knew tactics and planning, but he
never included lieutenants or NCOs in the planning
process. He was never clear in communicating why
things had to be done. Captain Alden was not the kind
of man subordinates questioned; they just followed his
orders as they understood them. This caused confusion
and poor performance on field exercises. When things
did not go well, the captain would get furious and chew
them out. The end result was that Alden's subordinates
did not have much confidence in him.
Due to Alden's good qualities, he had presented an
effective leadership image to the battalion commander.
He would tell Ross that training had gone well, except
for "a few flaws that he would correct before the next
field exercise."
As Williams spoke with the men, he saw the fear
that still haunted their eyes. Their natural fears must
have been multiplied by the unit's history of poor train-

ing and lack of confidence in the commander! All those
failures in training had a devastating result: the troops
did not think the unit could fight and win. When others around them were hit, it was easy to convince themselves that the commander must have given the order
to delay. The radios were jammed. They probably told
themselves that they missed seeing the star clusters-if
their terror-seized minds thought of them at all.
The squad leaders and antitank section leaders
shared a similar view of the battle. One antitank section leader's story aptly expressed their frustration. Sergeant Huckaby said, "I've known Captain Alden for

23

Chapter 1

about a year. My section always works with B Company. I've tried to change that, but none of ,the sections
want to work with this outfit. I'll tell you the way I see
it, Major. Court-martial me if you like, I've had it with
Alden! He doesn't respect soldiers. He thinks we're all
stupid people who have to be led by fear. He's acted
that way on every training exercise. I could take it before the war, but I'm not risking my life for that man
now. He takes away a man's pride and self-respect, and
without that a man ain't no man or no soldier.
"I tried to tell him he was puttin' my section on bad
ground, but he wouldn't listen. He thought I was afraid
to take my men out a few hundred yards. He told me,
'You shut up and go exactly where l tell you, and stay
out there and fight till ordered in, or I'll have you courtmartialed!' I was so angry I was shaking. He probably
thought I was shaking from fear. I took my men to the
exact spot he gave me. We could get a shot at 2,000 to
3,000 meters, but there were some rolls in the terrain
not shown on the map. They were just enough to block
a target from view momentarily, so we couldn't track
for more than 5 or 6 seconds on the main tank
approaches.
"We probably missed our first shots because we were
scared when we saw the t~nks. We got even more
scared when we remembered that Alden always forgot
to order us back in training. And he didn't like us anyway. After we missed those tanks, we couldn't think of
anything but getting back. That's what we did. We
almost got cut off anyway. We never got the word to
come back. He forgot. He left us to die out there! Now
Captain Alden says I'll be court-martialed for cowardice
and starting the panic."
Williams tried to calm Sergeant Huckaby. He saw in
him the potential for real leadership, the kind B Company needed. But Huckaby was filled with a boiling
resentment and rage. The stress of battle and Alden's
treatment had brought him very close to rebellion.

24

------------------------------------------------------~Chapter 1

Williams had seen troops go through this before
because of the way their leaders were treating them.
But, before the war, leaders could control the situation
through the fear of punishment. In war, however, the
fear of death or of being wounded is greater than the
fear of punishment from a leader one does not respect.
He wondered how many other soldiers in B Company
were near rebellion. He smelled a potential mutiny in
B Company. He could see it in the eyes of Huckaby
and others.
Williams told Huckaby that he had the makings of
a good leader and to keep his cool. He told him to use
his influence to encourage others to do the same.
Williams said he would look into the court-martial
charge. Huckaby eyed him skeptically. Soured by his
experience with Alden, he suspected all officers.
Williams might be sincere, but he might be just a
phony, without the guts to do the right thing.
Williams spent time with one or two men from each
squad. The soldiers of the line were candid. They were
not guarding careers. By talking to the troops,
Williams got closest to the real face of battle. A soldier
named Neal from West Virginia told a story that wa8
confirmed by others.

A GOOD LEADER
COMMUNICATES
WITH HIS TROOPS

25

Chapter 1

"My platoon was in the center. The position looked
OK, but we had doubts when we heard Captain Alden
say that the 83 gave our company the most dangerous
position. We were scared anyway from all we had heard
about enemy tank attacks.
"We've just never done well in the field, and everyone knew it. It bothered us some, but not too much,
'cause we really didn't expect to go to war. Anyway,
some NCOs and officers tried several times to tell Captain Alden tactfully that the company had serious problems, but Captain Alden would not listen. After that,
everybody just let it go except for the five guys who
complained to the IG. Captain Alden nailed those guys.
Word got out that he thought those soldiers were disloyal, and anyone who went to the IG would pay. Those
guys' going to the IG didn't seem to do any good, since
the captain wasn't breaking any regulations.
"Anyway, thjs was it. We could hardly believe we
were on front-line positions in a real war. We didn't feel
ready. We started to imagine all the things we had
heard about-wave after wave of tanks. I was thinkin'
about gas and nukes, and the lieutenant said we might
be on the enemy's planned breakthrough point!
"We started talking about all that. Someone asked
the lieutenant if he was scared, and he said, 'No, calm
down! But we could see in his eyes that he was, like
the rest of us. He knew how screwed up the company
was. We worried about how we would take care of each
other if we got wounded. We knew we hadn't had good
training in chemical warfare. We knew that we'd
screwed up every time we tried to defend and delay in
training, when one of the other companies played the
opposing force and attacked us. We remembered how
poorly we'd done on individual marksmanship and live
fire and maneuver. These things went through my mind
all at once. My knees hurt. My heart pounded. My
stomach got weak. My brain hurt. Maybe others felt the
same, I don't know.

26

-----------------------------Chapter 1

"Then the shelling started. My buddy's neck was
torn open by shrapnel. Blood spurted all over me. He
thrashed around in the bottom of the foxhole like a
dying chicken. He died in about half a minute. We'd
been together since basic.
"I couldn't even see the enemy. lt : was first light
then, and foggy. Shells landed everywhere. I didn't
know whether or not to put on my mask. I thought . I
might be dying from gas and not knowing it. Somebody in the next position yelled that he heard some of
our tracks heading to the rear.
"We couldn't call our squad leader. We had no radio,
and the telephone wire had been cut by artillery. We
couldn't get to his position 'cause of. the artillery fires.
He was a hundred meters away. It sounded like his
track was cranking. We thought the company
commander had ordered the delay.
"Then we caught a glimpse of five enemy tanks
about 1,000 meters away. Everyone in our squad ran to
the track. Somebody said our withdrawal route would
be cut off soon. Suddenly there was a horrible explo·
sion just outside the track. Several men inside were
badly wounded from concussion. Someone looked out
and said two men were lying in a pool of blood
10 meters away.
..
"I yelled to stop and help them. Someone else yelled,
'Hell no, we'll all be killed, drive the hell out of here!'
We drove to the rear. I don't know how long we drove.
All I could think of was gettin' outa there. I Ie8.riied ,
today that one of the men outside the track was another
good friend. Maybe I could have saved him. ':I .was a
coward. I almost killed myself when I found that out,
and it's driving me crazy now. I can't think about anything else!" Neal broke into sobs, trying desperately "to
control his crying.
Williams put his hand on Neal's shoulder and said,
"It's all right. Don't feel guilty. You're no coward. Next
time you'll fight bravely. The people in this company
need you."

27

Chapter 1

As Williams drove off from B Company, he knew
something had to be done quickly about that unit. What
little confidence they had in their leaders and in themselves when th~y went into battle was lost. An atmosphere of fear an~ despair paralyzed them. The next step
might be mutiny.\
At battalion headquarters, he found the commander
back from the hospital; he related the whole story. Ross
listened carefully. Williams concluded by saying he
would provide the results of his inquiry to the brigade
commander and to the Chief. Ross was deeply disturbed
by Williams' report. Seeing its truth, he was angry at
himself for not recognizing how serious the situation
was in B Company. Ross knew that he was largely
responsible for the panic, for the deaths and maimings
in B Company, and for the breakdown in the defensive
line.
To Ross, Alden had always seemed to be a sharp"
looking, competent, dedicated young officer. The performance of Alden's company had always seemed satisfactory. Ross had never actually lived with B Company
in the field, so he had not realized how poorly trained
they were.
Ross thought a moment before replying rto Williams.
He engraved upon his mind the lessons he had learned
from this situation. He looked at Williams with sadness
in his eyes. ''Jack, tell the Chief I am largely responsi ..
ble fQr B Company's situation. I had no idea it was so
b•d· there. That's inexcusable on my part. I'll take
action to ensure that it doesn't happen again. I knew
Alden was hard and distant from his men, but I
thought he was respected, and I thought the unit had
discipline. I've got to have a talk with the brigade
commander about how to rebuild B Company."
Williams moved on to C Company•. He found a different atmosphere there. Fighting positions were wellsited; weapons were clean, lightly oiled, and in position.

28

Chapter 1

Everything was camouflaged. Leaders at all levels were
· busy reconnoitering, planning, issuing orders, checking
positions, or looking out for their soldiers.
He found the company commander beside his command track, with his platoon leaders. They were finishing a discussion of the situation, going over contingencies, and planning accordingly. Significant to Williams
was the look in the eyes of the soldiers. It indicated
determination and confidence in themselves, in their
leaders, and in each other.
Captain Jeff Randall, the company commander, was
of medium height and build. He moved with the easy
grace of an athlete. Otherwise, his appearance was not
remarkable. He radiated a quiet competence. Williams
watched Randall ending the discussion with his platoon leaders. He wondered what had enabled this
average-looking captain to lead an attack that saved
the division. What a remarkable achievement!
Williams knew that few uni ts had effective leader
and soldier development programs that focused on mental and character development as well as technical
skills. Nearly all the problems he found as an IG could
be traced to poor leadership beliefs, values, concepts,
and methods.
Williams caught himself in the midst of these
thoughts. This line of thinking would do his division
no good now. He turned his attention to Captain
Randall, who had just dismissed his platoon leaders.
He asked Randall to relate the details of the battle.
Randall told the following story: "We started off in
reserve. We had several messengers at battalion. Thank
God for that. The radios were jammed most of the time,
and the telephone wire was cut by artillery. We got
word that B Company panicked and withdrew without
permission early in the battle, but that A Company was
holding off a large force.

29
466-680 0 - 85 - 2 : QL 3

Chapter 1

"I figured that one of the leading enemy regiments
was penetrating the B Company area. We had planned
and reconned battle positions throughout the sector, so
we could quickly move to assist the forward companies.
We also had several detailed plans for attacking followon elements. We'd given a lot of thought and practice
to the idea of moving between gaps in attacking enemy
units, getting on good ground, and ambushing their
follow-on units. We'd done this in several exercises,
and it never failed to cause chaos in the opposing
forces. But it requires detailed planning and sound intelligence and communication. Each soldier has to be
informed. The men did just great, just like we discussed
and practiced so many times.

Chapter 1

"The battle had been going on for about ll~t minutes
when one of my messengers from battalion roared up
with a message from Colonel Ross. It said, 'ENEMY
BN ON HIGHWAY TEN, "l5 KM FROM FEBA. EXECUTE PLAN BLUE. ONE PLT OF ATK HELICOP.TERS WILL SUPPORT. ;AlO'S WILL SUPPORT.
MINES WILL BE FIRED BY ARTILLERY TO FRONT
AND FLANKS OF ENEMY KILL ZONE.' With the message were copies of an overlay showing our route, the
location ·of the enemy battalion, and the route it was
taking. I looked at my map to locate the :· ~nemy. -~
"I knew the battalion commander had received the
enemy information from G2, and it w·a s very recent.
Based on our rehearsal, l knew we . had less than
20 minutes to get in the ambush position. ·We cranked
and moved out ASAP.
"We pulled into position in 15 minutes, two platoons
of· ·mechanized infantry and two platoons of tanks. I
immediately radioed our exact location to the battalion
83. The mines were fired in. We set up ·on ;a· woodeg
ridge overlooking the road, about 1,500 meters from 'tfl:~.:"~~
road. I planned for the tanks and infantry to· stay ,.,
behind the ridge until scouts reported targets in the kill
zone. Once I gave the order to :fire, the tanks and infantry would move up and fire, then back off, shift laterally,,_ move up and fire again.
"About 5 minutes after we arrived:t the .a dvance
guard 0£ the enemy battalion appeared. I infonijed ~e · ·
S3 so he could notify the attack helicopters and AlOs.·.l
could clearly see a .. column of tanks and infantry carriers rolling right into our ambush. When their lead vehicles hit the mines, I gave the order to open fire. A little
later, attack helicopters and Air Force AlOs attacked
out of nowhere. The rear portion of their column tried
to flank us, but they ran into the fires of attack ·helicopters, AlOs, and mines. The front of the column tried
to push forward , but disabled vehicles blocked them.
Then they tried to charge us; but we had the good

81

Chapter 1

ground, and they ran in to mines. Each of our tanks
and antitank weapons got in about two hits. The whole
battle lasted about 10 minutes.
"I ordered withdrawal, by radio, and fired a star cluster, our signal for withdrawal. We took off on our
planned withdrawal route. On the way back, by chance,
we ran first into an enemy regimental artillery group,
then into a command and control headquarters. In each
case an enlisted vehicle commander started a company
attack battle drill. Each attack lasted about 2 minutes.
We radioed the locations to battalion so they could fire
artillery on them. We got back behind our forward companies within 20 minutes of breaking contact with the
enemy regiment. Five men were killed and eleven were
wounded. We lost two tanks and three infantry tracks.
"The battalion commander ordered us to a battle position on the flank of the enemy penetration. We got on
good ground and attacked the flank by fire. The division reserve blocked them frontally. The enemy
withdrew in confusion. That was about it."
Williams was fascinat.ed. Randall's account raised sev·
eral questions. Why did the men of C Company fight
so bravely and effectively? What caused the difference
between C Company and B Company?· One company of
a battalion fought with courage and will; another ran
in panic at the first sign of enemy tanks. Why?
Williams resolved to find the answers.
He asked Randall his views on leadership and the
methods he used to . develop his subordinate leaders and
soldiers. The question surprised the captain. After thinking a minute he began to talk. His answer was choppy
at first, but as he talked his thoughts flowed. He
evidently had read and thought a great deal about
leadership.
Randall said: "The leader has to focus his attention
on accomplishing the mission while looking out for the
well-being of his soldiers. What's important is how he
gets everyone in the unit to work together to do that. I

82

Chapter 1

think there's potential for good and evil :in · everybody. ··
One big job of a leader is to suppress · the bad, bring
out the good, and then apply that good to the mission.
"I think soldiers basically want . to doi:.. good job-..
especially when they respect and believe in their lead..
ers. If they respect the leader as a person, they'll want
his respect and approval. They're then motivated to follow the leader.. They know they'll gain the leader's
respect if they do their duty to the best of their abilityJ(

ur believe it's essential for leaders to talk. with their
soldiers. For the past year, l've talked
~t. least one
group of eight or so soldiers a week. One week I talk to
privates, another week to E5s or E6s; sometimes to a
squad. That way I find out their thoughts .about how'
to improve the company, what they $ee as right and
wrong, and what their concerns are. I'm constantly looking to improve the company, and these talks help identify and solve problems. Often I learn about misperceptions, and then I can correct them on the spot.
''l also do a good bit of teaching
these discussions. We talk about the real meaning ·of duty. Most ·of
the men want to do their best for the company, the
Army, and the country. That includes initiative to do
the right thing in the absence of orders .. SP4 Jenkins
and Sergeant Johnson took action on their own to
enable us to attack the enemy artillery group .a nd the
enemy command headquarters. Leaders have • strong ·
influence on the development of values and character
in their _s ubordinates-if the leaders are respected and
if they're good at teaching, coaching, and ·counseling.
"Of course, well-planned, continuous training is crucial. Our leaders constantly take notes on what goes
right and wrong in training or in battle. We have leadership and training talks on these notes and plan
actions to correct weaknesses .

Ii-··

33

Chapter 1

I only have time to talk to about five men a week like
this, but it's invaluable. I find out what they think
about the company. I also counsel them on any
weaknesses observed.
"I believe a leader must constantly develop his leadership team. During the past year, I've had daily talks
with my platoon leaders and platoon sergeants. We discuss training, maintenance, leadership, and where we
need to go with the company . About once a month we
have a leadership discussion with all company leaders,
down to the fire team.
"We're a family, a leadership team. We believe in
and trust each other. Leaders must develop an atmosphere with strong bonds of trust and respect-among
troops, between troops and leaders, and among leaders
at various levels in the unit. You get these bonds from
tough training, sharing experiences, and a great deal of
talking and teaching. These bonds are the basis of
cohesion and discipline.
"I think training, tactics, and leadership flow together. They're not separate. Good leaders must know their
weapons and equipment and tactics. But this knowledge is worthless if a leader can't motivate soldiers. It's
worthless if the troops don't trust the leader.
"We continually teach subordinate leaders about thinking, planning, implementing, and motivating. They
understand these concepts and the methods that flow
from them.
''A good leader and trainer understands human
nature, why soldiers fight, and how people learn. He
knows how to teach and how to solve conflicts. He's
good at identifying and handling many problems. Professional values, such as duty and the character to carry
them out under great stress, are his foundation. Character allows a leader to control his emotions and to do
the right thing under great stress. Otherwise, the leader
can't set a cool example to calm the fears of his
subordinates.

"A leader must continually teach everything I've just
mentioned. If I had to put my leadership philosophy in
one sentence, I'd say this: If leaders and troops have
the right professional beliefs, values, character,. knowledge, and skills, they will do the right thing under the
tremendous stress of battle."
Williams said: "I don't know where you learned
those things, but I agree with you. I'm interested in
what caused the success of your company. Your attack
was the turning point of the battle. It looks like your
company totally disrupted the enemy follow-on forces,
permitting the division to repel the enemy penetration.
That success gave the division confidence and inspiration. You should be proud of your outfit. You and your
soldiers have sure earned my respect."
Captain Randall arranged for Major Williams to talk
to the first sergeant, platoon leaders, platoon sergeants,
some of the squad leaders, and many of the soldiers.
Williams found the interviews fascinating. He asked the
same questions in each interview. What happened? Why
did the unit fight so well?
All the leaders used Randall's approach to leadership. They stated it differently, but they held common
beliefs about the values, character, knowledge, and
skills of leaders and soldiers. They told him that they
often discussed leadership, training, discipline, and
teamwork. They used similar methods for developing com·
bat effectiveness. This had not been mandated by the
commanding officer, but developed through frequent discussions and training. The weekly training meetings
helped them come up with an overall concept of leadership and a set of training methods for developing
leaders, soldiers, and the squads and platoons of the
company.
The comments of one squad leader summed up the
thoughts of the other leaders. Sergeant Wills said: "The
:niost important thing in the success of this company is
the company commander. He's not perfect. He's got

35

Chapter 1

faults like all of us. He gets so wrapped up in what
he's doing that he'll forget things-like an important
meeting. He's weak on administration. Sometimes he
talks too much. The first sergeant has to keep him
straight on those things.
"But he's a ihinker and a fighter. He brings out the
best in all of ~us. When time permits, he involves "all
the leaders in the planning. He uses good ideas from
everybody, including privates. He lets you know how
much he appreciates your good work.
"From the day he took command, this company has
gotten better. One reason is that he's set up programs
to find weaknesses and to correct them. Before this battle we were constantly training and then talking about
how we could do a better job.
"He got in trouble about some statistics on training
and maintenance when he first took over, but he refused
to give in to pressure. He worked on getting the company together so that we respected and trusted each

Chapter 1

other. Then our statistics got pretty good. I guess our
attack on that battalion is a pretty good statistic, the
kind that really counts. Wouldn't you say so, Major?
"The main thing about the Captain is that he's
taught all his leaders how to lead and train. And, you
know, if the Captain gets wounded, it's not all over for
this company. We're a family. The XO, the first sergeant, the platoon leaders, the platoon sergeants, and
the squad leaders are all good leaders like the Captain.
He tries to teach us to be as good or better than he is.
I've taught my men. I have team leaders and some soldiers that could be as good a leader as I am, or better,
because we've worked at it.
"We're willing to die for each other and for the company. That may not be true for everyone, but it is for
most. That's why we were willing to go out there to
take on that enemy battalion. We knew we stood a
good chance of not coming back, but there was never
any question of whether we'd follow the Old Man. He
doesn't always do what we want, but he does what he
believes to be right."
Williams talked to many of the soldiers, asking each
why he had fought. There was a common thread in
their answers. Specialist Jones said it best. "Basically,
sir, we fought well because we're well led by our NCOs
and officers. Every man in this company respects the
way the Old Man and the other leaders work together.
The Captain talks to us; we understand him and believe
in him. Our leaders have taught us the meaning of
duty.
"Sure, we were scared, but we knew our leaders
would look out for us as best they could. They always
have. Nobody here wants to die, but that's not the
point. The point is each guy believes in doing his job
as well as he can. That's why we fought so well.
"I'll tell you something else, Major. I don't know
exactly how to say it, but it's damned important to all

37

Chapter 1

of us. Our leaders treat us with real respect and really
care about each of us. They always go to bat for us if
we're gettin' a bad deal.
"About 6 months ago my buddy, Specialist Kellett,
wanted to reenlist as a mechanic. Kellett loves the
Army. He'd done a good job as an infantryman. But
Kellett had beeb a mechanic in ci viii an life, and he
loves that kind of work. He wanted to reenlist and
make a career in the Army as a mechanic. He was
damn good-always fixing company vehicles. Some lieutenant at division said that Kellett couldn't reenlist as
a mechanic because that MOS was temporarily overstrength.
"Captain Randall had Colonel Ross personally make
an appointment for the Captain and Kellett with the
AG. The Captain took Kellett and explained the whole
case to ·the AG. The AG made some calls to DA and
got an exception to policy. Kellett reenlisted as a
mechanic. Our officers and sergeants do things like that
for us all the time. When a leader cares for you like
that, you really want to do a great job for him.
"One other thing, Major, about the soldiers in this
company. When the officers and sergeants are around,
we follow their orders 'cause they know their stuff.
When for some re~son they aren't around, each man
knows he's got to figure out and do what his leaders
would want him to do. That's why we nailed the
enemy regimental artillery group on the way back.
Specialist Jenkins' team was on flank security. He
spotted them at close range and opened up. When he
opened fire; that automatically caused the rest of the
company to execute battle drill for right flank contact.
We nailed 'em!"
After Major Williams left C Company, he visited
Colonel Ross again to brief him on the interviews. He
emphasized the leadership attributes of Captain Randall
and his subordinates. He told Ross of the many acts of
heroism that should be recommended for well-earned
medals. He also stopped at brigade headquarters and
gave a verbal report to the brigade commander.

38

Chapter 1

On his flight back to Division Main, Williams
reflected on his findings. He started ..to think through
the written report that he would give. the Chief. "The
main finding on B Company is that it collapsed and
ran because of' lack of confidence and ·low morale. Po<>r
training had failed to produce necessary cohesion, cipline,. morale, and will to fight. The evidence is clear.
The chain of command should conduct an investigation
to determine Captain Alden's competence as a leader
and to determine if Captain Alden,s charges against the
antitank gunners have a basis in fact.
"C Company fought heroically, primarily because :~~;,;y
the great leadership of Captain Randall an.d his subor- ,.
dinate leaders. They know how to think, plan, communicate, and motivate. They have the right professional
beliefs, values, character, knowledge, and skills. Those
have been transmitted to their soldiers. The leaders
have created a climate in which the troops and leaders.
believe in themselves, in each other, and in their mis~.
sion. All this has developed a cohesive, disciplined,
combat-effective unit. That's the quality .,o~ leadership
we must develop in the -Army today, and the d.ays to
come!" He got out of the chopper and .walked toward
the Chiefs tent.
As he neared the tent, he heard the tremendous roEU+
and staccato sounds of a rolling enemy artillery bar-"
rage. He looked back toward the front and saw ominous clouds of dust rising in the area .of the forward
brigades. For a brief moment he hoped and prayed the
Army had enough Randalls and c9Dip-a nies like
C/l-383d to stop the enemy again.

SUMMARY
This chapter presented two cases of battle-"The Face
of Past Battle" and "The Face of Future Battle." They
give you pictures of a poor leader and good leaders.
They should make you think about the questions you
must answer to lead soldiers in battle. How can I develop my own leadership attributes? Why do soldiers
fight? What causes cohesion, discipline, and the motivation to fight bravely against seemingly great odds?
What beliefs, values, character traits, knowledge, and
skills must I have if I am to lead soldiers successfully
in battle?
Keep asking yourself these questions. They are the
threads weaving this manual together. The next chapter gives you an overall leadership concept of what a
leader must be, know and do if he is to lead soldiers
well-in peace and in battle.

A Concept
of Leadership

r,

_,.___

This chapter discusses the principles of leadership,
defines leadership, explains the factors of leadership,
and provides an overview of what a leader must be,
know, and do. Its purpose is to provide an overall con-

cept of professional leadership. The traditional principles have long been the cornerstone of our leadership
doctrine. These principles, the factors, and the be, know,
and do attributes provide you the fundamentals of leadership and a framework for developing yourself, your
subordinates, and your unit.

PRINCIPLES
The traditional principles of leadership are excellent
guidelines. This manual explains what you must be,
know, and do to apply these principles. In the process
of explaining and illustrating all of the be, know, and
do attributes, this manual provides you with many
examples of how to apply the principles.
41

Chapter 2

The 11 principles are as follows:

1111 Know yourself and seek self-improvement. In order to know yourself you have to understand your
be, know, and do attributes. Seeking self-improvement
as a leader means continually strengthening your attributes. Each chapter of this manual provides you explanations and examples of how to understand and
improve your be, know, and do attributes. Chapter 10
provides a number of practical programs for developing yourself, your subordinates, and your unit.

B

Be technically and tactically proficient. Technical
and tactical knowledge is essential to leadership. As a

leader you must be proficient with each weapon, vehicle, and piece of equipment in your unit. Chapter 6 discusses how to develop your technical and tactical
knowledge.

B

Seek responsibility · and take responsibility for
your actions. Chapter 4 explains responsibility as a
crucial professional value. Chapters 5, 6, and 9 discuss
the importance of having the initiative to see what
needs to be done and the fortitude to take responsibility for doing it. Chapter 5 also discusses how seeking
and handling responsibility builds character.
111. Make sound and timely decisions. Chapter 7
examines problem solving, decision making, and planning. It explains and illustrates how to make sound
and timely decisions.
1H Set the ex~mpk. This entire manual explains and
illustrates the critical need for the leader to set the
example. Chapter 9 provides specific examples of how
to carry out this principle. ·

Know your soldiers and look out for their wellbeing. An entire section of chapter 6 emphasizes the
importance of knowing the human nature of your soldiers. It also explains the important aspects of human
nature that leaders must understand. Chapter 9

42

----------------------------------------------------- Chapter2

explains the importance of sincerely caring for the
well-being of your soldiers and gives examples of how
to apply this principle.
Keep your soldiers informed. Chapter 8 devotes
an entire section to how to communicate and keep soldiers, seniors, and other key people well-informed.
Chapter 9 also provides specific examples of how to
apply this principle.
1111 Develop a sense of responsibiUty in your subordinates. Chapter 4 explains how to instill the value of
responsibility in your subordinates. Chapter 5 shows
how to develop in your subordinates the character traits
that will cause them to carry out their professional
responsibilities. Chapter 9 explains how to assign responsibilities to subordinates in a way that will develop
them as leaders. It also discusses how to assign responsibilities to subordinates and hold them accountable. It
states the specific responsibilities of officers and NCOs.
llJI Ensure that the task is understood, supervised,
and accomplished. Communication is the key to applying this principle. Chapter 8 explains how to communicate and how to ensure that the task is understood. It
also devotes an entire section to supervising.
Train your soldiers as a team. The importance of
training your soldiers as a team is stressed throughout
the manual. How to do this is explained in chapter 6
in the section on cohesion.
Ill Employ your unit in accordance with its capabilities. Chapter 3 explains how Chamberlain and
Randall developed the capabilities of their units through
good leadership and training and then employed their
units successfully according to their capabilities. Chapter 6 contains a section on what you must know about
your unit. It discusses how to increase the capabilities
of your unit by developing discipline and cohesion. It
explains the draining effects of fear and fatigue. The
section on discipline in chapter 6 explains how your
soldiers must be capable of reaching u~it standards.

Chapter 2

To apply these time-tested principles, you need a
clear understanding of the definition of leadership, the
four factors of leadership, and the be, know, and do
attributes of leadership. The rest of this chapter provides you an overview of these fundamentals.

DEFINITION
Military leadership is a process by which a soldier
influences others to accomplish the mission. A soldier
carries out this process by applying his leadership
attributes (beliefs, values, ethics, character, knowledge,
and skills). When a young soldier is deciding if he
respects you, he does not think about each of these
attributes of a leader. He watches what you do so that
he can tell what you really are. He senses if you are
an honorable leader or a self-serving phony who
misuses his authority to look good and get promoted.
In "The Face of Future Battle," Alden is the selfish
officer who fails in battle; Randall is a selfless leader
who succeeds. Self-serving officers and NCOs are not
as effective in battle, because soldiers are not willing
to risk their Iives to follow them. They sometimes succeed in peacetime because they present a good image
to seniors at the expense of their soldiers. The point of
this discussion is to form in your mind the basis of
effective leadership. That basis is honorable character
and selfless service to your country, your unit, and your
soldiers.
In the soldier's eyes, your leadership is everything
you do that affects mission accomplishment and his
well-being. If you want to be a respected leader, concentrate on what you are (your beliefs and character),
what you know (human nature, tactics, your job), and
what you do (provide direction, implement, motivate).

FACTORS
The four major factors of leadership are the follower,
the leader, communication, and the situation. They
have a significant impact on what actions the leader
should take and when he should take them.
44

Chapter 2

LEADERSHIP FACTORS

EXPLANATION
The Follower. The first major factor of leadership is
the follower. Different soldiers require different styles
of leadership. For example, a soldier fresh from basic training
requires more direct supervision than an experienced
soldier. A soldier with a poor attitude requires a . different approach than a highly motivated soldier.
You must know your soldiers if you want to take
the right leadership actions at the right time. The fundamental starting point for knowing your soldiers is a
clear understanding of human nature (needs, emotions,
motivation).
You must understand the be, know, and do attributes of each of your soldiers. The be is what he ishis human nature, beliefs, values, and character. The
know is his knowledge based on experience and training. The do is what he is capable of accomplishing
through his skills. These are explained in more detail
later in this chapter.
You also need the trust, respect, and confidence of
other key people besides your followers. You need the
willing assistance of certain peers, key support personnel such as ~he S4 and Sl, and your ~eniors. You need
45

Chapter 2

to understand· the be, know, and do attributes of these
key people. You must behave in a way that motivates
them to want to help you. This can only happen when
you have developed relationships of mutual trust,
respect, and confidence with them.
Also, you are a follower as well as a leader. You
have to find ways of meeting the needs and goals of
your leader, your followers, other key people, and yourself. To accomplish this, you must understand key
people, have good communication with them, and
develop relationships based on trust and respect.
The Leader. The second major factor of leadership is
you-the leader. You must have an honest understanding of who you are, what you know, and what you
can do. This is necessary in order for you to control
and discipline yourself and to lead your soldiers effectively.
Communication. The third major factor of leadership
is communication. You lead through two-wa,y communication. Much of this is not verbal. When you "set the
example," for instance, that communicates to your
soldiers that you will share hardship with them and
will not ask them to do anything you are not willing
to do. You teach, coach, counsel, persuade, and punish
through verbal and nonverbal communication.
The way you communicate in different situations is
important. Your choice of words, tone of voice, physical
gestures, and the look in your eye affect the way a
soldier feels about what you communicate. Leadership
is more than setting the example and bravely leading
a charge. The right word-spoken quietly at the right
moment-is also an important part of leadership.
What and how you communicate either builds or
harms the strength of the relationship between you and
your soldiers. In a healthy relationship between people,
there are bonds of mutual trust, respect, confidence, and
understanding. These bonds form the basis of discipline
and cohesion in a unit. They are built over time as
46

Chapter 2

your followers learn-from training, from experience,
and from what you communicate-that you are a competent leader whom they can trust and respect.

The Situation. The situation is the fourth major factor of leadership. All situations are different. Leadership actions that worked in one situation with one group
of soldiers, seniors, and other key people may not wo~k
in another situation. Many forces combine to determine
the best leadership action to take at a particular time.
Also, by identifying and influencing certain forces, you
can create a situation more favorable to m1ss1on
accomplishment. (See appendix D.)
There are no rules or formulas to tell you exactly
what to do. You need to understand principles of leadership, tactics, and human nature and to apply these
as guides in particular situations. Then use your judgment to decide the best action to take and what leadership style to use. (Appendix D explains how to use your
judgment to determine an appropriate style.)
In one situation the best sol.u tion may be to confront
a subordinate. In another situation the best solution
may be to include your correction in a regular counseling session. In one situation you may want to punish an entire squad or platoon by denying them certain
privileges. In another, that may be the wrong thing to
do, unfair and unrealistic.
The situational factor includes the timing of actions.
For example, the decision to confront a subordinate
may be correct, but if the confrontation occurs too soon
or too late, the results may be disastrous.
The leadership situation includes all the forces
affecting mission accomplishment and the well-being of
your subordinates. Examples of forces are your relationship with your senior leaders, the skill of your subordinates, the organization of your unit, and the informal
leaders in the unit. In combat, important forces include
the mission, , ~nemy, terrain, troops, and_time (ME1T-T).
47

Chapter 2

There are many forces. No list is complete. The situation includes all the forces that affect the ability and
motivation of your unit to accomplish its mission. You
must be skilled in identifying and thinking through the
important forces in a situation. Then you will be able
to take the right action at the right time.
I
What if you take the wrong action? It happens. We
all make mistakes. Analyze the situation again, take
quick corrective action, and move on to the next challenge. Learn from your mistakes and those of others.

INTERACTION
All of these forces affect each other to varying
degrees in different situations. Some that are important
in one situation are not as important in others. The
four major factors, however, are always operating. The
leader must constantly assess them to understand the
situation and to take the proper course of action,
whether his goal is to take a hill or to straighten out
a poorly performing soldier. Mistakes result when the
leader fails to understand the major factors. Mistakes
also result when the leader does not see how the factors affect each other and mission accomplishment.
The more you understand these factors and how they
affect each other, the better leader you will be. All
Army leaders have a primary responsibility to understand and apply good leadership. Courses at any Army
school can increase a leader's ability to understand and
influence the four major leadership factors. Army
schools, however, cannot teach you everything you need
to know about human nature, why men fight, how
beliefs and values become instilled, how to build character, or how to create a cohesive unit. A clear understanding of human nature-what motivates people-is
crucial to effective leadership. All leaders need to
improve their understanding of the four major factors
of leadership through self-assessment, study, and
expenence.
48

ATTRIBUTES
If you are a leader your soldiers can trust to accomplish the mission while looking out for their well-being,
they will learn to respect you. To be a competent leader
there are certain things that you must be, know, and
do.

Chapter 2

WHAT A LEADER MUST BE
Your beliefs, values, and ethics are the foundation
of your competence as a leader. They guide you as you
lead. Beliefs are assumptions or convictions that you
hold as true regarding some thing, concept, or person.
For example, you may believe that people can only be
motivated by reward or punishment. That is a belief
about human nature. You cannot prove it. Some people
hold that belief, others do not.
Values are ideas about the worth or importance of
things, concepts, and people. They come from your
beliefs. They influence your behavior because you place
importance on your alternatives depending on your
system of values. For example, you place value on
such things as truth, money, promotion, justice, and
selflessness.
Your values influence your priorities. Strong values
are what you will put first, what you will defend most,
and what you least want to give up. As a leader you
may be confronted by situations where your value of
candor (honesty) comes in conflict with your value of
pleasing your boss. For example, if you failed to perform a security check as required, do you have the
integrity and the moral courage to put your error into
your duty log?
In that situation, your values on truth and selfinterest will collide. What you value the most will guide
your actions. In this example, the proper course of
action is obvious. There are, however, times when the
right course of action is not so clear.
The four values that comprise the professional Army
ethic (see FM 100-1) are loyalty to the nation's and the
Army's ideals, loyalty to the unit, personal responsibility, and selfless service. Other crucial professional
values include courage, competence, candor, and commitment. These eight values are discussed in chapter 4.
Your beliefs, values, and ethics are important. They
influence how you think and learn, how you implement
plans and how you treat people. Goals based primarily
on selfish values do not serve the best interests of the
country, the Army, or the soldiers in your unit.
60

Chapter 2

Military ethics are guidelines that help you lead in
a professional manner. Officers and NCOs must discuss, emphasize, and teach professional beliefs, values,
and ethics.
Your leadership should cause people to learn military
values and ethics. This occurs naturally as respected
leaders demonstrate their beliefs and values and teach,
counsel, and provide good training.
Professional beliefs, values, and ethics are the foundation of a leader's character, which must enable him
to withstand great pressures. Character is the sum total
of your personality traits. When we speak of a soldier
of "character" in this manual, we are speaking of an
individual with a combination of traits that causes him
to do what he believes is right-regardless of pressures.
Character traits that are important to leaders and
soldiers will be explained in chapter 5.

WHAT A LEADER MUST KNOW
A leader must know (understand) the four factors of
leadership. To understand them and their affect on each
other, you should continually seek more knowledge of
the following areas.
You must have knowledge about the human dimension which includes• How to motivate people in general and your subordinates in particular.

• Your own strengths and weaknesses.
• The strengths and weaknesses of your subordinates.
• How beliefs and values become instilled in people and
how they can be changed.
• How character is developed.
• How to communicate in a way that builds bonds of
mutual trust, confidence, respect, and understanding
among soldiers and between leaders and troops.
• How people learn.
• How to develop morale, cohesion, and discipline.
• How soldiers can deal effectively with stress.
• How to teach individual and team skills necessary
for unit effectiveness.
51

Chapter 2

• How informal group norms or rules become instilled
as beliefs and values in group members.
• How to teach and train others to become good leaders.
You must have the knowledge required to create
favorable situations. This knowledge includes• How to identify, analyze, and influence the important
forces in a situation. (See appendix D.)
• How to plan.
• The technical and tactical knowledge necessary to do
your job.
• The important lessons of military history.

WHAT A LEADER MU.ST DO
The three overall types of leadership action skills
are providing direction, implementing, and motivating:
. . Leadership that provides direction includes setting goals, problem solving, decision making, and planning. These are the thinking. !,kills of leadership. 'rbese
skills and methods are explained and illustrated in
chapter 7.
IDI Leadership that implements includes communicating, coordinating, supervising, and evaluating. These
are the implementing skills necessary to achieve goals.
They are explained and illustrated in chapter 8.
. . Leadership that motivates includes applying the
principles of motivation (such as aligning unit and individual goals and rewarding behavior that leads to the
achievement of unit standards and goals). It also
includes teaching and counseling. These are the skills
necessary to influence human nature, and to guide motivated people to carry out plans and programs. These
skills and methods are explained and illustrated in
chapter 9.1
'The basic ideas concerning the factors of leadership and the leadership skills (direction,
implementation, and motivation) can be found in Dr. Farr's book, A Five Factor System of
Leadership: Followership: A Follower Model of Leadership.

SUMMARY
This chapter has defined leadership as the process
by which a soldier influences others to accomplish the
mission. He carries out this process by applying his
leadership attributes (beliefs, values, ethics, character,
knowledge, and skills).
We explained the factors of leadership (the follower,
the leader, communication, and the situation), and
briefly outlined what a leader must be, know, and do
to be effective. Taken together, the definition, the factors, and the required be, know, and do leadership
attributes provide a philosophy or concept of professional leadership that will help you develop yourself,
your subordinates, and your unit. It will also help you
address the challenges that every leader faces.
The leadership principles were developed by soldiers
many years ago to train and develop their subordinates.
Those principles have withstood the test of time and
the foremost test-the battlefield. These principles are
guideposts. This manual explains and illustrates what
you must be, know, and do to apply these principles.

Application of the
Leadership Concept

Chapter 2 provided a concept of leadership to guide
you in accomplishing your mission and in taking care
of your soldiers. It will help you in analyzing tough
leadership situations and in developing yourself, your
subordinates, and your unit. This chapter's purpose is
to breathe life into that concept ·and to show you its
practical value by applying it to the leaders in chapter
1-Colonel Chamberlain, Captain Alden, and Captain
Randall.
55

Chapter 3

THE FACE OF PAST BATTLE
BELIEFS AND VALUES
What Colonel Chamberlain said, wrote, and did tells
us what his real beliefs and values were. He was no
phony. He was consistent. He said he was fighting for
the American ideals of truth, justice, equality, human
dignity, and the freedom of other men. His actions supported those beliefs and values. Chamberlain demonstrated the professional military values of loyalty to the
nation's ideals, loyalty to the unit, responsibility, and
selfless service.
CHARACTER
Chamberlain's actions reflected his character. An
honorable ·leader is able to control .his fears and emotions and do what he believes is right, regardless of
pressures. When Chamberlain volunteered for the Union
Army, he was a professor of languages at Bowdoin
College in Maine, living happily with his wife and child.
The college, trying to persuade him to stay, offered him
2 years of travel in Europe. Instead, Chamberlain went
to the capital of Maine and offered his services to the
governor, who was desperately seeking officers to lead
regiments.
The governor offered him the command of a regiment
at the rank of full colonel. Chamberlain declined, saying he would prefer starting as a lieutenant colonel and
learning the art of war before he commanded a regi-

ment. This incident reflects Chamberlain's deep loyalty
to the nation and his concern for properly preparing
himself to carry out the grave responsibilities of
leadership.
People of character establish a consistent pattern of
behavior. They can always be counted on, especially
in tough situations. During the year prior to Gettysburg, Chamberlain demonstrated his character to his
men. His actions in training and at the battles of
Antietam and Fredericksburg showed his soldiers that
they could count on him to lead by example, to choose
the right tactic to accomplish the mission, to stay cool,
and to look out for them.
66

In training and in battle, he displayed physical and
moral courage, competence, candor (honesty), and commitment (dedication). The strength of his character
caused his men to have confidence in him and in one
another. It helped develop cohesion and discipline in
the unit. Therefore, when he gave the order to charge
at Little Round Top, his men dutifully rose and
charged, disregarding the risk.
Soldiers will fight for you if they trust you to do
the right thing and to be concerned for their well-being.
Cohesion, discipline, confidence, morale, courage, and
the will to fight depend upon the application of your
professional beliefs, values, character, knowledge, and
skills.
KNOWLEDGE
Chamberlain had been on active duty for only a
year. How did he learn about tactics, weapons, and
equipment? Colonel Ames, a professional, had trained
Chamberlain for 5 months before he took command.
Chamberlain studied hard and learned fast. He read
books like Jomini's Art of War. He learned the infantry
tactics of the day.
There is much more to professional knowledge than
tactical and technical knowledge. Chamberlain also
knew human nature. Good leaders make a lifetime
study of people-what shapes their beliefs, values, and
character and what motivates them. Good leaders can
put themselves "in the shoes" of their troops.
If you seek to lead soldiers in battle, keep on studying human nature and caring about people. Knowledge
of human nature is basic to effective leadership in war.
It is required to develop cohesion, discipline, confidence,
morale, courage, and the will to fight.
LEADERSHIP THAT PROVIDES DIRECTION
Chamberlain excelled in leadership that provides
direction (problem solving, decision making, planning).
He studied t~e ground at Little Round Top and used it
o7

Chapter 3

to make the best defenses possible. When he saw that
he was being flanked, he shifted his defensive line and
met the attack. This was an incredibly difficult
maneuver to carry out while under a fierce assault, but
Chamberlain's analysis, decision, and plan were correct.
Key to providing direction is creative thinking. After
repulsing six charges, although wounded and losing
blood, Chamberlain still forced himself to think clearly
and imaginatively until he developed a plan that would
give his unit a chance for success.
Chamberlain knew his unit would be overwhelmed
by the next assault. He reasoned that a bayonet charge
might take the initiative from the Confederates and
give his unit a psychological advantage. He was right.
This decision is a brilliant example of creative leadership. It set the direction for the 20th Maine and the
overall Union victory at Gettysburg.

LEADERSHIP THAT IMPLEMENTS
In leadership that implements (communicating, coordinating, supervising, evaluating), Chamberlain showed
great skill at Little Round Top. His orders were clear,
and he explained the reasons behind his decisions to
his subordinates. He ensured that his companies were
tied together in the defense so that the regiment's full
strength would meet the attackers. He was at every
crisis point during the battle: communicating, coordinating, supervising, and evaluating.
LEADERSHIP THAT MOTIVATES
Chamberlain was a motivator, skillful in dealing
with people and in teaching, coaching, and counseling.
He understood human nature and how to apply the
principles of motivation. Chamberlain set the example.
He personally led the charge at Little Round Top.
During the war, he had 14 horses shot from under him,
and he was wounded six times.
There is no substitute for leadership by example. You
must share the dangers, hardships, and discomforts of
your soldiers if you want them to respect you and to
68

------------------------------

Chapter 3

follow you in the toughest, most dangerous situations.
The deep effect of this quality of leadership on the
motivation of soldiers and the cohesion of a unit makes
all the difference. The 20th Maine would not have
charged into superior numbers if Chamberlain had not
been a respected leader who had clearly demonstrated
the be, know, and do leadership attributes during the
months prior to the battle.
Another example of how Chamberlain combined his
knowledge of human nature and his thinking skills
occurred about 1 month before the Battle of Gettysburg.
One hundred and twenty mutineers from the 2d Maine
Regiment were brought to his unit by guards with fixed
bayonets. They were attached as replacements to the
20th Maine. General Meade ordered Chamberlain to
shoot them if they would not do their duty.
Chamberlain decided to find out why they were
mutineers. When they had enlisted, there had been a
foul-up in their papers. Some members of their regiment
had been signed up for 2 years, some for 3. After
2 years were up, two-thirds of the regiment went home.
The other third was ordered to remain on duty. Feeling
that the order was a gross injustice, they had refused
duty. Chamberlain rode to Meade's headquarters and
received permission to handle the mutineers as he saw
fit.
The men had not eaten in 3 days. He removed their
guard so they would not feel like prisoners. He fed
them. He then broke the mutinous group spirit by splitting them up and assigning them to different
companies. He told them that he could not treat them
as civilian guests, but that he would be glad to treat
them as soldiers-with all the rights of soldiers. He
would look into their case and do what he could to
help them. In the meantime, he would appreciate it if
they would do duty with the 20th Maine. All but six
went along with Chamberlain's suggestion. 1
lJohn J. Pullen, The Twen#eth Maine, pp 77..fMJ.

59

Chapter 3

Chamberlain's actions show how humane treatment
can turn away anger, how the right word spoken
quietly and firmly at the right time can persuade even
rebellious soldiers. These stubborn men were willing to
face death because they believed that they were being
treated unfairly by their leaders. Chamberlain recognized their value. If a strong-willed soldier will not be
pushed around, it is unlikely that the enemy will push
him around either. By treating these men with firmness, fairness, and respect, Chamberlain rekindled their
motivation to serve their country.
If Colonel Chamberlain had not been able to motivate nearly all of these 2d Maine replacements to fight
with the 20th Maine, the 20th Maine would surely have
been overwhelmed in their fight at Little Round Top.
This might have resulted in a Union loss at the Battle
of Gettysburg, and even the loss of the war. It is
amazing how leadership in a seemingly small matter
can have an important effect on great events.

THE FACE OF FUTURE BATTLE
In "The Face of Future Battle," two leaders showed
contrasting philosophies of leadership. Captain
Randall's company gallantly completed its mission;
Captain Alden's company panicked.

BELIEFS AND VALUES
Perhaps you think that you have the same beliefs
and values as Captain Randall. Watch yourself. It is
easy to slip, unknowingly, into adopting Alden's beliefs.
It is easy because you face complexity and great pressure. You may feel ill-equipped to motivate soldiers with
positive methods. You may find that threats of punishment and coercive methods are effective motivators in
peacetime.
Human nature requires that people justify their
behavior. If your main method of motivating soldiers
is coercion (yelling, loss of privileges, cursing, and
60

Chapter 3

threats), you will unconsciously tend to justify this
method. One way is by developing beliefs and values
that support your behavior. Like Captain Alden, you
may come to believe that your soldiers are lazy, that
they are against you, that they are bad people, and
that you can only motivate them by threats. Then you
will act according to these beliefs.
Like Sergeant Huckaby and the soldiers of Bravo
Company, your soldiers will sense your lack of respect
for them as equal human beings. Your beliefs and
values will become obvious to soldiers from the way
you look at them, talk to them, give them orders, and
reprimand them.
People resent a lack of respect and will respond with
that same disrespect. Troops cannot openly show disrespect for leaders who treat them in this way. Instead,
they keep the resentment inside and get back at such
leaders by doing only what is necessary to avoid
punishment.
The Alden-type leader fails to build the bonds of
mutual respect, trust, con{idence, and understanding
that are fundamental to a disciplined, cohesive fighting
unit. This type of leadership causes soldiers to lose confidence in the leader, in themselves, and in each other.
They lose confidence in the ability of the unit to succeed in battle. They may even lose faith in the cause

for which they fight. Loss of confidence causes loss of
morale, courage, and the will to fight.
Good leadership takes work and study. Good leaders,
like Chamberlain and Randall, .make intelligent, efficient
use of both their own and their subordinates' time. In
their units you do not see groups of soldiers idly
wasting time during training and maintenance time.
.

.

Good leaders sincerely care about their soldier's personal and professional development. They teach, coach,
counsel, critique, and punish as a concerned parent
does. They see their unit as a family-a team. This
family climat~ helps create a discipline~, cohesive unit.
466-680 0 - 85 - 3 : QL 3

61

Chapter3 ~----------~~------------------------------------~

Leadership as displayed by Chamberlain and
Randall is not just a job; it is a calling, a profession.
It is a commitment to serve the ideals of the United
States and to serve soldiers and their families.
The Randall-type leader values his subordinates as
individuals, not merely as resources to accomplish a
mission and to help him get promoted. He knows that
coercive methods cannot be used as the main way to
motivate soldiers in wartime. The fear of death in battle
is far greater than the fear of court-martial by a leader
who is not respected. Therefore, you must build the
bonds of trust, respect, confidence, and understanding
between y-ou and your soldiers through the use of positive leadership methods such as teaching, coaching, and
counseling.
At the same time, you must also punish soldiers who
intentionally fail to meet standards and follow rules.
You lose respect when you do not punish fairly.
(Examples of punishing fairly are given in chapters 6
and 9.)
CHARACTER
Honorable character is essential in a leader. Chamberlain and Randall had strong character, Alden did not.
Alden's company did poorly in training. The soldiers
knew the company was not combat-ready. They knew
that Alden did not have the character to control diffi-

cult situations during field exercises-let alone on the
battlefield.
Unfortunately, Lieutenant Colonel Ross did not see
this because he failed to look beneath Alden's "image"
of military competence. He saw only that Alden had
military bearing and that he was committed to doing
a good job. He did not see that Alden was inflexible,
prejudiced against troops, and lacked empathy, creativity, and candor (being open and honest with subordinates). The lack of these character traits prohibited
Alden from developing the basis for cohesion and
discipline-strong bonds of respect, trust, confidence
and understanding between leaders and troops.
62

Chapter 3

What about Randall's character? Like Chamberlain,
during the year preceding the battle, Randall had been
consistent in his values, in his words, and in his deeds.
He directed, implemented, and. motivated in ways that
brought success to the unit and respect and confidence
from his soldiers. He showed that he had the strength
of character to control his own nature and to do the
right thing under pressure. Sergeant Wills said Randall
had been under pressure after assuming command
because of some statistical indicators. Randall withstood
that pressure and worked on cohesion and motivation
in the unit. That took moral courage, a critical
character trait for all soldiers.
Recall Randall's actions in the case of Specialist
Kellett. Department of the Army policy prohibited
Specialist Kellett from reenlisting as a mechanic
because that MOS was <>verstrength. Randall went to
the Division Adjutant General about it. He explained
Kellett's case, and the Adjutant General obtained authorization from the Department of the Army for Kellett to
reenlist as a mechanic. Captain Randall took this
.action because Kellett was a good soldier and a good
mechanic who deserved the best help Randall could
provide. Incidents like that showed Randall's men that
he sincerely cared for them and that he was honest,
selfless, and fair. They showed the soldiers that he had
the moral courage to do what he believed right, to fight

for his troops, and to be loyal to them when they were
being treated unfairly.
This .is what· strength of character is all about.
Randall had it. Alden did not. The difference showed
on the battlefield.

KNOWLEDGE
Alden and Randall both knew how to use and maintain their weapons and vehicles. Both were tactically
proficient. They had been to the same Army schools
and had studied the same tactical and technical
manuals. Such knowledge is critical to succeeding as a
leader.
68

Chapter 3

What knowledge, then, did Randall have that Alden
lacked? Randall understood human nature. Alden did
not. Randall knew how to communicate with soldiers
to build bonds of trust and respect. Alden did not.
Randall knew how to influence the beliefs and
values of soldiers and how to develop character in himself and others. He knew that his soldiers would fight
if they believed in themselves, in each other, in their
leaders, and in the cause for which they were fighting.
He knew that he and his subordinate leaders would
not gain confidence and respect if they relied on fearoriented methods. To get the respect of his men, he
had to treat them with sincere respect as human beings.
He had to show willingness to do the right thing, even
if it put him in a dangerous position.
He knew that by working hard at teaching, coaching, counseling, training, and developing his subordinate leaders and troops, he would create a climate of
trust and respect. He knew that this climate w·ould
ca use cohesion, confidence, and morale.
The major difference between Alden's and Randall's
knowledge had nothing to do with tactics and technical
knowledge, although these are essential leadership
attributes. The difference was in their knowledge of

people and in their ability to communicate, to motivate,
and to affect beliefs and values. Some leaders, like
Alden, are lacking in these areas of knowledge. You
must be skilled in them if you seek to lead soldiers. It
all goes back to studying and knowing human nature.
This manual will help you in these areas of knowledge.
(Chapter 6 discusses human nature.)

LEADERSHIP THAT PROVIDES DIRECTION
Alden and Randall ·also differed in leadership that
provides direction (goal setting, problem solving, decision making, planning). Randall had weekly leadership
and training meetings with his subordinate leaders. In
64

~----------------------------------------------------- Chapter3

these meetings they discussed the company's strengths
and weaknesses. They then set goals and made plans
to correct weaknesses.
Obviously, Captain Randall was the main planner
for the company; he made the important decisions. He
was open to ideas from his subordinates, however, including the troops in the rear rank. He involved his
lieutenants, NCOs, and soldiers in identifying problems
and planning. Therefore, everyone in the unit felt they
could assist in setting the direction for the company.
Captain Randall had a good operation plan for
attacking the enemy follow-on battalion. Everyone in
the company knew the plan. They had rehearsed it
many times and performed it successfully in field
training exercises. Captain Alden had a good plan for
his delay, but it was not communicated, understood, or
rehearsed. Therefore, it was useless.
Alden isolated himself. He set goals and made plans
without consulting with his subordinates. People were
afraid to come to him with " negative feedback" or
problems. By himself, he was unable to create training
programs that would eliminate weaknesses. Training
problems were caused by Alden's unwillingness to use
the talents of his subordinates when developing training

programs. Therefore, Alden's subordinates did not gain
a sense of shared responsibility for correcting and
improving the programs.
There is a basic leadership lesson here. Unit problems are rarely caused by soldiers. They are caused by
a lack of good leaders or by leadership mistakes. You
will always have problems in your unit. Just remember
that much of your success as a leader is determined
by your ability to identify, to head off, and to correct
potential or real problems. To do that, you must involve
your subordinates. You must get their perceptions of
problems and their ideas on improving the unit. You
must show that you wa.nt and need their feedback.
65

Chapter 3

GOOD LEADERS
ENSURE THAT
THE TASK IS
UNDERSTOOD,
SUPERVISED,
AND ACCOMPLISHED

LEADERSHIP THAT IMPLEMENTS
Captain Randall had excellent skills in leadership
that implements. He communicated, coordinated, supervised, and evaluated. He ensured that his subordinates
did the same. His communication skills enhanced his
ability to provide direction and to implement. Every
man knew his part in the plan to attack the follow-on
battalion. They had excellent SOPs for movement,
actions on contact, communicating, and coordinating in

battle.
Because of the implementing skills of Randall and
his subordinates, the unit could move out quickly and
efficiently to execute its attack plan. It was also ready
for contingencies. When the lead tank fired on the
enemy artillery headquarters, the rest of the company
immediately executed the battle drills they had
rehearsed many times. A great deal of training is
required to develop a unit's ability to act, under stress,
in this instinctive manner.
Captain Alden and his subordinate leaders were
weak in leadership that implements. Their delay plan
broke down. Their SOPs for communication and
66

Chapter 3

coordination in battle were inadequate. When the
artillery started falling, no one knew what to do.
Remember the soldier who did not know what to do
when he could not talk to his squad leader? Remember
Sergeant Huckaby, who was unsure about how and
when his antitank team would be called in?
The company simply had not practiced the necessary
techniques for implementing the delay. If they could
not implement it on an exercise, how could they implement it under the stress of battle? Lack of success in
training undoubtedly contributed to the troops' lack of
confidence in themselves and their leaders and contributed to the panic.

LEADERSHIP THAT MOTIVATES
Captain Randall had strong motivating skills that
were a direct result of his beliefs and values, his character, and his knowledge of human nature. He set the
example. He spoke to subordinates with respect. He
often led informal discussions with individuals and
groups about how to improve the unit. He understood
how to apply the principles of motivation explained in
chapter 9. His skills as a teacher, coach, and counselor
created a climate where soldiers developed confidence
and an inner motivation to follow him and his
subordinate leaders.
Captain Alden's greatest skill weakness was in leadership that motivates. His inability to deal with people
caused the poor leadership climate-lack of cohesion,
confidence, and morale-in B Company. This climate
caused breakdowns in planning and implementing and
destroyed the will to fight.
Why were Captain Alden's human skills so poor?
The answer is simple. Our skills are what we do. What
we do is directly affected by what we are and what we
know. Captain Alden had the wrong beliefs and values
about human nature. He did not understand human
nature. He lacked some important character traits. His
soldiers, therefore, did not respect h_im. Without such

67

Chapter 3

respect, his soldiers could not be motivated to believe
in his plans and to want to fight for him. Alden had
no positive motivating skills as a teacher and counselor.
For that reason, he had to rely on coercive methods
that had worked in peacetime, but failed miserably in
war.
It is important to note that Captain Alden knew how
to plan and implement. Since he lacked motivating
skills, however~ the plan and its implementation failed.
In other words, his failure in leadership that motivates
caused him to fail in the areas of leadership that
provides direction and leadership that implements.
This is _an important point. To be a good planner
or implementer, you must understand the human nature
of the soldiers who will carry out the plans.

LEADERSHIP LESSONS LEARNED
DISPLAY MORAL COURAGE
One reason Lieutenant Colonel Ross did not know
the terrible condition of the indicators of lf!adershipproficiency, discipline, cohesion, and morale-in B Company was because Captain Alden's subordinate leaders
did not tell him. Several officers and NCOs went to
Captain Alden to tactfully discuss the seriousness of
the situation. Alden would not listen. At that point,
they should have had the moral courage to inform
Alden that they were going to discuss the company1s
problems with the battalion commander. Clearly, Ross
failed in not knowing the true condition of B Company.
But the leaders in Bravo Company had a moral duty
to let Lieutenant Colonel Ross know that B Company
was in bad shape. Not one had the moral courage to
do that. This situation was so bad that their loyalty to
the Army should have been above their loyalty to their
company commander and their concern for their careers.
Could your career be ruined if you have the moral
courage to do that in a similar situation? Yes, it is
possible, even if you are right. That is what character

68

Chapter 3

is all about-having the courage, self-discipline, and
will to do what you believe is right, to tell your seniors
the truth, regardless of the possible consequences or
dangers. (Chapters 4 and 5 explain more about how to
act according to your convictions in this type of
situation.)
The only ones with the moral courage to expose the
situation in B Company were the five troops who went
to the inspector general about Captain Alden's methods
and the poor condition of the company. Private Neal
tells us that "Captain Alden nailed those guys." We do
not know exactly what "nailed" means, but we can
imagine that the five soldiers were not considered
favorably for promotion or other benefits.
Why didn't their squad leaders, platoon sergeants,
and platoon leaders stand up for them? These leaders
also lacked the moral courage to defend their troops
against Captain Alden. They feared getting on his
"wrong" side.
CREATE A CLIMATE CONDUCIVE TO
FEEDBACK
People in subordinate units generally will not come
to you with feedback on problems in their unit unless
you create a climate in which they feel safe. If one of
your soldiers goes to the inspector general or the chaplain or writes his congressman about a perceived
injustice, you have a moral duty to ensure that the
soldier is not punished in any way for exercising his
rights. If you and your subordinate leaders are fair and
professional, you have nothing to fear from these actions.
But remember, such complaints are indicators of
actual or perceived injustices. In each case, it is your
job to communicate with the soldier and to determine
if the complaint is valid. If it is, take corrective action.
If it is not, correct the soldier's misperception by talking
to him. Frequent complaints about the chain of command to the inspector general, a chaplain, or a congressman are often indications that a healthy leadership
climate may not exist in a unit.

69

Chapter 3

You must create a climate in which soldiers feel free
to go to their leaders with perceived injustices or valid
complaints. Had Captain Alden been receptive, his subordinates and others could have advised him on how
to improve the leadership climate in his company. A
major role of chaplains and command sergeants major
is to help junior leaders. Get their assistance on
developing a healthy leadership climate that 1s
conducive to feedback.

SPEND TIME WITH SUBORDINATE UNITS
One reason Lieutenant Colonel Ross did not know
about Alden's lack of leadership attributes was that he
probably did not really want to know what was wrong
in B Company. He was busy; he had many things on
his mind. He had training and war plans to complete.
He had meetings at brigade and division.
He believed that he should stay out of the business
of subordinate units. He did not believe in going to
the mess hall, in sitting down with soldiers in a unit,
and in having a frank, open conversation with them
about what was right and what was wrong in their
unit.
He visited units training in the field, but for only
30 minutes or an hour. He never felt he had the time
to live with one of his companies for a day or two on
a field exercise. These beliefs and values caused Lieutenant Colonel Ross to be an ineffective leader, unaware
of the leadership climate and the state of combat readiness in one of his companies.
There are important lessons in Lieutenant Colonel
Ross's leadership failure. As a squad leader, platoon
sergeant, platoon leader, company commander, or· first
sergeant, you have a responsibility to know the real
situation in your subordinate units. To get honest feedback on their strengths and weaknesses, you must do
more than visit the training of a platoon or squad. If
you are a platoon leader or a platoon sergeant, Iive
with each squad for a day or two in the field as often
70

Chapter 3.

as possible. See how they really operate. Get to know
each soldier. Teach and coach the squad leaders and
soldiers after observing them.
You must spend time with your units. If they know
that you are there to help them become better soldiers
and leaders, they will be glad to have you, just as an
athletic team is glad to have a good coach watching
and helping.

SUMMARY
In this chapter we applied the leadership concept to
Colonel Chamberlain and the two captains in "The Face
of Future Battle."
If you had to pick one thing from the concept that
really made the difference between Alden and Randall,
what would it be? Was it their beliefs and values, their
character, their knowledge, or their skills? All these
leadership attributes are important, but which is most
important?
Anyone vvith average intelligence and motivation can
learn the tactical and technical know ledge and skills
of war. Beliefs and values are important, but without
the character to carry them out under pressure, they
are useless. The same applies for providing direction,
implementing, and motivating. These skills are useless
if you lack the character to apply them under the great
stress of battle.
Character is not concrete. It is not something you
can touch, see, or measure, but it is something that
troops sense in a leader after serving with him for a
time. Honorable character is the moral fiber, the inner
strength to do what is right.
Beliefs, values, and character are the most difficult
aspect of leadership to explain, but they are critically
important. They are the major source of your power as
a leader. You must understand their importance. You
must work to develop them in yourself, your subordinate leaders, and your soldiers. You have no more
important task as a leader.

71

Chapter 3

What you are (your beliefs, values, ethics, and character) is the most important part of your leadership. It
directly affects the way you think and what you do.
Without the correct professional foundation of beliefs,
values, and character, you cannot properly apply the
professional knowledge and skills necessary to lead
soldiers in battle. If you have the right professional
beliefs, values, and character, you will be self-motivated
to learn and apply the necessary knowledge and skills
to develop a disciplined, cohesive, combat-ready unit like
the 20th Maine.
Work hard to develop these leadership attributes.
Nobody reaches perfection in all these attributes. We
all have weaknesses. The important point is to strive
continually to minimize weaknesses and to strengthen
leadership attributes. This is crucial because you never
know when the fate of our Army and nation might
rest on the shoulders of you and your soldiers-on some
small piece of ground like Little Round Top.

This chapter is about professional beliefs, values,
and ethics. We will discuss what they are, how they
are learned, and how they affect a unit. We will begin
by examining an incident that' occurred in Captain
Alden's company-the one that panicked in "The Face
of Future Battle." (See chapter 1.) This case is based
on an actual incident.
73

Chapter 4

Before the war,, Captain Alden was quite concerned
with statiatfoal indicators.., He wanted his company to
look goo4. ·. At one .'P 9int hi$ '.a ompany had achieved the
highest number .o f AWOL-~· days within the division.
Captain .Alden's record ended when Private Jones
went .over the hill because o( , personal problems. Jones
was sure that. his leaders ·would ·not. help him, so he
went AWOL. :H~ : returned a few days later. Alden was
furious. He gave Jones a company-grade Article \l-;} with
reduction in rank, loss of pay,. and restrictio.n . And
Alden made it clear to the company that Jones was~~­
reason they would not receive the usual 3-day w~kepd
tewanl for .AWOL-free days at the end of that month.
As: a result of;.Alden's actions, Jones ~me the
bru11:t .o f snide co~ments and remarks. He we$ verbally
,_bused ~nd physically threatened 'by some of. the soldiers. He became depressed and ·. felt that everyone in
company was against him. His attitude, appearance,
and performance deteriorated rapidly. Daily
-grew
more sullen and resentful. Finally, he began' ·talking
back tQ his NCOs, resulting ·i n a rapid succession of
Article t5s··for·· failure tO.·repair, dereliction of duty, and
jnsubordination. This gave, Alden th.e necessary evidence
to have Jones separated from the Arm.y.
Shortly before Jone• was to be discharged, Alden
decided to ensure that Jones would not go AWOL again.
He wanted to set .an ·example for · other soldiers who
might consider going AWOL, so ·.he handcuffed ·Jones
to a bed in the orderly room. Jones. remained there for
·3 days, uritil the mor~ing he signed out.
Eventually the incident was reported and· investigated. Captain Alden w·a s angry because hi•, actions
were being investigated. He felt hamstrung ·by legal
rules. He told the investigating officer that Jones was
"·a bum who deserved much harsher treatment than he
had received." His justific:;ation was that Jones had
already ruined the company's AWOL record once. His

the

74

ae·

---------------------------Chapter 4

COD'.}W~Y had a~c11mulated 60 AWOlrfree days by .the ·
time Jones was;~ ' be released. He wasn't about to take
a chance on Jones going AWOL again and ruining that ·
statistic.
....,
·
The investigating officer explained to Alden that
handcuffing Jones was not .only poor leadership, ,but it
also was illegal. Alden still believed he had done noth·ing wrong. Alden could have been court-martialed for ·
this incident. Instead, he received a written reprimand. .
Alden believed that his AWOL-free record was a ·key ·
indicator used by his seniors ·to judge his leadership ·
ability. He believed that handcuffing Jones to the bed
would contribute to u~t discipline .. He placed a high
value .on looking good through statistical indicators, but
not ·on justice and adherence to regulations. He knew it
was ·against Army. regUlations ·to confine Jones urilaw· ·
fully, but he believed he had cause to break the regulation& bi this case. These .beliefs and values had a direct .
· influence on his behavior. They caused. him to set· up a
climate :- j~.·~ '.the 'Company which contributed to J ories'
.poor peiformance.

If a leader holds the wrong beliefs and values, they
will affect his character, his thinking, and his behavior.
Alden 1s false beliefs about human nature and motivation were the root of his inability to provide direction,
to implement, and to motivate in battle. Keep "The
AWOL Incident" in mind as we discuss beliefs, values,
and norms.

BELIEFS, VALUES, AND NORMS
EXPLANATION

Beliefs are assumptions or convictions that you hold
to be true regarding people, concepts, or things. We all
have beliefs about things, concepts, and people. One
soldier may believe that duty simply means putting in
75

time from "8 to 5." Another may believe that duty is
selflessly serving your country, your unit, and the
soldiers of your unit.
You have beliefs about human nature-what makes
people tick. We usually cannot prove our beliefs scientifically, but we think and feel that they are true. The
following brief examples illustrate the meaning of beliefs.
Some people believe that a car is simply a means
of transportation. Others believe a car is a status
symbol. Captain Alden believed that troops are lazy,
that they must be motivated by fear. Lieutenant Colonel
Ross, the battalion commander in "The Face of Future
Battle," believed that having frank conversations with
troops about the strengths and weaknesses of their
company is meddling in the business of subordinates.
Colonel Chamberlain believed that troops could not
be threatened into fighting well in battle, but that they
had to be led. He also believed deeply that he had a
duty to fight for the ideals of the Union. People generally behave in accord with their beliefs. As these
examples show, the beliefs of leaders impact directly
on the leadership climate, cohesion, discipline, training,
and combat effectiveness of a unit.
Values are attitudes about the worth or importance
of people, concepts, or things. You may place high
value on a family heirloom, such as your grandfather's
watch, or on a clean, well-maintained car. You may
value personal comfort or freedom to travel. You may
value a friend, a relative, or an adult who helped you
as you were growing up.
Values influence your behavior because you use them
to weigh the importance of alternatives. For example,
a person who values personal pleasure more than he
values a fit, healthy body continually makes choices
about eating and exercising that will result in his becoming overweight and out of shape. Your values guide
you in choosing whether to go with your friends to a
concert or to a family gathering on your grandfather's
75th birthday.
76

For people to live together in harmony, they must
agree on certain beliefs and values which become group
norms (rules or laws) that members of the group follow.

Formal norms are official standards or laws that
govern behavior. Traffic signals, the Uniform Code of
Military Justice, and the Geneva convention are formal
norms that direct the behavior of American soldiers.
They dictate what actions are required or forbidden.
Uniform regulations, safety codes, and unit SOPs are
also formal norms.
Informal norms are unwritten rules or standards
that govern the behavior of group members. The 20th
Maine had an informal norm that the wounded were
evacuated after a battle, regardless of danger. At the
root of this norm was a shared value about the importance of caring for each other. They knew they could
be wounded at any time. Each member of the unit
found comfort in knowing that he would be cared for.
An informal norm that runs counter to unit goals
and to individual health is heavy drinking or drug
abuse. Soldiers who want to be considered "in" feel
peer pressure to comply with this informal norm. A
group of clerical workers may restrict their individual
output so that their supervisor cannot point to the high
producer as an example of what the others should do.
This restriction of production is an informal norm, one
that runs counter to unit effectiveness.

IMPORTANCE
Beliefs, values, and norms guide the actions of individuals and groups. They are like a traffic control
system; they are signals giving direction, meaning, and
purpose to our lives. They are powerful. People will risk
danger and will often die for deeply held beliefs and
values. Many early Christians died for their beliefs
because they valued service to God more than their
lives. Death in the service of God was an accepted
norm.
77

Examples abound of soldiers of different nations
throughout the history of war who sacrificed their lives
to save friends or to help their unit accomplish a mission. These brave, selfless actions include blocking
exploding grenades, personally taking out enemy machine gun positions, and manning key positions to protect a withdrawal. Beliefs and values motivate this
kind of heroic self-sacrifice. The motivating force may
be the soldier's belief in the importance of retaining
his personal honor, of saving a buddy, of helping the
unit, of serving a cause, or a combination of these. In
any case, beliefs and values are fundamental motivating
factors; leaders should nurture and shape them in
subordinates.
Your soldiers will fight for you if they believe that
the best chance for survival for themselves and their
buddies is to do their job as part of a team. They will
be more effective if they believe in themselves, in the
unit, in you, and in the cause for which they are :fighting.

DEVELOPMENT
As a leader you have the power to influence the
beliefs and values of your soldiers by setting the
example; by rewarding behavior that supports professional beliefs, values, and norms; and by planning and
conducting tough individual and collective training.
"Tough" training does not mean training in which
leaders haze or yell at troops in an effort to ca use ar·
tificial stress. This merely creates an antagonistic
atmosphere of "us against them." It is not the kind of
leadership that succeeds in combat, so why practice
bad habits? "Tough" training occurs when leaders and
troops go 't hrough realistic, exhausting conditions that
prepare leaders and troops, as a team, for the stress of
combat.
The 20th Maine marched over 100 miles in the
5 days prior to the Battle of Gettysburg. The night
before the battle they marched all night, got very little
rest, then fought ferociously. Training that simulates
such conditions is "tough."
78

During a field exercise, you could plan for an allnight road march, a few hours rest, then a simulated
battle that is demanding on leaders and troops. This
kind of training builds cohesion-positive respect and
trust among troops and between leaders and troops. It
builds a feeling of shared hardships and teamwork. It
contributes to the respect and comradeship that assist
you in influencing beliefs and values of soldiers.
Tough training will teach your soldiers to do things
as individuals and as a team that they did not believe
possible. It will give your soldiers confidence in themselves, in each other, and in you.
You can also influence the beliefs and values of
your soldiers when talking with them individually or
in groups. For example, at some appropriate time, tell
your soldiers why you believe each one of them should
have an equal opportunity for promotion or other rewards. Or tell your junior leaders why you believe it is
their duty as supervisors to ensure that every one of
their soldiers is properly fed and clothed in the field
and in garrison.
Remember, you can influence beliefs and values in
your soldiers by what you are and what you do.
As the leader, you must respect your soldiers and
have their respect if you are to influence their beliefs
and values. Respect is basic to all human relationships.
Strong friendships, strong marriages, and strong units
are based on respect. If there is mutual respect between
you and your soldiers, they will be motivated to follow
your orders. You then have only to communicate what
you want them to do-perform their duty as well as
they can. Even in the most desperate situations, like
Little Round ·Top, soldiers will follow someone they
respect.
Make it a general rule to think through situations
and choose the course of action that will gain you the
long-term respect of your subordinates, seniors, and
peers.
79

Chapter 4

Once your soldiers respect you and want your approval, you c.an guide them to demonstrate unselfish
concern for the unit and for other soldiers. They will
become concerned with excellence in everything that
relates to combat readiness if these are the values you
demonstrate. At each opportunity, you should praise
them for things they do that support duty, cohesiveness,
discipline, good training, and good maintenance. Praise
from a respected leader is a meaningful reward. Praise,
however, can be cheapened by overuse. Teaching and
correction, if constructive, provide needed direction for
new effort.
Human nature requires people to justify their actions.
If your troops respect you and behave according to
your values, they will naturally justify their behavior.
Most of them will do this by developing beliefs that
excellence in training and maintenance is right, that
selfless service to others and the unit is right, that
being courageous is right, and that defending the ideals
of America is right. In short, if they respect and
admire you, they want to be like you, and they naturally tend to adopt your professional beliefs and
values as their own.
Let us summarize this process because it is the key
to positive military leadership in peace and war. Your
soldiers respect you because you have demonstrated
character, knowledge, and professional skills in a series
of situations. When you tell them what to do, they do
it well because they want your approval and have confidence that you know your job and have their best
interests at heart. They then justify what they do by
developing beliefs and values to support their actions.
By this process your beliefs and values tend to become
instilled in them.
Something vital happens in the development of a
cohesive unit if the majority of your people respect you
and want your approval. By the process described, you
instill your values in most of your soldiers. You then
have a unit with shared values, or group norms, on
such matters as loyalty, responsibility, selfless service,
80

Chapter 4

training, maintenance, discipline, and other beliefs and
values important to combat readiness. Your unit has
shared beliefs on professional knowledge and methods
of providing direction, implementing, and motivating.
These shared beliefs and values become formal and
informal norms that govern the behavior of everyone
in the unit. When new soldiers come in, the old hands
quickly let them know the norms of the unit.
A characteristic of human nature is that when
people join a new group, they want to be accepted and
to make friends. Therefore, most new soldiers will go
along with the group norms of their new unit to ensure
acceptance. They will then tend to justify following the
norms by adopting the beliefs and values that underlie
the norms. Through this process-called socializationthe beliefs and values of the old-timers in the unit
become the beliefs and values of the new soldiers.
Obviously, there are exceptions to this which will
be discussed later. This basic socialization process,
however, is usually the way that soldiers are integrated
into a unit. It is how they develop beliefs about the
right way to behave in that unit. This is why the reception and integration program of a unit is so crucial;
it plays an important role in determining the beliefs
and values that the new soldier develops. That is why
you want one of your best soldiers to sponsor a new
soldier and to ensure he learns the right norms and
values.

INFLUENCE
Captain Alden's soldiers did not respect him. Therefore, he had a negative influence over his soldiers'
beliefs and values. They distrusted Alden so much that
they would develop beliefs in opposition to those that
he held. If Alden were to say, "Men, I believe we can
take that hill with a night attack," his soldiers would
probably mumble, "I don't believe that is the right
thing to do, let him take it himself." Alden would probably have to threaten them to make them obey his
orders.
81

In contrast, Chamberlain and his subordinate leaders
had a positive influence on the beliefs and values of
their soldiers. When Chamberlain gave the order at
Little Round Top to fix bayonets and prepare to charge,
his soldiers knew that he was saying to them, "Men, I
believe this is the right thing to do."
They knew they were in a desperate situation, but
they were not going to run. That was not the norm in
the 20th Maine. They had been in other tight situations,
and they had never run.
Probably these thoughts were going through their
minds: "I believe in Chamberlain. His quick thinking
has saved us before. If he says fix bayonets and prepare to charge, that is the right thing to do in this
situation. I'll fix my bayonet and charge when he gives
the order."
Randall's unit was like Chamberlain's because the
leaders used the same leadership philosophy. Remember
what Sergeant Wills said to Major Williams about
C Company's attack on the enemy battalion? He said
that no one questioned the order. If Randall said to
attack, that must be the right thing to do.
During training, the troops of C Company came to
believe in Randall and their other unit leaders and to
adopt their beliefs about how to fight. They adopted
their leaders' professional values of loyalty, responsi-

bilityt and selfless service. These shared beliefs and
values became norms that influenced training, maintenance, cohesiveness, discipline, and the will to fight.
Your unit has both formal and informal leaders
who can influence your soldiers' beliefs and the norms
that will lead to cohesion, discipline, and the will to
fight.
Formal leaders are noncommissioned, warrant, and
commissioned officers. The nation has given authority
to those soldiers, along with special trust and confidence that they will use it to serve the Army and the
nation. This authority is derived from law. It gives
these leaders power over their soldiers. It does not
82

----------------------------------------------------~ Chapter4

ensure that this power will be used well. Rank identifies
those who are formally entrusted with responsibility.
You become a positive leader when your rank is ratified
in the minds and hearts of your subordinates, when
your troops follow you out of respect and confidence
and not out of fear of your authority.
Informal leaders attract followers because of the
strength of their character. They have energy, drive,
and will. They know what they want and go after it.
They are positive leaders, often without authority, who
can work either for your beliefs, values, and goals, or
against them. A private may have a great deal of influence over the soldiers in a platoon, especially if he
is the platoon athlete or has a magnetic personality. A
junior NCO may be the most influential NCO in the
platoon, if his more senior NCOs lack leadership skills
or character.
Informal leaders can help or harm mission accomplishment. You need to find out who they are and
ensure that they use their influence to support professional values and the goals of your unit. Informal
leaders often emerge unexpectedly in combat. "Commando" Kelly is an example of such a soldier.
Charles E. Kelly was a slightly built, easy-going,
friendly private when the American invasion of Sicily
began in September 1943. No one in his company suspected that he would be a great combat leader. Four
days after the invasion began, Kelly's Company L,
143d Infantry of the 36th (Texas) Infantry Division
was stopped by heavy machine-gun fire. Kelly asked
his captain's permission to reconnoiter the enemy position. He led four other volunteers on the patrol. They
located the enemy gun. Kelly silenced the enemy machine gun and killed about 40 attacking German
soldiers. Later that afternoon he found himself leading
a force of about 100 soldiers who had been cut off by
a German counterattack. In the course of about
24 hours of fighting, Kelly burned out the barrels of a
machine gun and. several automatic .rifles, fired six

bazooka shells, took the safety pins out of mortar shells
and threw them at the rushing enemy, broke up an
enemy attack with a 37-mm antitank gun, and led the
survivors to friendly lines. By nightfall of that day he
was already famous in the Texas Division as "Commando" Kelly. For his heroic actions and leadership,
he was awarded the Medal of Honor/
As a leader you should use your influence to promote
unit cohesion and discipline. You do this when you• Show sincere concern for all subordinate leaders and
troops in your unit. By being concerned with the personal and professional values, needs, and goals of your
soldiers and by being deeply involved in all unit training and activities, you will sense who the informal
leaders are. You will see which soldiers influence others
and how they use that influence. Chapter 10 gives you
concrete ways to get to know your soldiers and to
ensure that the informal leaders use their power for
positive unit goals that lead to combat readiness.

~--~~--~----~------------~~----~--------------- Chapter4

• Gain and maintain the respect of both your subordinate (formal) leaders and the informal leaders. Then
they will adopt your beliefs, values, concepts, and
methods and convince other soldiers to do the same. If
you cannot gain the respect of both your informal and
subordinate leaders, you have a problem. Either something is wrong with you, or .something is wrong with
them. It may be that the informal leaders have strong
character, like gang leaders, but not honorable character that builds the values of loyalty, responsibility, and
selfless service. In any event, get advice and help from
your seniors, peers, a chaplain, a command sergeant
major, an inspector general NCO or officer-at least
one or more people you respect. Weigh their advice
carefully. If you decide you are in the wrong, take
corrective action. Perhaps one or more of the informal
or subordinate leaders are in the wrong and refuse to
adopt your beliefs about duty, training, and professional
standards that lead to combat effectiveness. Then you
must" separate them from your unit or take other
appropriate action to stop their negative influence.
• Remain firm when you sincerely believe you are right,
even if it means the whole squad, platoon, or company
is temporarily angry at you. In the long run, if you
are right, they will know it and respect your courage.
• Admit to all concerned tha.t you were wrong, if you
did something you believed to be right at the time and
circumstances later proved you wrong. This takes humility and moral courage, but you will gain respect in
the long run. Some people think it ·is a sign of weakness to apologize, that a leader loses power if he does.
That is not true. It shows strong character. We are all
human; we all make mistakes. If you wronged a unit
or a soldier, have the humility and the courage to
admit it. You might find that the simple act of acknowledging your error to the individuals involved
makes a big difference when it comes time for that
unit or soldier to follow you into battle.
85

PROFESSIONAL VALUES AND ETHICS
THE PROFESSIONAL ARMY ETHIC
The basic professional beliefs and values that you
should hold and constantly strive to instill in your
subordinate leaders and soldiers are loyalty to the
ideals of the nation, loyalty to the unit, personal responsibility, and selfless service.
These four values make up the professional Army
ethic, and they should be the basic values of all soldiers. You may have the rank of a noncommissioned,
warrant, or commissioned officer, but if you do not
live up to these values under pressure, you are not yet
a professional military leader.
Society gives Army leaders authority to build an
effective force that can protect its citizens and its national interests. When society gives professionals powersometimes life and death power-members of society
trust the professionals to use that power for the good
of society and not for the self-interest of the professional. Unfortunately, history has proven that power
tends to corrupt, often unconsciously, and some people
will use power for selfish reasons. Therefore, professionals have a code of ethics to guide them in using
their power. This code helps the professional avoid
giving in to temptation, human weakness, and
corruption.
The values of the professional Army ethic flow from

American ideals found in the Constitution and the
Declaration nf Independence. Throughout American
military history, these values have been the bedrock of
our best military leaders and soldiers. It is by following
professional ethics-principles of conduct, and standards of behavior-that soldiers achieve "moral" or
"right" behavior that exemplifies the ideals and values
of this nation.
FM 100-1 states: "As a profession-a calling which
demands of its members specialized knowledge and
skills, and intensive preparation-it is imperative that
the military profession embrace a professional ethic.
In this ethic should be set forth those values and
86

Chapter 4

principles of conduct which govern our behavior both
as a group and as individuals. Furthermore, such a
professional ethic must be understood and accepted in
its totality by individuals at every level of military
operations-from the soldier on point, to the field
commander, to the general officer testifying before
Congress. It is true, therefore, that while personal value
systems or ethics may vary from individual to individual,
professional integrity demands of each soldier an
uncompromising commitment to those institutional
values which form the bedrock of our profession-the
Army ethic. "2
Loyalty to the Ideals of the Nation. The fundamental value of the professional Army ethic is loyalty
to the ideals of the nation: "This value implies recognition that the Army exists solely to serve and defend
the nation. It represents unswerving loyalty" to the
ideal values of the nation and the Army-"directed
upward through the chain of command, and accepts
as proper and fitting the subservience of the military
to civilian control. It demands total adherence to the
spirit and letter of the lawful order, to the fullest of
one's comprehension of that order."3
To a true military professional, loyalty to the ideals

of the nation means a deep belief in serving and defending the ideals of freedom, justice, truth, and equality
found in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. It is the sworn duty of military leaders to
defend these ideals; numerous wars in the past two
centuries have been fought to preserve them. These
ideals will guide you if personal and professional
values ever .conflict. Legal and moral actions that
assist the Army in defending these ideals are right.
Actions that are contrary to the ideals or principles
upon which this nation was founded are wrong.
2FM 100.1, p 23.
3FM 100-1, p 24.

87

Chapter 4

Loyalty to the ideals of the nation underlies our
other professional values. Being a professional leader
means being selfless, honorable, and committed to serving the ideals of the nation. True leaders are always
more concerned with service to America than they are
with promotion or glory.
American military professionals do not fight to impose our political system on others by force or to gain
power or wealth. They are not simply professional
killers or managers of violence. Professional soldiers
are protectors of the ideals of America, willing to sacrifice their lives defending and fighting for these ideals
so that others can live in a free and just society. To
do this they must be experts at leading soldiers in
battle.
The military leader who deeply values loyalty to the
nation sees himself as a person who will always do
his best to defend American ideals.
Loyalty to the Unit. This second value of the profession al Army ethic implies a two-way obligation
between those who lead and those who are led; an obligation to conserve lives, to be considerate of the wellbeing of one's subordinates and comrades, to instill a
sense of devotion and pride in the unit, and to develop
the cohesiveness and loyalty that mold individuals into
effective fighting organizations."
Your unit is your piece of the Army's action, your

day·to·day part of the Army. By contributing to your
unit's mission and combat readiness, you contribute to
the Army's mission and the defense of the nation. The
unit is your family, your team. Loyalty to the unit
means that members of the unit place the needs and
goals of the unit ahead of their own personal needs
and goals. "Commando" Kelly showed this value when
he volunteered to risk his life looking for the enemy
machine gun that was stopping his company.
Personal Responsibility. "Essential to the proper
expression of loyalty" to the nation "and unit is a deep
sense of personal responsibility, the third fundamental
4FM 100-1, p 24.

88

~--------------------------------------------------~ Chapter4

value of the Army ethic. Personal responsibility equates
to the individual obligation to accomplish all assigned
tasks to the fullest of one's capability; to abide by all
commitments, be they formal or informal; and to seize
every opportunity for individual growth and improvement. This value also requires of each of us a willingness to accept full responsibility not only for our own
actions, but also for the actions of those in our charge.''6
Colonel Chamberlain showed this value at Little Round
Top when he accepted responsibility for holding the
ground at all costs. The soldiers of the 20th Maine
risked their lives out of this deep sense of responsibility.
Responsibility includes the age-old soldierly values
of duty and honor. As a professional, your responsibility
is to do your duty-what ought to be done-in an
honorable way. The honorable way accords with the
moral values of truth and justice. You have honor if
you morally and courageously do your duty to the best
of your ability.
A leader who lies or tells a half-truth to make his
unit look good on a report may think he is doing his
duty and being loyal to his commander and unit. In
fact, he is being dishonorable and unethical, neglecting
his duty to the Army and the nation. A leader cannot
truly do his duty without being honorable.
A good rule to follow about responsibility is this:
You will carry out your responsibility as a professional
soldier if you always do your duty in an honorable
way.
Selfless Service. Service in the professional Army
requires teamwork which emphasizes the greater good
of the nation and the Army.
Selfless service means putting the needs and goals
of the nation, the Army, your unit, and your soldiers
ahead of your personal needs and interests. As a leader,
you must be the greatest "servant" in your unit. You
are not given authority, status, and position as a personal reward to enjoy in comfort. You are given them
so that you may be of greater service to your subordinates, your unit, and your country.
5FM 100-1, p 24.

89

Chapter 4

A successful leader should be perceived as the
hardest-working member of the unit. That does not
imply that he does the same work as his subordinates.
He does work appropriate to his position and thereby
assists his subordinates in getting each job done.

FOUR SOLDIERLY VALUES
Courage, candor, competence, and commitment are
four qualities or traits of character which must be .
valued by all soldiers. They should be the foundation
of your character. The more you build these traits in
yourself and others, the more successful you will be.
In order for them to become traits, you must first believe in and value them.
Courage comes in two forms. Physical courage is ·
overcoming fears of bodily harm and doing your duty.
Chamberlain and his soldiers showed great physical
courage at Little Round Top. Moral courage is overcoming fears of other than bodily harm while doing
what ought to be done. It is the courage to stand firm
on your values, your moral principles, your convictions.
You show moral courage when you do something based
on one of your values or moral principles, knowing
that the action may not be in your best interest. After
the Civil War, General Chamberlain ran for governor
of Maine. He was faced with many pressures to make
political promises of jobs and benefits to various people
who had the power to influence the election in his
favor. He stubbornly refused, based on moral principle,
knowing that he was hurting his chances to become
governor.
There will be times when honestly stating your true
beliefs to your seniors or the group may not be in your
best interest-it may hurt your chances for promotion
or even ruin your whole career. These times will test
whether or not you have the moral courage to "stand
up and be counted."
Candor is being frank, open, honest, and sincere
with your soldiers, seniors, and peers. It is an expression of personal integrity. Captain Randall showed this
90

Chapter 4

trait in his many talks with his soldiers and subordinate leaders. Colonel Chamberlain showed it when he
persuaded the 2d Maine mutineers to join the 20th
Maine.
Competence is proficiency in required professional
knowledge, judgment, and skills. Each leader must have
it to train and to develop a cohesive, disciplined unit
with all the required individual and collective skills to
win on the battlefield against superior numbers. Colonel
Chamberlain and Captain Randall showed great competence. Competence builds confidence in one's self and
one's unit-crucial elements of morale, courage, and
success on the battlefield.
Commitment means the dedication to carry out all
unit missions and to serve the values of the country,
the Army, and the unit. This is shown by doing your
best to contribute to the Army, to train and develop
your unit, and to help your soldiers develop professionally and personally. Chamberlain demonstrated commitment by his words and deeds. Patriotism, duty,
courage, and the high ideals of America were real to
him. He transmitted this commitment to his soldiers.
In so doing, Chamberlain reinforced the determination
of his soldiers to do their part to save the Union.

ETHICAL DILEMMAS
A dilemma is a situation presenting two or more
undesirable alternatives. You face a "simple" dilemma
when you choose between going hungry or eating something you really dislike. An ethical dilemma occurs
when two or more values conflict or collide. When you
find yourself in an ethical dilemma, you must search
for the morally RIGHT thing to do. The right thing to
do is the moral action that best serves the ideals of
America and your soldiers. The "highest moral good"
is what professional ethics are all about.
If you make the right decisions when faced with
ethical problems, you will continually build your character and your leadership. If you fall into the trap of
91

Chapter 4

taking the easy way once or twice, however, you will
tend to justify your actions and then begin to erode
your character. Your people will sense this over a
period of time and gradually lose respect for you. You
will then be forced to use coercion to motivate them
and will eventually lose the necessary foundation for
positive, inspired leadership.

PRESSURES TO BE UNETHICAL
A principle, a belief, or a value is but a concept
until it is tested under stress. Anyone can be ethical
when there is no pressure to be unethical. If you are a
professional, you will resist all pressures to be unethical. Such temptation can come from many directions.
It can come from within you, from peers, from subordinates, or from seniors.

Pressure from Self-Interest. Self-interest is probably
the most common cause of unethical acts. An individual
does something to improve his personal situation or to
avoid criticism or punishment.
Let us say you are a student in an Army course. If
you get an A on this exam you will be an honor graduate, and that will enhance your promotion opportunities. You are wrestling with a tricky multiple-choice
question that you feel will make the difference between
an A or B. You deliber&te between responses B and D.
You decide to circle B. You are almost finished with
the exam when you hear some students in the hall
discussing the solution to the question that troubled
you. Someone says, "Son of a gun, I thought for sure
the answer to that question was B." That tells you that
B is wrong and the answer has to be D. What do you
do?
Self-interest is driving you to say, "Well, I didn't
intentionally cheat. I didn't hear them say D was correct, just that B is not right." Then your conscience
grabs you. "Not everyone had access to that information. I'll be taking advantage of others if I change my
answer."
92

Chapter 4

This is a small incident. The student in this case
left his answer as B, knowing the answer was wrong.
Some would argue that such action is stupid. Rather,
it shows that he values honesty and has the integrity
of character to act on that value in the face of temptation. His act is similar to Abe Lincoln's when, as a
boy, he walked 3 miles to repay three cents to a lady
who had accidentally overpaid him. This habit of being
ethical on little things tends to carry over to the big
things.
Here is another example. Regulations require that
you periodically conduct a "serial number" inventory
of all weapons in your arms room and sign a voucher
indicating that the inventory has been accomplished.
If you try to save time by conducting "muzzle count"
inventories, but your signature indicates that you have
conducted "serial number" inventories, you are lying
for your own self-interest. A leader's word and signature are his bond. The readiness of our Army depends
on integrity in all leaders.
Lying about conducting a security check, signing an
inflated voucher for per diem expenses, and cheating
on income taxes are all examples of unethical acts
caused by a person's valuing self-interest more than
integrity and responsibility. If a leader's word and
signature are not his bond, there is no basis for the
trust, confidence, and respect that are so essential to
cohesive units. Honesty in all leaders is basic to a disciplined, cohesive, combat-ready Army. Dishonesty in
leaders rots the fabric that binds an Army together.
Self-interest seems less obvious as a motive when
you do unethical things for your unit. But usually such
things are done because they will make you look better.
Examples of this are stealing a part from another
vehicle to get yours off "deadline" and borrowing equipment from another unit so that your unit can pass an
inspection or inventory. In these examples you are helping your unit look better, but only because you expect
to gain personally from your actions. Self-interest, therefore, is still the main ~otivation.

Chapter4 ~--------------------------------------------------~

Pressure from a Peer. A buddy can also put pressure
on you to behave unethically. He can ask to borrow
some of your unit's equipment to help his unit pass
inspection or inventory. In this case he is doing something unethical for his own self-interest. If you go along
with his request, you would be acting wrongly because
of peer pressure.
Peer pressure to use marijuana at a party may
induce you to behave unethically. Other examples include a friend asking you to "forget" that you saw him
physically assault one of his subordinates, or to falsify
the score on his PT test so he can qualify for a course
he desires to enter. These are all examples of pressures
for you to commit unethical acts even when you personally gain nothing from the acts except a peer's
appreciation. They are, however, breeches of professional ethics because they involve misrepresenting the
truth. They contribute to an unethical climate in that
they condone and encourage the unethical behavior of
others.
Pressure from Subordinates. The following case,
based on facts, shows how subordinates can apply pressure to their leaders to be unethical.
A squad in Vietman was given the mission to go
on a long, dangerous reconnaissance patrol. The
weather was rainy and miserable. The young squad
leader did not want the mission any more than his
soldiers did,, but he knew it was an important and
necessary mission.
Shortly after moving out, one of the informal leaders
and several troops in the squad came to the squad
leader. The informal leader said, "Sarge, the men don't
think we should have gotten this mission. We're getting more than our share of the hard missions. Besides,
this mission is too dangerous. A squad is not big
enough for the enemy .forces out there. We could all
get killed. I rotate to the States in 2 weeks, and I plan
to be in one piece; so do the other guys. The men feel
that you didn't stick up for them when the platoon
94

----------------------------------------------------~ Chapter4

leader gave you that mission. They think you care
more about promotion than you do about them. There's
a rumor that you want to get us into a big fight just
so you can get promoted and that you asked the lieutenant for this mission. I'm just telling you the way it
is, Sarge.
"I'll tell you what you could do to let the men know
how wrong they are and that you really do care about
them. We could go out in the jungle for 1,000 meters
and relax for the day. You could call in reports every
hour indicating we are at certain checkpoints. No one
will ever know we didn't pull the patrol. What do you
say, Sarge?" As you read this, the answer seems so
obvious. But, when it occurs in reality, the temptation
to give in to this kind of pressure from others can be
great.
At some point you will face pressure from below to
be unethical. As a · professional, you must never give
in to it. Not only would it have been unethical to do
what the squad members wanted in this case, it would
also have destroyed real respect for the squad leader
and ruined his power as a leader. This is the difference
between being popular and being respected.
Here is one approach to handle this situation. Get
the whole squad together, and talk to them along these
lines. "As long as I lead this squad, we will always

carry out orders. I will not tolerate, or be a party to,
any dishonesty. I understand you think I asked for this
mission. That is not true. I hear that you think I want
to get in a fight so I can get promoted. That's not true
either. But we have a mission, and as long as I am
the squad leader we're going to do it properly without
unnecessarily endangering anyone. Now prepare to
move out."
You should then have a private counseling session
with the informal leader. Tell him the following. You
are reporting the incident to the platoon sergeant and
platoon leader. You will be watching him closely. He
had best use his influence to support you, or you will
95

Chapter 4

consider recommending that appropriate action be taken
against him. There is not much distance between the
rumors he has spread and "inciting troops to mutiny"
which is a serious court-martial offense. Let him know,
very strongly, that you will not tolerate his lack of
s~pport.

This approach, or one similar to it, will reinforce
the traditional Army values of loyalty, responsibility,
and selfless service. It will show your soldiers that you
have the courage of your convictions and that you do
not fear being unpopular. This deprives them of their
ability to manipulate you.
Here is an example of indirect pressure from subordinates to be unethical. A company executive officer or
first sergeant falsifies C ration consumption records to
build an excess of C rations to trade for lumber and
paint to improve the dayroom and the barracks.
Although this action may be motivated by a desire
to help subordinates, it is still unethical for two reasons. It violates integrity, and it violates the leader's
responsibility to the Army.
The company executive officer or first sergeant may
be improving the living conditions of his soldiers by
accumulating excess C rations, but he is guilty of
misusing government property. He is violating regulations and being dishonest at the expense of other units

and the Army. How can he expect his troops to be
honest and to obey regulations when they see his
example?
A squad leader who lies about his patrol location
may keep his soldiers out of danger, but other soldiers
may die because of his failure to do his duty and to
accomplish his mission. As the 20th Maine demonstrated at Gettysburg, one small unit doing its duty
can make a decisive difference in a battle and even in
a war.
Pressure from a Senior. Pressure to be unethical can
come from seniors and their desire to "look good" on
inspections, statistics, and activities that are visible to
96

Chapter 4

their seniors. Your senior can pressure you to do things
with the direct or implied threat of an adverse efficiency report. He might say "I don't care how you do
it, but get those vehicles off deadline in the next
5 days." He might tell you to collect at least a certain
amount for a charitable fund drive.
Even if your superior is a supportive, positive type
of leader, he represents the Army chain of command.
This in itself can cause indirect pressure upon you to
behave unethically. For example, any time you are
tempted to lie to make your unit "look better, you may
reason that the pressure to lie is from a senior. But
chances are that the pressure to act unethically is not
from your senior or your unit, but rather from your
own self-interest-to make you look better.
Perceived or real pressure from a senior is never an
excuse to behave unethically. You must be absolutely
honest with yourself before you can be honest with
others.

AN ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESS
Regardless of the source of the pressure to act unethically, you usually know in your heart the right
thing to do. The real question is whether or not you
have the character to live by professional values when
under pressure. If you have the values explained in this
chapter, the right thing to do in most situations will
normally be clear, and you will do it.
You will sometimes find yourself in complex situations where the ethical alternative is not clear. These
are the true ethical dilemmas where two or more deeply
held values collide. In such situations you need a reasoning process to assist you in deciding what course
of action results in the greater moral good.
We will explain and illustrate an ethical decisionmaking process to help you think through ethical
dilemmas.
97

Chapter 4

THE ETHICAL REASONING PROCESS

LEGAL AND
REGULATORY
STANDARDS
BASIC
NATIONAL
VALUES
TRADITIONAL
ARMY
VALUES

INDIVIDUAL
VALUES

The ethical reasoning process takes place within you
from the time you confront a problem until you develop
and implement a solution. In the process you analyze
the problem, identify influencing forces, develop possible
courses of action, assess them, and decide on a course
of action. A variety of forces influences the ethical reasoning process. Principal forces that you should consider are defined as follows:
• Legal standards-formal regulatory standards contained in law.
·
• ·Basic national values-values established in the Constitution, Declaration of Independence, and other documents and traditions that provide the foundation for
required behavior of all Americans.
• Traditional Army values-values the Army establishes as standards of required behavior for all soldiers.
They are loyalty to the nation's ideals, loyalty to the
unit, personal responsibility, selfless service, courage,
competence, candor, and commitment.
98

----------------------------------------------------~ Chapter4

• Actual Army values-values actually functioning in the
local unit that produce the standards governing day-today soldier behavior. Actual Army values are often the
same as traditional Army values. There are times, however, when they are not-such as careerism, falsifying
records, and borrowing another unit's equipment to display as your own for an inspection.
• Individual values-values held by the individual
soldiers involved in the situation.
• Institutional pressures-elements of Army policies,
procedures, operations, and other aspects which influence the ethical behavior of soldiers.
These six forces may not be the only important
forces that you should identify and consider. Ethics is
a part of leadership. Therefore your reasoning process
should also consider the four factors of leadership explained in chapter 2-the follower, the leader, communication, and the situation. The four factors of leadership
and the six principal forces defined here are guides to
help you determine the course of action which you
believe leads to the highest moral good.
Ethics are rules or standards that guide professionals to do the moral or right thing-what you ought
to do. As a leader, you have an obligation to do the
right thing. We are sometimes faced with dilemmas
where two or more values collide. You must decide
which value will lead to the highest moral good-that
moral outcome which best helps the Army serve the
ideals of the nation. You then choose the course of
action you believe will lead to the highest moral good.
The ethical reasoning process is an excellent way
to think through all factors of an ethical dilemma and
arrive at a course of action that will lead to the highest
moral good. Once you have analyzed all the factors and
forces involved, the concept of the highest moral good
clarifies your thinking on the right thing to do. Look
at the values that are in conflict. Determine what value
99

Chapter 4

will lead to the highest moral good. Then determine
which course of action you think will best lead to the
highest moral good.
The following case is based on fact. You should apply
the ethical decision-making process and the highest
moral good to this case.

Incident in the Personnel
and Administration Center
Staff Sergeant Sanchez was the personnel sergeant
of a medical battalion. Several months ago she had
replaced a sergeant first class who was relieved after a
di vision inspection team found serious deficiencies in
the battalion }lersonnel and administration center
(PAC). She had been the SIDPERS clerk for her first
4 months in the unit. Because of her demonstrated competence, initiative, and sense of responsibility, she· bad
been promoted to staff sergeant and assigned as the
personnel sergeant.
·
Sergeant Sanchez's strengths were her basic knowledge of administration and organization, her ability to
teach subordinates, and her skill at building a cohesive,
disciplined team. Her weakness was simply inexperience
with· checking the various personnel systems to ensure

that records, reports, and paperwork were properly 'processed, suspensed, and completed. In other words, she
had much to learn about the pitfalls and mechanics of
supervising a PAC. She had to spend time educating
herself and training her inexperienced clerks.
Three months ago the battalion had been inspected
by a division inspection team. The team found significant problem areas in the PAC that impacted on ·the
battalion's ability to accomplish its mission and properly
take care of its soldiers. The battalion commander and
executive officer (XO) had placed some blame on Lieutenant Freeman, the adjutant. However, they had decided

100

Chapter 4

that the main problem was the poor leadership ability
of the personnel sergeant. He was technically competent,
but he could not teach the clerks or supervise them as
an effective team. The personnel sergeant was reassigned, and because no E7 personnel sergeant was available, Sergeant Sanchez had been assigned as the PAC
sergeant. Under her leadership, the PAC was beginning
to serve the battalion effectively.
The PAC was scheduled for a major command inspection. Staff Sergeant Sanchez, Lieutenant Freeman, and
the clerks had been working nights and weekends to
prepare for it. The main problem areas in the PAC had
been lack of organization and individual training of
PAC clerks. Sergeant Sanchez, concentrating heavily on
these two areas, had made significant progress.
The day before the inspection, however, Sergeant
Sanchez, in working with the clerk in charge of enlisted
evaluation reports (EER), discovered a deficiency that
could be serious were the inspection team to find it.
Because of the clerk's oversight and lack of PAC organization, five EERs had been misplaced 2 months ago.
They had not been sent to the raters. Therefore, the
EERs were already late. The inspection team could fail
the PAC for this deficiency. Sergeant Sanchez immediately reported this discrepancy to the adjutant and the
battalion XO.
The battalion XO was worried. The commander had
made him personally responsible for the results of this
inspection. The chain of command had made it clear
that people might be "relieved" if any battalion failed.
Sergeant Sanchez was very concerned. Her job would
be in danger if the PAC failed. The XO, Lieutenant
Freeman, and Sergeant Sanchez discussed the chance
that the team would find ·the deficiency and . fail them, . _:
for it. The following points were made. It ·was ·not fair~ :·: ·.

an accideb.t~a·simple human oversight? Someone mentioned that a little pencil work could cover the deficiency. No one would know the difference. After the
major command inspection team left, Sergeant Sanchez
could have the EERs completed. The PAC would be
criticized by division· for submitting late EERs, but
that would not be as -bad. as failing a major command
inspection.
The battalion XO said that. he sure would sleep easier
if he knew that somehow the inspectors would find
nothing wrong with the EERs. Lieutenant Freeman
sort of grinned and said that the personnel sergeant
might be able to perfQrm a little ''pencil doctoring!•
They both fo<>ked at Sergeant Sanchez, awaiting her
reaction.
She kn~w what they wanted-an eaay way out, a
look <or a word from her that would tell them not to
worry~something ·like. 0~o sweat, I'll handle it, sir." As
they looked at her, she began to feel fear and anxiety~.
her heart pounded too fast, her stomach felt dry and
knotted, and her hands began to shake. She forced her·
self to remain cool and tQ think clearly•. Some ethical
considerations that ·she .recalled from an ethics case
study raced thmU.JJi her alert mind:
• Legal :regulatory .;~:nda~d$>(records must be truthful).
• National val11e8 (ttjit}>;):
• Traditional ArDly values (candor, ·I;~sponsibility to do

yout duty in an ethical way).

·

• Actual ArDly values (she :bad heard that "pencil doctoring,, was common in many units, that some admin~i
istrative people believe,d that · t hey must ~do it .to sQtVive
and get promoted)..
.
.
• Individual values (she valued candor-honesty-but
she also valued her job and protnoti6ii).
• Institutional pressures (the XO $ltd_ ti~teaallt Freeman were clearly pressuring }J.er. If sh~ covered up the
deficiency, she would please them ·and enhance her efficiency report. If• she ·did not, she· risked their anger, a
bad rating, or even relief ftom·her.job).

102

Chapter 4

GOOD LEADERS
HAVE THE
CHARACTER
TO MAKE ETHICAL
DECISIONS WHILE
UNDER STRESS

She asked herself what was the highest moral good?
The answer was simple, if she were to be a true professional. She knew that false reporting and "covering up'~
undermine the Army's combat readiness. Her professional values and character guided her in deciding on
a course of action.
She said, "Sir, I have never falsified records and
never will. I am a professional and responsible for ·the
validity of personnel records and actions. I won't allow
anyone to falsify them in any way. We have a good
personnel administration program. We are straight ex-

cept for a few deficiencies. If they fire us over those
EERs, well,. then I'm in the wrong Army anyway.
They'll find things wrong, but they'll also see the tremendous effort and improvement we've made since the
IG. They might not even notice those EERs.
"I think we should write a memorandum that explains honestly that we have found this fault in our
program through our own inspection system. The EERs
were not sent to the raters due to oversight because our
attention was on other overriding priorities-organizing
the PAC and training the ·clerks. The EERs will ~e completed and submitted as soon as possible. This will

103

Chapter 4

show them that we have an effective overall program,
that we have our own inspection system to find flaws
in our program, and that we take quick, honest corrective action when we find problems.''
Sergeant Sanchez's example of ethical thinking and
moral courage momentarily shamed the others and
helped give them the moral courage to do the right
thing. They agreed that she was right. They wrote the
memorandum. The inspecting team came the next day
and praised the improvement in the overall personnel
and administration program of the battalion. (They
never noticed the EER problem.) The PAC was rated
as highly satisfactory.

Cases like these do not always have a happy ending.
Some inspection teams would praise the p~rsonnel sergeant for her handling of the EER problem if they
noticed it. Others might fail the PAC for such a deficiency. You will not always be rewarded for integrity
and candor. The point is that you have to live with
yourself. Your honor is an intangible psychological possession. Before you can gain the respect of others, you
must have self-respect. You gain honor and keep it by
doing your duty in an ethical way, having the character to act by the traditional Army values.

COMPLEX .E THICAL DILEMMAS
It may seem to you that the ethical reasoning process is too mechanical. You may think you do not need
it if you have the will and moral courage to be honest.
For most situations, this is true. The case just discussed
is not difficult to resolve for an honest leader. The
"right" alternative is clear. However, it is a simple
example of a real ethical dilemma. -Its purpose is to
illustrate the use of the ethical reasoning process and
104

~---------------------------------------------------- Chapter4

the concept of the highest moral good. Once you understand how to handle a simple example, you are better
prepared for the more complex dilemmas that haunt
leaders who bear the great burden of responsibility for
people's lives.
The Caine Mutiny is a classic war novel by Herman
Wouk about a young Navy lieutenant at sea who
found himself faced with a complex ethical dilemma in
which the "morally right" alternative was not clear at
all. Over a period of months the lieutenant and other
officers on the ship began to believe that Captain
Queeg, the ship's captain, was insane and incapable of
command. When they became convinced of this, they
were in a dangerous combat situation at sea. What
should they do?
On the one hand they sincerely believed that Queeg
was going to fail in his mission and destroy the ship
and the crew. On the other hand, they knew their evidence was questionable and that if they relieved him
of command, they could be court-martialed for mutiny
on the high seas during war. They did mutiny and
later had to justify their actions before a court-martial.
The Caine Mutiny is a book worth reading by all military leaders.
If you ever decide to violate a regulation or law,
you must be able to show that your actions were not
motivated by self-gain, but by the highest moral good.
You must be able to show that the situation was so
unique that you had to violate a regulation, law, or
ethical rule to do the most moral thing in terms of the
ideals of this nation.
If you ever find yourself in such an ethical dilemma,
think through the ethical reasoning process and the
concept of the highest moral good. Then, before you
take action, ask yourself if you could justify the morality
of your actions before a group of your peers and
seniors. If you could, then be true to yourself and the
principles for which this nation stands, and do what
you believe is right.
105

SUMMARY
This chapter has examined beliefs, values, and
ethics. What you are (your beliefs, values, ethics, and
character) is the essence of your ability to lead. Your
ability to inspire soldiers to do the right thing, the
brave thing, the things they think they cannot do,
flows from what you are.
Beliefs and values have great motivating power.
Under some circumstances, people will die for their
beliefs and values. If you are a respected leader of
character, you will have significant power to influence
the beliefs and values of your soldiers. As a professional, you are sworn to use that power for the good
of the country, your unit, and those you lead.

CHAPTER 5

The Character
of a Leader

This chapter defines character, shows its importance, explains important traits of character, and discusses how you can build honorable character in yourself and your subordinates.

DEFINITION AND EXPLANATION
OF CHARACTER
A trait is a distinguishing quality or characteristic
of a person. Character is defined as the sum total of
an individual's personality traits and the link between
a person's values and his behavior. Your character is
the combination of personality traits that allows you
to behave consistently according to your values, regardless of the circumstances.
A person's visible behavior is an indication of his
character. When you are in tough situations, you will
find that successful leadership takes courage, will, initiative, compassion, and flexibility. The combination of
107

Chapter 5

traits that you need to succeed in the range of situations you will face cannot be simply listed. There is no
formula. There are times when you have to be as flexible as a willow. At other times you must be as unyielding as an oak. The combination of character traits that
you use in a particular situation depends on the interaction of the factors of leadership and the forces in
that situation.
Character can be strong or weak. A person with
strong character sees clearly what he wants and has
the drive, energy, self-discipline, willpower, and nerve
to get it. His traits combine in a synchronized way;
they click. A person of strong character attracts followers. A person of weak character does not know what
he wants and lacks purpose, willpower, self-discipline,
and drive. His traits are disorganized. He vacillates
and is inconsistent. He does not attract followers.
A person of strong character can be either moral or
immoral. Forceful gang leaders are examples of leaders who use their character to pursue immoral values.
This type of person has a strong but bad character. A
person of good or honorable character uses his will and
drive to pursue and to build moral values. 1
In the military we need soldiers (both leaders and
troops) of strong and good character who build the
values of loyalty to the nation's ideals, loyalty to the
unit, personal responsibility, and selfless service. In
this manual, when we speak of a soldier of character,
we are speaking of a person with both strong and good
character.
The strength of your character as a military leader
is based upon• The absence of character flaws such as indecision,
deceit, cowardice, and selfishness.
• The self-discipline and will to follow your value system-to be your own person; your actions are consistent with your personal and professional values.
1 Emory S. Botrardue, Uo<kra and Uolkrahip, pp 140-141.

108

Chapter 5

IMPORTANCE OF CHARACTER
Your subordinates assess your character as they see
your day-to-day actions. They learn whether you are
open and honest with them. They see whether you are
indecisive, lazy, or selfish. They may test your will by
cutting corners on a job and watching your responses.
They observe whether you advance yourself over their
interests or whether you are supportive of them and
the unit. They will quickly see when your actions are
inconsistent with your values or with the formal or
informal group norms. For example, if troops know
that their NCO leader is breaking the law by using
drugs or stealing office supplies, his character becomes
suspect in their eyes. Your subordinates' perceptions of
your actions combine to form a continuing assessment
of your character.
In stressful situations soldiers want to follow leaders
whom they trust and who provide them strength, inspiration, and guidance. They trust their Iives to their military leaders based on their assessment of whether or
not the leader has strong character traits, such as courage, candor, competence, and commitment. If you show
character flaws, your subordinates will follow you only
because of their own sense of duty or your coercive
powers. Coercive power can take a unit only so far in
the heat of actual combat. The most effective units historically have been those led by leaders of positive character like Colonel Chamberlain.
The battlefield is a fearful, stressful, and chaotic
place. Most of your unit could be wiped out by a nuclear weapon, conventional artillery, or chemical weapons. There may be few soldiers capable of carrying
out° your mission after such a catastrophe. You may be
the ranking man left, and suddenly you find yourself
the unit commander. How are you going to handle yourself? Are you going to give in to fear, depression, and
defeat? You and your men could easily convince yourselves that the only thing to do is to run to safety.
What will you do? Let us suppose that you have all
the right beliefs, values, and ethics. You have been
109

Chapter 5

trained and have the leadership knowledge and skills
discussed in chapter 2. The big question will be-do
you have the character to carry out your beliefs,
values, knowledge, and skills in an ethical manner in
this dangerous and demoralizing situation? If you have
character, you will master your fears as you analyze
the situation. You will reconstitute and reorganize your
soldiers into a unit. You will appoint subordinate leaders. You will come up with a plan to carry out your
mission, whether it is active combat or a supporting
role.
If we are going to win in future wars, our smallunit leaders must have the character to take this kind
of action. When mentally preparing for the stress of
combat, it will help you and your subordinates to know
that in past wars, many ordinary people have shown
the kind of character that may be required of you in
war. An inspiring example of such a soldier follows.

Sergeant York
Alvin C. York was born to a poor family in the
mountains of Tennessee. He grew up in the Valley of
the Three Forks on the Wolf River in Fentress County.
As a youth, York was known as a wild hellraiser with
a particular hankering for moonshine, fighting, and gam-

bling until he fell in love with a church.going girl who
refused to date him unless he changed his ways. He
started reading the Bible and adopted its fundamental
teachings as his values. He changed his beliefs, values,
and behavior, and he even became a respected leader
in his eh\lrch.
When he was 30,.; World War I broke out. Because of his religious beliefs, Yor:.k applied for release from the draft as a conscientious objector. His
request was denied. He was inducted into the Arniy 11nd
assigned to Captain Danforth's Company G, 328th
Infantry Regiment at Camp Gordon, Georgia. York told

110

Chapter 5

Danforth that he would do his duty, but that he did
not want to fight and did not believe in killing enemy
soldiers.
Danforth, a former schoolteacher, was troubled by
York's beliefs and feelings. As training progressed, he
could see that York was potentially the best soldier in
the company. York's mountain life had made him a
tough, hard-muscled, clear-thinking man. His body and
mind were conditioned by years of hunting, plowing,
and blacksmithing. He had been an expert shot since
boyhood. Danforth would have made York a sergeant
except for York's religious convictions about killing. In
one conversation, York told Danforth that he would kill
enemy soldiers, "but he gravely warned Danforth, he
would hold the captain responsible for the lives he had
taken when he [York] appeared before God in Heaven
on Judgment Day.''2
Danforth tried in several counseling sessions to convince York that killing enemy soldiers in a just war is
not against the word of God. York wouldn't budge. Danforth then discussed York with the battalion commander, Major George E. Buxton, a deeply religious man
who knew the Bible as well as York did. Buxton said,
"Bring him to my hut tonight. "8 That night the three
talked for a long time. Danforth listened to Major Buxton and York arguing the morality of war, each quoting the Bible to support his position. ''As Buxton lis·

tened to Danforth's account, he sensed that York was a
man well worth salvaging, if he could be made to listen.
He felt that for all the mountaineer's dedication to the
principles of the sect to which he-belonged, there was
some nagging thought in the back of the man's mind
which would not let him play the role of conscientious
objector."'
Finally, the Major told Danforth to send York home
on leave. "To York he said, 'That will give you time to
do some thinking and praying. If you can then find it

111

Chapter 5

in your heart to return with a free conscience, we will
take you with us. If you cannot ... I will see that you
are let out. "6
York went home and was in the agony of a true ethical dilemma for 2 weeks. He had no one to tum to for
help. He had to reso~ve the dilemma by himself. Finally,.
on the last·:day of his leave, after searching the deepest
regions of his mind and soul, he decided that for him
the h i ghest moral good was to go to war with
Company G.
"He rejoined bis company and told Captain Danforth
that he ·had become convinced. that he could fight for
his country without violating the precepts of his faith.
From that day on York marched in the ranks with a
light heart and clear mind.''8 York changed his own belief about the "moral rightness" of war. It is important
to note, however, that York respected Danforth and Buxton. It appears that their sincere concern and compassion for York's dilemrha had a strong influence on
York's decision to fight. The point is that ~'res:pected"
leaders can have a real influence on the beliefs, values,
and character of subordinates.
York's decision had great consequences when he accomplished an almost unbelievable exploit that displayed. int.
portant character traits-courage, competence, commitment, creativity, and initiative.
". ,.: , the essence of.Alm York's life was compressed
into four hours of October 8, 1918, in the mud and blood
of the Argonne Forest [in France]. In the war's last big
push, York was a corporal in Company G of the 82nd
Di visi9n 's 328th Regiment • .. on the front line .at
Chatel .. Chehery~ At f;:lO a.m., G Company was ordered
to advance two miles and to seize a German-held rail
point. Hidden in woods overlooking a valley, a German
machine.gun battalion opened up on the company,
killed ·most of its forward ranks.

breakfast, most of the Germans started to surrender.
Then German machine guns started raking·. the area.

and seven privates survived. While the seven privates

"That was too much for a German major lying on
the ground near York. He figured York was backed by
more Yan ks in the brush, said he would order his men
to surrender if York would stop shooting. Ninety Germans promptly lined up by twos for York and his seven
... buddies. 'How many men have you.' asked the
startled major. 'I got aplenty,' replied York. With himself at the head of the column and his men strung
along its sides, York marched off his catch. When more
machine-gun crews loomed ahead, York put his pistol
to the German major's head, got him to order their surrender. Eventually, York herded 132 prisoners into his
battalion -field headquarters.
"Army investigators later found 25 German bodies,
counted 35 machine guns put out of action by York.
French Marshal Ferdinand Foch told him: 'What you
did was the greatest thing accomplished by any private
soldier of all the armies of Europe.' York went back to
the United States a sergeant with the Medal of Honor,
received a wild hero's welcome.
"York tersely rejected every offer to capitalize on his
heroism, declared: 'This uniform ain't for sale.' He returned to a simple life in the mountains with his wife,
Gracie, and reared seven children. He made several
tours in the early '20s to raise money for a grammar
and high school at home, only yielded to repeated pleas
to permit a movie of his life when convinced that it
might inspire patriotism ...
"York's only complaint about the film was over its
portrayal of how he 'got religion.' According to Hollywood, he was knocked off a mule by a bolt of lightning. But York explained it differently: 'That weren't
the right-down facts of it. You see, I had met Miss
Gracie. Miss Gracie said that she wouldn't let me come
a-courting until I'd quit my mean drinking, fighting,
and card flipping. So you see I was struck down by the
power of love and the Great God Almighty all together.,,.,

Chapter 5

Sergeant Alvin York died in September 1964. He was
a true hero, a soldier of character. After he changed
his values about drinking and cards, he was a man of
strong and good character-before the war, during it,
and after it. On 8 October 1918, his character and
skills combined to enable him-one soldier-to destroy
the morale and effectiveness of an entire enemy machine .gun battalion, just. before it was supposed to support a large German counterattack on York's division.
This case clearly demonstrates the value of one personone soldier-.with strong character based upon
moral principles.

Great character in soldiers is not unique to the
American Army. While customs, values, and habits of
people vary from society to society, human nature does
not.
All people have values, beliefs, traits of character,
emotions, and needs. The success of any army is
greatly dependent on how well the leaders of that army
can devefop strong and moral character in their young
leaders and troops.
Much can be learned from studying how armies
have instilled beliefs, character, and skills in their soldiers. It is important to know about the character of
the soldiers of our Allies and of our potential enemies.
One way to learn this is to study their military
history.
Rifleman Dodd, by C.S. Forester, a historical novel
based on fact, gives us insight into the development of
values, character, and skills in soldiers. It describes a
low-ranking infantry soldier with the character necessary to carry out his beliefs in duty and honor. Rifleman Dodd was a remarkable hero under difficult wartime circumstances.

115

Chapter 5

Rifleman Dodd
The setting is in Portugal during the Peninsular
Campaigns of the early 1800s. During this period,
Napoleon's French Army invaded and laid waste to a
portion of Portugal while in pursuit of the English forces under Wellington. The English withdrew to a seemingly impregnable defensive position near the Tagus
River. Wellington ordered the countryside evacuated and
all crops, animals, and grain stores destroyed so that
the French Army would not be able to support itself. In
addition to the English Army, the major enemies of the
French were starvation and Portuguese guerrillas :fighting on the side of the English.
Rifleman Dodd had been with the 95th Light Infantry Regiment for 5 years of war on the Peninsula. He
was an average rifleman in a distinguished light infantry regiment. During a rearguard action Dodd was cut
off from his unit. Though he escaped the French, he
found the entire French Army between himself and his
regiment. He met a band of Portuguese guerrillas. Minutes later, Dodd and the guerrillas had a chance encounter with French cavalry. Lacking training and discipline, the guerrillas scattered in confusion. Dodd's excellent military training and experience enabled him to devise a plan quickly. Taking charge, he led the guerrillas
in a series of ranger-type raids on the vulnerable flanks
of the cavalry. The guerrillas were astounded at his leadership and tactical competence, and although he could
not speak Portuguese, he quickly became their military
leader. He led this band on many successful guerrilla
raids in which he and his small band defeated, demoralized, or disrupted hundreds of the enemy.
Duty was always Dodd's guiding motivation, but his
concept of it broadened and deepened as he gained experience operating alone and as a guerrilla leader. Since
he could not cross the Tagus River ·to· join his regiment,
he resolved .to do ·his. best .to serve the English Army's
goals as he undereto<>4 'them. On his own initiative, ·he

116

Chapter 5

·performed a dangerous reconnaissance with Bernardino,
his guerrilla guide, and pieced together ·the strategic
situation.
·
During the reconnaissance, he. observed .French units
constructing parts of .a bridge. He learned that the
bridge was to be assembled at the Tagus River, some
distance away. He saw the bridge as a real threat to
the English Army. Although knowing that he ·probably
would not survive, he took on the mission to destroy
the bridge. He planned a 25-mile journey through Frenchheld territory. On the journey, his twoPortuguese com~ .
panions were captured and brutally killed. Dodd con~ ·
tin ued alone and, in a brave and remarkably wellplanned one-man raid, he killed two sentries and burned
the bridge before the French garrison could react.
Rifleman Dodd is a remarkable book about a soldier
of character under the great stress of war. What lessons
of tactics, duty, patience, judgment, initiative, and .leadership can be learned from this historical novel about a

Chapter 5

war in the early 1800s? What factors in Dodd's experience, education, training, and character enabled him
to control his fears and avoid despair when he was
alone against seemingly insurmountable odds? Why did
he become the idolized leader of a group of foreign
guerrillas?
Dodd had no education. He was . a.· simple Sussex
country lad when he joined the Army at 17 years of
age. He understood and believed, however, in the meaning of duty. His regimental officers and NCOs had
taught him that his duty was to do hie best .to fight
and to serve his regiment. He ·knew that. duty included
all aspects of· the daily maintenance of equipment,. use
of weapons, and. above all-competence. His leaders
taught him that ·1tis_honor as a man and as a soldier
depended upon always doing his ~uty as best he could.
"And, as for despair-there. was no room fQ!t deilpair
in Dodd's mak'e-up. The regiment had *8ught him that
he must do his duty . o~- die .in the ·attempt;,. a· simple
enough religion fit for his simple mind. ·As long as
there was breath in his body or a thought in his mind
he must struggle on; as long .as he went on trying there
was no need to meditate on success or failure. The only
reward for the doing of his duty would be the knowledge that his duty was being done. That was how honor
called."8
Forester gives the reader an insight into the ·•U~il­
scious connection in Dodd's mind between duty
happiness.
"Yet if he had been asked if •.~·./ he were happy, he
would not have known wha.t to ·.-eply. He would have
admitted readily enough that he· :was uncomfortable,
that he was cold, and badly .fed, and verminous; that
his clothes were in rags, and his feet and knees and
elbows raw and bleeding through much walking and
crawling; that he was in ever-present peril of his life,
and that he really did not expect to survive the adven-

and

8C. S. Forester, Rifleman Dodd, p 44.

118

Chapter 5

ture he was about to thrust himself into voluntarily, but
all this had nothing to do with happiness: that was
something he never stopped to think about. Perhaps the
fact that he did not think about it proves he was happy.
He was a soldier carrying out his duty as well as he
knew how. He would have been the first to admit that
under the wise direction of an officer what he had done
and what he proposed to do might be more successful,
but as it was, he felt (or rather he would have felt if
he had thought about it) he had nothing with which to
reproach himself. And that condition is not all far from
true happiness.''9
The officers and sergeants in Dodd's regiment
instilled duty and honor in him, but they also trained
him to be very skilled. He believed in his competence
as a soldier. He had confidence in his leaders and in
his fellow soldiers. When he was cut off from his regiment, this belief and confidence never wavered.
Thus he could control his fears and keep his
thoughts and energy focused on creating and executing
plans to disrupt the enemy and to return to his
regiment.
Again and again, Dodd and his guerrillas triumphed
over the much larger, stronger French forces. He always
had a clear, logical plan, the character to carry it out,
and military skills superior to those of the enemy. Dodd

frequently found himself in combat with a French
squad led by Sergeant Godinot. The comparison between
Dodd and Sergeant Godinot and Godinot's men is interesting. Dodd was not innately a better man than
Sergeant Godinot, but the difference between them was
Dodd's years of training, leadership, and experience.
Dodd had developed the character and skills of ~, ;
soldier. As a result, in any situation or in any terrairi,'
the right thoughts and actions came to him instinctively
and automatically. He trained himself to wake at a

119

Chapter 5

chosen hour. He had trained ·his subcoliSCious mind to
notice any unusual sounds while he slept,~ pass them
on to his conscious mind, and to awaken him-instantly
alert with his rifle. Sergeant Godinot and his men had
virtually no training. They were not conditiOned · :_t~.f .
battle, and they had little experience. · On the field .ofi
battle this difference made Dodd ·seem like a supernatural force to,' Sergeant Godinot's men. Sergeant
Godinot's men ·lost confidence ·in themselves and their
leaders and eventually mutinied.

If the US Army goes to war again, many of our
units and soldiers will likely find themselves cut off,
isolated like Dodd. How will they behave? Will they
rise to the occasion as he did? Will they have the neces.sary character and skills? Or will they despair like
Sergeant Godinot's soldiers? That depends on whether
you, their leader, have instilled in them the required
beliefs, values, character, knowledge, and skills.
American soldiers have as much potential as Rifleman Dodd to be great soldiers under stressful circumstances if they are trained and led as well as Dodd
was trained and led. As a leader, your training programs must include and emphasize the development of
character and clear thinking while imparting necessary
soldierly skills. Your training programs must be based
on an understanding of human nature and on building
confidence and competence in your soldiers. If you do
this, you will develop soldiers like Rifleman Dodd.

TRAITS OF CHARACTER
Traits such as courage, competence, candor, and
commitment (chapter 4) are crucial for all soldierstroops and leaders. Military history shows clearly that
the following traits of character also are important in
a leader. There is no formula that shows which traits
are more important or how you should apply these
traits. But you should seek to develop these traits in
120

Chapter 5

yourself and your subordinates. The more you and your
subordinates display the following traits, the more you
increase your chances for effectiveness in difficult,
crisis situations.
Integrity is utter sincerity, honesty, and candor. It
is avoidance of any kind of deceptive, shallow, or expedient behavior. A leader of integrity strictly adheres to
his code of professional beliefs and values. Chamberlain, Randall, York, and Dodd are all excellent examples of leaders who had integrity.
Maturity refers to the sense of responsibility a person has developed. A mature leader does not make impulsive decisions based on childlike emotional desires
or feelings. He makes wise decisions based on reason
and moral principles. His emotions are subordinate to
his reason. He controls and channels his emotions constructively to help and inspire others. Chamberlain, Randall, York, and Dodd were mature. Alden was immature, given to childish displays of emotion.
Will is the perseverance to accomplish a goal, regardless of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Chamberlain and the soldiers of the 20th Maine on Little Round
Top are excellent examples of soldiers with strong will.
Rifleman Dodd's torturous journey to destroy the bridge
over the Tagus River is another example.
Self-discipline is forcing yourself to do your dutywhat you ought to do-regardless of how tired or unwilling you may be. Chamberlain showed self-discipline
when he studied tactics every night after taps. Leaders
who force themselves to complete correspondence courses
systematically are showing self-discipline. If you have
such discipline, you will be dependable. Your seniors
and subordinates appreciate dependability. A disciplined
unit-one that does what it ought to do, when it ought
to do it-is a product of disciplined leaders who instill
self-discipline in their soldiers by example, standards,
and training.
Flexibility is the capability to make timely and appropriate changes in thinking, plans, or methods when you
see, or when others convince you, that there is a better
121

way. Chamberlain showed flexibility while his unit was
under a heavy frontal assault when he extended and
"refused" his left flank, forming a line at right angles
to his existing line. He had to invent that tactic to fit
his situation; he was not bound by tactical rules or
formulas. Sergeant York showed quick thinking and flexibility throughout his gallant adventure.
Confidence is the assurance that you and your soldiers will be successful in whatever you do. Confidence
shows in your bearing, in the look in your eye, in the
tone of your voice, in your enthusiasm, in what you
say, and in what you do. If you, the leader, are not
confident about the outcome of a mission or a problem,
it is unlikely that your soldiers will be confident. Chamberlain, Randall, Sergeant York, and Rifleman Dodd all
behaved in a way that showed inner confidence springing from a belief in themselves, their cause, and their
professional knowledge and skills.
Endurance includes mental, spiritual, and physical
stamina. It is the ability to keep going mentally, spiritually, and physically over prolonged periods of stress.
Chamberlain and his soldiers showed this trait throughout the agonizing years of the war. Toward the end of
the war, after he had been severely wounded and his
health was impaired, it was Chamberlain's enduring
mind and spirit that triumphed and provided inspirational leadership in the key battles that led to Lee's
surrender.
Decisiveness is the ability to use sound judgment
and make a good decision at the right time. Timing is
a critically important element of decisiveness. Colonel
Chamberlain's decision to charge at Little Round Top
was perfectly timed and contributed to victory. That
same decision earlier or later would probably have
been disastrous. Sergeant York showed decisiveness
after realizing that he, his 7 soldiers, and their 90 German prisoners were inside German lines. To get back
to friendly lines he would have to go through a line of
122

---------------------------Chapter 5

occupied German trenches. Boldly, he decided to march
to the German trenches where he demanded and
received ·the surrender of 42 more German soldiers.
Coolness under stress is a confident calmness in
looks and behavior. Chamberlain and Randall showed
coolness under stress. They were not "totally calm" in
the prelude to battle or during it-but they controlled
their adrenaline and fears and acted with outward calmness. In tum, this self-control helped calm them and
their soldiers. Staff Sergeant Sanchez showed coolness
under stress when she controlled her emotions, forced
her mind to think clearly, and decided on an ethical
• course of action. ("Incident in the Personnel and Administration Center," chapter 4.)
Initiative is the ability to take actions that you believe will accomplish unit goals without waiting for orders or supervision. It includes boldness.. Specialist
Jenkins-the soldier in "The Face of Future Battle"
who initiated the attack on the enemy headquartersshowed initiative and boldness. Rifleman Dodd showed
these qualities in his attacks on the French Army, his
analysis of the situation, and his attack on the bridge
over the Tagus River.
Justice is the fair treatment of all people regardless
of race, religion, color, sex, age, or national origin. As
a just leader, you must give rewards according to merit

and performance. You must investigate thoroughly the
true causes of an offense and take appropriate and fair
action. Prejudice is the enemy of justice. It is prejudging a person favorably or unfavorably because of some
aspect of the person, such as race or sex, that has no
connection with the person's ability or potential. Justice was lacking in the way Captain Alden treated the
soldiers who went to the inspector general. Alden also
held prejudices about his troops. He saw them as lazy,
needing to be motivated by fear. On the other hand,
Chamberlain showed justice in the way he handled the
2d Maine mutineers.

123

Self-improvement is shown by reading, studying,
seeking challenging assignments, and working to
strengthen beliefs, values, ethics, character, knowledge,
and skills. Captain Randall, through his talks with subordinates, was continually striving to improve his company and his own leadership. Chamberlain's after-taps
study of tactics and war is another good example of
self-improvement.
Assertiveness is taking charge when necessary, making your ideas known, helping to define the problem,
and getting others to do the right thing to solve the
problem. Riflemen Dodd showed assertiveness when he
took charge of the guerrillas, made a plan, and at- ..
tacked the French cavalry.
Empathy or compassion is being sensitive to the feelings, values, interests, and well-being of others. It
includes making suggestions that help people with problems. Captain Randall showed empathy in his dealings
and talks with his soldiers. Randall's soldiers knew
that he really cared about them. Captain Danforth and
Major Buxton showed empathy when they helped York
with his religious dilemma. Colonel Chamberlain displayed empathy in his dealings with the 2d Maine
mutineers. What if Chamberlain had not displayed
empathy for these men? They probably would not have
fought for the 20th Maine at Little Round Top.

A sense of humor is shown by not taking yourself
too seriously and by contributing to the laughter and
morale of the people around you. A sense of humor
eases tension; combats fear and depression; and enhances communication, trust, and respect.
Creativity is demonstrated by thinking of new and
better goals, ideas, programs, and solutions to problems.
Colonel Chamberlain's decisions to extend his line and
to charge showed creativity and imagination. Previous
training had not addressed those types of situations,
but his mind created the correct answers under the
great stress of battle.
124

Chapter 5

Bearing is shown by posture, overall appearance,
and manner of physical movement. Your bearing is an
outward display to others of the state of your inner
feelings, fears, and overall inner confidence. Your bearing can either hurt the confidence of your soldiers or
help inspire them.
Humility is admitting weaknesses or imperfections in
your character, knowledge, and skills. It is acknowledging mistakes and taking the appropriate action to correct those mistakes. Captain Randall showed humility
by listening to his soldiers' perceptions of problems in
the company. Captain Alden showed that he lacked
humility, as well as justice, by the way he handled the
five soldiers who complained to the inspector general.
Tact is a sensitive perception of people, their values,
feelings, and views which allows positive interaction.
Captain Randall was sensitive to his soldiers and
treated them with tact.
This list of important traits of character is not complete. Science has not been able to give us a formula
for the combination of traits that will lead to success
in all situations. We know, however, that a leader's
character-that combination of his personality traitscan be the determining force of victory or defeat. We
know from experience that some traits are essential to
being a good soldier and leader. The purpose of this
chapter is to make you aware of the importance of intangible character traits and to explain how you can
work to develop character in yourself and others.

CHARACTER BUILDING
Building character demands the honesty to determine your own character weaknesses. Have you demonstrated the self-discipline and will upon which strong
character is based? How have you handled the tough
situations? Sometimes you are the best judge of your
strengths and weaknesses. Other times you have blindspots that keep you from seeing your own weaknesses.

126
466-680 0 - 85 - 5 : QL 3

Chapter5 ---------------------------------------------------------------

Captain Alden was not a bad person. He thought
he had all the necessary beliefs, values, character
traits, knowledge, and skills. But he had psychological
blocks that prevented him from seeing his weaknesses.
Had he seen and accepted them, he could have corrected them. His real downfall was that he was not
open to honest feedback from his subordinates and
others, such as the inspector general.
You must be open to feedback and advice. However,
you must take the responsibility for continually building and strengthening your character. Others can help,
but they cannot do it for you. Also, you are responsible for helping subordinate leaders and soldiers build
their own character.
To build character in yourself or subordinates; you
should• Determine as best you can the present situation and
status of values and traits.
• Determine what values and traits you desire to instill.
If you are seeking to develop character in subordinates,
you normally should communicate this fact to them.
• Establish an environment that supports the development of the desired values and traits.
• Reward those actions which support the desired
values and traits, and penalize actions that do not.
• Model on the people you want to be like. Be the example for your subordinates in terms of the values and
traits you want them to have.
You build character by hard work, study, and challenging experiences. You develop habits of living and
working that force you, on a daily basis, to work hard
continually to develop your mind and your personality
traits.
When Chamberlain was a boy his father taught him
about self-discipline, will, and perseverance. One day
the boys were clearing rocks from a field on their
father's Maine farm. Returning from the field they told
126

Chapter 5

their father that there was one rock that was too large
to move. He said "Go move it," and they did. Chamberlain's father taught him that if a task was said to
be "impossible," the only thing to do was to attack it
and accomplish it.
This early training had an effect on Chamberlain.
As a teenager he decided he wanted to learn Greek.
He shut himself in the attic and studied from morning
to night until he had mastered a Greek grammar book.
The more you exercise your will, self-discipline, and
other important traits, the more you strengthen and
temper the steel of your character.
Chamberlain's religious training had a strong impact on the good part of his character. He studied for
3 years in seminary to be a minister. He held the J udeoChristian values of selflessness, respect, kindness and
compassion for others. He deeply believed in the ideals
of the Union-freedom, justice, equality, and human
dignity, and he always tried to use his influence to
build these values. They were his major motivating
force during the war. If they are your major motivating force as a leader, you will not go wrong.
You may think that it is impossible to build traits
of character. This is not true. Theodore Roosevelt was
a sickly, pampered son of a wealthy, socialite family.
He decided to change himself, and over the years he
became a strong outdoorsman, big game hunter, and

adventurer. He became the leader of the famous
"Rough Riders," a volunteer regiment which made history during the Spanish-American War. He went on to
become a great American leader-governor of New
York and President of the United States.
Character normally develops over a long period of
time from behaving consistently with the right values
and norms. For this reason, it is important that soldiers be well led and well trained beginning with their
induction into the service. When soldiers and young
leaders begin their training in the Army, most are psychologically ready for change. They want to become
127

Chapter 5 ~~~~~---~~~~---~---~~---~------~-------------------

better people through Army life and training. They are
prepared to give up some of their old values and habits and adopt the values, habits, and practices of the
Army. It is essential, therefore, that all units have effective programs for integrating new soldiers into a unit.
Leaders must ensure that the right military values and
norms of working, training, and living are being
taught, demanded, reinforced, and demonstrated. These
values and norms contribute to the development of
character.
BUILDI NG CHARACTER IN SUBORDINATES
The following case, based on fact, shows one
sergeant's methods for improving his subordinates'
character.

Incident in Vietnam
After several weeks .in Vietnam, .a young platoon sergeant was amazed to learn that h18"' soldiers would not
keep. their rifles clean ·a nd dig proper foxholes at night.
He had thought that the instinct for survival would
cause soldiers to keep their weapons clean and io dig
in wen at night, He was wrong. Soldiers get tired and
hungry, and often think they won't .be attacked. They
usually ehQose to eat ·and'. sleep before they clean wea·
pons and dig in. The platoon sergeant found that Ile
had ·to .force his soldiers to develop the habits of cleaning the weap0na t.Q', standard every clay ancf of digging
foxholes ·io ~tandard every night. He had .to "establish a
set priority :of work when moving llito a defensive position-security out, some soldiers dig in while ·some clean
weapons, then eat and sleep.
·
The platoon sergeant established an SOP that each
man would clean his weapon each day when. ,th&. platoOn stopped its movement. Each squad leader ·- . required ·te!inapect weapons daily and.' io report hi8 rifle
inspection to ·the platoon sergeant. The platoon sergeant
would inspect a sample of the platoon's weapons each

This case makes several teaching points about
character:
• The squad leaders and troops learned that the platoon sergeant had the self-discipline and will to check
and enforce standards and policies. Word of this incident quickly spread. Respect for the platoon sergeant
increased.

129

Chapter5 ~---------------------------------------------------

• The platoon sergeant's SOPs on weapons and foxholes forced the soldiers to develop soldierly habits. Remember the socialization process. People tend to develop
values to justify their behavior. These two SOPs
(norms), and others like them caused habits of behavior which became instilled in the squad leaders and
troops as the values and traits of duty, responsibility,
and self-discipline.
• These and other SOPs paid off for this platoon sergeant and his unit in combat. The soldiers of the platoon realized their success in combat was due primarily
to the platoon sergeant's values, sound thinking, and
policies. Their confidence in him, themselves, and the
unit increased. They knew they could fight and win.
CHANGING CHARACTER OF
PROBLEM SOLDIERS
You may question how much you can change the
character of a soldier. What if you have a soldier who
comes from an environment where the parents themselves set a bad example or the soldier received a poor
education? Take the example of a soldier who comes
from a neighborhood where lying, cheating, and stealing were the informal norms of groups of young people. These norms became instilled in him as values
while he was growing up. Lying to authority, "getting
over," "shamming," and taking advantage of "the system"
have been normal behavior to this soldier. He is undependable and irresponsible; he lacks self-discipli~e. Can
this soldier change? Can soldierly values and character traits be instilled in him? What is your responsibility to this soldier?
You must understand human nature. There is good
and bad in everyone. A leader must suppress the bad
and bring out the good in each soldier. Counterproductive beliefs and values can be eliminated if the person
wants to change. Professional beliefs and values can
be instilled if the person wants to change. Character
can be developed if the person wants to develop it.
180

Chapter 5

Many problem soldiers want to improve. People need
discipline, organization, and a good set of beliefs,
values, policies, and habits to live by. They develop an
inner satisfaction and confidence from doing the right
thing and working hard.
You will not be able to influence the beliefs, values,
and character traits of all your soldiers, but you can
have a positive influence on most soldiers. You have a
responsibility to make good soldiers out of the people
in your unit, even the problem soldiers.
Gaining the respect of your soldiers is important. A
respected leader influences his soldiers by setting a
good example and by teaching, coaching, counseling,
training, and disciplining. If the soldier has no desire
to change or to adopt soldierly values and traits after
you and your subordinates have done your best to
teach those values and traits, take action to eliminate
him from the Army. He will be a disruptive influence
on discipline and cohesion in your unit.
If you are a respected leader, you will be successful
in creating a leadership climate which causes most of
your soldiers to develop the right professional values
and character traits. If you are a good leader, you have
the power to change people from individuals motivated
by self-interest into soldiers who are motivated to serve
their unit and their country selflessly.
You have another major responsibility in developing
the character of subordinates. You must give your soldiers the confidence that they can develop their character. Give your soldiers the belief that you are on their
side, helping them. Of course, they must realize that
the mission comes first. Without accomplishment of the
mission, a unit is ineffective and might as well not
exist. They need to know, however, that as long as
they are doing their duty to accomplish the mission,
you will do all in your power to help them become better soldiers and better people. If they believe that you
sincerely care about them and want them to develop
181

Cbapter5 --------------------------------------------------~

the correct values and traits because that is right for
them, it helps give them confidence to become soldiers
of character and ability.

SUMMARY
Character is the sum total of your personality traits.
It is the link between your values and your behavior.
It determines whether you will have the inner strength
and tenacity to behave consistently in terms of your
values regardless of stress, danger, or consequences. It
affects how well you learn and apply critical leadership skills. It is what keeps you going-driving you forward toward your goals-when all other sources of
energy and motivation are gone. Character is the inner
power source of leadership and, in this sense, it is the
source of all good leadership.

What a Leader
Must Kno"7 j,f

•·

The first half of this manual made you aware of
the demands combat places on leaders and troops. It
presented the big picture of leadership-what a leader
must be, know, and do. It explained how a leader instills values in his subordinates, resolves ethical dilemmas, and builds character in self and subordinates.
The crucial knowledge that a leader must have is
listed in chapter 2 in the overall concept of what a
leader must be, know, and do. The be, know, and do
attributes are intertwined in reality. For example, to
instill the value of selfless service into your subordinates, you have to know how values become instilled
in people. To be a good professional you ·must know
the true meaning of the values of loyalty, responsibility,
duty, and honor (chapter 4). You must know the meaning of good and strong character (chapter 5).
'188

Chapter6 --------------------------------------------------------

And there are things you must know to do your duty
as a leader. Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10 focus on what a
leader must do (provide direction, implement, and
motivate). To do these things, you must know (understand) the four factors of leadership (yourself, your followers, communication, and the situation) and how they
can affect each other. The more you understand the
four factors and how they interact, the better able you
will be to provide direction, implement, and motivate.
This chapter explains what you need to know about
yourself, human nature, your job, and your unit to be
an effective leader. This know ledge will give you a
stronger foundation for what you must be and what
you must do. Keep in mind as you read this chapter
that knowledge is far more than memorizing information. Knowledge is the understanding of information.

KNOW YOURSELF
"Know thyself. " 1 To lead others successfully, you
must know about people and human nature; but before you
can understand other people, you must know yourself.
Using chapter 5 as a guide to self-evaluation, you
can better understand yourself, your personality, your
strengths, and your weaknesses. Are you an analytical
person who likes to work objectively with facts, or are
you intuitive, preferring to rely on your instincts and
feelings as you make decisions? Are you warm or cold
to the feelings of other people? Are you introverted,
tending to be a loner, or extroverted, relating easily to
other people? Are your actions directed toward your
personal interest, or do you give of your thoughts and
time to help others? Do you like a planned, orderly way
of life or a flexible, spontaneous one?
Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Crucial to
your development as a person and a leader is knowing
your own strengths and weaknesses. You can then

Chapter 6

max1m1ze your strengths and work to improve your
weaknesses. The character traits of chapter 5 and questions like those above will guide you. Also chapter 10
provides a complete step-by-step program to use as a
guide for self-development.
Your seniors, peers, subordinates, relatives, spouse,
and others will give you honest feedback if you seek it
and are open to it. Candid feedback can help you to
understand yourself better and to know how to improve
yourself. Recall how Captain Randall constantly sought
feedback on how he was doing as a leader. Captain
Alden, in contrast, was unapproachable. Consequently,
he did not know his weaknesses or those of his unit.
If you know yourself and seek self-improvement, you
have a foundation for knowing your job and your
people.

KNOW HUMAN NATURE
S. L. A. Marshall said that the starting point for
the understanding of war is the understanding of
human nature. This is a fundamental truth. As a leader
you have to deal with followers, peers, seniors, and
other people whose support you need to accomplish your
mission. You must be able to motivate all these people
to support you. To understand and motivate people and
to develop a cohesive, disciplined, well-trained unit, you
must understand human nature.
People behave according to certain principles of
human nature. These principles govern behavior in war
just as they do in peace. The stresses of war may unleash certain fears that have been suppressed in peace.
War, however, does not change human nature. Since
all humans react according to principles of human
nature, it is important that you study these principles.
You must constantly be aware of them through the
conscientious study of this manual, of other books and
courses, and of people in real-life situations. The following is a discussion of the basic aspects of human
nature that you should know as a leader.
136

Chapter 6

Human nature is the common set of qualities shared
by all human beings. Chapters 4 and 5 examined some
of these qualities-beliefs, values, and character traitsof individuals. Now we will examine other aspects of
human nature important to soldiers: the potential for
good and bad behavior in all humans, stress factors
influencing fear and panic, and human needs. If you
understand these and how they affect the behavior of
people under various conditions of stress, you will be
on your way to becoming a skilled, inspirational leader.
POTENTIAL FOR GOOD AND BAD BEHAVIOR
All people have the potential for good and bad behavior. One of your most important jobs as a leader is
to suppress the bad, bring out the good, and direct that
good behavior to the accomplishment of unit missions.
Most people want to do the right thing, but, unfortunately, many lack the moral fiber or character to behave well under temptation or stress. A leader must
realize this and know the conditions that bring out the
good and the bad in people. He can then encourage
the good and suppress the bad. The following example
illustrates this point.
An American company was moving at night in
Vietnam. They had been taking casualties from deadly,
unseen booby traps. As they neared a village, they were
fired on by Viet Cong snipers who quickly retreated
after killing a private and a lieutenant. It was dark,
and the American soldiers were scared, anguished,
resentful, and frustrated. They urged the commander
to let them go into that village and kill whoever had
killed the soldier and the lieutenant. The commander
was also anguished and frustrated, but he controlled
his emotions. He foresaw what could happen. Surprise,
ambush, and retreat were standard Viet Cong tactics.
Since the commander knew that the ambushers were
probably gone, he did not allow movement toward the
village. If the soldiers had gone into the village in their
emotional state, they might have lost control and caused
136

Chapter 6

inexcusable deaths and damage. In turn this would
have created hatred in the Vietnamese and motivated
more of them to become Viet Cong guenillas.
War can bring out the worst in human nature. There
are examples in war of people committing horrible
atrocities, such as the murder of disarmed prisoners
and innocent civilians. Leaders must exercise selfdiscipline to bring out the good and suppress the bad
in their subordinates.
Why do such acts occur? A veneer of civilization
separates people from their baser desires. The stresses
of war often crack that veneer. It is the leader's job to
understand the stressful conditions, such as fear, exhaustion, loss of comrades, hunger, and deprivation of
sexual needs, that can break that veneer.
Some people take the view that atrocities are inevitable in war, that it is human nature, and that nothing
can be done about it. It is true that human nature,
allowed to run its course under certain conditions of
war, will produce atrocities. It is also true that leaders
can and must prevent atrocities. In nearly every case
where atrocities have occurred in history, there was a
leader who condoned or encouraged them. If the leader
had controlled his own emotions, set the correct example, and given appropriate orders, the atrocities would
not have been committed. A leader who values the
American ideals of truth, justice, freedom, and human

dignity does not condone atrocities. He controls himself
and his soldiers, no matter how difficult the situation.
The fundamental point of this discussion is that a
leader must suppress the bad in his subordinates, bring
out the good, and apply that good behavior to mission
accomplishment.

FEAR
The stresses of family life, garrison life, training,
and war can bring out the bad in people. They can
also cause a dangerous emotion-fear. Fear, if not controlled, can lead to cowardly behavior in an individual
or to panic in a unit.
187

Chapter 6

Fear is a common quality of human nature, one that
we all experience. Earlier in this manual you read
about several examples of fear in combat. Two resulted
in panic-Colonel Oates' Alabama regiments at Little
Round Top and Alden's company in "The Face of Future Battle." The following account illustrates the fear
of soldiers in war.
During their baptism of fire at the Battle of Antietam,
the men of the 20th Maine felt fear of battle for the
first time. As they heard the sounds of fighting across
the Potomac River and prepared to cross, "the imminence
of personal death began to develop its involuntary,
uncontrollable physiological reactions-the too-fast,
too-hard pounding of the heart, the dry knotting of the
stomach, and a general shakiness. " 2 Before the fight
at Little Round Top, the men of the 20th Maine felt
"blood beating harder and faster through the arteries;
lungs seeming to dilate deep down, reaching for more
oxygen; stomach and intestines shrinking and stopping
all movement; and tension rising to the point where it
could shab a man like the passage of a powerful
electric current.'' 3
Fear causes definite physical reactions. You can see
it in the eyes and sense it in the shakiness of a soldier
or of yourself. Fear is an emotion that occurs naturally
in soldiers before or during battle. What is important
is how a person handles fear, and this depends on com-

petence, confidence, and strength of character.
Courage is not the absence of fear. It is the ability
to act as you believe you should in spite of fear. It is
the domination of will over instinct and fear. Competence and a belief in one's ability to succeed if he tries
are powerful agents in counteracting fear. A soldier
feels fear in direct proportion to his belief that he may
fail. As a leader, you can do many things to counteract
fear and other types of stress by building competence
and confidence in your soldiers.
2John J. Pullen, The Twentieth Maine, p 27.
3Pullen, p 115.

138

Chapter 6

Train your soldiers to be superbly competent as individuals and as a team. Competence builds confidence.
Confidence bolsters morale, courage, and the will to
fight.
Set the example by controlling your fear. Show
courage, confidence, and self-control, as Chamberlain
did when he sensed panic as his troops were retreating
across the river at the Battle of Antietam. He turned
his horse, faced the enemy, and calmly encouraged his
soldiers.
Prepare your soldiers for the fears of battle. Describe
the carnage and confusion of the battlefield by reading
quotations from books such as The Face of Battle by
John Keegan, Men Against Fire by S. L. A. Marshall,
The Red · Badge of Courage by Stephen Crane, Once
An Eagle by Anton Myrer, The Forgotten Soldier by
Guy Sajer, and The Twentieth Maine by John J. Pullen.
Discuss what combat will be like; discuss the details
of past battles. Talk about why some units panicked
while others had the cohesion and discipline to hold
together. Explain the isolation a soldier feels on the
battlefield when his unit comes under fire and all
soldiers hit the ground. When all go to ground, the

Chapter 6

individual soldier cannot see his comrades; he cannot
see the enemy; he feels alone. Without proper training
and confidence, this isolation can cause paralyzing fear.
Do not push your soldiers unnecessarily, as fatigue
drains courage! Give them adequate food, water, rest,
and protection from the weather. In the words of
S. L. A. Marshall:
"In battle, whatever wears out the muscles reacts
on the mind and whatever impairs the mind drains
physical strength. Tired men take fright more easily.
Frightened men swiftly tire .... Half of control during
battle comes from the commander's avoiding useless
expenditure of the physical resources of his men while
taking action to break the hold of fear." He went on
to say: "As a man becomes dehydrated during summer
fighting, his courage flows out through his pores, along
with his muscular strength. He loses the will to fight
or to take co-nstructive action."'
"After a wearing approach march and entrenching,
two [American] rifle companies went into a perimeter
[defense] on adjoining ridges [in Korea]. They were the
same strength; the positions were about equal. Both
units were dog tired. One commander ordered a 100
percent alert. The other put his men in the sacks and
with a few of his NCOs kept watch. Thirty minutes
later the Chinese attacked. The first company was
routed and driven from its hill immediately. The second

bounded from its sleeping bags, fought like tigers, and
held the position until finally ordered ... to withdraw." 5
Here is an example of how not to suppress fear.
In World War I, the German Army launched its
third great Marne offensive in May 1918. The offensive
was achieving success along much of the front, including that part defended by the 1st US Infantry Division.
All the normal reserves had been committed to create
additional combat power. All the supply and technical
troops were collected into two provisional battalions
•s. L. A. Marshall, The Soldier's Load and the Mobility of a Nation, pp 46-47.
5Marahall, p vii

140

Chapter 6

under the Division Adjutant General and the Staff Judge
Advocate (senior lawyer). The two leaders went to the
headquarters for instructions. George C. Marshall's aide
took them to a window and said: "You are to die east
of that railroad. That is all the order you need." 6
That brief order certainly impressed these men with
the gravity of the situation. But it did not give them
the information they needed on the friendly and enemy
situation. It did not set a positive tone to calm the
natural fears of soldiers who normally do not fight
directly against the enemy.
Keep your soldiers active before and during battle,
be ca use positive action conquers fear. You and your
troops can master fear; soldiers have been doing .it for
centuries. Get your soldiers to think about the mission,
each other, how to fight, and what to do in various
situations. If they force themselves to keep their minds
on the task at hand, on their comrades, and on the
unit, fear will not have a chance to take over. They
must think positively and take positive action.

Emotions That Contribute to Fear. You, the leader,
can have an important influence on these emotions.
Depression, sadness, and feelings of hopelessness, lack
of self-worth, and lack of self-respect are dangerous
emotions that breed combat ineffectiveness, fear, and
panic. Prevent or control these emotions in yourself by
exercising self-discipline. Sense these emotions in your
soldiers, and take action to control them.
Attack these emotions by setting a positive, cheerful
example; by talking with individuals and groups; by
counseling; and by giving your soldiers a sense of confidence, purpose, meaning, and self-respect. Often, all
it takes is for you to sit down and talk with a soldier
who is depressed or scared. If you have his confidence,
the soldier will tell you the causes of his fear. Then
talk to the soldier. Show kindness and understanding.
This will alleviate the causes of fear. Sometimes, all it

understand. It is natural to doubt yourself and have
the emotions that you are feeling. But you're a good
soldier. I know you; you will do fine. You are brave,
and I have confidence in you." Words like these inspire
confidence-the belief that he can succeed. They also
show that you sincerely care about the soldier.
A soldier must believe that his leader sincerely cares
about him. When determining what our relationship
with another person should be, human nature dictates
that we ask ourselves two questions: Does he care about
me? Is he powerful? The following diagram shows the
possible answers.
-

- -

TWO KEY QUESTIONS

and
Trusted

Feared

Tolerated

Despised

The "yes-yes" box confers confidence. When your soldiers ask these two questions about you, you want the
answer to be "yes-yes." For this to occur you must have
the key leadership attributes and you must sincerely
care for your subordinates. The diagram also shows
how important the "yes" answer is for caring. Even if
142

------------------------------------------------------ Chapter6

a leader is rated "no" on being powerful, he will not
generate fear or hatred if his soldiers know that he
sincerely cares for them.
Emotions That Combat Fear. To combat fear, panic,
and other kinds of stress, you must inspire certain
emotions in yourself and your troops. These are feelings
of self-worth, self-respect, hope, and confidenceconfidence in self, comrades, and leaders and that the
cause itself is worth fighting for.
Another important emotion is the feeling of being a
part of something that is more important than oneself.
This is crucial because it leads to cohesiveness in a
unit. It generally occurs after a unit has gone through
experiences which caused the soldiers to feel positive
about themselves, each other, their leaders, and their
unit. It encompasses and reinforces the other positive
feelings. This feeling of unit wholeness creates invisible
but powerful bonds of mutual respect, mutual confidence, mutual trust, and communication.
An individual's pride in being a member of the unit
is a motivating part of the identity and self-image of
the soldier. When he feels this bond with other unit
members, the soldier is motivated to do his duty. This
feeling of duty to the unit helps the soldier master fear
and selfishness.
This feeling motivated the men of the 20th Maine,
Rifleman Dodd, Sergeant York, and the soldiers of
C Company in "The Face of Future Battle." Recall that
Rifleman Dodd, separated from his regiment by the
enemy army, was primarily motivated by his desire to
do his duty as he thought his regimental sergeants and
officers would want him to. An entire army between
Dodd and his unit could not break the invisible bond
which existed between Dodd and the consciousness of
his unit.
HUMAN NEEDS
Thus far, we have discussed the potential for good
and bad behavior, fear, and the emotions related to
fear. Closely related to fear and emotions are needs.
143

Chapter 6 ~----------------------------------------------------~

Human needs are an important part of human nature. Values, beliefs, and customs differ from group to
group and country to country, but people all over the
world have similar human needs. As a leader, you must
understand these needs because they are powerful forces
in motivating soldiers. There are several categories of
needs which are described below.
Physical Needs. Physical needs include food, shelter,
liquids, and sleep. When these needs are deprived, the
motivation to satisfy them can sometimes overwhelm
other motivations, such as achieving the mission.
Security Needs. People need to feel secure. Your
soldiers expect you to ensure that all formations and
positions have proper security to the front, flanks, and
rear. A leader quickly loses respect if he does not show
genuine concern for the physical and security needs of
soldiers. A leader's lack of concern for these basic,
simple needs is quickly evident to perceptive soldiers
and affects their motivation to follow the leader into
dangerous situations.
Social Needs. Social needs are important motivators,
but they are less obvious than physical and security
needs. Social needs include the need for self-respect,
status, comradeship, love and affection, and the need
to belong to a group and to be respected by others in
that group.
Men and women are social beings with instinctive
needs to be part of a group. In general, if the group
helps a person satisfy his physical, security, and social
needs, the person will abide by the rules of the group
and be a loyal member of that group. When, however,
the individual perceives that the group is not helping
him meet his needs, he will be dissatisfied. He will not
feel a part of the group. Often this is the person who
becomes a problem soldier.
Higher Needs. The physical, security, and social needs
discussed thus far are lower-level human needs. Many
people never get beyond being motivated primarily by
these needs. Their beliefs and values tell them that
144

Chapter 6

self-oriented needs to make money and acquire valuables
are the ones that result in a happy life. They never
realize that the satisfaction of higher-level needs could
give them a much deeper happiness. One of the things
that make humans unique is the higher-level needs of
the spirit or soul. Leaders must encourage subordinates
to realize the importance of these needs. Some of these
needs are• The need for religion. From the beginning of recorded
history, most people have shown a strong need to believe in God or some form of higher religious being.
People need to explain everything that happens. Science
cannot explain everything, and that leaves a mysterious
void that people cannot tolerate. Most people need to
believe that God exists in some form of higher spiritual
being and that this spiritual being has a plan for the
universe and an explanation for the many events that
cannot be explained by reason and science.
Many people not normally religious become so in
time of war. The danger and chaos of war give rise to
the human need to believe that a greater spiritual being
is guiding one's fate for the best, regardless of whether
one lives or dies. In this sense it helps soldiers to believe that they are fighting for a cause that is moral
and right in the eyes of their religion. This is an important source of motivation for soldiers all over the

world. Remember York's dilemma. He could not rest
until he believed that God wanted him to fight.
Leaders, as well as chaplains, can assist soldiers by
bolstering their spiritual strength and their conviction
that they are doing the moral thing.

• The need for increased competence. We all have a
need to be competent and to increase our competence.
This is the need to live up to our potential, to be all
we can be, to develop all of our talents-whatever they
are. It is the need to grow, to become a better, more
effective person. When this need is strong in a person,
he is motivated toward the achievement of goals. Reaching goals proves to him that he is, in fact, competent
146

Chapter 6

and growing in competence. The satisfaction of achieving goals reinforces the need to keep growing by achieving new, more difficult goals.
• The need to serve a worthwhile cause. Most people
will suffer hardship and danger to the degree that they
believe the mission or cause is important.
"What happens when an army loses faith in its
cause? It is in fact defeated and wholly submissive to
the enemy. Its will is defeated. Those who respect history will deem it beyond argument that belief in a
cause is the foundation of the aggressive will in
battle." 7
This need is exemplified by soldiers of units like the
20th Maine. Because the unit had proven itself great,
each member felt that in some measure he contributed
to that greatness. This gave the soldier a feeling of
pride because he was contributing to something more
important than himself.
All humans need to feel important. We can satisfy
this need by being a contributing part of a unit that
is serving an important cause. The potential for the
satisfaction of this need is present in all units as all
US Army units are important to a crucial cause-the
defense of this nation and the ideals for which it
stands. Again, recall how Sergeant York could not fight
until he believed in the cause.
• The need to be needed. This need helps explain why
some soldiers are motivated to risk their lives to help
others, why they will unselfishly serve a cause they
believe in, and why they want to be part of an important unit. Doing these things gives them the feeling
of being. needed. We want to be needed by our families,
our friends, the leaders we respect, our unit, and our
society. As the soldiers of the 20th Maine demonstrated, .
this need is a powerful motivating force that contributes
to discipline, cohesion, and the will to fight.
7s. L.A. Marshall, Men Against Fire, pp 161·162.

146

-----------------------------------------------------Chapter6

Good leaders are concerned more with the well-being
of their people than they are with themselves. They go
out of their way to give their time, energy, thought,
and counsel to teach and help their subordinates to live
up to their potential. They do this out of an unselfish
need to help other human beings contribute to society.
They do not expect anything in return.
What such a leader gets in return, however, is the
respect of troops and their willingness to follow that
leader, even into grave danger. The many examples of
soldiers falling on grenades to save comrades or otherwise risking their lives so that others might live attest
to the existence of this unselfish need to help others.
Effect of Needs on Motivation to Fight. In arguments about why soldiers fight, various human needs
are given as the motivating force. Some say that a soldier fights for survival, that he knows he must kill or
be killed, fight or be court-martialed. This argument
states that basic security needs are the primary motivating force in battle.
Others claim that the main motivators are social
needs, the respect of one's buddies or the respect of
the leader. Some argue that soldiers and whole units
are basically motivated by higher needs that arise from
deeply held beliefs, values, and principles. These higher
needs can be satisfied by becoming part of a unit that
is striving to achieve a cause more important than the
life of any one individual.
It is true that the lower-level needs are important
motivators in battle. But the evidence shows that when
the higher-level needs are activated in soldiers, they are
a more powerful, lasting force. Before soldiers can be
motivated by higher-level needs, however, several important conditions must be met. The leaders must have
excellent character, knowledge, and skills; they must
believe in and selflessly serve the higher cause. The
troops must believe in the leaders, and the troops must
have a deep belief that they are fighting for a just
cause. History shows' us that good leadership, good
147

Chapter&----------------------------------------------------~

training, and a just cause can produce units that are
motivated by the higher-level needs which create more
effective fighting units.
It is doubtful that soldiers would fight the way the
20th Maine did at Little Round Top unless the leaders
and most of the soldiers were motivated by higher
needs. In 1864, death and disease were common in the
Union Army, but this did not deter these soldiers. Chamberlain wrote that many soldiers reenlisted when their
first 2-year enlistment was up, knowing full well that
they were facing death or maiming. Many who were
wounded and medically excused from combat found
their way back to their regiment to continue the fight. 8
It would seem that these men were motivated by a
higher need to preserve their own honor and self-respect
by serving their country. This need arose from deep
beliefs in the rightness of the ideals and values of the
United States of America.
We have discussed crucial areas of knowledge involving human nature. Understanding human nature will
give you a basis for developing cohesive, disciplined
units and for successfully leading soldiers in battle. The
bibliography suggests further readings on the study of
human nature.

KNOW YOUR JOB
TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE
Technical knowledge is the knowledge required to
perform job tasks. In the 20th Maine, the officers and
NCOs had to know a nine-step process for loading a
musket. If they did not know the process well, they
could not teach it to their soldiers.
In the frenzy of Civil War battles, many things
could go wrong with an improperly loaded musket. In
the modern US Army, we are dependent upon equipment much more complex than a Civil War musket.
Our weapons and equipment will serve us well only if
8Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, The Passing of the Armies, pp 17-25.

148

----------------------------------------------------- Chapter6

unit leaders and troops have the technical knowledge
required to operate and maintain them under all conditions of weather, terrain, and battle.
Your goal should be to know every piece of equipment, to drive every vehicle, to be an expert firer of
every weapon assigned to your unit. That is a tall
order, and it calls for technical proficiency..
To obtain this knowledge, study and work hard
in schools and in your unit. Individual study of Army
manuals and publications is also invaluable for acquiring
such expertise. Ask your seniors, peers, and subordinates
to help you learn. Sometimes junior soldiers make the
best teachers. They are proud to show you what they
know and to help you learn. Teaching you makes them
feel intelligent, proud, important-and they are.

TACTICAL KNOWLEDGE
Besides having the technical knowledge to operate
and maintain your equipment, you must also know how
to use it for tactical advantage over the enemy. Tactics
is the maneuver of forces and the employment of fire
support to defeat the enemy on the battlefield.
Civil War tactics inCluded the various battle drills
for moving and massing soldiers and weapons to gain
an advantage of firepower over the enemy at the decisive point. As we saw with the 20th Maine, extremely
complicated tactical battle drills occurred at company
and regimental levels. How well these were accomplished in the heat of battle was of great importance.
At Little Round Top, Chamberlain and his subordinate leaders had to think creatively to devise new
tactics. They could do this because they had mastered
the tactics of the day and, through training, had instilled them in their soldiers.
Tactics today are more complex than in the Civil
War. There is much more to know-countless formations
and movements involving all types of combat and combat support units.
149

Chapter 6

Because of the nature of modern battle, leaders of
combat support and combat service support units must
know tactics. The modern battlefield will have no safe
areas to the rear, to the flanks, or in the air. Our
potential enemies' tactics include deep attacks into rear
areas designed to disrupt logistics and destroy morale.
In these rear area combat operations, an adjutant general, finance officer, or NCO may have to organize and
lead a platoon of clerks in a defense against a wellarmed enemy unit. If they are to survive, that platoon
of finance or adjutant general clerks must be trained
in basic infantry and antiarmor tactics. Military police
units, engineers guarding key bridgeheads, air defense
artillery units, and small groups of cooks, clerks, and
maintenance soldiers may well find themselves fighting
as infantry against various types of enemy units. The
Battle of the Bulge in World War II might have been
lost without the heroic efforts of small groups of wellled, determined soldiers such as these.

BE TACTICALLY
AND TECHNICALLY
PROFICIENT

150

---------------------------Chapter 6

Technical and tactical knowledge is imperative to
lead soldiers successfully. Soldiers need to feel that they
are following a competent leader who knows his job.

KNOW YOUR UNIT
As we saw with Captain Alden, tactical and technical know ledge is crucial, but, by its elf, it will not
make you an effective leader. You must couple it with
knowledge of yourself and your unit-y·o ur team of
people. If you are to build a disciplined, cohesive unit,
you must know your unit. This means that you must
have a clear understanding of discipline and cohesion.
An effective unit is a group of soldiers who know themselves and each other well; care about each other; share
mutual trust, respect, confidence, and understanding;
and work as a disciplined team to accomplish common
purposes.

DISCIPLINE
Discipline exists in a unit when the unit is orderly,
obedient, controlled, and dependable. A disciplined unit
does its duty promptly and effectively in response to
orders, or even in the absence of orders. The forces that
drive a disciplined unit come from within that unit.
These forces are the values and character of the leaders
and of the individual troops.
The character of a unit is a combination of the character of the leaders and the troops who comprise it. If
the soldiers have courage, initiative, will, creative. thinking, and self-discipline, the unit will tend to develop a
personality, a character, with these traits as its
foundation.
Self-discipline means forcing yourself to do your dutywhat you ought to do-regardless of stress, exhaustion,
or other conditions in the situation. A disciplined unit
forces itself to do its duty in any. situation. In a disciplined unit soldiers at all levels have initiative. A
good subordinate does not idly watch as things deteriorate. In the heat of combat, when he cannot communicate with his senior, he estimates the situation,
gives orders,. and takes the actions he deems appropriate.
151

Chapter 6

In a disciplined unit soldiers deeply value the character trait of self-discipline; therefore, it is a value
shared by most unit members. This shared value causes
the development of such norms as prompt obedience to
orders, dependability in performing all missions, and
initiative in the absence of ord~rs. These norms help
create teamwork, causing all unit members to play by
the same rules of responsibility, honesty, and duty.
How do you develop discipline? Like cohesion, you
get it when you and your subordinate leaders apply
the essential leadership attributes and when you train
your soldiers and unit well. A cohesive, disciplined unit
is the result of effective leadership at all levels. Discipline is the essential quality of a good unit. Survival
under the stressful conditions of combat depends upon it.
The results of a well-disciplined unit are clearly observable:
• All missions are accomplished.
• Soldiers have confidence and a sharp appearance.
• Soldiers are proud of their unit; they know it has a
good reputation.
• Weapons and equipment are well-maintained.
• Soldiers at all levels are actively engaged in doing
their duties. They do not waste time.
• Soldiers cooperate; they willingly help one another.
• Training is well planned, well conducted, and thoroughly evaluated for individual and unit strengths and
weaknesses.
• In combat the unit fights successfully under stress.
Recall and compare the state of these indicators in
Alden's and Randall's companies.
What must you know to develop discipline in your
unit? You must know what Chamberlain and Randall
knew. You must know the material covered in chapters
1 through 5. Especially important is that leaders and
troops share the values explained in chapter 4 and
develop the traits of character explained in chapter 5.
162

~------------------------------------------------------- Chapter6
Recall from chapter 4 that norms are rules that govern
the behavior of group members. The norms that unit
members believe in generally dictate their behavior.
That is why a leader must understand how to influence
the development of norms in his unit. A leader can set
high standards, as he should, but unless those standards become norms that most soldiers in the unit believe in, the standards won't be effective under stress.
There is no easy formula for establishing and maintaining discipline, but the leader should be guided by
the following principles:
• Ensure that norms which contribute to discipline are
established and strengthened. For example, establish
the norm that subordinates should never hide problems
or mistakes. Tell your subordinates that you always
want to know the truth, no matter how bad the problem. Stress that your evaluation of a subordinate will
be lowered if he fails to inform you candidly of problems and mistakes that affect discipline, cohesion, and
mission accomplishment. Norms counter to discipline
must be eliminated. For example, the norm of frequent
heavy drinking and brawling among your soldiers cannot be tolerated. In any unit there will be individual
cases of heavy drinking or brawling, but this should
never be the norm. Stern action should be taken to prevent this type of destructive behavior.
• Set high, yet realistic, standards in all things that
relate to the success of yo-ur unit in training and war.
Communicate these standards clearly. Ensure that standards which apply to training, military courtesy, appearance, maintenance, administration, security, camouflage,
and other important areas are understood and attained.
• When your standards are not met, analyze the situation and decide on a course of action for handling the
situation. Your greatest single job as a leader will be
teaching and motivating all your subordinate soldiers
to achieve the high standards that you set.
First, you must decide whether your standards are
realistic. Do other units achieve such standards? Seek
the advice of experienced leaders whom you respect.
158

Chapter6 -----------------------------------------------------

Adjust your standards if necessary. When your standards are correct, however, do not change them. Recall
the case in chapter 5 of the platoon sergeant who set
high standards on digging in and cleaning weapons.
He set and enforced standards, thus making them become unit norms.
If your standards are on the mark, but you fail to
achieve them, determine the cause. How you get your
subordinates up to standard depends on why they
failed. You can determine the reason for failure by
answering the following questions:
• Did your troops know what was expected?
• Was it communicated clearly and effectively?
• Did they know how to do what was expected?
• Did they have the capability to do it (time, stamina,
knowledge, skills, authority)?
• Did they deliberately fail to meet the standard (laziness, unpleasant duty, anger directed at supervisor,
desire to transfer to another unit, or claiming the task
is not a part of their MOS or job)?
Depending on the answers, your specific problem
may require skill training, more supervision, counseling,
or better communication in explaining how to do the
job. If the cause of the problem is intentional failure

to meet the standard, you must motivate your troops.
Often the best way is to show your troops what is
wrong and to give them another opportunity to do it
right. For example, if your inspection of weapons shows
them to be unsatisfactory, give your soldiers time to
clean them again, and then reinspect. If a soldier's
appearance is poor, have · him stand inspection again,
on his own time. Do the task until it is done right.
In the early 1900s, George C. Marshall, who later
became Army Chief of Staff, was a young officer on
duty in the Philippines. He was leading a patrol through
the jungles when they reached a stream which they
had to cross. As he led the men across, they thought
164

Chapter 6

they heard crocodiles and broke formation, running
pell-mell across the stream. Marshall re-formed them on
the far side, marched them back across the stream to
their starting point, and then marched them back again.
He demonstrated dramatically through this incident that
he would not tolerate undisciplined behavior, even in
the face of danger.
To get your soldiers to meet your standards, you may
need to reprimand an individual or a group. When you
do so, do not become arrogant or abusive. An oral reprimand can be at the site of the infraction, in private,
or in an office or other location. When you reprimand
a soldier for doing something wrong, you should simultaneously counsel him. Explain to the soldier what he
did wrong and why it is unacceptable in terms of standards, values, and desired character traits. Explain how
the soldier can improve his behavior, -beliefs, values,
and character. Focus on the specific behavior you want
the subordinate to change. Do not degrade his personality.
How you reprimand and counsel affects the later behavior of the individual or group. Your manner can
increase respect for you, or it can cause deep feelings
of resentment, hostility, and injustice.
All leaders want their soldiers to do well. The failure
of soldiers to do well is particularly frustrating to the
leader. Frustration tends to lead to aggression and to
some loss of personal control. You, the leader, are in
an official position of power over the soldier. It may
be tempting for you to work off your frustrations by
yelling at the soldier, threatening him, or otherwise
verbally abusing him. Keep yourself in check while
accomplishing the reprimand and counseling session.
Imagine the soldier with his spouse or mother standing
on one side and your battalion commander standing
on the other. If you do that, you should be able to
conduct your reprimand with the right balance of military firmness and recognition . of human dignity.
166

Chapter 6

COHESION
Cohesion is the existence of strong bonds of mutual
respect, trust, confidence, and understanding among
members of a group. Cohesion and discipline are intertwined. If a unit is to be disciplined, performing all its
missions promptly and well under stress, it must be
cohesive. Cohesion results from the respect, confidence,
caring, and communication that bind members of a unit
together-mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. The
level of cohesion depends upon how well the unit can
work as a smoothly functioning team to accomplish all
missions in peace or war.
Caring is an essential element of the bonds of cohesion among all soldiers, including leaders, in a unit. A
soldier's courage and will under stress are strengthened
by his belief that his leader and buddies will try to
help him because they care for him.
The cohesion of a unit can be seen by watching the
unit operate in training or in combat. The cohesion of
the 20th Maine was obvious at Little Round Top. The
unit repositioned itself to the left and bent itself back
to form a new defensive line. Individual soldiers
responded in unison as a team, swiftly shifting itself
in response to danger from a new direction. Voice
control by leaders was impossible. These soldiers-leaders
and troops-displayed strong bonds of respect, confidence,
caring, and communication that "glued" them together
mentally and spiritually to form a cohesive fighting
unit. These bonds are the essence of cohesion and
discipline.
For true cohesion to exist, there must be a union of
thought and information among all members, at all
times, about the unit's problems and missions. This
union can occur only if the bonds connecting the
soldiers (leaders and troops) are strong. The strength
of the bonds is dependent upon respect, trust, and
confidence, and upon the degree of open, candid
communication that produces understanding. A constant
flow of information strengthens the bonds, maintains
166

I ..-Chapter 6

respect and confidence, and allows a unit to remain
cohesive and powerful while accomplishing difficult
missions under stress.
The following quotations by Ardant du Picq, the
French military writer, give some perspective on cohesion:
"A wise organization [or leader] ensures that the
personnel of combat groups changes as little as possible, so that comrades in peace time maneuvers shall
be comrades in war. " 9
"Four brave men who do not know each other will
not dare to attack a lion. Four less brave, but knowing
each other well, sure of their reliability and consequently of mutual aid, will attack resolutely." 10
In other words, cohesion actually builds confidence,
morale, courage, and will to fight in the individual soldiers of a unit. This has the following implication for
leaders:
• Do not continually reassign subordinate leaders and
soldiers to different jobs and squads. Do not reassign
Private Jones into the 3d squad because it temporarily
has fewer members than the other squads. Do not continually reassign drivers or they will not take pride in
their vehicles. Do not rotate more experienced people into
"softer" jobs as a reward for good service. Do send
units (squads or platoons), not collections of individuals,
to accomplish tasks. Bonds of respect, trust, confidence,
and understanding take time to develop. When people
or leaders are shifted, bonds are broken and new ones
must be built. While they are building, the unit does
not function as well. Weak bonds cause communication
breakdowns, disciplinary problems, and disintegration
under stress.
• Put your soldiers through significant, emotional experiences in which they do things they did not believe
they could do as individuals or as a unit. An example

466-680 0 - 85 - 6 : QL 3

167

Chapter 6

of such an experience is a stressful all-night road
march, followed by a river crossing and a sudden violent attack on a realistic opposing force. As they go
through each experience, they must help each other to
achieve their common purpose. As a platoon, squad, or
section leader of any unit, you could take your unit
through this type of training on your own initiative.
Get the training area, plan it, and do it.
• Resolve interpersonal conflicts between unit members
in a constructive way so that respect, confidence, and
candid communication between the conflicting soldiers
are restored. This requires the problem-solving skills
discussed in chapter 7 and the counseling skills explained in chapter 9. Constructive resolution of conflict
is critical because you cannot afford broken bonds between unit members. Broken bonds cause the unit-the
family-t-o deteriorate, to lose power, and to become
unglued and unable to function under stress.
• Always try to keep unit members working together,
as a team, toward a common purpose. This principle
applies to all training, details, maintenance, and administration.

SUMMARY
This chapter has explained and illustrated some of
the key things a leader must know if he is to understand the four factors of leadership. We explained what
you rµust know about yourself, human nature, your job,
and your unit. This knowledge is fundamental to the
development and application of your crucial be, know,
and do leadership attributes.
Invisible threads weave together the overall be,
know, and do attributes of a leader. Chapters 4 and 5
explained the essential "being" foundation of a leadervalues, ethics, and character. This chapter has explained essential knowledge that is built on the bedrock
of a leader's values and character. What a leader doesthe application of his skills-flows from his "being" and
"knowing" foundation. It is to these crucial leadership
action skills-what they are and how you can learn
and apply them-that we now tum.

This chapter addresses the thini:ng aspects of leadership. It explains and illustrates how to be a creative,
logical thinker. Your thinking skills are called directional skills because they set the direction for your
unit. They provide vision, purpose, and goal definition.
They are your eyes to the future, allowing you to sense
the need for change, when to make it, and how to
manage it.
As a leader you must continually analyze the situation,

identify problems and their real causes, make decisions,
and plan. These thinking skills are crucial to developing a disciplined, cohesive, combat-effective unit. Thinking skills explained in this chapter include identifying,
analyzing and solving problems; making decisions; planning; and goal setting.

PROBLEM SOLVING
There are times when you have a week or a month
to solve a problem and to plan. At other times you
have seconds or minutes. The following case illustrates
the basic steps of problem solving, decision making,
. and planning.

General Warren was a staff officer. Normally staff
officers and NCOs do not make command decisions.
However, staff officers, NCOs, and warrant officers are
leaders. In a crisis, if they cannot communicate with
their commander, they must use initiative and take the
action the commander would take if he knew the
situation.

161

Chapter 7

Colonel Vincent knew that he was acting on his
own initiative without the knowledge or orders of his
division commander. But he immediately identified the
problem, analyzed the information given to him by the
staff officer, and took the action he knew his commander
would want him to take.
This case illustrates seven basic steps of problem
solving, decision making, and planning:

1111 Identify the problem. General Warren was on a
personal reconnaissance actively looking for actual or
potential problems. He realized that Little Round Top
was undefended. If tha Confederates took it, they could
easily attack the flank and rear of the Union Line and
win the battle. Therefore, General Warren identified the
problem as-"How to get a Union force to defend Little Round Top before the Confederates take the hill."

1111 Gather information. In the few moments available, General Warren gathered and analyzed all the information he could on the enemy, the terrain, and
friendly forces. He knew that the Army Commander's
plan called for the defense of Little Round Top. Since
it was unoccupied, he reasoned that a terrible mistake
caused .the Union Line to be unhinged.
B Develop courses of action. Warren had only two
realistic courses of action. One was to send word immediately to the Army Commander about the situation and
wait for his order. The other was to send word to
Meade but also to request help from the nearest corps
commander.
llJI Analyze and compare courses of action. Warren
quickly compared the advantages and disadvantages of
both courses of action.

H Make a decision; select a course of action. Since
there was no time to await a response from Meade, he
chose to· send word to Meade asking for a division but
also, on his own initiative, to send for the nearest help.
1111 Make a plan. Warren made a plan that included
who would do what, when, where, how, and why.
162

Chapter 7

H

Implement the plan. Warren ordered an aide to
ride to the nearest corps commander and urgently request help. He sent word of the situation to General
Meade. Part of implementing a plan is continually evaluating it by getting feedback on the plan's effectiveness.
If evaluation shows the need for corrective action, ·
the problem-solving thought process begins again, and
leaders take appropriate corrective action. General Warren's plan was effective. No changes were necessary.
This case about a general in the Civil War is relevant to leaders today. The chaotic, lethal nature of
modern battle will cause communication breakdowns at
all levels. Radios will go out; plans will be uncoordinated. Crises will develop in unexpected ways. The solutions to these crises will require clear, creative thinking and initiative by soldiers of all ranks. Staff officers
may have to give orders. The fate of a company may
depend on the decisions and plans of a private.
Soldiers may get cut off and isolated, like Rifleman
Dodd. To survive, they must know how to think and
plan. Their decisions and plans, like Dodd's, may have
a great impact on the enemy and on our own units.
Soldiers trained by leaders who communicate directionclear guidance-will know what to do. They will do
what their commander would have done if he were
there and knew the situation.

In the case the fate of the nation depended on the decisions of General Warren, Warren's aide, General Sykes,
Sykes' staff officer, Colonel Vincent, and Colonel Chamberlain. In modern battle the fate of our nation may
rest on the collective decisions and initiative of captains, lieutenants, warrant officers, sergeants, specialists, and privates.
The following case, based on an actual incident, occurred because a soldier challenged authority in a disrespectful manner. You could be challenged in a similar
situation. This case will help you determine how to
think when confronted with this type of problem.
163

Chapter 7 ---------------------------------------------------------

You are a newly promoted sergeant E5 and have
just been given a squad. You have sensed some resentment toward you as the "new" leader. The squad
leader you replaced was popular with his troops, but
he was relieved for consistent failure to motivate the
squad to achieve standards. Your new squad has been
assigned the mission of firing a rifle salute at a ceremony. You had a meeting with the platoon sergeant,
so your squad has already gone to the parade field to
prepare for rehearsal.
Your squad is lounging in a corner of the parade
field. As you approach, you decide to inspect your
troops' weapons informally before the rehearsal. You
state to the squad that you want to check their weapons. They don't move. You walk to Private Hart who
gives you a challenging stare-as if to say, "You won't
check my weapon." You ask him for his weapon. He
says, "Go to hell, Sarge."

A LEADER
CANNOT
TOLERATE
INSUBORDINATION

164

---------------------------Chapter 7

This infuriates you, but you control your emotion,
remaining outwardly calm. Your mind swiftly goes to
work on the problem:

a

Identify the problem. This soldier has challenged
your authority and put you in a difficult position. He
has given you a major disciplinary problem-disrespect
and insubordination-before you have had the chance
to get to know your people and the informal norms of
the squad. The way you handle this problem will have
a major impact on cohesion, discipline, and the respect
your troops have for you. You identify the problem as
-"How to take immediate action to gain control and
maintain discipline while earning the long-term respect
of your troops."

lfll Gather information. In this case you have no
time to gather further information.

B

Develop courses of action. You think of the following alternatives:

• Course of action I-Immediately reprimand Private
Hart in front of the squad for insubordination. Inform
him that you will recommend an Article 15 for his insubordination. If he continues to disobey, you will recommend court-martial.
• Course of action 2-Stand in front of Private Hart

for a short time; look him in the eye. Then order him
to stand up and hand you his rifle.

B

Analyze and compare courses of action.
• Advantages of course of action 1.
-You come across as strong and decisive.
- You immediately assert yourself as the authority.
• Disadvantages of course of action 1.
-It is normally unprofessional to reprimand, embarrass, or humiliate a soldier in front of a
group.

165

Chapter 7

-You will show your hand by telling him what
punishment you will recommend. It is never
wise to tell a subordinate exactly what punishment you will recommend until you have had a
chance to think the situation through and discuss
it with your seniors. It is always better to say
simply that you intend to recommend appropriate
action. That leaves your options open.
• Advantages of course of action 2.
-You will not be reprimanding Private Hart in
front of others; you can reprimand him later in
private.
-You will show that you will not back down
from a challenge.
-You will prove that you do not immediately resort to threats to get compliance.
- You will not show your hand. You can still
recommend any punishment you believe is right.
• Disadvantages of course of action 2.
- You do not immediately assert yourself as the
unquestioned authority. He embarrassed you in
front of the group; therefore, you could reason
that you have the right to do the same. Some
of your troops may initially think they can get
away with disrespectful and insubordinate be-

havior like Private Hart's.

B

Make a decision; select a course of action. You
decide on course of action 2. Initially some of your
troops may think Private Hart got away with insubordination, but they will learn otherwise when they find
out that you sternly reprimanded Hart in the presence
of his fire team leader, counseled him, and recommended him for nonjudicial punishment.

,M M Make a plan. Quickly think through what you
will do. Include contingencies in your plans. Order Private Hart to stand up and present his weapon. If he
166

Chapter 7

does, inspect the weapon; then order him and his fire
team leader to meet you immediately after the rehearsal. If he refuses, inform him that he has been insubordinate, and give him another order. By refusing
your order, he will have committed two serious courtmartial offenses. If he still refuses, immediately send
for the platoon sergeant or platoon leader while you
inspect weapons. This plan prepares you for possible
contingencies if he obeys or if he continues to disobey.

H

Implement the plan (communicate, coordinate, supervise, and evaluate). If evaluation indicates a need
for change, the problem-solving process begins again
and appropriate action is taken. Depending on what
Private Hart does, take action in terms of your plan or
make appropriate changes. Observe the effect of your
actions on the manner and obedience of the other soldiers in the squad. Explain that you will not tolerate
insubordination and disobedience; suitable disciplinary
action will always be taken against those offenses.
As a leader, you are beset by many problems. The
problem may be how best to accomplish a mission, how
to handle a soldier who is performing poorly, how to
help a subordinate with marital problems, or how best
to train your soldiers to operate and maintain their weapons and equipment.
A logical thought process helps ensure that you will
not neglect key forces that influence the problem. We
introduced you to this basic thinking process in chapter
4 when we explained and applied the ethical reasoning
process. That same clear, logical thought process
applies to all leadership problems. The problemsolving process just described and illustrated is an excellent tool to guide you.
Much of your ability as a problem solver depends
on correct identification of the problem, the accuracy
of your information, speedy analysis, a sound decision,
and rapid execution.
167

Chapter 7

NATURE OF THE PROBLEM
"Personal reconnaissance and face-to-face communication" are crucial principles to follow in determining
the nature of a problem. Even by following these principles, however, you will not always determine the
real problem and produce a plan that will succeed. All
leadership problems, whether they involve a tactical situation on the battlefield or a counseling situation in garrison, are exploratory in nature. We do not always identify the right cause of the problem or always develop
the best plan. We make mistakes. Personal reconnaissance and face-to-face communication may fail to determine the true source of the problem. We may develop
an inadequate plan.
The key is to seek feedback constantly on how your
plan is doing. Get feedback from subordinates, go to
the point of action, determine why the plan is not working, determine what mistaken assumptions you made,
and take immediate action to correct the plan. Mental
flexibility is vital.
Colonel Oates' historic decision to withdraw at Little
Round Top shows the disasters that can occur if decision makers are given inaccurate information. Oates,
commander of the 15th and 47th Alabama Regiments,
received false information from his front line. His company commanders reported that a Union regiment and
a large cavalry force were on their rear and flanks.

Oates failed to question this false information. It led
him to incorrect identification of the problem and to
incorrect assumptions about the causes of the problem.
Colonel Oates thought his problem was encirclement
by superior forces. Therefore, when he used the right
problem-solving process, it led to the wrong decision.
His actual problems, just prior to his unit's panicking,
were (1) his unit's loss of the initiative and (2) the development of the initial stages of panic. Both were due to
the surprise and psychological shock of the 20th
Maine's charge and B Company's firing into their rear
and flanks.
168

---------------------------Chapter 7

Oates failed to consider the possibility that his subordinates' exhausted, fear-filled minds were imagining
enemies that did not exist. Had he identified his problem as-"How do I regain initiative and forward momentum?-he would not have considered breakout from
encirclement as a course of action. This incorrect identification of the problem was a mental error. Oates
thought his problem was superior Union forces, yet he
actually outnumbered the Union forces about 3 to 1.
This error set the two great Alabama regiments moving 180° in the wrong direction, towards a defeat with
great consequences. On the other hand, Chamberlain
accurately identified the 20th Maine's problem and the
causes of the problem. This led him to the only reasonable course of action-fix bayonets and charge.
As shown by this case, one of the most common
errors of leaders in thinking skills is identifying the
wrong problem or the wrong causes of a problem. The
tendency for leaders to make mental errors increases
as the levels of fatigue and stress increase.
You must learn to identify your real problems. Consider all angles. You must learn to seek accurate information that leads you to the real causes of the problem. Ensure that your information is accurate. Question
its validity. S. L. A. Marshall said, "In the fog of war

much of the information you need is hidden behind a
curtain."
You must take what accurate information you have,
use your best judgment, and make educated assumptions about the causes of a problem. Then consider the
courses of action most likely to succeed. That is what
Chamberlain did when he reasoned that a charge
might take the initiative from the enemy.

It is a fallacy to think that using a correct formula
or set of steps will lead you to the real problem and to
a successful course of action. Your values, character,
knowledge, and way of thinking have a direct and
169

Chapter 7 -----------------------------------------------------

vital impact on the problems you identify as important.
These inner qualities affect how you view, gather, and
analyze information bearing on the problems.
Your thinking must be clear and logical, or your solution will not be sound. Your thinking cannot be clear
and logical without adequate sleep. Fatigue and extreme thirst due to the lost watering party affected the
judgment of Colonel Oates and his subordinates.
They had marched all night and all day prior to the
battle. On the other hand, Colonel Chamberlain and
his subordinates rested from 0200 to 0400 and 1200 to
1500, just prior to the battle.
Some leaders correctly identify a problem in the performance of a soldier. They often make an error, however, in assuming that the problem is caused by lack
of motivation. Therefore, they attack the assumed
cause-motivation-by threatening the soldier with punishment. If the cause of the soldier's problem is lack
of self-confidence, the leader's course of action-threat
of punishment-causes resentment and fear on the part
of the soldier. Furthermore, it aggravates the cause of
the problem. By attacking the wrong cause, the leader
further damages the soldier's lack of self-confidence. Additionally, it causes the soldier to resent and lose confidence in the leader. This is a common mistake. Alden
types make this mistake often; Randalls rarely make
it. When Randall types do make it, they get feedback
and correct the mistake. The mental error of assuming
the wrong cause for a problem can have a long-term
negative impact on cohesion and discipline.
Another basic error leaders tend to make in problem solving is to attack symptoms of a problem instead
of the actual underlying problem. For example, a unit
may have a high rate of deadlined vehicles, AWOL,
and crime. Some leaders-the Alden types-would attack each one of these indicators or symptoms with coercive, punishment-oriented courses of action. The
source of these unit problems is normally that leaders
within the unit lack a good combination of the basic
170

Chapter 7

leadership attributes. Yet, leaders of poor units have a
million reasons and excuses for their units' poor performance. They rarely indentify the real reason-the inadequacy of their own leadership. This situation has a
negative impact on cohesion and discipline. The only
solution is to develop good leaders.
These examples illustrate how your thinking skillsproblem solving, decision making, and planning-influence the direction your unit takes in terms of cohesion,
discipline, training, maintenance, combat effectiveness,
and mission accomplishment.

FLEXIBILITY OF MIND
The ability to make appropriate changes in decisions
and plans requires a certain flexibility of mind, a crucial trait of a good problem solver and planner. As
S. L. A. Marshall points out:
"All combat is ... exploratory. When in the course
of operations the true situation is made clear, the commander who thereafter holds rigidly to his original
plan, whether because he is too dull to appreciate what
has happened or too indifferent to change over, must
be regarded as having failed his troops in the most
vital particular. It is a failure without excuse."1 Later
Marshall has this to say: "Sixty percent of the art of command [or good problem solving] is the ability to anticipate; 40 percent ... the ability to improvise, to reject
the preconceived idea that has been tested and proved
wrong, ... and to rule by action instead of acting by
rules.'~

Be prepared and anticipate change. Think of as
many "what ifs" as you can. Prepare for them. The
laws of probability are strongly in favor of surprise.
Don't be surprised. Make plans to counteract events
that might endanger mission accomplishment.
ls. L.. A. Marshall, Men Against Fire, p 107.
2Marshall, p 108.

171

Chapter 7

Earlier we discussed the character trait of will or
determination. A soldier's strong will can ca use disaster if it becomes stubbornness in sticking to a course
of action regardless of reality. Never let your strong
will turn into mental rigidity. By the same token, don't
let your flexibility of mind cause you to vacillate or
bend with each shift of the wind. "You have somehow,
in yourselves, in your own characters, to strike the balance between flexibility of mind and strength of will. "3
OBJECTIVITY AND INTUITION
After you have objectively and logically analyzed
the possible courses of action in a situation using all
available information, consider your intuitions and emotions. Are the courses of action consistent with professional values? The decision-making process is not a
purely objective, rational, mathematical formula. The
human mind does not work that way, especially under
stress. The mind is both rational and intuitive. Your intuition is that aspect of your mind that tells you what
"feels" right or wrong. Your intuition flows from your
instincts and your experience.
Since the decision-making process is a thought process, it is both rational and intuitive. However, never
make the mistake of making decisions guided totally
by emotions or intuitions and immediately doing what
''feels" right. This is a prescription for disaster. First
follow the problem-solving thinking process as rationally and objectively as possible. Gather information;
then develop, analyze, and compare courses of action.
Then consider your intuition or hunches, your emotions, and your values. Try to identify a "best" course
of action that is logical and likely to succeed and that
also "feels" right in terms of your intuition, values,
and character. Finally, make your decision, plan, and
take action.

Chapter 7

IMPACT OF CHARACTER
Character has a strong impact on a leader~s judgment and application of the problem-solving process.
When the Civil War began, General McClellan was
thought of as the Union's best general. He did a brilliant job of setting and achieving training goals. His
application of the problem-solving process in training
was superb. He was intelligent-a brilliant strategist
and tactician. He knew the lessons of military history.
His appearance, bearing, and manner of relating to soldiers were inspirational. As well as any officer in the
Army, he had the knowledge to be a skilled general in
war. For all these reasons he was loved by his
soldiers.
Under the fog and stress of battle, however, McClellan could not see reality. On several occasions, in the
heat of battle with victory within his grasp, fears
would cloud his mind. He would believe incorrectly that
he was vastly outnumbered, and he would withdraw.
At these crucial moments in history, his character
failed to control his fears and keep his mind clear to
see and deal with reality. At the Battle of Seven Days,
all his actions were dictated by his false fear that the
enemy was twice as strong as it actually was. "It was
the supreme example of his gift for fantasy.""
Why did McClellan make these false assumptions?
What fears destroyed his judgment? It appears that
McClellan had created an image of himself and his
army of milita r y perfection and confidence. Yet it
seems that subconsciously he feared that he and his
army might prove incompetent at the moment of truthdecisive combat where one army would lose. He refused
to face this fear and master it. He handled it by repressing it into his subconscious mind, refusing to admit
that it existed. This worked most of the time. The
greater the stress of battle, however, the more his fear
of defeat would break through to his consciousness,
affecting his emotions and problem-solving ability.
4T. Harry Williams, McClellan, Sherman, and Grant, p 38.

173

Chapter 7

Rather than face his fear, deal with it, and take reasonable risks, he would withdraw his army and excuse
the withdrawal by saying the enemy was too strong.
He claimed that he did not want to risk the destruction of his army. McClellan ultimately blamed the poli5
ticians because they had not given him enough men.
This example is about a general, but generals have
the same human nature as sergeants and privates.
They are subject to the same fears and errors in judgment that distort clear thinking and good problem solving while under stress. This example of fears and character flaws affecting the thought process of problem
solving and decision making is applicable to any level
leader. It shows also how the stress of battle affects
the minds, emotions, and behavior of leaders and
troops. FM 26-2 can help you recognize the effects of
stress and learn how to deal with them. It is important reading for all leaders.
The examples of problem solving and decision making have been given for a specific reason. We cannot
give you formulas or solutions to the array of problems
you will face. What we can give you in this manual is
a way of thinking about the kinds of problems you will
face as a leader and basic, time-proven tools for attacking the problems. Correct use of the tools, such as the
problem-solving process, is critical. However, without
the character to control fears and deal with reality, and
without clear thinking and good judgment, the tools

will not work. As shown by the examples, you must
quickly and accurately analyze the situation and determine potential and actual problems and their real
causes.
Now that you understand the basic problem-solving
and decision-making process, it is important to give you
a detailed explanation and an example of how to plan.

PLANNING TRAINING
In the charge at Little Round Top, Colonel Chamberlain had only minutes to analyze the problem, make
a decision, and plan. In peacetime, you have more time
Gwnliama, PP 40-41.

174

---------------------------Chapter 7

to plan training. More than any other single factor,
training builds a cohesive, disciplined unit that can
win in war. Training is your number one priority in
peace.
Three primary parts to training are planning, conducting, and evaluating. If training is well planned, it
will go well. Our Army has developed a set of concepts
and methods for the detailed planning of training. (For
detailed discussions on managing and conducting training in units, see FM 25-2, and FM 25-3). The following example is a comprehensive one, based on fact,
which illustrates how to plan training.
In this example you, a modem day leader, will go
through a clear thinking process with input from your
subordinates. You will develop a plan for excellent
training. In this particular example you are an infantry
platoon leader planning for a night attack. The same
process applies for all company-, battery-, or troop-level
leaders. If you are a combat support or combat service
support leader, simply change the mission to-"Support forces conducting a night attack." The purpose of
the example is to teach you how to plan for worthwhile training. The thinking process illustrated here
applies to any training mission at any level of company leadership.
Based on the last field training exercise and after
consultation with your squad leaders, you have decided
that your platoon needs training on a night attack. You
know that in 50 days your unit will be going to a maneuver training area, giving you the opportunity to
train on a platoon night attack. Your commander has
included this training mission for a specific night, in
a specific area of his overall plan. The battalion 83
and battalion commander have approved the company
training plan.
Call a meeting of your platoon sergeants and squad
leaders. Tell them that by the end of the week you intend to have a complete, detailed training plan for the

175

platoon night attack. Inform them of the date the
training will take place and the training area designated for this night attack. Advise them that the purpose of the planning session is to get their valuable
input on how best to accomplish this training mission.
Some of them know the terrain better than you from
previous experience.
You know they are anticipating this mission because
after the last field training, you had all agreed that
the night attack was a weakness that required work.
You had also discussed how preparation for the night
attack would result in work on many other necessary
individual and collective skills such as navigation, communication, and fire and movement.
The available 50 days to plan allow you to request
opposing force weapons, vehicles, uniforms, helicopters,
and other necessary training aids and support. Developing the plan now will guide the squad leaders on individual and squad tasks that they should work on to
prepare for the night attack. It will also allow you, the
platoon leader, to work with your subordinate leaders
on the leader tasks and skills, such as command and
control in the dark. You state that before the training
plan is complete, you will have listed all the required
individual tasks, collective tasks, leader tasks, training
aids, and support required for the mission. You will
also have developed a scenario and a detailed time schedule for the occurrence of specific events.
You review these points with your subordinates to
provide necessary background for the meeting and to
get them thinking creatively about needed plans. At
this point you have stated the mission and have given
your general guidance on requirements. You have set
the direction for the session.
Now it is wise for you, the ranking man, to back
off and allow your subordinates to exercise their initiative and mental powers. To establish this climate start
asking questions, such as, "Sergeant Rodriguez, you
176

Chapter 7

WHE ,N POSSIBLE

SUBORDINATES
IN THE
PLANNl ,N G
PROCESS

know that ground well. What do you think is the best
area for the objective, the line of departure, and the
approach routes? What do the rest of you think?"
Be sure to state up front that you want people to
be frank. Differing points of view stimulate creative thinking. You want quality thinking. The only rule is to
treat each other with respect. In the final analysis, you
will make the decision, but until that time you
want honest opinions and the best of everybody's
thoughts. Ask, "When should we kick off the attack?
What do we really want to gain by this training?
What are some side benefits from this training that

we can get if we plan for them? Who should be the
opposing force (OPFOR)?"
Your job in this questioning or brainstorming phase
is to develop a creative atmosphere that causes your
subordinates to think and to exercise their imagination
and problem-solving skills. This, in itself, is part of the
process of developing the leadership of your subordinates and preparing them for more responsibility. You
should ensure that• No disruptive emotional arguments or resentments
hinder this atmosphere.
• You do not hinder creativity with your rank.
177

Chapter 7

• The ideas of your quiet subordinates are requested
and listened to. Sometimes the quiet ones have the best
ideas.
• A big chalkboard, butcher paper, or writing paper is
available for recording all suggestions, ideas, support
required, things to be coordinated, things to be checked
on, and like items.
While participating in this questioning and brainstorming phase, don't hinder the thinking of your subordinates. You may want to jot your thoughts down as
they are triggered and keep them until the end of the
brainstorming phase. No criticism will be allowed. All
ideas will be accepted and respected in the brainstorming phase.
You should also ask two key questions. What are
all the ingredients necessary for successful training?
What are all the possible forces or events that could
hinder or destroy the quality of this training? As
much as possible, get the answers to those questions.
Then plan the positive forces and events, and take action to prevent any obstructions that might hinder the
training in any way.
After brainstorming, you are in a position to develop
several alternative courses of action-objectives, routes,
time schedules, OPFOR, and maneuver forces. List
these overall broad courses of action on the board or
on butcher paper. Get everyone's opinion on which
course of action will best meet the needs of the unit.
Create a list of pros and cons for each course of action.
This is the time for frank disagreement, critical thinking, and the exercise of judgment. Give everyone a
chance to make his argument. Finally, compare the
courses of action in terms of which will best accomplish
the training mission.
Having listened carefully to the judgment of your
subordinates, you must determine the best course of action. Using your judgment, mentally go over all available information, all opposing arguments, all known
178

and possibly relevant forces and factors, and the real
needs of the unit. Choose the course of action that you
believe will best train and develop your platoon. Make
your decision; communicate it to your subordinates.
A detailed plan must include who, what, when,
where, how, and why for all tasks to be accomplished.
In addition, organizing is an important part of detailed
planning. Organizing is the process of creating and
maintaining the conditions necessary for effectively executing plans. It involves systematically defining and
arranging each task with respect to the achievement
of the overall mission or objective. Organizing consists
of three major steps:

D

Determine all tasks. In this phase you and your
subordinates determine all tasks and conditions necessary to carry out the plan. It is very important to consider timing, when each task must be done. A helpful
approach to determining all tasks, conditions, and appropriate timing is "backward planning." Look at your
goal and decide what must be done to accomplish the
goal. In this example the mission is to conduct successful training on the night attack. That is the start point
for your planning, and from there you plan back in
time to the present. What must be done the day prior
to the mission? What must be done the week prior and
2 weeks prior to the mission?
In this way you plan from the moment of the mission back to the present to determine what must be
done when. For example, to accomplish the mission
your soldiers need certain collective skills. Identify
these skills, and determine when your soldiers will
train for them. Identify what individual skills your sol_.
diers will need to successfully execute the required collective skills. Decide when you will teach these skills.
Backward planning simply means looking at the big
picture first and then planning all tasks, conditions,
and details in a logical sequence to make the big picture happen.
179

Chapter 7

In backward planning, you and your subordinates
brainstorm all conditions necessary to carry out the
plan successfully. Include all the details of support,
time schedule, training aids, weapons, equipment, required coordination, and required checks. Your unit
should have detailed training SOPs and checklists to assist you in this phase. If it does not, you must take
action to develop them. In this stage, you and your
subordinates must think of every possible detail that
will help or hinder training. Ensure that all important
points and details are written down.
Then organize these details into categories such as
OPFOR, support, training aids, supplies, tactical maneuvers, and other relevant categories. List all the details
under the categories. Jot down tentatively who will do
what and when they will do it. Come up with a "todo" list for each catiegory. These t<Hlo lists become an overall checklist that you use to ensure that everything is
progressing as planned.
D Set up a structure to accomplish all tasks. In this
phase you set priorities. You and your subordinates cannot do everything at once; some things are more important than others. Obviously, if your platoon was very
weak on navigation during the last exercise, training
in navigation is a must. Your ability to fire and maneuver won't be effective if leaders and soldiers are poor
navigators. Infantry soldiers need to be skilled at individual movement under fire before you will have a
platoon that is good at fire and maneuver.
Set priorities for each category and organize your
to-do lists in terms of those priorities. Establish A, B,
and C priorities for each to-do list. The A priorities
must be done today; B priorities must be done in the
next 2 or 3 days; C priorities can wait. Do the A priorities first, then the Bs, and the Cs.6 Assign someoneyou, your platoon sergeant, or a squad leader-to do
each task on each list. Develop a system-known by
all leaders and troops-for checking each other and
ensuring that each task is accomplished on time.
8Lakein, Alan, How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life, pp 25-27.

180

B

Allocate resources. Ensure that you have identified all required resources and planned for obtaining
and allocating them.
1

When you have completed the resource phase, you
will have a valuable plan to meet a crucial training
need of your unit. The quality of this plan is enhanced
by the years of experience and the skills of your platoon sergeant and squad leaders. By asking for their
input, your subordinates contributed many ideas and
details that you might have overlooked. You have
proven that you value their intelligence and experience.
Everyone has contributed to the plan. Consequently,
everyone has an emotional stake in the plan, and this
will enhance motivation and quality training.
You now have 49 days to develop this plan and all
the necessary individual, collective, and leadership
skills to carry it out. You must ensure that every detail
is covered so that the training develops your soldiers
into a cohesive, disciplined unit that can win in battle.
If you are a squad leader, conduct a meeting with
your squad members and go through the same process
that the platoon leader used in his meeting. Develop a
complete, organized plan to prepare for your squad's
part of the mission.
This example of a platoon planning for a night
attack is important because it illustrates how to con-

duct a comprehensive planning process. This way of
problem solving, decision making, and planning has
proven to be a highly successful way of gaining valuable input from subordinates, developing teamwork, and
creating the conditions for excellent training. It illustrates• How to conduct a meeting in which you, the senior
leader, make the final decisions, but gain good ideas
from subordinates and keep them informed.
• How to analyze the advantages and disadvantages
of courses of action.
• How to determine the best course of action.
181

Chapter 7 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

You have involved your soldiers and used their initiative in the planning process. All soldiers in your unit
will now be informed about training that will take
place in 6 or 7 weeks. They will know what they will
be doing between now and then to make that training
meaningful. Being informed will greatly enhance their
motivation and effectiveness.
The planning process you used helps develop teamwork because you planned as a team. You will prepare
as a team; you will execute as a team; you will evaluate
the training as a team.
Use the evaluation process explained in FM 25-3. In
the evaluation, each soldier should tell of his experience, what he learned, what went right, what went
wrong, what needs improvement. Write a complete lessons learned after-action report that includes all
strengths, weaknesses, and problem areas indicated by
the training. Use this report to update your training
SOP or to develop an SOP if your unit lacks one.
There are many official job aids available to help
you develop a similar training plan and conduct this
type of planning meeting. If you plan in the way described here, you will be well on your way to developing a well-trained, cohesive, disciplined, combat-ready
unit.

GOAL SETTING
Goal setting is a critical part of leadership; it sets
the direction for your unit. When you assume a leadership position, you and your subordinates should ensure
that you have a set of clearly written goals and policies
which you all understand and support.
When setting goals for your unit, remember several
key points:
• Goals should be realistic and attainable.
• Goals should lead to improved combat readiness.
• Subordinates should be involved in the goal-setting
process.
182

--------------------------------------------------~Chapter7

• Goals should be established, as a minimum, for training, maintenance, discipline, morale, cohesion, and development of subordinates.
• A program or set of policies should be developed to
achieve each goal.

SUMMARY
This chapter has focused on the thinking or directional skills critical to leadership. These skills literally
set the direction for your unit. The correct application
of these skills is complex and difficult, requiring knowledge, good judgment, and character.

-----------------------~;~------------------

184

Once you have a good plan, you need both implementing and motivating skills to ensure the plan is
carried out. This chapter explains the type of leadership
that includes the implementing skills of leadershipcommunication, coordination, supervision, and evaluation.

COMMUNICATION
This section explains the need for effective exchange
of information and ideas. It defines and explains the
communication process, the barriers or filters to effective communication, and how to develop effective communication in your unit.
NEED FOR EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION
Control of units is dependent upon effective communication. Faulty communication causes most unit problems. It leads to confusion and can cause a good plan
to fail. A squad leader's report can become distorted
186

Chapter 8

by the time it reaches the company commander. Leaders may have no idea of the size, strength, location,
and intentions of friendly units on their flanks. Supplies may not be delivered to the right place at the right
time because the supply people remain uninformed.
Incidents like these have been happening throughout history. They often cause demoralization and defeat.
Failure to communicate effectively while solving problems and while executing plans is one of the greatest
obstacles to success in training and in battle.
After a major field training period at a post in the
United States, an S3 wrote the following training note
to all leaders in the battalion. The communication problems experienced in this unit are typical of those you
will encounter as a leader.

Training Note
Many of the problems that occur in training and
during operations are a direct result of people failing to
communicate with each other. Each company was badly
deficient in keeping the tactical operations center (TOC)
informed. It is battalion SOP that each company keep
the TOC informed of locations, activities, and other relevant information. This was never done. Battalion HQ
always had to call and ask for situation reports. During the field training exercise, the reconnaissance platoon could not contact the TOC by radio due to extended
distance. They were relaying valuable reports on OPFOR
activity through a line company for 36 hours, but the
TOC never received a report during that time on
recon's valuable information. Not only did the company
radio telephone operators fail to relay to battalion HQ,
they also failed to inform their own company commanders
of the reports. This would have cost lives if we were in
combat.

186

Chapter 8

In another case, a battalion order was given at 0900,
yet at 2300 that night the platoon leaders of one
company had not received the order for the mission
which was to start at 0700 the next day. A unit simply
cannot function well if people at all levels do not
communicate effectively. We must keep each other
informed, and we must keep the troops informed. Every
soldier must have a notebook and pen to write down
messages and information and pass them on accurately
to ap.propriate people.
· i
The battalion operation orders for the delay and the
night attack were written and given to the company
commanders 24 hours in advance of the operation. Yet,
many people in the companies had no idea of what was
happening until just before an operation. Leaders at all
levels must realize that the potential for human communication breakdowns is great. Therefore, leaders must
use several channels of communication. They must
repeat themselves. They must constantly check to ensure
that information is flowing accurately up and down the
chain of command from battalion headquarters to the
individual soldier and from the soldier back to battalion headquarters.
1

A leader's communication skills either help or hinder
him in the use of all his other skills. Through effective

communication you cause your unit to achieve its missions.
EXPLANATION OF COMMUNICATION
Communication is the exchange or flow of information and ideas from one person to another. The process of communication involves a sender transmitting
an idea to a receiver. Effective communication occurs
only if the receiver understands the exact information
or idea that the sender intended to transmit. .
Examining the communication process is useful
because you coordinate, supervise, evaluate, teach, coach,
and counsel through this vital process. First an idea
187

Chapter 8

or information exists in the mind of the sender. He
encodes the idea or information into words or other
symbols and transmits them to the receiver. The receiver
then decodes the words or symbols into a concept or
information. If this concept or information is the same
as the idea or information in the mind of the sender,
effective communication has occurred.
If the receiver provides feedback to the sender on

his understanding of the message, that feedback is the
beginning of another communication. When healthy,
open, two-way communication exists between a receiver
and a sender, this process of sending a message and
receiving feedback goes on-back and forth-until both
parties are certain that the sender's concept or information is understood by the receiver.
Communication coordinates and controls all parts
of a unit so that they act in harmony to accomplish a
mission. When you coordinate and supervise, you help
each part of your team to reinforce the efforts of the
other parts. This can only be done through a flow of
accurate, timely information. Such information flows
from person to person to person-through the bonds of
trust, respect, confidence, and understanding that connect people in a cohesive, coordinated unit.
-

THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS

188

Chapter 8

If the unit is to function effectively, the information
must flow quickly, must be accurate, and must get to
all' parts of the unit-just as all parts of the body need
a continuous flow of blood. If the flow up, down, and
laterally is not continuous, accurate, and timely, the
unit cannot be coordinated. It will lurch along awkwardly. Union of the various parts of a unit results
only through a union of information and action.
Communication has been described as "the chain of
understanding that integrates the members of an organization from top to bottom, bottom to top, and laterally.... [It] imparts, tells, makes known, transmits, and
expresses meaning by written, oral, or visual methods." 1

PROCESS OF PERSON-TO-PERSON
COMMUNICATION
The communication process is complex. Let us say
that you are a platoon leader who wants to communicate an order to a squad leader. You are the sender,
your squad leader is the receiver. Your exchange of
information has three important parts:

• Message-the concept, idea, information, or feelings in
your mind.
• Content-the actual words or symbols.
• Context-the way you deliver the message: your tone of
voice, the look in your eye, your state of emotion (anger,
fear, uncertainty, or coolness and confidence).
The first two parts of the message are understood
by most people, but the context is often not fully
appreciated. As one communication expert explains: "It
[communication] includes what is not said; it also
includes shades of meaning and emphasis; and it even
includes ambiguities into which men can read whatever
fits their preconceptions best. This subtler form of
communication between the leader and the led is all
the more persuasive because it is largely unconscious
1 Leon C. Megginson, Personnel, p 595.

466-680 0 - 85 - 7 : QL 3

189

and therefore neither edited nor analyzed by either
party. In effect, the leader is likely to communicate a
great deal more than he intends."2 All three parts of
the communication contribute to what the receiver
hears.
Many leaders think they have communicated once
they tell a subordinate to do something. How many
times have you heard-"Well, I told Jones to do that."
If you check with Jones, you find that he totally misunderstood the message. A person cannot be confident
that he has communicated with another person until
he has feedback that tells him the receiver understands
the meaning of the message, its level of importance,
and what he should do with it. Remember: Communication is an exchange, like buying and selling. Both
parties must participate to complete the information
exchange.
As a leader you will communicate a great deal to
seniors, subordinates, and peers. Without skillful communication, it is likely that the receiver will misunderstand the message. You must develop your skill to communicate the meaning, content, and tone of your message clearly and persuasively.
BARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION
Anything that prevents understanding of the exact
concept or information intended by the sender is a
"barrier" to communication. Many physical and psychological barriers to communication exist. You must
understand them and overcome them.
Physical barriers in a situation may surround and
block communication. The noise of battle, distance, and
any other physical factors that distract the attention
of the sender or receiver are physical barriers to communication. Voice command cannot be used in many
combat situations because of noise.
Voice communication was nearly impossible at Little
Round Top when the 20th Maine (see chapter 1) had
to bend back and to the left to form a new defensive
2&ul W. Gellennan, Motivation and Productivity, p 224.

190

Chapter 8

line. Somehow, however, there was an effective personto-person flow of information, and the unit moved in
harmony. Other barriers are hard-to-read messages,
incorrect use of words or abbreviations, failure to
pronounce words correctly, and verbal or written messages that are unclear or too long.
You must identify all existing or possible physical
barriers and ensure that they do not distort or block
your communication. This can be done with foresight,
conscientious application of the problem-solving process,
and hard work.
Psychological barriers to communication are more
difficult to identify and overcome than physical barriers. You must apply your knowledge of values, character, and human nature to identifying and overcoming
psychological barriers to communication.
A person's beliefs, values, character, needs, experience, education, and goals combine to form a frame
of reference. This frame of reference acts as a filter
through which he sees and hears. Since we all have
unique combinations of these factors, our filters cause
us to see and hear the same situation differently. With
this awareness of each person's unique frame of reference, let us discuss several factors that may cause a
breakdown or distortion in communication:
• Differences in rank or echelon. Differences in rank
or echelon can block effective communication between
people. Because of conflicting interests or values, even
a husband and wife or two brothers can see the same
situation differently. They can hear the same words but
interpret their meaning differently.
If the frames of reference of husbands and wives or
two brothers can differ so greatly, think of the potential for difference in the way captains and privates
hear an announcement or see a situation. For example: A nervous private on an outpost may hear a few
rounds of rifle fire and report that he is under "heavy
fire." The company commander hearing the report
would think the outpost is being fired on by an enemy
platoon or company. But if the captain knew that only
191

Chapter 8

a few rounds had been fired, he could more accurately
assess the situation. Even people at the same level in
a unit do not see and hear things the same way. This
difference in the way people see and hear things tends
to increase as the rank difference between them increases.
Also, a sergeant or officer on the front line of battle
may see a situation far differently than a sergeant or
officer of the same rank at a higher headquarters. The
further apart they are, the greater the chance for two
people to see and hear things differently.
To ensure that differences in rank and echelon are
not barriers to communication, leaders have an obligation to communicate clearly their frames of reference
to subordinates. A person's frame of reference governs
the way he thinks, plans, and acts. Subordinates need
to know the values, goals, and way of thinking of the
leader so that they can plan accordingly and use their
initiative when out of contact with the leader. This
knowledge also helps subordinates determine what
information the leader wants and needs. Likewise,
leaders must also learn the frames of reference of their
subordinates.
• Failure to listen. Another communication problem
arises when people do not listen to one another. They
may be so concerned about their own ideas and emotions and what they want to say that they do not listen
to what the other person is saying. As an experiment,
notice how often this is true of social conversation.
Failure to listen attentively often becomes obvious and
upsetting to the other person. It tells him that the person is not really interested in him and in what he is
trying to say. Alden gave this perception to his subordinates. Randall gave the opposite perception. Randall's
willingness to listen carefully to subordinates, without
interrupting, enhanced his leadership competence. Interrupting is impolite and counterproductive. It generally
shows that the person who interrupts is more interested
in what he has to say than in listening to the other
person's ideas, information, or feelings.
192

Chapter 8

There is a useful technique that you can practice in
discussions with another person or a group. It is to
listen to the speaker andt before you respondt to explain
to the speaker the correct meaning of his message. This
ensures that you Hsten and understand before you
respond.
• Tendency to smother information. It seems to be
taken almost for granted by trainers that the impulse
to send a message or to impart useful information is
so automatic in the normally intelligent combat soldier
that it requires almost no special cultivation. Nothing
could be further from the fact! "The tendency is ever
to smother information in combatt to keep what one
knows to ·onets selft to dismiss the idea that it will
have any value to a comrade or to higher authority t to
argue that what might be gained would not justify the
effort, to conclude that the special facts must already
be known to all concernedt or if none of these thingst
then simply to fail to recognize information at its face
value.us
It is a common tendency to smother information in
war and peace. Recognize it. Train to overcome it.
Teach your people the importance of communication
and how to communicate when under stress.
• Lack of trust, respect, and confidence. When two
people do not understand each othert they lose mutual
respectt trust, and confidence. In chapter 6t we
explained how cohesion occurs through strong bonds
of trustt respect, confidence, and understanding. Trust
and respect are fundamental to candidt open communication. An individual will tend to guard himself against
another individual he mistrusts.
You trust someone when you feel that they are supportive of you-they keep their word, they care about
yout understand you, and. want to help you. It takes
time t<>--build trust. People do not trust each other until
they have had time to get to know each other's motives,
valuest character, knowledge, and skills. Building trust
Ss. L A. Manhall, Men Agairot1t Fire, p l:W.

193

Chapter 8

between people is a slow and delicate process. If the
bond of trust is injured, the wound must be quickly
identified and treated by both people. The cure is for
both people to communicate openly about the cause and
cure of the injury. If this is not done, the bond of trust
may become irreparably severed.
You gain the trust of your subordinates by demonstrating the leadership attributes explained in this
manual. If you are competent, and if you show your
subordinates that you sincerely care about them and
their frames of reference, they will trust you. You lose
trust when your subordinates perceive that you are selfish and not truly concerned with the mission, with the
unit, and with their well-being as individuals.
Little things may cause you to gain or lose trust
and respect. Recall the great impact on trust and
respect when Captain Randall helped Specialist Kellett
reenlist as a mechanic. If a soldier comes to you with
a personal problem and you act unconcerned, his trust
in you will be damaged, if not destroyed. Any time a
gap exists between what you say and what you do, or
if you break your word in any way, trust is a casualty. If you issue impossible orders-"! don't care how
you do it, Corporal, but get me five gallons of paint"trust deteriorates. If you show overconcem with how
statistical indicators affect your image, trust diminishes.

Any type of selfish, nonsupportive behavior damages
the respect your soldiers give to you.
The loss of understanding, trust, respect, and confidence between leaders and subordinates and among
troops is a cancer that will destroy a unit if it is not
checked and cured. This is precisely what happened in
Alden's company. You must find and cure the causes
of distrust in a unit by using the problem-solving process. Also, appendix D provides an overall thought process that will assist you in analyzing leadership situations, identifying problems, determining what to do,
and determining what leadership style to use. If you
increase candid communication in your · unit, you can
194

Chapter 8

clear up the misunderstandings that frequently occur.
(Appendix C explains some useful communication techniques for determining what another person is thinking, and why. Another way to increase communication
and resolve misunderstandings is by using the programs explained in chapter 10.)
The following guidelines will assist you in avoiding
or overcoming physical and psychological barriers to
communication:
• Sense what seniors, subordinates, and peers need to
know to do their jobs. Leaders at all levels must put
themselves in the shoes and situation of other soldiers.
They need to see the ha ttle or the training from the
eyes of their seniors, their subordinates, peers on their
flanks, and support personnel. A lieutenant who has
this ability will immediately sense the information that
the company commander must have to direct all parts
of the company. He will also be sensitive to the information squad leaders and fellow platoon leaders must
have to achieve platoon and company missions. He will
sense the information the supply, intelligence, and personnel people need.
Battalion headquarters must have accurate information on each company's situation to assist and coordinate the actions of all the companies. They should not
divert a leader's attention from mission accomplishment, however, by nagging them for information.
On the other hand, subordinate unit leaders must
provide timely, accurate information so that their higher
headquarters can coordinate the overall unit activities.
Headquarters in tum must communicate necessary information to subordinates. Information flow must be
planned for and encouraged through the ranks. Communication ensures that decisions will be made from
knowledge of the situation rather than from a void.
• Understand how stress affects communication. You
need to understand clearly the human tendencies under
stress that create communication problems. Be aware
that different people do not see the same reality when
196

Chapter 8

they look at a situation or read a message. What each
of us sees at a given moment is influenced by our psychological frames of reference-our beliefs, values, character, knowledge, past experience, goals, and fears.
People do not always see reality. They see what they
perceive to be reality. Unfortunately, people's perceptions, especially under stress, are often far from reality. Stress is pressure or tension. It is any real or perceived demand on the mind, emotions, spirit, or body.
Under stress, people tend to see the situation as worse
than it is. In battle, soldiers tend to use words like
"heavy shelling," "intense fire," or "strong resistance."
But these terms mean different things to different
people.
Soldiers at all levels need to be clear and concise in
their communication. Prepare your soldiers to deal with
stress and its effect on communication through tough,
realistic training. Familiarize them with the sights and
sounds of battle through training. Teach them how to
perform effectively both as individuals and as a team
under the hardships they will face in war. They will
learn to react in true proportion to the situation.
• Teach and demand accurate reporting. You have to
be aware of the human tendencies that distort reality.
You must cut through them and get correct information which corresponds with reality. If something is not
known to be a fact, do not report it as a fact. Report
it as whatever it is-a perception, belief, opinion, or
assumption. Teach your soldiers to report matters
exactly as they know them based on what they see
and hear. If they do not follow this principle closely,
disaster can occur.
During the Ardennes fighting in WWII, the lead
forces of the German 2d Panzer Division reported meeting "intense fire" and "strong resistance" at a bridgehead, when in fact they met 12 nervous infantry soldiers. Luckily for the 12 soldiers and the American Army,
this miscommunication caused a German Division Commander to make a serious error. 4
4Marshall, pp 67-70.

196

Chapter 8

No matter how great the pressure from a senior for
progress in a situation, it is better to say, "I don't
know," "I believe," or "I'll check and get back to you,"
than to report as "fact" something you are not certain
is a fact-just to get "higher" off your back. The leader
of the level above you must be aware of what is fact
and what is assumption if he is to make good decisions. By the same token, those below you and at your
level in the unit need to know what is fact and what
is assumption. Stress the difference between them.

• Aim at your target before you shoot your message.
You want the target of your communication to receive
and understand your message. Therefore, take a moment
to aim at your target. Put yourself in his shoes, frame
of reference, and situation. Then you can better form
the content and tone of the message so that it hits the
target.
People tend to make the mistake of communicating
from their own situations and frameworks, rather than
to the framework of the target person. Before communicating, take a moment to think. How would you interpret the message and how would it make you feel? This
is an important, often neglected step to good communication. Ask someone else to put himself in the situation of the target person. See how he understands and
feels about the message.
When circumstances permit, write out a message to
prevent a change in its content or meaning. Writing
forces you to complete your thoughts and to express
them accurately. And you know that all receivers on
the way up, down, or laterally are getting the same
content.
It helps to write out plans, orders, and messages,
even if you are going to communicate them verbally.
Writing allows you to "see" your communication. It
gives you a chance to analyze your message to ensure
that you are communicating exactly what you want the
other person to receive and understand.

197

Chapter 8

• Use several channels of communication and repeat
important communications. Since information can
easily be filtered or blocked, you must use several
channels to relay it. Repeat important communications
to ensure that they get to all parts of the unit. The
following are channels of communication:
Announcements. Announcements are easy, quick,
and reach a large group at once. However, they are
not always reliable and should not be the sole channel
for communications. Some troops will not be present,
some might not listen, and some may not understand.
Also, feedback on whether or not the message is understood is limited when troops are in formation. Announcements are best for short, easy-to-understand messages.
Chain of command. The leaders in the chain of command must be a cohesive, harmonized team if the chain
is to communicate clear messages. Strong bonds of
trust, confidence, respect, and understanding among all
leaders in the unit lead to an effective command channel. The officers and NCOs in the unit make up the
leadership team which is the nervous system of a unit.
The leadership team must prevent change in the
meaning, content, and importance of messages on the
way up or down the chain or laterally. The leadership
team of a unit is made up of people. No matter how
good each person on the team is, each has his own
unique framework for seeing and hearing. Therefore,
the potential for blocking and distorting communications is always present. You must know this and continually check to ensure that accurate information is
flowing through the leadership team to the troops.
Informal groups. Chapter 4 explained the importance
of informal norms and informal groups. Informal
groups shape morale and influence values. People in
informal groups are linked by the bonds of friendship.
Their communication net operates quickly and directly.
If informal groups support the chain of command, they
can promote effective communication and control the
ill effects of rumors.
198

Chapter 8

Informal conversations or feedback sessions. Informal conversations are a good way of communicating
to your subordinates and of receiving feedback from
them on conditions affecting cohesion, discipline,
morale, and unit effectiveness. How to conduct these
sessions is explained in chapter 10.
• Communicate to key subordinate leaders at one time.
As a company commander, you may have an order to
give or a policy to announce. You want to ensure that
all subordinate leaders get the exact unfiltered order or
policy. Therefore, rather than communicating to just
your platoon leaders, gather all your subordinate leaders together so that they all get the full impact of your
communication.
• Ensure that all soldiers are completely informed on
the object (mission). The likely nature of modern war
will cause mass casualties, small groups of soldiers
isolated from friendly units, great stress from continuous
day and night operations, and confused engagements
with enemy forces. More than ever, success on the battlefield will depend on the creative thinking, problemsolving ability, and character strength of all soldiers.
We must teach our soldiers how to think and solve
problems while under stress. If they are to think creatively on the battlefield, they must have a clear concept
of the "object"; the mission must be clearly communicated to them. They must have all the accurate information that headquarters-platoon, company, battalion,
and above-can supply about the enemy and other
factors that affect the mission. This way, when communications with headquarters become temporarily cut
off, lower-level units and soldiers will be able to use
their initiative to accomplish the mission without
instruction from higher headquarters.
Chamberlain, Dodd, York, and Kelly each had a
clear concept of his mission and each used initiative
and creative thinking to achieve it. Through explicit
communication, soldi~rs must be able to visualize the
199

Chapter 8

unit goal. Keep in mind that this can happen only if
leaders at each level clearly communicate their goals
and frames of reference to subordinates.
• Conduct a personal reconnaissance. There is a principle that applies to both the inspirational and practical sides of leadership. Getting up front, conducting a
personal reconnaissance, and setting the example are
critical to analyzing the situation and to having a positive effect on the morale and motivation of soldiers.
Because of all the communication problems we've
discussed, getting to the front is necessary to obtain
facts and to make valid assumptions about what is not
known. It is critical to sensing the actual physical and
moral conditions of your soldiers and the advantages
and disadvantages of terrain.
S. L. A. Marshall wrote:
"The truly inspired leaders that I have seen in combat ... invariably made the most of every opportunity
to inquire into the physical characteristics of the fire
fight. That was a rule of thumb to them-to learn the
small details of how the battle was being fought from
the men who were carrying the action." Marshall added:
"In this way they not only used their visits to inspire
their men but they learned much which could be applied
to conserving the Ii ves and building the efficiency of
their forces." He went on to say: "The processes of the
battlefield evolve so rapidly that no man may keep pace
with them through knowledge gained second-hand. The
know ledge of the stresses and strains upon hum an
nature, which is as vital to an appreciation as the counting of man strength and weapon strength, comes only
of experience acquired firsthand." Marshall wrote: "The
front is to be seen and its conditions are to be understood only through the eyes of the men who fight
there .... The values which derive from inspection and
personal reconnaissance are in direct ratio to the diffi5
culties of the situation."
5Marshall, pp 103-105.

200

Chapter 8

For effective communication in a unit, there is no
substitute for face-to-face communications and personal
reconnaissance.
In the invasion of Normandy, Brigadier General
Roosevelt, President Theodore Roosevelt's son, was an
assistant division commander of the 4th Infantry Division. He went ashore at Normandy Beach with the first
wave of invading forces. His purpose was not to command the companies or oversupervise, but to inspire
and gain firsthand information. He personally reconnoitered the German positions. When a crisis developed,
he was there to analyze it, to direct units, and to set
an inspirational example. His personal reconnaissance,
his overall direction to units, and his inspiring example contributed greatly to the success of that historic
invasion. For these actions he was awarded the Medal
of Honor.6 If he had been leading from a safe distance
to the rear, he would not have known the situation and
the 4th Division's attack might not have been successful.
The principle of "personal reconnaissance and honest, candid, face-to-face communications with soldiers
at the lowest levels" is fundamental to being a good
leader at any level It applies in garrison, in training,
and in the field. Any leader who violates the principle
risks being misinformed about matters critical to unit
success. Face to face communication helps to eliminate
barriers to communication.

• Ensure that accurate information flows laterally as
well as up and down. In Men Against Fire, S. L. A.
Marshall describes how leaders have a disastrous
tendency to regard flanking units as props rather than
as equal, mutually supporting units striving for a common goal
They expect "higher" to keep them informed about
their flanks, but in the heat of battle "higher" rarely
knows. Unit leaders must actively seek out flanking
6Bruce Jacot.., Htroe• of tht Army, pp 134-1116.

201

Chapter 8

units on their own initiative and share information on
strength and intentions. Marshall asserts that leaders
should ask themselves:
"Have I established full communications [with flank
units]? Do I know the strength, [or location], and intentions? ... Not one officer in two score is inclined to
make this a rule of action; it is the rare man who
applies it even on occasion. . . . Failure to grasp this
simple and basic idea of communications is the most
common cause of breaking contact on the field of battle and is the general reason why the union of tactical
forces is so frequently deprived of any positive
result .... Juncture of forces calls for a juncture of
thinking and of information if success is to be had at
the lowest cost. " 7 You should always send someone to
get information from units on your flanks.
S. L. A. Marshall gives the example of a company
that gave up a bridgehead to a German force in WWII
because it did not know that the other two companies
of its battalion were on its flanks within supporting
distance. Had the leaders known the strength, mission,
and location of the two companies, morale would have
been strengthened. This union of force of the three
companies could have held the bridgehead.8 Information
can build flagging morale. A union of information and
thinking causes a union of force.
Communication skills are fundamental to your ability
to apply your other implementing skills-coordination,
supervision, and evaluation. To illustrate these skills,
we will use the example from chapter 7 of the platoon
leader planning the night attack training.

COORDINATION
Coordination is defined as "to bring into a common
action, movement, or condition; to regulate and combine
in harmonious action." All players must be harmonizedsinging from the same sheet of music.
7s. L. A. Marshall, Men Against Fire, pp 86-87.
8Marshall, pp 87-88.

202

Chapter 8

Recall from chapter 7 that the night attack plan
includes a detailed organization of all tasks that must
be done, who will do them, and when, where, how, and
why. The plan includes to-do lists covering all areas.
All tasks have been put in priority. For the sake of
efficiency, these tasks are divided between the platoon
leader, platoon sergeant, squad leaders, and other key
people.
It took you a week to complete the plan. You now
have about 43 days before the training will take place.
Of course, you will continually improve the plan, but
basically you will spend the remaining 43 days using
your implementing skills.
Coordinate your plan with all parties to avoid conflict with their plans. You have coordinated with your
commander for permission, but now you must give him
the written plan and gain his approval on all aspects
of your plan. It may be that parts of it interfere with
his plans, or he may have some valuable suggestions.
Coordinate with the various staff sections. Either you
or the company commander needs to inform the S3 of
your plan and of the support you will need. Training
aids (such as OPFOR weapons and uniforms) need. to
be coordinated with the S3. You may also need to
request artillery, helicopters, engineers, or other support.
The S3, assistant S3, and the operations NCOs may

have suggestions and advice to help ensure quality
training.
Coordinate the plan with the S2 or the intelligence
sergeant. Get their ideas on how to conduct the training. Perhaps they have some suggestions to integrate
intelligence training. Your plan includes the capture
and interrogation of prisoners. Coordination is required
to have the S2 or the intelligence sergeant present to
observe and critique the way your platoon handles all
aspects of intelligence.
Coordinate also with the S4, supply NCO, and the
motor officer or the motor sergeant. They must know
your overall plan and the support and supplies you are
203

Chapter 8

requesting. Every detail of supplies, transportation, and
ammunition must be coordinated and double-checked.
The people supporting you must understand exactly
what you want, where you want it, and -when you want
it. You must be sure that they are willing and able to
provide this support.
You also need to coordinate with the other platoon
leaders. Perhaps your training coincides with their training, and you can assist each other. Perhaps another
platoon needs training in conducting a night defense,
and they would like to be the OPFOR. Consider all
possibilities.
Face-to-face coordination on these matters by you or
your representative is useful. If you send a written form
to the 84 asking for supplies and transportation, he
may not understand what you are requesting, or the
form may be lost. On the other hand, if you hand-carry
the requests and personally coordinate with the 84,
motor officer, and ammunition sergeant, or their representatives, there is a much smaller chance for error.
Your manner as you carry out this coordination is
critical. Everyone else is busy with their plans and problems. You cannot expect them to stop everything and
react to your every wish. Although the staff and support sections are there to support your training, you
get more bees with honey than with vinegar. You will
get much better support if you have a "requesting"

attitude rather than a "demanding" attitude. Your
approach to the staff officers or sergeants should be
along these lines: "Good morning, I am planning a
night attack on this date. Here is a copy of the basic
plan. Please take a little time, look it over for me, and
give me any suggestions you may have, especially in
those areas relevant to your staff section. Also, I have
prepared these requests for support, and I want to check
with you to ensure that they are reasonable and that
you can provide this support."
If you take this approach, you will be informing the
staff officer or NCO of the plan and your requests.
Since you asked for advice and suggestions, you will

204

Chapter 8

make them feel involved in the plan. People are more
interested in seeing a plan succeed if they have been
involved in its development. This open approach will
also bring up any problem areas or disagreements that
need to be resolved. If you feel that a particular staff
officer or NCO is not supporting you properly, explain
the situation to your commander. It is then the commander's job to straighten out the problem with the
83, the battalion XO, or the battalion commander.
Remember that this example is not designed to
explain every detail that must be coordinated. Its pur-__
pose is to illustrate how you should think and the kinds
of things you must do to coordinate a plan. Your unit
should also have clear, comprehensive SOPs to help you
coordinate all important details. If your unit does not
have them, take swift action to develop them. They are
essential to unit effectiveness.
The example on preparing for the night attack mission illustrates how to plan and coordinate training.
The principles and processes are also applicable to
planning and coordinating missions in combat support
and combat service support units.

SUPERVISION AND EVALUATION
Supervision is defined as keeping a grasp on the
situation and ensuring that plans and policies are
implemented properly. Supervision includes giving
instructions and inspecting continuously "at firsthand"
the accomplishment of a task.
There is a narrow band of adequate supervision. On
one side of the band lies oversupervision; on the other
side lies undersupervision.
Oversupervision stifles initiative, breeds resentment,
and lowers morale and motivation. Inadequate supervision, however, can lead to miscommunications, lack of
coordination between subordinate units, disorganization,
and the perception by subordinates that the leader does
not care. This perception can lead to resentment, low
morale, and poor motivation.
206

Chapter 8

All soldiers benefit from appropriate supervision by
seniors with more knowledge and experience who tend
to see the situation more objectively.
Evaluating is a part of supervising. Evaluation is
defined as judging the worth, quality, or significance
of people, ideas, or things. It includes looking at the
way people are accomplishing a task. It also includes
all types of "firsthand" checking and inspecting. It
means getting feedback on how well something is being
done and interpreting that feedback. Does the feedback
indicate the plan will succeed? Does it indicate the need
for a modification or a major change in plans or policies?
You need to have a routine system for checking and
double-checking the things that are important to cohesion, discipline, morale, unit effectiveness, and mission
accomplishment. The programs in chapter 10 will help
you develop such a system. Checking is such a simple
word and concept. It is obvious that leaders must check,
but human nature can cause us to fail to check the
most simple things that can lead to big disasters. You
will hear some people say-"Worry about the little
things and the big things will take care of themselves."
You will hear others say-"Worry about the big, important things and don't sweat the small stuff." Don't go
by either because they are poor guides. First, be concerned about the big things; that is where you exercise
your thinking or directional skills. Next, check the little
things that make the major things happen.
In your plan you created a to-do list for each category of the plan. Add to that list each day as you
coordinate and think of new things to do. Split up the
to-do tasks between yourself, your platoon sergeant, and
your squad leaders. Assign clear responsibilities for
each task. Then systematically check yourself and your
subordinates so that everything is done correctly.
When delegating to subordinates, give them a list
of tasks, in priority, and tell them when you want the
tasks done. If possible, use a carbon copy. At the end
of each day, get together with your subordinates and

206

Chapter 8

have each one brief you on the accomplished tasks,
problems encountered, and what remains to be done.
This is a simple technique, but important. It allows you
to stay informed of progress and problems, to control
events, and to develop your subordinates.

USE CHECKLISTS
You will find that all of us have poor memories
when it comes to remembering a list of details. We all
need checklists. The more there is to do, the more stress
there is, and the less time there is available, the more
we need checklists. Every soldier should have a notebook and pen. Every subordinate leader should have a
list of tasks that need to be accomplished that day.
You and your subordinates should also develop the
habit of making up your own checklist of things you
want to do that day. The A priorities must be done
today; B priorities should be done tomorrow; C priorities can wait a few days. Do your boss's A priorities
first, then do your A priorities. (If you disagree with
the priorities your senior gives you, have the moral
courage to discuss your concerns with him.) Then move
on to the Bs, then to the Cs if you can get to them
that day. Each morning or evening develop your list,
and add to it as the day goes on. Check it several
times during the day. When someone-your boss, a peer,
a staff officer, or sergeant-tells you something that
you must do or check on, do not rely on your memory.
Write it down on a checklist, and give it a priority.
Then delegate it and check on it, or do it yourself. This
is the only way to ensure that things will get done
and that your training or your mission is "implemented" as planned. Good checklists are a crucial
implementing technique.

USE A SYSTEM OF DOUBLE CHECKS
It is now 14 days before your night attack. You
and your platoon sergeant completely coordinated the
plan with the staff sections 2 weeks ago. All requests
were approved. Support and supplies were assured. At
this point many young leaders assume that they have

207

Chapter 8

done their job and that the training will take place as
planned. They neglect to go far enough, to take the
final steps, to follow through.
Do not ever allow yourself or your subordinates to
think this way. You have to use all available time to
check and double-check details necessary for the success
of your training. The principle to keep in mind is:
"Follow through on your coordination, supervision, and
evaluation.''
It was about 25 days ago that you coordinated your
supplies, ammunition, trainings aids, OPFOR uniforms
and weapons, and other items. You have been systematically checking and supervising all tasks that were
delegated and all support tasks, but you now need to
double-check everything. Have your squad leaders accomplished all necessary tasks, individual training, and
collective training?
Strange things can happen to ruin your training if
you are not immediately aware of them. The 84 and
motor officer may have new missions; they may have
lost your paperwork. They may have forgotten to tell
you that they can give you only one truck instead of
two to transport your platoon. This could throw your
time schedule off. People are human; they forget. Recognize that in yourself and others, and guard against
it. If you have a system of checks and double checks,
you will discover mistakes, have time to take corrective action, and minimize the disruption to training.

USE INFORMAL AND FORMAL INSPECTIONS
As a leader you need your own system of informal
and formal inspections. This will serve as an important
source of knowledge of your unit's combat readiness.
Good supervision and evaluation require you to be a
skilled inspector with a critical observant eye for detecting those details and things that can help or hinder
mission accomplishment.
208

When you observe one of your squad leaders conducting individual training, you are conducting an informal
inspection. You are evaluating the squad leader's
pre para ti on, his manner of teaching and coaching~
whether or not the soldier learns the task being trained,
and whether or not the training is properly recorded
in the soldier's job book.
Whenever you are with your soldiers and equipment,
you have a responsibility to inspect informally and take
appropriate action-praise what is right, correct what
is wrong, and coach on how to do it right. You should
inspect and evaluate in a way that contributes to a
positive learning environment. Be critical, but make
sure that they know you are on their side, trying your
best to help them improve.
Train yourself and your subordinates to be systematic
and thorough during your daily informal inspections.
Look for anything out of place, anything that is not
right, and anything that might hinder mission accomplishment or morale. Your eyes and mind must be open
and alert for small, but important, details that are
symptoms of present or future problems. Examples of
informal inspections are described below.
You are a platoon leader. On the way to the mess
hall, you decide to stroll through the barracks. You see
a broken window. How long has it been broken? Is a
work order in? Who broke it? You make a note to ask
your platoon sergeant these questions. You note the
latrine sinks are dirty. The SOP calls for the latrine to
be cleaned each day. Why isn't the SOP being followed?
One of your leaders is not doing his job.
While at the mess hall you eat with five of the
troops in your platoon. You have a helpful conversation with them about the last field training cycle and
their perception of training strengths and weaknesses.
While talking, you note that one of your soldiers at
another table is wearing worn-out boots that will not

209

Chapter B ~-----------------------------------------------------------------------~

protect her feet. The soldier next to her is wearing a
camouflaged T-shirt. Another soldier has holes in his
fatigue pants. You make a mental note to have your
platoon sergeant counsel the squad leaders of these
troops. The squad leaders should have already seen and
corrected these pro bl ems.
After leaving the mess hall you write these points
down in your notebook. On your way to the training
site, you walk through your platoon's area in the motor
pool. You see a broken headlight, a missing mirror, a
flat tire, and trash in many of the vehicles. Why? Motor
stables were supposed to be performed this morning
while you and the other officers were on a tactical
exercise without troops. Make a note to check on these
points.
At your 1700 meeting with your platoon sergeant
and squad leaders, you explain what you found and
ask the appropriate questions. Your informal inspecting
found an array of deficiencies in your unit. Now you
and your subordinates go to work with the problemsolving process to correct them. You may have to
counsel or coach your platoon sergeant. He should have

GOOD LEADERS

WRONG AND
TAKE APPROPRIATE
CORRECTIVE
ACTION

210

Chapter 8

noted and taken action on the deficiencies you found.
You and your platoon sergeant also have some teaching, coaching, and counseling to do in order to develop
the competence of your squad leaders.
Much of your success as a leader depends on your
ability to inspect systematically as you execute your
day-to-day tasks. Much of what you do to create a good
unit involves repetitively paying close attention to routine,
seemingly minor, details. Little details, as well as big
ones, are important to morale and mission achievement.
To be a good inspect.or, you must develop an investigative attitude, as well as an observant eye for detail.
For example:
You are a platoon sergeant informally inspecting the
conduct of motor stables. You note that a side-view
mirror is missing on a vehicle. You ask the driver about
it. She says she found it missing 2 weeks ago. She
thinks it was stolen. She told the motor sergeant
about it right away and the motor sergeant said he
would order it. You ask if she told her squad leader
about it? No. Why? The squad leader told her to handle
that kind of thing directly with the motor sergeant.
Make a note to counsel the squad leader.
You check to see if the parts clerk ordered the mirror.
It was never ordered. Why? What is the problem in
communicating the need for a part? Where did the
system break down? What action did the motor sergeant
take when the driver told him about the mirror? Is
there a problem with parts being stolen from vehicles?
You keep investigating until you find the causes of the
problems.
If you and your subordinate leaders are systematic,
observant, and skilled informal inspectors on a daily
basis, the need for formal inspections is lessened.
Periodic formal, comprehensive inspections, however,
are necessary. Their timing and frequency depend on
the unit and the unit's mission. As a general rule you
should have a formal inspection of weapons and equipment before a training or combat mission and after a
field training exercise or a combat mission.
211

Chapter 8

One key to formal inspections is organization and
recordkeeping. As a leader you must first set standards
for excellence in all areas affecting combat readiness.
When inspecting, know what deficiencies to look for.
You must know everything that is important to your
unit's combat readiness. The Army has excellent
documents on how to inspect Army weapons and equipment. You should use these documents for preparing
and conducting inspections.
In a formal inspection your manner is somewhat
more formal than during an informal inspection. But
the purpose is the same-to look for every detail that
affects mission accomplishment. Your soldiers should
know ahead of time the standards you expect in personal appearance, uniforms, weapons, and equipment.
You inspect for those standards. Whenever they are not
met, note the deficiency and ensure that appropriate
corrective action is taken in a timely way. The following
are examples of important formal inspections:
• Field gear should be formally inspected before and
after major field training. Does the soldier have all his
necessary equipment? Is it clean and serviceable? Will
his boots protect his feet? Is the soldier preserving the
leather of his boots? If the soldier is missing equipment,
what has been done to replace it? Why is it missing?
The answers to these questions may uncover problems
that you need to address. When you show concern over
these questions, you demonstrate that you sincerely care
about your soldiers.
• Formal in-ranks inspections of greens are necessary
periodically to ensure that each soldier has a reputable,
well-fitting set of greens. You do not want to learn that
a soldier has an ill-fitting uniform just prior to a
ceremony or his leave.
• Individual and crew-served weapons must be formally
inspected periodically to ensure that your unit has a
program that provides weapons that are always ready
for combat.

212

Chapter 8

• Linens should be formally inspected periodically.
The combination of your informal and formal inspections is your overall inspection program. Your inspection program is a major way of gathering information,
identifying problems, and ensuring the combat readiness
of your unit. If you have a good systematic program
that covers all aspects of morale, discipline, training
readiness, and materiel readiness, you will always be
ready for inspector general inspections and inspections
by higher-level units. More importantly, your unit will
always be ready for combat. Combat may come today
or tomorrow, and your unit must be ready for it.
A case showing how to set standards, supervise, and
evaluate is relevant here. This case is based on an
actual incident.

Sergeant Jackson checked again on the following day
and still found most weapons to be dirty and rusty. He
decided that there were two causes for the problem.
First, the squad leaders were not doing their jobs.
Second, the squad leaders and troops were bucking himtesting his character to see who would really make the.
rules in the platoon. He could feel the resistance to his
leadership-probably because he was new and had been
the platoon se~eant in another platoon. Sergeant
Jackson knew he had a serious discipline problem that
he had to handle correctly. He called the squad leaders
together again. Once again he explained his standards
clearly. He then said, "Tomorrow we are due to go on

The next morning Sergeant Jackson inspected and
found that most weapons in each squad were still below
standard. Sergeant Jackson's patience had reached its
limit. His squad leaders and troops had to learn that

This case illustrates the committed effort necessary
to inspect your people, weapons, and equipment. It is
also an example of one approach to building discipline
when your subordinates fail to meet the standards you
have set.

SUMMARY
This chapter has focused on the implementing skills
of leadership-communicating, coordinating, supervising,
and evaluating. You can have a great plan and a
highly cohesive, disciplined unit. If communication
breaks down, however, and if the implementation of the
plan is not coordinated, supervised, and continually
evaluated, disaster can result. Little things must be
checked and double-checked.
"For want of a nail, the shoe was lost; for want of
a shoe, the horse was lost; for want of a horse, the
rider was lost; for want of a rider, the battle was lost."0
In today's terms, someone may fail to check a small
item on a tank. That failure may cause a problem and
the loss of the tank just prior to a battle. The loss of
that tank may mean the loss of a battle.
In the next war in which Americans fight, the stakes
may be very high. The loss of a battle may cause the
loss of a war and the loss of our freedom as a nation.
Keep in mind that thinking skills, implementing
skills, and motivating skills (chapter 9) are intertwined
and that you must apply them simultaneously as you
lead. Obviously, you must think when you communicate,
coordinate, supervise, and evaluate. Also, you must
understand people and apply your implementing skills
in a way that motivates. We now turn to a critical type
of leadership-leadership that motivates.

EXPLANATION
A person's motivation is a combination of his desire
and energy directed at achieving a goal. Motivation is
the cause of action. Influencing people's motivation
means getting them to want to do what you know must
be done.
A quick review of the section on human nature in
chapter 6 may be helpful to you prior to reading further. A basic knowledge of human nature is important
to understanding motivation.
217

Chapter 9

A person's motivation depends on two things: the
strength of certain needs and his perception that taking
a certain action will help satisfy those needs. When
hungry, you desire food. Satisfaction of thi;S need
depends on motivation. The degree of motivation to
reach your goal-to obtain food-is affected by how
hungry you are and by your perception of the value of
the goal. Perhaps you are slightly hungry, but you do
not like fish. Someone suggests you go out for a fish
dinner. You have a weak need (hunger) and you perceive the value of the goal (fish) as low. You are not
highly motivated, therefore, to have a fish dinner. Suppose, however, you are very hungry, you enjoy steak,
and someone says he will buy you a steak dinner. You
now have a strong need (hunger) and you perceive the
value of the goal (steak) as high. Your motivation to
get the steak will be high.
People can be motivated by beliefs, values, selfinterest, kindness, fears, needs, worthy causes, and
other forces. Some of these forces are internal to the
person-such as needs, fears, and beliefs; and some are
external-such as danger, the environment, a chance
for promotion, pressure from a senior, pressure from subordinates, or pressure from one's family. External and
internal forces combine to determine what a person is
motivated to do in a given situation.
In Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage, a
combination of internal and external forces motivates
a young soldier to run from the enemy on his first day
of battle. On the next day a different combination of
forces motivates the same soldier to great deeds of courage. In one situation his fears motivate him to flee; in
the next situation his courage motivates him to master
his fears and fight heroically.
If your soldiers have confidence in themselves, each
other, the unit, you, and the cause, they will be sincerely motivated. Training them to have the knowledge
and skills to fight and win as a cohesive, disciplined

218

Chapter 9

team will have a valuable motivating effect. People are
afraid of the unknown. Knowledge and skill combat
fear and increase confidence, which is a potent motivating force. It gives rise to morale, courage, and the
will to fight.
You must keep a broad point of view on human
nature and motivation. Do not allow yourself to hold a
narrow view like Alden's-that troops are only motivated by fear. He believed that they must fear their
leaders more than they feared the enemy. It is equally
dangerous to believe the opposite-that people are all
good, that most people will always be motivated to
work hard and to do the right thing. A complex array
of forces motivates people, and these forces cannot
always be readily seen or studied.
Although there is no simple formula for motivation,
we can provide a basic view of what motivates people.
Keep in mind that this view is a simplification for you
to use as a guide. It assumes that people are motivated
by needs. A person's motivation to reach a goal
depends on whether the person perceives that the goal
will satisfy certain needs. Realizing that different
people react to varying needs will allow you to arrive
at appropriate decisions and actions in a particular
situation.
To understand motivation you must understand how
needs drive people, individuals, or groups to action. For
ease of explanation, we will label all the internal motivating forces as needs. We discussed the different levels
of needs in chapter 6: physical, security, social, and
higher needs. We can also say that people need to act
in terms of their beliefs, values, and character traits.
For example, if a person holds a patriotic belief in the
ideals of America, he feels a need to serve those ideals.
In the Civil War the great soldiers on both sides felt
an unrelenting need to fight for their beliefs and perceived
rights. Traits of character are also motivating forces.
If physical courage and moral courage are traits of your
character, you have a need to behave courageously.
219

Chapter 9

All of these needs are powerful motivating forces.
The way they combine with each other and with external forces determines what a person is motivated to do
in a particular situation.
As a leader you have the power to influence motivation. You can awaken certain needs in your soldiers
and sometimes make them override other needs. For
example, people need security. This often acts as a
restraining force, alerting a person and holding him
back from dangerous situations. When this need dominates other needs, however, it drives people to panic,
to run, to do the selfish, cowardly thing. In another situation, however, this security need is useful in that it
motivates soldiers to be appropriately cautious, to put out
security on the flanks, to dig in, to clean weapons, and
to reach standards essential to the security of the unit.
People also have a need to do the right and brave
thing regardless of danger. In dangerous situations this
need is in direct conflict with the need for security.
Which need will overpower the other and dictate the
person's actions? What soldiers are motivated to do in
cases like this may depend completely on what the
leader does to influence the conflicting needs. Our needs
are constantly fighting with each other, colliding, pushing, and pulling us in different directions. As a leader you
can add forces that guide people in the direction you
want them to go. You can weaken or eliminate counterproductive forces such as fears or feelings of despair
and hopelessness. Chapter 6 discussed ways to do this.
The most powerful form of lasting motivation is selfmotivation. Your goal as a leader should be to create
self-motivation in your subordinates. A few of your
troops will always require an external coercive force.
Most people, however, can become self-motivated if you
teach them the leadership attributes explained in this
manual.
Nearly all self-motivated professional soldiers are
influenced to some degree by the need to seek job
security, promotion, and approval of their peers and

220

Chapter 9

bosses. This is normal. The primary influences on a
self-motivated professional soldier, however, are internal
forces-his values, ethics, and character traits that form
the principles by which he lives. A self-motivated professional is a soldier of moral principle. A moral principle
is but a word until it is tested. A professional soldier
behaves according to his principles, regardless of the
situation. The main reason he does his duty is not to
gain a reward or avoid a punishment, but simply to
have the satisfaction that he is doing the right thing.
Chamberlain, York, and Dodd were such soldiers.

PRINCIPLES
Fourteen practical principles (guidelines) flow from
this basic view of motivation. We will explain each of
these general rules and give you guidance on practical
techniques for applying them.

PRINCIPLE 1
Make the needs of individuals in your unit coincide with unit tasks and missions. Your soldiers will
have a natural desire to work to satisfy their own
needs. When you link their interests and needs with
those of your unit, you have a powerful way to motivate your subordinates. The following policies show
how you can apply this principle:
• People who do their job well and stay out of trouble
are recommended for promotion when they have proven
to their leader that they can handle the additional
responsibility.
• Those who fail an examination (a practical hands-on
test) at the conclusion of classes receive remedial training during off-duty hours.
• Those who are unable to remain in formation during
the company run need additional PT and will assemble at 0700 on Saturday for remedial PT.
• Soldiers who miss a scheduled PT period during the
week for any reason or who failed the last PT test will
assemble for PT on Saturday at 0700.

466-680 0 - 85 - 8 : QL 3

221

Chapter 9

• Soldiers must meet prescribed weight requirements
and pass the PT test to be considered for schooling
and promotion.
• No one goes to bed until the weapons are cleaned
and inspected.

PRINCIPLE 2
Reward individual and team behavior that supports unit tasks and missions. The opportunity to
win a reward is a sound motivator, though often it only
provides actual incentive to the top five or ten percent
of the group the leader is trying to motivate. As General Bruce C. Clarke points out, programs like the
Soldier of the Month motivate only the top five or ten
percent of your people who are capable of winning this
award. It does nothing for the other 90 percent of the
average, good troops who really determine the success
of your unit. 1
A piece of ribbon, a medal, a badge, a certificate, or
a letter are only small tangible objects, but they mean
a great deal to a soldier psychologically. Napoleon marveled at the motivational power of a small piece of ribbon. He once said that if he had enough ribbon, he
could conquer the world. Medals and other awards have
motivating power for a soldier because they are a way
of satisfying social and higher needs. They are tangible
evidence to the soldier that he is appreciated and
needed by his leader, his unit, and his country. Awards
symbolize a proud achievement. Once the higher needs
are awakened by rewards such as praise from the
leader and by medals or badges for courage and hard,
competent work, the motivation to keep working for
more recognition normally increases.
Examples of how you can apply this principle follow:
• Let the soldier who gets the best score on the training
simulator fire the live missile on the firing exercise.
• Obtain recommendations from every leader in the
chain on rewards, awards, and schooling.
1 Bruce C. Clarke, Guidelines for Leader and Commanders, p 92.

222

----------------------------Chapter 9

• Use the established awards system to the maximumArmy and division certificates, Army achievement and
higher Army medals, letters of commendation, driver
and mechanic badges, and safety awards.
• Create local unit certificates or awards, where appropriate, for individuals or units, such as "Hawkeye
award" for the antitank gunners who meet an established standard.
• Present awards at a retreat, parade, or some other
appropriate unit ceremony.
• Reward the desired behavior of an individual or
group promptly.
• Stand up for your good soldiers when they need help
in any way.
• Pick the sharpest soldier in the guard mount to be
the supernumerary, who walks no post unless another
soldier gets sick or hurt.
• Give a 3-day pass to everyone if the unit passes the
annual general inspection. Give a fourth day to any
individual cited as "commendable."
• Give verbal praise liberally. If a soldier is trying to
learn the right values, character, knowledge, and skills,
encourage him-even if he is still falling short. That
recognition will reinforce his efforts and motivate him
to do even better. Often words of praise like, "Thanks
for doing such a fine job, Private Smith; I've been
noticing your hard work and I sure appreciate it," have
a tremendous motivating effect. Be aware, however, that
if you give too much praise, or give it when undeserved, you cheapen its motivating value.
• Develop awards and ways of recognizing good performance that motivate the large group of average
people who make up 90 percent of your unit. There is
nothing wrong with giving verbal praise, time off, certificates, or badges of achievement to 90 percent of your
unit if they meet certain standards.
• Promote people who work hard, study hard, achieve
standards, and influence others to achieve unit standards, and who show the capability for increased
responsibility.
223

Chapter 9

• Give routine benefits upon m1ss1on accomplishment.
For example, you can make the satisfaction of certain
physical needs dependent upon the achievement of standards, such aso In the field, your soldiers clean their weapons
and prepare defensive positions before they go to sleep.
oWhen your soldiers come out of the field, they
clean and inspect all vehicles and weapons before they
go home.
• Write a short letter-just a paragraph or two-to the
families of soldiers regarding the soldiers' performance.
Parents .can strongly influence motivation .
The following is an example of this principle.
An infantry company commander in Vietnam pondered the challenge of rewarding soldierly behavior that
would lead to success against the enemy. There was
very little he could offer his soldiers by way of tangible
rewards, except for medals. He could not promise them
time off or special passes or special pay. They were at
war 7 days a week-living in mud, in the jungle, in
rice paddies, and suffering sweltering heat. They faced
the threat of death every single day. Their only time
off in a year was one 5-day R&R period and one or
two 3-day rests in a large base camp. They received
the same combat pay as soldiers in large protected base

camps with hot food, clean sheets, maids, and other
comforts. Threats could not make them do their duty.
Positive, tangible rewards could not be the main motivator to do their duty as there were so few.
Clearly, he had to rely much more on intangible,
psychological rewards to motivate his soldiers. He had
to get his men to want to do their duty for the psychological satisfaction of knowing that they were doing
the right thing, the courageous thing. The only true
reward for doing their duty was the knowledge that it
was worth doing. One of the few things the commander
could do to reward his soldiers was to give them his
personal thanks periodically.
224

---------------------------Chapter 9

Although there were few tangible rewards he could
offer his infantrymen, this commander did have a liberal policy of recommending medals for bravery in
action. This policy had a great motivational effect. This
company commander believed that it took courage, hard
work, and skill to be on the front line, to face the
enemy when bullets were flying, to use weapons effectively, to communicate, to fight as an individual and a
team, and to win. He rewarded people for special contributions they made to the unit, in and out of battle.
This awards policy was a powerful motivator in this unit.
It showed the soldiers that their courage and skill were
sincerely recognized and appreciated by their leaders.

A WELL-DESERVED
MEDAL MEANS
A GREAT DEAL
TO A SOLDIER
PSYCHOLOGICALLY

This example illustrates that the greatest reward to
a true professional soldier is the inner knowledge that
he is serving his unit and country to the best of his
ability. His peace of mind and sense of service and
accomplishment are his reward.

225

Chapter 9

Recall Rifleman Dodd in chapter 5. Dodd was cold
and hungry; his clothes were ragged and verminous.
He was planning a mission he knew might cause his
death. But he was doing his duty as his officers and
sergeants had taught him. The only reward he had was
the knowledge that he was doing his absolute best as
his officers and sergeants would want him to. That was
enough for him. That is the true reward of a professional soldier.

PRINCIPLE 3
Counsel or punish soldiers who behave in a
way that is counter to unit tasks, missions, and
standards. The previous principles were the "carrot"
or reward approach. This is the opposite, the "stick."
This principle is usually necessary only to motivate the
soldiers who do not respond to positive motivation.
Before resorting to "the stick," you should be certain
that the task, mission, or standard was clearly communicated prior to the infraction. Examples of how you can
apply this principle follow:
• Ensure that every leader in the chain of command is
involved in the process of judicial or nonjudicial disciplinary action. Each leader provides his recommendation for leniency or severity of punishment. This shows
the troops that the squad leader, platoon sergeant, and
platoon leader do have the power of the ''stick." The
leader at the appropriate level to take action considers
the judgment and recommendations of his subordinate
leaders who know the soldier well. This also gi;.es the
commander another practical way of involving subordinates in the problem-solving process and of developing
their leadership ability. Each case requiring counseling
or disciplinary action provides an opportunity to teach
subordinate leaders how to counsel, to teach discipline,
or to take disciplinary action.
• Conduct· reprimands, counseling, and corrective action
as privately and as quickly as possible after an offense.
Do not humiliate or embarrass a soldier in front of
others. The only people present during a reprimand .or
226

---------------------------Chapter 9

counseling session should be the individual, you, and
any intermediate leaders in the soldier's chain who are
subordinate to you.
• Recommend to your commander suspension of some,,
part of a soldier's Article 15 punishment, if you deem
it fair, to encourage him to get back quickly to doing
his duty well.

PRINCIPLE 4
Set the example in all things. If you show your
subordinates how to act, you are teaching them at the
same time. If you follow regulations and SOPs, you
show your subordinates that you expect regulations and
policies to be followed. You also prove your own degree
of self-discipline. Examples of how you should apply
this princi pie follow:
• Apply camouflage thoroughly, wear your helmet at
all times in the field, and lead the way through the
obstacle course.
• Get adequate rest. You must remember that you cannot do everything. Your people look to you for clear
thinking and creative, practical problem solving, planning, and decision making. As the leader you are the
brain of the unit. You will set the direction; you will
navigate the ship in the storm. You must have enough
sleep to think clearly and to make the right decisions
under stress.
Your people also require adequate sleep. Therefore,
ensure that you set the example in getting enough rest.
Recall the two companies on the ridge in Korea (chapter
6); the one without sleep was routed, but the troops in
the company with 30 minutes of rest fought like tigers.
• Set the example in physical fitness. It is a fact that
physically fit people are mentally, physically, and emotionally stronger than people who are not. Physically
fit people are better able to withstand stress in peace
or war. They are better able to think clearly. Setting
the example in physical fitness includes leading a conditioning program for your unit, following a healthy
diet, using alcohol or tobacco in moderation, or
abstaining from their use.
227

Chapter 9

• Position yourself so you can best control and help
your unit. You should be where you can move swiftly
to the crisis, the "point of action." When the bullets
are flying, "follow me" is often the only motivation
that works.
A word of caution is in order here. No man or
woman is superhuman, and your soldiers do not expect
that. While they want you to set the example in all
things and to share danger and hardships with them,
they do not want you to take unnecessary risks with
your life or their lives. If they see you taking unnecessary risks with your life, they may lose confidence in
your judgment.
Also, the unnecessary loss of a good leader has a
terrible effect on the morale, cohesion, and effectiveness
of a unit. Heroism is the necessary display of physical
or moral courage to do your duty for your unit, the
Army, and the country. But it does not mean stupidly
exposing yourself to enemy fire.
Chamberlain, York, Dodd, and Kelly were all heroes,
but the evidence indicates that the furthest thing from
their minds at the time of their heroic deeds was demonstrating their heroism. What was on their mind was
how best to defeat the enemy through superior skills.
Their motivation was to do their duty and to accomplish their missions. They had the character, knowledge,
and skills to succeed in their missions against great
odds. That is the kind of heroism we need in modern
battle, not careless exposure of self and others to
danger just to be recognized as a brave, fearless hero.

PRINCIPLE 5
Develop morale and esprit in your unit. Morale
is defined as the mental, emotional, and spiritual state
of an individual. It is how he feels-happy, hopeful,
confident, appreciated, worthless, sad, unrecognized, or
depressed. Morale has a tremendous impact on motivation. High morale strengthens courage, energy and
the will to fight.
228

Chapter 9

Everything you do as a leader affects morale in one
way or another. You must always be aware of how your
actions and decisions affect it. Try to give your people
something to hope for, because hope builds morale.
Napoleon said, "Morale is to the material as four is to
one" -meaning that morale is four times more important than weapons and equipment in determining the
outcome of battles.
Esprit means team spirit. It is a product of cohesion.
Esprit is defined as the spirit, the soul, the state of
mind of the unit. It is the overall consciousness of the
unit that the soldier identifies with and feels a part of.
It is a great motivator.
Examples of how you can build morale and esprit
in your unit follow:
• Show your soldiers that your unit really cares about
them through a welcome and orientation program. All
newcomers should be linked up with a good soldier to
show them around. They should meet with the command sergeant major who tells them about unit history,
distinctive unit insignia, and battle streamers. They
should meet with the battalion commander who tells
them about the mission of the unit.
A new soldier should be welcomed and interviewed
by each leader in his chain of command-from the fire
team leader through the company commander-during
his first 24 hours in the unit. During these interviews,
the leaders should explain what the unit has done in
the past few months; what it will be doing; and unit
standards, policies, and norms.
• Plan a retreat parade to be held at the conclusion of
the after-operation maintenance as a part of major
exercises or deployments. Plan well ahead and have the
division band there to play for the ceremony. Present
individual and unit awards at the ceremony.
• Have a farewell program that shows your departing
soldiers how deeply you and other unit members appreciate their dedicated service. Ensure that they receive
any medals or deserved recognition before they leave.
229

Chapter 9 ~----------------------------------------------------~

GOOD LEADERS
GIVE AWARDS IN
A MANNER THAT
INCREASES MORALE,
ESPRIT, AND
MOTIVATION

Have an appropriate farewell ceremony for departing
soldiers. Conduct the ceremony in a way that shows
your sincere appreciation to the departing soldiers and
reinforces desired unit values and standards.

PRINCIPLE 6

Give your subordinates tough problems, and
challenge them to wrestle with them. Coach them
on their problem solving, decision making, planning,
and implementation. Mission-type orders encourage the
development of junior leaders.
A company commander in Vietnam practiced this
principle in the following way. One day he called in a
new platoon leader and informed him that intelligence
sources indicated a squad of four or five Vietcong
spending the night in a particular village. He pointed
to the village on the map. "I need you and your platoon
to capture or kill those Vietcong by 0700 tomorrow,
280

Chapter 9

before they leave the village, without hurting innocent
civilians in the village. You are new so you do not
know the terrain well, but your platoon sergeant, squad
leaders, and some of your troops know it well. Get their
advice. I want you and your subordinate leaders to come
up with a plan to accomplish the mission. Come back
in 2 hours and brief me on your plan."
The company commander could have given the platoon leader a plan, but that would not have developed
the thinking of the platoon leader. Moreover, the plan
would have lacked valuable ideas from the platoon sergeant, squad leaders, and troops. People are motivated
to carry out a plan if they are part of the planning
process.
The platoon leader consulted his platoon sergeant,
squad leaders, and several experienced troops, and they
developed a plan. The platoon leader then presented the
plan to the company commander. This is a good process, when time is available, for several reasons:
• It teaches the junior leaders.
• It motivates the people who must carry out the plan
because they had a part in creating it, and it produces
better understanding of the plan among those who must
implement it.
• Communication is clearer; therefore, everyone has a
better understanding of the mission and what they
must do as individuals and as a team to achieve it. A
clear vision of the goal and the path to the goal
enchances motivation and allows subordinates to use
initiative if communications break down or the plan
deteriorates.
• It allows the company commander to coach and
develop the thinking skills of the platoon leader.
• The platoon leader may come up with a better plan
than the company commander.
• It creates an open, trusting communication bond
between the members of the chain of command-the
leadership team. A thinking, cohesive leadership team
develops a cohesive, disciplined, effective unit.
231

Chapter 9

• It obtains the best of the minds of the captain, lieutenant, sergeants, and troops and applies that thinking
to unit goals.
• The captain can still alter the lieutenant's plan if
necessary.
• The captain may learn some new ideas or methods
from this process.
This example also illustrates the value of the next
principle.

PRINCIPLE 7
Have your subordinates participate in the planning of upcoming events. Participating in the planning of future events can be a highly motivating experience. It improves communication, which in turn
improves cohesion. Improved communication also gives
everyone a clearer picture of the objective, so that they
can use their initiative to achieve it. Clear understanding of the mission and the plan combats illfounded rumors and fears that are based on lack of
knowledge.
By involving your subordinates in planning, you
show that you recognize their ability and appreciate
them. Recognition and appreciation from a respected
leader are powerful motivating forces. Your subordinates
contribute ideas to the plan, which gives them a personal interest in seeing the plan succeed.
The example of the company commander in Vietnam
involving his platoon leader, his platoon sergeant,
squad leaders, and a few troops in developing a plan
shows one way you can apply this principle. The platoon leader planning the night attack in chapter 7 is
another example.

PRINCIPLE 8
Alleviate causes of the personal concerns of
your soldiers so that soldiers can concentrate on
their jobs. In chapter 8 we explained that every individual has a unique combination of experience, values,
character traits, knowledge, and skills which causes him
to have a unique frame of reference for dealing with

232

Chapter 9

life. Things that seem of no importance to you might
seem critical to some of your soldiers. Some of them
will have family, financial, or legal problems. You must
empathize with them before you can help them. You
may have some potentially good soldiers who have
never had a parent figure to teach them how to live.
They have not been taught how to handle money and
legal matters, how to have meaningful relationships
with the opposite sex, how to stay out of trouble, how
to balance the demands of work with the needs of one's
family, and how to grow professionally and personally.
You need to help your soldiers as much as you can
with their personal and family affairs. If they are
having real or perceived personal problems, the problems will worry them, consume their energy, and prevent them from being effective soldiers. Teach your
soldiers how to handle their personal and professional
lives in a healthy, constructive way. The following
examples show how you can apply this principle:
• Start with your program for welcoming new soldiers
into your unit.
• Assist your soldiers with legal, personal, or financial
advice to help them work through their problems. Keep
books regarding these subjects available for your reference and theirs. Have a comprehensive program for
informing and helping the spouses of your soldiers.
A void making personal decisions for your soldiers, but

help them determine facts and wise alternatives.
• Encourage informal conversations between leaders
and troops. You may have people in your unit with
untapped expertise to shed light on a problem area.
• Counsel your soldiers as best you can when they have
personal problems, such as financial, legal, or family
problems. But never hesitate to refer them to a chaplain, a lawyer, or some other appropriate professional
for help. Never hesitate to call or see professionals yourself to determine how they can help your soldiers. Chaplains can be of great assistance in helping you carry
out this principle.

233

Chapter 9

• Provide assistance to family members when soldiers
are on an exercise or on temporary duty. Notify them
in advance, in writing, on who to call for emergency
assistance. Ensure that soldiers keep their preparations
for deployment up-to-date to minimize any difficulties
for their families.

PRINCIPLE 9
Ensure your soldiers are properly cared for and
have the tools they need to succeed. Caring for your
soldiers means doing all you can to try to help them
meet their physical, security, social, and higher needs.
Some leaders get the idea that caring for their soldiers
only means ensuring that they have adequate food,
clothing, rest, shelter, and necessary weapons and equipment to do their jobs. Providing for these physical
needs is critically important, but caring for your subordinates goes much further.
If you truly care about your soldiers, you are deeply
concerned about all aspects of their lives-in much the
same way a parent cares about his children. If you
care about your soldiers, you want to prepare them for
battle and for life in every way you can. You want to
teach them all that you know. You want them to have
the right values, character traits, knowledge, and skills
because these are the tools that will allow them and
your unit to survive, to protect this nation, and to win
in battle. They are the tools that will allow your

soldiers to live happy, productive lives as soldiers or
civilians .•
The following examples show how you can apply
this principle:
• Ensure that your soldiers are properly fed, clothed,
and protected from the weather.
• Ensure that your soldiers powder their feet and put
on dry socks each day when in the field. You or your
medic should inspect to ensure that this is done.
• Share survival tricks with your soldiers, such as layering clothing, making a fist inside your glove, and
body motion to prevent frostbite.
234

• Conduct special field hygiene classes for fem ale
soldiers.
• Make your people observe proper health habits such
as using iodine tablets in impure water or taking
required malaria pills in tropical climates.
• Ensure that your soldiers dig in and prepare defensive positions whenever you will be in a position for a
period of time.
• Ensure that your soldiers clean and maintain their
weapons and equipment each day.
• Ensure that your soldiers wash their hands before
going through the chow line.
• Insist on proper field latrines.
• Insist that can teens are clean.
• Insist that your soldiers keep their bodies, teeth, and
clothing as clean as conditions permit, and that your
male soldiers shave. This serves two purposes. Bathing,
shaving, brushing teeth, and putting on clean clothes
are basic health habits. These simple preventive measures have a major impact on counteracting fungus
infections and other diseases. Secondly, they help maintain the veneer that keeps soldiers civilized in war.
• Encourage your soldiers to improve their education.
• Inform your soldiers of chapel programs available to
meet their spiritual needs.
• Advise your soldiers on how to live-how to handle
money, how to relate to other people, and how to grow
professionally and personally. Teach your subordinates
how to have self-development programs for increasing
their professional and personal competence.

PRINCIPLE 10
Keep your soldiers informed about missions
and standards. We have discussed the importance of
clear, open communication so that soldiers can accomplish their mission as a team and use initiative in the
absence of orders. The following examples show how
to apply this principle:
• Conduct periodic discussions in which you talk about
upcoming training and answer questions.

235

Chapter 9

• Implement the group feedback, leadership seminar,
during-the-action, and after-action programs explained
in chapter 10.
• Ensure that company short-range (3 months) and
long-range (12 months) training plans are accessible to
each squad leader and soldier. Each soldier should also
have easy access to all published training schedules.
In this way a soldier will know when to plan leave,
when he will be on guard, when he will be in the field
or deployed, and what to do to prepare for upcoming
events. It gives him a sense of control over his life.

PRINCIPLE 11
Use positive peer pressure to work for you and
the unit. Peer pressure can be a powerful motivating
force, but you must be careful how it is applied. If
not used properly, it can backfire with serious
consequences.
On the other hand, positive peer pressure that is
based on professional norms and values is healthy. The
following examples show techniques for applying positive peer pressure:
• When a detail (police call) is properly completed by
a unit, everyone goes to eat.
• When a squad is selected as best in the company, it
will get an afternoon off. Best squad is based on discipline, cohesion, maintenance, and individual and collective skills.

PRINCIPLE 12
Avoid using statistics as a major method of
evaluating units and motivating subordinates. Because senior leaders cannot be with their subordinates
as much as they would like, they often use statistical
goals and summaries to evaluate the effectiveness of
subordinate units and to motivate their subordinate
leaders. While their objectives are commendable, the
results are often counterproductive. Key definitions may
be redefined, procedures changed, and other actions
taken so that even if the "counting" were done quite
honestly, the statistics would be warped. Some examples
of this follow.
236

-----------------------------Chapter 9

A division commander declared . . . "that there
would be no more tank engine compartment fires. The
result was that there were no more fires. Instead, there
was a series of rapid oxidations and massive shorts in
electrical components of engine compartments. " 2
When unit training was measured by the number of
rounds expended and the n um her of times the rifle
ranges were open, more and more rounds were expended
each month-in the air, in the ground, and so forth.
More and more ranges were opened and closed by
second lieutenants without any firing between the opening and closing of the ranges. This not only gave a
false picture of training, but worse, it taught young
leaders to be dishonest.
When the number of pay inquiries became a measure
of financial unit effectiveness, a finance officer quietly
changed the definition of a pay inquiry. Finance services for soldiers did not improve, but the number of
complaints that met the new definition of pay inquiry
was lower.
These are examples of the counterproductive effects
of an evaluation system based on the improper use of
surface or image statistics. Statistics in themselves are
not necessarily bad or good. Statistics should be used
sparingly and carefully because they are only the
"mask" of a unit and they may present a false image.
They are surface indicators or symptoms that need to
be checked further. Perhaps they indicate a serious problem, perhaps not. You simply do not know until you
look into the true causes of the symptoms.
Improper use of statistics has a devastating effect
on trust, morale, and motivation. Valid evaluation
systems and effective leaders require much more than
statistics. They require ways to get beneath the "image"
to the real substance of the unit-the true strengths
and weaknesses that influence effectiveness and the
real leadership causes of those strengths and weaknesses. An inspirational leader makes the time to get
out with the troops and see the substance of a unit.

Chapter 9

PRINCIPLE 13
Make the jobs of your llubordinates as challenging, exciting, and meaningful as possible.
Make each soldier feel that he or she is an intelligent,
feeling, thinking individual-not a cog in a machineand that his creative thinking and competence are
crucial to the success of the entire unit. Experience and
study have proven that people need meaningful work.
They need to believe that what they are doing, even if
it is tiring and unpleasant, is necessary and important.
When people feel that their jobs are important and that
they have responsibility, they feel needed and motivated. Examples of how you can apply this principle
follow:
• Delegate some of your responsibility and authority.
You may think that this means to give up some of
your power to your subordinates. That is true because
you give them authority to give certain orders and supervise certain tasks. However, you actually increase the
power of your unit and yourself because you develop
the be, know, and do attributes of your subordinates,
and you greatly increase their motivation. You also free
yourself to direct your attention to bigger problems and
to plan for the future. Therefore, you increase your
power, the power of your subordinates, and the power
of your unit all at the same time.
Delegating authority and responsibility-pushing
power down-helps you get the best out of all your
subordinates. Of course, you can never delegate your
overall leadership responsibility because you are always
responsible for whatever happens or fails to happen in
your unit.
A company commander is totally responsible for all
that happens in his unit. Since the company commander is ultimately responsible, does that mean the
platoon leader is not responsible for what happens in
his platoon? Of course not. Both the company commander and platoon leader are responsible for all that
happens in the platoon. The company commander, first
sergeant, platoon leader, platoon sergeant, squad leader,
238

Chapter 9

and fire team leader are all responsible for what happens in a given squad or team. Responsibility in a unit,
must be shared by all members of the unit.
• Give responsibility to subordinates who have the skill
and will to handle it.
• Ensure that the individual who is given the responsibility knows exactly what you are holding him accountable to do. Ensure that he has all required resources
to accomplish what you want him to do.
• Strive to make all your subordinates feel that they
are as responsible as you are for achieving all unit
standards and goals. This requires that soldiers have
a complete understanding of your frame of reference
and of all unit standards, missions, and goals. If you
can get your subordinates to accept this belief about
their responsibility to the unit, you will have tapped
into a powerful motivation source.
People have a need to feel responsible and important. Make your people feel important by letting them
know that they are responsible for using their initiative;
achieving all unit standards, missions, and goals; and
influencing others to do the same. If you have a company that feels that way about company goals, you will
have a great unit. The way to instill this value has
been explained in chapter 4. Make a point of publicly
praising and rewarding performance that exhibits this
sense of responsibility.
• Challenge a capable individual by giving him increased responsibility. This will cause him to grow.
Give him the recognition and rank that go along with
the increased responsibility.
A note of caution is in order here. Once you have
delegated a responsibility according to the guidelines
discussed, check, coach, and supervise to ensure that
the subordinate is handling the responsibility well. You
are still responsible for everything that happens or fails
to happen in your unit. So you personally have to check
and teach. You can't lead from an office. A platoon
239

Chapter 9

leader should delegate the responsibility for conducting
individual training to his NCOs. The platoon leader,
however, is directly responsible for ensuring that the
platoon sergeant and squad leaders plan and conduct
an effective individual training program. He does this
by participating in the planning of the program, approving the program, and supervising the execution of
the program.
He supervises and checks in various ways. One way
is to observe each squad leader conducting individual
training. Another is to sample several soldiers in each
squad each week-to ensure that they have learned the
required tasks and that their job books are up-to-date.
When he finds deficiencies in the program, he gives
clear guidance to his platoon sergeant, coaches or counsels the appropriate squad leader, or, depending on the
situation, has his platoon sergeant do the coaching and
counseling. All leaders should have this type of system
for ensuring that subordinates are carrying out their
responsibilities.
The following section provides useful guidelines for
dividing responsibilities and tasks between officers and
NCOs. It is important that this section be viewed in
the light of the caution just discussed. Officers are responsible for helping, supervising, and ensuring that
NCOs carry out their responsibilities. They cannot
simply say, "Oh, that's sergeant's business," as if
checking the maintenance of weapons, the quality of
food, the correctness of foxholes, or the cleanliness of
the barracks is somehow below their commissioned
status. Officers should not do NCOs' work for them;
however, they must ensure that NCOs have the guidance, resources, and assistance necessary to do their
duties.
By the same token, NCOs are responsible for assisting and advising officers in carrying out their duties.
They must also stand ready to assume the responsibilities of the officers. There is no clear, sharp line that
distinguishes officer and NCO responsibilities and
duties. The officers and NCOs of a unit must determine
240

Chapter 9

the exact division of responsibilities and tasks by considering the mission, the situation, and the abilities and
personalities of the leaders on that particular leadership
team.
The following points from FM 22-600-20 explain guidelines for what officers do and what NCOs do.

PRINCIPLE 14
Do not tolerate any form of prejudicial talk or
behavior in your unit. Racial, sexual, or other prejudicial talk and behavior are contrary to the principles
that America was founded on. They are contrary to the
professional Army ethic and the character trait of
justice. If a soldier feels that he is the object of prejudice, his motivation to serve the unit can be seriously
damaged. Prejudice can also destroy cohesion.

POSITIVE AND COERCIVE TOOLS
One of the most difficult problems that all leaders
face is finding the appropriate mix of the "carrot" and
"stick" -the positive and coercive tools of motivation.
How do you determine the right combination for various difficult situations? When should you use the carrot
and when should you use the stick? These are difficult
but crucial questions. Your ability to use an appropriate
combination of positive and coercive tools of leadership
will have a significant effect on the motivation of your
soldiers and the discipline, cohesion, and effectiveness
of your unit. This section provides guidelines on how
to determine the appropriate mix of the positive and
coercive tools of motivation.
The major positive tools of motivation are• Setting the example.
• Establishing clear goals and standards.
• Teaching, coaching, counseling.
• Listening, persuading, rewarding.
• Making jobs challenging and meaningful.
• Making unit and soldier needs coincide when possible.
The coercive tools of motivation are• Verbal and written reprimands.
• Warnings about inappropriate behavior.
• Nonjudicial and judicial punishment.
Both the positive and coercive tools motivate people.
The art is knowing what combination of tools to apply
in a particular situation, and in what manner to apply
them. Since most people want to do their duties well,
you should develop your skills with the positive tools.
242

Chapter 9

The more skillful you are with each of these tools, the
better leader you will be. These skills are difficult to
develop for some people, and they take time to apply
successfully. Initially, the response of your people to
these skills may not be as quick as you would like.
Because it is more difficult to learn to apply the
positive skills of motivation, people in authority, like
Alden, often find themselves overusing coercive tools
of motivation. They are much easier to use and tend
to get immediate short-term results. It is easier to
threaten a willing, but below average soldier than it is
to spend time determining his problem, counseling him,
and teaching him to be a good soldier. Leaders who
rely on coercive tools as their main method of motivation in peacetime can produce units with impressive
statistics on maintenance, training, AWOLs, and contributions to fund-raising campaigns. You must remember, however, these statistics may show a false mask.

OVERUSING COERCIVE TOOLS
There are several major problems with overuse of
coercive tools of motivation. Coercive tools depend upon
fear. People have deep security needs to avoid pain and
fear-producing situations. These are lower-level needs.
Unlike the higher needs which reinforce motivation,
when the lower needs are met, motivation to do the
job ceases.
People motivated by coercive methods only do

enough to reach minimum standards and avoid the
punishment of the leader. When the coercive leader is
not present to threaten, motivation to reach the leader's
standards and goals stops. If discipline is a measure
of what a soldier does when the commander is not
there, then in the case of the coercive leader's unit, true
discipline is missing.
Improper use of coercive motivation causes resentment and loss of respect for the leader. It creates a
negative unit climate that damages the soldiers' trust
in their leaders. Loss of trust destroys open, candid communications-the unit's life blood. If subordinates are

243

Chapter 9

afraid of a leader, they will be afraid to ask him for
clarification of messages. They will be afraid to use
their initiative, creative intelligence, and judgment in
difficult situations when the leader cannot be reached.
Overuse of coercion creates a shallow, false discipline
in a unit because the discipline is caused by fear, not
by internal forces that carry on under stress.
A coercive leadership atmosphere prohibits people
from experimenting and developing their competence,
and from growing professionally and personally. Moti vation based mainly on coercion breaks down in combat
because the fear of maiming or death in battle is
stronger than the fear of the leader's punishment. At
the moment of truth in combat, the leader who has
relied heavily on fear for motivation in peace finds himself powerless in battle. On the field of battle, he cannot rely on coercion. Since his unit lacks real discipline,
cohesion, confidence, and morale, it panics, becomes
routed, mutinies, or suffers an unnecessary defeat.
The process just described is real. Perhaps you think
that the contrast between Alden and Randall is artificial, that there really are no leaders like Alden or
Randall. That is simply not true. There are Aldens in
the Army. There are Randalls and Chamberlains. If you
rely too much on coercion, you will be an Alden. You
must develop the positive skills of motivation.

APPROPRIATELY USING COERCIVE TOOLS
We have discussed the perils of overusing coercive
methods. When is it appropriate to use coercive tools
and how do you use them?
When reasonable, attainable standards are set, the
leader should communicate the consequences for not
attaining minimum standards. Thus far we have given
you two examples of when such coercive methods may
be used-the platoon sergeant in Vietnam (chapter 5)
who set a clear standard with a reasonable consequence
to get the men on a position to dig in properly and
the platoon sergeant (chapter 8) who took similar action
to get his men to clean their weapons properly. In the

244

Chapter 9

examples for applying the principle of "making the
needs of individuals coincide with unit tasks and missions," we have shown the proper use of coercionsetting clear standards with reasonable consequences.
The examples for applying the principle "counsel or punish soldiers who behave in a way that is counter to
unit tasks and missions" also illustrate proper use of
coercion. We cannot tell you exactly how and when to
use coercion, but the following guidelines can help you
think through problems and determine how to motivate
people in various situations:
• Use the positive tools of motivation first with groups
of soldiers and with individuals.
• Strive to instill professional values and character
traits in all your subordinates. They will then be mainly
self-motivated by their own professional beliefs, values,
and character.
• Ensure through teaching, counseling, and coaching
that your people have the knowledge and skill to reach
all unit standards.
• Determine the cause when a soldier or a group does
not reach a standard. Was it improper communication,
lack of knowledge and skill, intentional failure to do a
job, intentional violation of a rule, or unprofessional
values and character traits? If the cause of the problem
is poor communication or lack of knowledge and skill,
then improved communication, instruction, and training
are in order. If the cause is intentional failure, disobedience, or unprofessional values or character traits, then
counsel the individual or group on why these things
are unacceptable. Tell them of the consequences of failure to meet unit standards. If the improper behavior
persists, then further disciplinary measures are in order.
• To determine fair disciplinary measures, seek the
advice of seniors, trusted subordinates, peers, and others
you trust. Use the problem-solving process, determine
an appropriate, fair punishment, and administer it. Follow up with evaluation of the effect of your action on
the individual and the unit. Continue to counsel, evaluate, and take action as appropriate.
245

Chapter 9

Your people know that reasonable consequences are
necessary to maintain discipline and to get people to
work together under difficult circumstances to achieve
goals. Since people need security, they need order and
discipline; therefore, they need leaders who will give
them order, rules, and required discipline.
Very few people are totally self-motivated and selfdisciplined. All of us require a coercive push now and
then to overcome laziness or lack of interest. We all
know that sometimes we tend to work a little bit harder
when we are being graded or evaluated. Grades, tests,
inspections, and other forms of evaluation are healthy,
yet coercive motivators. We do not resent the coercion
as long as we can see that it is used fairly to achieve
a worthwhile purpose. If we see coercion used by the
leader to benefit himself, we resent it. If we see it used
as a prop because the leader lacks character, knowledge, or skill, we resent the leader, and the unit
deteriorates.
We also resent leaders who make rules to guard
against the behavior of the few worst people in the
unit. These rules punish the majority and are counterproductive. An example of this is a commander on an
off-post exercise who will not let his troops go into town
on a Saturday night because he fears one or two might
behave badly and mar his image in the eyes of his
seniors.

TEACHING AND COUNSELING
We have discussed direct, short-range techniques for
influencing motivation and how to determine the correct mix of positive and coercive tools of motivation.
We said that you would do well to improve your skills
in applying the positive tools of motivation. Teaching
and counseling are positive tools that have an indirect,
but powerful effect on motivation. If you teach and
counsel well, you will affect your soldiers' values, character, knowledge, skills, and confidence-positive motivating forces. Furthermore, you will counteract fear and
unprofessional values and character traits-counterproductive motivating forces.
246

Chapter 9

TEACHING
Teaching is helping to create the conditions that
cause someone to learn and develop. If you are going
to influence the competence and motivation of your
subordinates, you must be a skilled teacher. Coaching,
counseling, rewarding, and taking appropriate disciplinary measures are all a part of teaching. You must
be a good teacher to plan and conduct effective training
and to help your subordinates develop professionally
and personally.
A clear understanding of how people learn is fundamental to being a good teacher. People learn by the
example of others, by forming a picture in their minds
of what they are trying to learn, by gaining and understanding necessary information, and by application or
practice. Learning requires certain important conditions.
One condition is that the person must be motivated to
learn. You cannot teach knowledge or skills to someone
who is not motivated to learn. He must feel a need to
learn what you are teaching.
How do you get the person to need what you want
to teach? You show the person that what you are trying
to teach will make him a more competent soldier-better
able to do his duty and survive on the battlefield. Use
examples to get the person to see the importance of
what you are teaching. For example, the purpose of the
two case studies in chapter 1 of this manual was to
illustrate the need to study this manual and to develop
your leadership attributes. They showed you the demands of combat on leaders and troops. They presented
a vivid picture of the leadership attributes that you
need if you are to develop a cohesive, disciplined unit.
The next condition of learning is to involve soldiers
in the process. Keep their attention by actively involving their minds and emotions in the learning process.
Have your subordinates participate, either through discussion or through active practice of a skill.
You cannot keep people's attention with a long
lecture. Normally, people can only pay attention to a lecture for a short time-less than half an hour. Then
247

Chapter 9

they need to use what has been taught or they will
forget it, and their minds will wander. They need to
discuss, to apply to an example, or to practice whatever it is you are teaching. If you lecture to soldiers
for an hour on the nomenclature, functioning, and operation of a weapon, they will remember very little of what
you said. You can have beautiful slides, funny jokes,
and a polished presentation. You can even keep their
interest through your style and enthusiasm for the subject, but they won't remember much of what you said.
Instead, the way to teach the nomenclature, operation, and maintenance of a weapon is to have a set of
logically related learning objectives. Give a brief lecture
(no more than 10 minutes) and demonstration on the
first objective. Then have the soldiers practice the skill.
Coach them, and when they have proved to themselves
and to you that they have achieved the objective, go
on to the next objective.
This process of learning is easily used for teaching
physical skills like learning to operate and maintain
weapons and equipment. But what about skills that cannot be directly observed or evaluated? For example,
what do you do if you want to give your platoon a
2-hour class on communication, counseling, or motivation? The only real difference in teaching technical
skills, like firing a weapon, and difficult-to-measure
skills, like communication or counseling, is the way the
teacher conducts the practice and coaching part of the
instruction.
When teaching leadership attributes, you should present principles, discuss examples, and then actively
involve subordinates in the learning process. Conduct
simulations and role playing. Have your subordinates
apply the attribute to a case or have them present a
realistic skit that demonstrates their understanding of
the attribute or principle and how to apply it.
Appendix A details how to teach a class on professional values. The same process can be used to teach
character traits and other leadership attributes that are
not easily measured.
248

Chapter 9

COUNSELING
Hand in hand with your responsibilities as a teacher
are your responsibilities as a coach and a counselor. It
is critically important that you counsel all your soldiers
frequently on their professional and personal strengths
and weaknesses and on any problems that you may
be able to help them with.
Counseling is talking with a person in a way that
helps that person solve a problem or helps to create
conditions that will cause the person to improve his
behavior, or character, or values. Counseling is a leadership skill that is a particular form of leading and teaching. Good counseling, like good teaching, requires a
combination of all your leadership be, know, and do
attributes. It requires directional (thinking) skills, such
as identifying the problem, analyzing the factors and
forces influencing the behavior of the soldier being
counseled, and planning and organizing the counseling
session. It requires implementing skills-coordinating
the session, communicating, supervising, and evaluating
the session as it proceeds. It requires an understanding
of human nature-what causes the soldier to behave
in a counterproductive manner and what will be required to change his behawor, character traits, or
values. Counseling requires sincerity, compassion, and
kindness. It also requires a sense of timing about when
to let the counselee make his own decisions and when
you should make them for him, when to be kind and
understanding, and when to be firm and unyielding.
Just as there are no easy answers for exactly what
to do in leadership situations, there are no easy
answers for exactly what to do in specific counseling
situations. When you see that a subordinate needs counseling, review the problem-solving process (chapter 7).
Decide on what you believe to be the best course of
action, implement it, and then get feedback on its effectiveness. Examine the feedback to determine what
further action needs to be taken.
As a counselor you want to teach the counselee new
values, character traits, knowledge, or skills that will
change his behavior and help him to be a better person
249

and soldier. Appendix B contains a case study based
on fact that illustrates counseling skills. FM 22-101 is
a thorough explanation of how to prepare and conduct
different types of counseling sessions.
Appendix D, on analyzing a leadership situation and
determining an appropriate style, will assist you in
teaching and counseling. The communication techniques
in appendix C will also aid in your teaching and counseling roles.

SUMMARY
This chapter has focused on practical techniques for
increasing soldiers' motivation to achieve unit standards
and missions. We defined motivation and explained a
basic view of what motivates people-the perception
that taking specific actions will lead to the satisfaction
of certain needs. We then explained a number of important principles of motivation and gave you practical,
direct techniques for applying the principles. Finally,
we discussed teaching and counseling-two leadership
skills that have an indirect, but powerful, long-range
impact on the motivation of your soldiers.

and "dnit

This chapter provides you practical , programs for
developing yourself, your subordinates, and your unit
according to the concepts and principles of this manual. These programs will also assist you in developing
a positive, healthy leadership climate in your unit.

LEADERSHIP SELF-DEVELOPMENT
In chapter 2 we defined leadership as the process
through which a soldier influences others to accomplish the mission. We explained the four major factors

of leadership-the follower, the leader, communication,
and the situation. We then briefly explained what
a leader must be (beliefs, values, ethics, character),
know (self, job, unit), and do (direct, implement, and
motivate) to accomplish missions.
To improve yourself and your subordinatest you
should strive to learn more about the four factors of
leadership and how they affect each other. You should
also seek to improve yourself and your subordinates in
the areas of what a leader must be, know, and do.
Good leaders have a never-ending thirst to increase
their competence as persons and as leaders through
study and experience.
251

A good leadership self-development program should
include a combination of the following activities:
• Seek additional responsibility and tough, challenging
jobs. You build character, knowledge, and skills by handling tough jobs and situations. You should seek
assignments that will allow you to make your best contributions to the Army and give you the most challenges and responsibilities.
• Engage in self-study of military history, technical
and tactical publications, and correspondence courses.
• Take college courses in such subjects as military history, psychology (the study of human nature), sociology
(the study of society and groups within society),
anthropology (the study of the development of man),
organizational behavior and development, management,
literature, and other subjects related to the knowledge
and skill requirements of your military specialties.
Seeking challenging, responsible jobs and self-study
are mandatory activities if you wish to develop. College courses, though not mandatory, can enhance your
competence as a leader.
Furthermore, you should write your own leadership
development program with the assistance of your seniors, peers, and other trusted people. Then, about
every 6 months, update the program based on your
increased learning and development.

The following steps are a guide to developing your
program:
i~ng.11 Identify your strengths and weaknesses
in the fallowing areas:

• Beliefs, values, and ethics-see chapter 4.
• Character traits-see chapter 5.
• Knowledge (yourself, human nature, your job, your
unit)-see chapter 6.
• Directional skills (problem solving, planning, decision
making, goal setting)-see chapter 7.
• Implementing skills (communicating, coordinating,
supervising, and evaluating)-see chapter 8.
252

Chapter 10

• Motivating skills (teaching, counseling, applying the
principles of motivation)-see chapter 9.
We all have .weaknesses in several of the be, know,
and do attributes. You should think of at least one or
two ways to improve in each of these areas. How do
you do this?
Think in a quiet place. Reflect about how you have
performed in the past. Then visualize how you want to
be able to perform in the future. Review each chapter
of this manual. As you review each chapter, think· of
at least one way you could improve. Write down the
desired improvements and what you can do to improve.
Also, as you review each chapter, think of ways you
can reinforce or better use your strengths. Write these
down. The points you have written down become goals
to achieve.
Seek feedback and advice from seniors, peers, and
others you respect on how you could improve your leadership competence. They will see things that you simply
do not or cannot see. If this feedback makes sense and
feels right, accept it and develop goals from it.
After you have identified weaknesses and ways to
improve, you are ready for step 2.

a-1t§·IJ

Set goals. For each weakness or desired
improvement, set a goal. For example, let us say that

you desire to strengthen your motivating skillsteaching, counseling, and applying the principles of
motivation.
Set the following goals:
• Learn more about human needs. See chapter 6.
• Improve ability to apply principles of motivation. See
chapter 9.
• Improve communication skills. See chapter 8 and
appendix C.
• Improve teaching skills. See chapter 9 and appendix A.
• Improve counseling skills. See chapter 9, appendix B,
and FM 22-101.

253

Once you have stated your goals you are ready to
continue.
ii§·ll Develop plans to achieve goals. For each
goal you need a plan that will lead you to achieve that
goal. Making your plan involves the same planning process that you went through to plan the night attack in
chapter 7. Identify tasks that must be accomplished,
put them in priority, and establish all the conditions
necessary to carry out each task. Write a simple plan
to reach each goal. Here are basic outlines of plans
you might use to reach each goal in step 2:
·

f

• Goal A: Learn more about human needs.
1. Study the needs section of chapter 6. Determine
how you can better apply the motivation principle of
"making the needs of the individual coincide with the
tasks and missions of the unit." Use both the positive
tools of motivation (teaching, counseling, rewarding, setting the example) and the coercive tools of motivation
(reprimanding and demanding that standards be met
before routine benefits are given).
2. Have informal conversations with soldiers of various ranks. Ask them about the needs of troops, what
makes troops tick, and how best to motivate troops.
Have them describe leaders they have known who have
truly motivated troops to want to do the job. It is key
to ask what specific things these leaders did.
• Goal B: Improve ability to apply the principles of
motivation.
1. Study the principles of motivation in chapter 9.
Using the examples of how to apply each principle as
a guide, write down your intentions to apply each principle in your unit.
2. Get feedback from seniors, peers, and others you
trust on how you can better apply the principles of motivation in your unit. In your conversations with soldiers, use the principles of motivation as a guide for
asking questions on how to motivate people. If your
conversations with soldiers are to be constructive, you .
254

Chapter 10

GOOD LEADERS
LEARN FROM THE
PERCEPTIONS,
EXPERIENCE,
AND IDEAS
OF THEIR
SUBORDINATES

have to be natural, relaxed, and create an atmosphere
that gets them to "open up" to you. For example, if
you are a platoon leader or squad leader, you can sit
on a log during chow in the field with a few soldiers
or join a few soldiers around a campfire or share a
foxhole with a soldier. Casually inquire about what
motivates troops and what things might be done to
improve your unit. Get the soldiers talking about motivation. Ask for examples. Keep the conversation casual, nonthreatening, and enjoyable. Talk naturally to
them, and they will talk naturally to you. You can conduct this same kind of spontaneous conversation with
soldiers of all ranks to include your seniors. You will
be amazed at what you will learn. Also, the very process of having these conversations with subordinates
will help create bonds of respect, trust, confidence, and
understanding between you and your troops. The conversations themselves will improve communication,
understanding, cohesion, morale, and motivation.
255

• Goal C: Improve communication skills.
1. Study appendix C and the section in chapter 8
on communication.
2. Ask questions about communication in your
casual discussions with seniors, subordinates, and others. What makes good communication in a unit? What
are the barriers to good communication between people
in a unit? Ask for examples of the barriers. Say things
like-"I wonder how we could improve communication
in our unit. Do you have any ideas? How do good leaders you have known communicate? Do you think people in this unit are a little afraid to communicate
openly with their seniors? Why? Can you think of an
example?
• Goal D: Improve your teaching skills.
1. Study the section in chapter 9 on teaching. Study
the example in appendix A on teaching. Study
FMs 25-2 and 25-3 on how to manage and conduct training. Your unit should have adequate copies of these
manuals. If it does not, ensure that the Sl orders them.
2. In your casual discussions in the field, mess hall,
or motor pool with seniors, subordinates, and others,
ask the same kinds of questions about teaching and training that you did about motivation and communication.
• Goal E: Improve counseling skills.
1. Study the section in chapter 9 on counseling and
the example in appendix B. Study FM 22-101.
2. Get feedback from seniors, peers, and others you
trust on how to improve your counseling skills. For
example, as a squad leader, you might have to counsel
one of your troops. Ask your platoon sergeant and the
soldier's fire team leader to be present at the counseling session. After the session, meet with your platoon
sergeant. Request feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of your counseling skills. Also, at a convenient
time and place-in the field or in the mess hall-ask
the fire team leader for his thoughts on the effectiveness of your counseling session.
256

Chapter 10

After developing a plan to reach each goal, you
must plan to evaluate your progress.

1t!Jt§.ll Evaluate. For each goal write out two
or more ways of evaluating progress towards the
goal. The following are suggested methods of evaluation:
• Self-evaluate. You are your own best evaluator. Be
honest with yourself. Constantly try to determine the
status of your progress.
• Seek feedback from seniors, peers, and others. You
may want to get the assistance of one or two people
you respect in the development of your goals and plans.
They should then coach you and give you feedback on
your progress. Ideally, your rater is your primary teacher, coach, and evaluator. Like all leaders, your rater
has three major functions: accomplish the mission, look
out for the well-being of all his subordinates, and teach,
coach, and counsel his subordinates in areas of professional and personal competence.
Often, if we are wise enough to allow them to be,
our subordinates can be excellent teachers, coaches,
and advisers to NCOs and officers.
• Look at grades received on SQTs, ARTEPs, and
courses. These are indications of progress towards your
goals.
In review, your leadership self-development program
consists of four major steps:
1. Identify your weaknesses and ways you want to
improve your be, know and do attrib~tes.
2. Set a goal for each weakness or way you want
to improve.
3. Develop a plan to achieve each goal.
4. Develop at least one method for evaluating your
progress toward each goal.
The process is continuous. Based on the results of
step 4, identify new ways to improve, and then go
through steps 2 through 4 again.
267

Your leadership self-development program is the
basis of your leadership development. You should have
a program, and you should require your subordinates
to have one. Assist your subordinates in establishing a
program, and coach them on how best to develop themselves. While your rater has responsibilities to assist
in your development, the primary responsibility for
your leadership growth rests squarely on your shoulders. If you have the necessary character traits-initiative, will, and self-discipline-to develop and implement
this program for yourself and your subordinates, you
will reap great dividends in leadership and unit
effectiveness.

INDIVIDUAL FEEDBACK
Each leader, from fire team leader to company
commander, should have a program for systematically
counseling and for receiving feed back from each of his
subordinates. We will use the platoon sergeant as an
example, but all company-level leaders should use some
form of this program.
The platoon sergeant and platoon leader should each
spend about 30 to 60 minutes with each subordinate
soldier every 3 to 6 months. Soldiers of all ranks should
be interviewed. The platoon sergeant should ask the soldier to sit down in a relaxed, private, and confidential
atmosphere. He should request honest, frank answers.
He should ask the following types of questions:
• What things are motivating people to do their best?
What things are hindering motivation? Give examples.
• What can the leaders and troops in this unit do to
improve.. ? . . . M·t
Tra1n1ng.
a1n enance.? . . . Moral?
e. . . .
Cohesion? ... Discipline? ... Combat readiness? ...
• How is your morale? Why? Give examples.
• Do you feel that you are learning and improving as
a professional soldier and person by being in this platoon? Give examples.
258

Chapter 10

• Why do some people in this unit go AWOL?
• Why do some people in this unit use illegal drugs?
If the platoon sergeant has received honest answers
to most of these questions from most of his people, he
will have a good assessment of his unit's weaknesses
and his subordinate leaders' weaknesses. He will then
be in a position to develop appropriate programs. Naturally, he should take thorough notes during each
counseling session.
After asking appropriate questions, the leader has
the opportunity to counsel and coach the subordinate
on how he can develop his competence. To do this, the
leader must have a thorough knowledge of the soldier's record and abilities and specific examples of
what the soldier has done poorly. The leader should
recommend ways the soldier might improve. This
requires conscientious preparation for the session.
Many great benefits derive from this type of counseling and feedback program. The leader identifies
problems, learns the perceptions of subordinates, and
identifies various unit and personnel weaknesses. As a
result of the session, each soldier feels a special relationship with the leader, and a bond of trust, respect,
confidence, and understanding develops.
While the platoon leader and platoon sergeant can
meet with each soldier only once every 3 to 6 months,
lower level leaders should have individual counseling
sessions more frequently. This program takes time, but
the time invested will result in great dividends in the
cohesion, discipline, training, morale, motivation, and
combat readiness of the unit.

GROUP FEEDBACK
This program involves informal talks by the leader
with small groups of soldiers (eight or fewer) about unit
problems, weaknesses, cohesion, discipline, and other
professional topics. Each leader from squad leader
to company commander should carry out such talks.
259

We will use the company commander to show how
to do this, but the same process is valid as an example for other leaders. For example, the first sergeant
should be talking with NCOs and troops in the same
way the company commander does.
The company commander should spend at least
1 hour per week talking to at least one small group of
subordinates. One week he should talk to a group of
E2s, E3s, and E4s; the next week E5s; and the next
week E6s and E7s. Each level has different perceptions,
problems and conflicts. The leader needs to understand
the thoughts, emotions, perceptions, and problems of all
levels of his subordinates-their frames of reference.
The leader follows the same process as in the counseling program. He talks to the group in private. His
manner is relaxed and natural, encouraging honest
feedback. He asks the same questions as in the counseling program and in the interviews discussed in the
self-development program. The leader should focus on
both strengths and weaknesses-how to reinforce unit
strengths and correct unit weaknesses. The leader
should spend 90 percent of his time listening and
10 percent talking.
The benefits of this program are the same as those
attained from the counseling program. The feedback
program is one of the most efficient ways to identify

problems that could dangerously snowball if not
quickly attacked. The leader can also bring out problems and get valuable advice. For example, he might ask
what could be done to lower the AWOL rate, increase
the reenlistment rate, improve training, and improve
cohesiveness. This exchange creates a team spirit in
solving unit problems and in improving the unit.
A feedback session also gives the leader the chance
to teach leadership, to counsel, to instill correct professional beliefs and values, and to correct misperceptions.
Also, when the leader listens more than he talks, it
shows the soldiers that the leader sincerely cares about
them and their ideas. This, in turn, causes them to
260

Chapter 10

believe in the leader and to increase their motivation.
Soldiers will risk their lives for leaders they believe in.
The leader also benefits from the ideas of his subordinates. This program can be carried out informally
nearly anywhere-in the mess hall, in the field, around
a campfire, in the motor pool, in the barracks-at the
same time the leader is checking on daily activities.

LEADERSHIP AND TRAINING SEMINAR
Company leaders at all levels should apply this
program. It involves discussing with your subordinate
leaders how training, maintenance, morale, and discipline problems can be solved by good leadership. The
purpose of the leadership and training seminar is to
help individual leaders develop as professionals and to
develop a cohesive leadership team that applies the
same basic concepts and methods. When all unit leaders are communicating as a cohesive team and are conscientiously applying effective leadership concepts and
methods, the unit will thrive.
The leadership seminar is a major vehicle for the
commander or leader at any level to develop his leadership team. The idea of the seminar is to teach all
leaders how to develop and to apply the professional
leadership attributes: beliefs, values, ethics, character
traits, knowledge, and skills.
All leaders should conduct leadership and training
seminars. For purposes of discussion, we will use the
platoon leader as an example. The leadership and training seminar should be conducted at least once or twice
a month. A typical seminar might concentrate on the
strengths and weaknesses of the unit. An example of
how that seminar might look is described below.

leader. All his subordinate leaders are present, to
include fire team leaders. Fire team leaders are our
most junior, thus inexperienced, leaders and therefore
have the greatest need to develop. Include them. The
platoon leader initiates the seminar by encouraging an
261·

open atmosphere of frank, honest discussion about problems that the unit is facing. If possible, he should have
butcher paper or a blackboard on hand to record problems and suggestions. Someone should be appointed
recorder to take accurate notes. The platoon leader
should explain that the purpose of the seminar is to
identify unit strengths and problems. He should clearly
state that the purpose of the session is not to air "complaints," but to identify unit weaknesses and discuss
how to apply good leadership concepts and methods to
correct the weaknesses. In this manner, not only does
the seminar teach practical leadership, but it improves
the unit by reinforcing its strengths, by identifying
problems, and by applying good leadership to solve
unit problems.

a-iC§·IJ

Determine unit strengths and weaknesses. The platoon leader may wish to start the semi-

nar by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the
past week's training. He could then ask for opinions
from his subordinates on training weaknesses and problems. Everyone has a different frame of reference;
therefore, the platoon leader should try to get everyone's opinion on training weaknesses. Actual examples
of weaknesses should be given so that concrete specifics can be discussed. Actual problems and examples
(training, maintenance, communication, morale, discipline) should be discussed and recorded. Further, if too

many problems surface to handle in the allotted time
period, you may need to put those problems in priority
and delay steps 3 through 5 until later meetings.

ffS·ll

Identify the causes of the weaknesses.

The purpose of step 3 is to identify the causes of the
problems stated in step 2. The leaders present need to
discuss honestly what is causing the problems. You
must drop your defenses and be willing to face your
own leadership weaknesses and mistakes. In almost all
cases, if you honestly analyze the causes of your unit's
problems, you will find that the problems were caused
by some leader or group of leaders who did not plan,
262

Chapter 10

organize, communicate, or motivate correctly. Nearly
all training and combat failures are caused by leadership failures. The leader neglected to plan for supplies
or artillery support; he did not make a checklist; he
failed to make a personal reconnaissance; he did not
inspect properly; he did not communicate; or the troops
were not motivated because the trainer did not make
the training meaningful. These are typical causes of
poor training, and they all relate to the trainer's failure to properly apply certain leadership attributes.

~ii§·ll Discuss how to improve unit per(ormance through better leadership. In step 3 the root
causes of stated problems are honestly discussed. The
purpose of step 4 is to discuss how the application of
leadership attributes can eliminate the identified
causes. The platoon leader leads a discussion identifying which leadership attributes were violated and how
the violations caused the problems. He then leads a
discussion of how the application of good leadership
attributes would have avoided the problem.

~ii§aj Discuss what leadership concepts and
attributes have been learned and how they will
be correctly applied in the future. In this way, the
platoon leader teaches a unified framework of leadership concepts and attributes that he wants applied in
his unit. He teaches the kind of leadership he wants,

the standards he wants reached, and the boundaries
his subordinate leaders must stay within.
People will say, "We don't have time for this kind
of thing." Take time. You need to conduct this kind of
seminar once a month. The leadership and training
seminar explained here, if properly carried out, will save
time in the long run and will significantly improve your
unit in every way. One way to conduct this seminar is
to integrate it in~_o ~ur weekly training meetings. This
is logical and ef{eCtive since it is the leadership attributes explained In this manual that cause good training. Why not include leadership development as a major
item of discussion at all weekly training meetings?
263

You may be concerned with what the troops will do
while all the leaders, including the fire team leaders,
are in a seminar. If you use your imagination, there
are several productive solutions that will keep the
troops constructively employed and at the same time
develop leadership competence in some of them. One
solution is to appoint a com;>lete shadow chain of command in your company o~ platoon of specialists and
privates. Let them know in advance what their jobs
will be. Coach them in planning a training or maintenance activity that they will lead and supervise while
the leaders are in a 2-hour seminar. Let them know
they will be responsible for the quality of training and
maintenance.
There are many things they could do. Examples:
Squad-versus-squad battle drill in a close-in training
area; battle drill on the parade field; individual training that emphasizes peer instruction and using Training Extension Course tapes; motor stables; maintenance
and inspection of weapons and equipment. Of course,
a plan for notifying the real chain of command is necessary in the event of an emergency.
This kind of program works. It is useful in many
ways for privates and specialists to practice carrying
out leadership responsibilities. It develops their leadership competence. It is motivating. It prepares them for

the battlefield when a specialist or private might sud·
denly find himself the leader of a unit.
There are some pitfalls in this type of seminar that
must be avoided. People need to be candid, but any discussion of another person or unit must be constructive,
tactful, and respectful. The seminar is in no way a psychological group sensitivity session. If people get angry
at each other and criticize emotionally, the seminar
may be harmful. It is the job of the seminar leader
and each individual to keep the seminar calm and rational and to ensure that people talk to each other with
respect and tact. Criticize specific behavior or events,
not the motivation, ability, or character of others.
264

Chapter 10

Nobody likes criticism. We must identify our leadership
weaknesses, however, and take corrective action if we
are going to produce effective, combat-ready units.

THE JOURNAL-NOTE TAKING
DURING THE ACTION
The purpose of this program is to record the details of
significant events as they occur, or as soon after they
occur as possible. For example, the fight at Little Round
Top occurred on 2 July 1863. Colonel Chamberlain took
time to write a complete detailed after-action report on
6 July 1863. Leaders always have things to do, so they
must make time for important actions. In training or
war, there is always time to record briefly important observations or events; however, it takes self-discipline.
During a training mission or combat mission, all
leaders should take advantage of lulls to jot down
thoughts on unit strengths, weaknesses, or problem
areas. When events occur they are fresh in your mind,
and you think you will always remember the lessons
learned. A month later, however, you have already forgotten many important lessons. If you or someone else
did not write down the lessons or observations, they are
forgotten and the same costly mistakes are made again
and again.
These during-the-action notes are memory joggers.
Each day you should try to take 15 to 30 minutes to
sit down, go over your notes, and write down the weaknesses, strengths, and problem areas that surfaced during training or combat mission. That way, when you
write your after-action "lessons-learned" report, you
have daily notes to jog your memory.
As an absolute minimum, each day you should sit
down by yourself, date the page in your journal-which
can be your green Army pocket notebook-and write
briefly the lessons learned that day and what your priorities are for the next day. It forces you to think, to use
your mind creatively, to help your mind integrate information and ideas, and to come up with new concepts
265

and solutions to problems. It completes your thoughts
and helps you think of things you simply would not
have thought of otherwise. It develops and disciplines
your mind.

GOOD LEADERS
TAKE GOOD
NOTES EACH
DAY ON UNIT
STRENGTHS AND
WEAKNESSES

If you do this once a day, you will have useful
notes to form the basis of a valuable after-action critique and report. A daily journal kept by all leaders is
a superb way to record lessons learned. The journals
become the basis for training, for new tactics, for
SOPs, and for other actions aimed at developing the
unit. They also become an excellent historical record
that provides insights for future soldiers. In writing
The Twentieth Maine, John Pullen relied heavily on
the diaries of several soldiers. The demands and lessons of battle can only truly be learned through the
eyes, ears, feelings, and words of soldiers at the point
of action while events are fresh in their minds. When
soldiers write what they have seen and learned in
training and in battle, they contribute to the knowledge
of other soldiers.
266

Chapter 10

Without a journal, many valuable lessons will be forgotten that will have to be relearned next time. This
costs valuable time in training and lives in combat.
When soldiers do not systematically write lessons
learned, they doom those who follow them to make the
same mistakes.
For example, a company commander took over a
company at a post in the United States; the company
had inadequate records of lessons learned. Every time
the company had gone to the field or on a readiness
exercise, it made the same mistakes. The new company
commander instituted a system of lessons-learned journals. After each training exercise the journals were
used as the basis for after-action critiques on the exercise. All leaders and many troops in the company participated. Key points were taken from each journal and
included in the detailed after-action report which was
written after each exercise. It was then used as the
basis for future training and updating SOPs. In this
way the company continually improved. It did not
make the same mistakes.
After 2 years a new and inexperienced company commander took over. Since he had the lessons-learned
after-action reports and SOPs, he did not have to learn
everything through experience. "Experience is a good
teacher, but a fool learns by no other." When it came

time for the company to go on an emergency deployment readiness exercise, the new company commander
referred to the detailed after-action report on such exercises. He guarded against previous mistakes. He and
his subordinates studied the lessons learned and followed the SOPs. The exercise was a success. Without
the report they would have had to relearn all the mistakes of the company on the previous exercises. The
report would not have been possible if the leaders and
some troops had not kept journals.
The practice of keeping journals and using them to
help the overall company motivates soldiers. They feel
important, intelligent, and needed.
267

CRITIQUES DURING THE ACTION
This program keeps pace with unit action. Once a
day you should sit down with your subordinates and
critique the actions that occurred that day in field training, in garrison, or in combat. Plan actions for the next
day. The company commander should have this meeting with his first sergeant and platoon leaders; the
first sergeant with the platoon sergeants; the platoon
leaders with his platoon sergeant and squad leaders;
the squad leaders with members of their squad.
This program is enhanced if all leaders keep a daily
journal.
The following is a suggested way of handling this
meeting:
1. The senior leader starts by saying "O.K., let's
talk about what happened today. What went right and
what went wrong?"
2. Each person present states his views.
3. The senior leader says, "I want each of you to
tell me what you and your unit did today to contribute
to combat effectiveness and to prepare for future
missions."
4. After this is done, the senior leader says, "What
do we need to do to correct what went wrong today?
What do we need to do to prepare for tomorrow?" Each
person gives his views.
5. The senior leader considers all the views, makes
his decision, and issues appropriate instructions. He ensures that each person present clearly writes down all
of his instructions so this key information will not be
forgotten or miscommunicated. In combat or training,
people often go to meetings to receive orders or instructions and fail to write down all important information
because of laziness. They think they will remember.
You must require your subordinates to write down
your instructions and pass them on. Check on this at
the end of meetings by asking each subordinate to read
back your instructions in a certain area or to read
back part of the operation order. Check on it by visiting the troops and asking them questions relating to
268

Chapter 10

instructions and orders that your subordinate leaders
were supposed to give them. Did the troops write down
in their notebooks the important information that they
must have and remember?
We have discussed at length the criticality of the
flow of accurate, complete information in a unit. We
have discussed how information can get filtered and
distorted as it goes up or down the chain of command.
Do not let miscommunication damage your unit. Do
not trust your memory or the memory of subordinates.
Be tough as nails on this point. Make people take good
notes when you are passing information. Then check
the accuracy of their note taking. This forces people to
pay attention. Under stress, minds tend to wander.
People may not listen closely, and they tend to forget
things quickly. Good note taking will counteract forgetful tendencies and will enhance an accurate flow of complete information up, down, and laterally.
A daily critique can have tremendous benefits. The
senior leader designates a recorder. He encourages all
present to take appropriate notes. The notes become the
basis of lessons learned and an after-action report.
This daily session allows the leader to communicate
directly with his key subordinates, to teach them, to
counsel them, to learn from them, and to receive valuable counsel from them. This daily session promotes
trust, clear communication, respect, and confidence. It
builds the bonds of a strong, effective leadership team
in which all members are using the same "sheet of
music"-leadership philosophy and methods.
A daily session keeps your unit coordinated and organized. It helps you to see problems before they arise
and to take action to prevent them. Critiquing helps
you deal with problems that have arisen. It helps you
keep your finger on the pulse of morale, cohesion, discipline, and unit effectiveness. A daily meeting helps
your leaders know you and what you want so that
they can use their initiative to achieve what you want.
269

S. L. A. MARSHALL
AFTER-ACTION TYPE CRITIQUES
These critiques are invaluable and should be completed after every training and combat mission. Every
leader at each level should carry out an after-action critique with all of his subordinates. You may want to use
a tape recorder, but all people present must know and consent to being taped. A recorder should be appointed.
The leader runs the critique, conducting it the same
way he runs the leadership seminar program. He asks
each individual to get out his notes or journal and
state his experience during the mission-the observed
problems, unit weaknesses, unit strengths, and mistakes. These are all recorded. The leader stimulates discussion of the strengths, weaknesses, and problems by
asking the following questions:
• What are our strengths?
• How can we increase and better use our strengths?
• What are our weaknesses?
• What are the causes of our weaknesses?
• How might we correct our weaknesses?
• What causes our problems?
• How can we correct our problems?
The leader then gives his views of the strengths,
weaknesses, and problems of the unit. He clearly communicates what he expects of all his subordinates in
the future. He clarifies the ideas behind his leadership
concepts and methods. He teaches. He addresses constructive feedback from the critique. He explains what
actions will be taken to increase strengths and to correct weaknesses and problems. In summary, he praises
the unit for what went right and emphasizes the area
that needs strengthening.

READING AND DISCUSSION
Reading and writing develop and discipline the
mind, broaden vision, and give experience, insight, and
knowledge that one otherwise would not have. Leaders
270

Chapter 10

should encourage subordinates to read books and
articles that will develop them professionally and
personally.
You may say, "My troops won't read; they are too
hooked on TV and movies." This is simply not true in
all cases. Some troops will not read, but many will if
they respect you and want your approval, and if you
encourage them. Reading has a positive influence on a
person's thinking, values, character, knowledge, and
skills. You have a responsibility, therefore, to encourage your subordinate leaders and troops to read.
There are various ways to get your subordinates interested in reading books that will develop their competence as thinking soldiers. It is important to try to get
your subordinates to enjoy reading and to be selfmotivated to read good books and articles. The following approach is recommended.
When in garrison or in the field always have a book
handy. Make sure it is a good book like The Killer
Angels, or another .suggested reading in the bibliogr,aphy. Have the book in your jeep, on your desk, or in
your rucksack. During breaks or at the end of the day,
be seen reading a page or two from the book. Sooner
or later, one of your subordinates will ask you about
the book. Be ready to explain the book, its value, why
you enjoy it, and how reading it has improved your
performance as a leader. If he is interested, loan the
book to him. In this way you are setting the example.
If your subordinates respect you and want to be like
you, they will read the book. They will then want to
discuss it with you. When they come to you to discuss
the book, you will be able to reinforce their reading
effort. By using the book as a springboard for discussion, you will be able to indirectly influence their
values, character, knowledge, thinking, and skills. Interest in the book will spread, and you will have a valuable reference point for leadership discussions.

271

Chapter 10 ~--------------------------------------------------~

The extent to which each subordinate gets interested
in reading and discussing books with you will provide
you with some useful insights into the character of that
subordinate. You would not want to evaluate a subordinate solely on this one factor, but it is an aspect of
the person's overall competence that may be important.
After you have several people interested in discussing books with you, announce that at a certain time
you will hold a seminar on a certain book. Invite any
interested soldiers to attend and participate. The questions that will be discussed are:
• What was the author's purpose in writing the book?
• What is his main point?
• What did you learn from this book about values, character, professional know ledge, and leadership skills?
What did you learn about the nature of soldiers in battle or in peace?
• What are some meaningful quotes from this book?
• What is your estimate of the value of this book?
• What did you learn from this book that you can
apply to your job?
Announce that if anyone wishes to write a one- or twopage paper discussing the above questions, you will
read the paper and discuss it with the writer.
Give strong praise to those with the initiative and
discipline to write a page-regardless of how wellwritten. For those who write a paper, coach them on
their writing and thinking.
Hold a 1- or 2-hour discussion on the book. Lead
the discussion yourself or develop a subordinate by having him lead it. Encourage troops to participate. Create
an open atmosphere in which debate is encouraged.
Have a recorder take notes on key points. Encourage
everyone to take notes for future use in their own leadership development. Have people talk about the lessons
learned from the book. What lessons are applicable to
improving your unit, and how can these lessons be
applied to your unit? Use the session as a vehicle for
272

Chapter 10

guiding the development of your subordinates and your
unit. For example, the chapter titled "Multiples of Information" from S. L. A. Marshall's book, Men Against
Fire, is a superb vehicle for discussion on how to
improve communication in your unit. Use the session
to teach soldierly values, ethics, character, knowledge,
and skills.
Encourage all your subordinate leaders to conduct
informal, voluntary reading discussion programs. Like
the other programs, the benefits of this program cannot be directly seen. However, you can be certain that
it will contribute significantly to your subordinate soldiers and your unit.

LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT IN THE
MOTOR POOL AND IN OTHER
MAINTENANCE AREAS
Leadership development-developing yourself and
subordinates and continually teaching subordinatescan occur nearly anywhere, in garrison or in the field,
in peace or in war. It can and should occur wherever
and whenever leaders and troops are together. It can
and should be consciously planned and integrated into
all unit activities.
One of the places we often find serious leadership
problems is in the motor pool. Since we work on
machines in the motor pool, we often forget that it is
human beings who must maintain the machines and
implement the complex paperwork systems that support
maintenance. When there are problems in the motor
pool, we often tend to look for technical or administrative causes. But the main problem is rarely the
machines, or paperwork, or the lack of trained mechanics, although these are handy excuses for leaders with
serious maintenance problems. The causes of the maintenance problems are normally human-some leader or
group of leaders not planning, communicating, supervising, or motivating properly. Maintenance problems
normally are caused by leadership problems. All areas
of maintenance, therefore, pose a challenge for wrestling with problems and developing leaders.
273

i'

GOOD LEADERSHIP
IS THE HEART
OF GOOD
MAINTENANCE

The following questions will guide you in integrating leadership development with an improved maintenance program:
• How can you make the jobs of your mechanics meaningful? They often work long and hard without recognition. Sit down with them once a month. Learn their
perceptions-the logjams to effective maintenance that
they know about. Get their ideas on solutions to problems. Develop an awards program that recognizes all
good mechanics, not.just the best. The conditions under
which mechanics work can often cause low morale if
the mechanics are not well led. Keep a close eye on
their morale. Show them appreciation. Recognize their
good work. Give badges and awards to all of the maintenance people-mechanics, armorers, communications
people, chemical people, drivers, and others who are
doing a good job of maintenance. Make their jobs challenging, meaningful, and rewarding in every possible way.
• How can you make motor stables as interesting and
challenging as possible? You have to ensure that you
have a well-planned and well-implemented motor
274

stables program. In units with poor maintenance programs you find soldiers loitering in the motor pool
because they are required to be there, but they are not
doing meaningful work and are not being. well led. One
or two soldiers are working on vehicles while others
are bored because of poor planning and poor supervision. There is no acceptable reason for this. Here are
some ideas for planning, supervising and developing
your people at the same time.
• Do motor stables by squad. Each day emphasize a
different part of the vehicle.
• Each day the squad leaders assign a different squad
member to be in charge of motor stables. Tell him one
week in advance. Tell him he will give a 10- to 15minute class and demonstration on an aspect of the
vehicle. He will then supervise the maintenance checks
on the entire vehicle. The squad leader's job is to provide overall supervision, to observe, to coach, to critique, and to ensure proper maintenance. At the end of
the maintenance session, the squad leader leads a feedback session in which each soldier in the squad gives
honest, respectful feedback to the soldier who led the
session. The squad leader must ensure that the feedback, while honest, does not overwhelm and discourage
the soldier. The feedback focuses on leadership attributes that were demonstrated.
This same program will work equally well for any
kind of weapons and equipment maintenance. It is also
applicable to training. It involves all soldiers in the
squad and develops leadership in them-capabilities
that they may not have known they had.

SUMMARY
Use these programs as guides to develop yourself,
others, and your unit. They have been tried and they
work well. Use your imagination to apply these and
other programs at every opportunity in the daily activities of your unit. If you do, you will reap great dividends in cohesion, discipline, motivation, and overall
combat effectiveness.

APPENDIX A

Teaching Beliefs and Values
This appendix presents an example of how to teach
a 2-hour class on beliefs and values. Other hard-tomeasure attributes are character traits, communication
skills, counseling skills, and the ability to apply the
principles of motivation. This appendix provides you
with an approach for teaching these important attributes
of leadership. When you are teaching, remember that
you must be a living example of the attribute you want
to teach. People learn naturally by simply following the
example of a respected teacher or leader. Role modeling
is the strongest teacher and has long-term effects. In
addition to role modeling, the following approach will
help you when teaching the hard-to-measure attributes:
• Start the class. To gain the interest of your soldiers
start with an interesting, challenging example that
illustrates professional beliefs and values or the lack
of them. Use an example from this manual or another
appropriate example. Then define the terms "beliefs"
and "values" and explain how they have a powerful
influence on a person's life.

• Involve the troops in an interesting discus,s ion.
After giving examples of beliefs and values and defining
them, you have talked for 15 to 20 minutes. It is now
time to involve the troops. Get them talking; let them
debate about the pros and cons of various beliefs and
values. You can list them, or have another soldier list
them on a blackboard or on butcher paper. This discussion will bring out at least one or more important
teaching points that you want to make; write these
down. Let the discussion continue for 15 or 20 minutes.
If it is a meaningful discussion, you can "sense" the
learning taking place. Let the discussion continue if it
is meaningful, and participate in it as you see fit. Your
job as the teacher in discussions is to ask the right
questions to create and maintain an atmosphere where
people are involved and interested in what is being
taught.
277

Appendix A

• Make your teaching points. When the discussion
is not making progress, conclude it with a summary.
Review the important points that were made, praising
those people that made good points. Always encourage
and reward participation if it adds to the learning
climate.
You-as the leader-should then state your important
teaching points. In those areas where you feel there is
a "right" answer, give it to them. Tell them what you
believe in and value and what you expect them to value
and why. Give them the boundaries of what you see
as acceptable. Answer any questions raised by your
teaching points and statements.
In your summary, define beliefs and values, state
the meaning of the values in the professional Army
ethic, restate the main teaching points, and tell them
what you expect from them-including unit standards.
By this time 50 or 60 minutes has passed, and it is
time for a 10-minute break.
• Teach how to resolve ethical dilemmas. Begin
the next hour by defining an ethical dilemma. Present
an example of an ethical dilemma, such as one of those
in chapter 4. Then have a 20- to 30-minute discussion
of how the lieutenant, sergeant, or soldier should handle
the dilemma. List the pros and cons of the alternatives.
Then follow the same teaching process as in the first
hour-make teaching points, answer questions, summarize, and state what you expect of them in similar
situations.
This type of 2-hour class can be of great value to
you as a platoon leader, a platoon sergeant, or a squad
leader. It should create an awareness in your soldiers
of the crucial professional beliefs and values. This
awareness is the first step in really learning these
beliefs and values. They must see their leaders always
living by professional values and that soldiers in the
unit are recognized for behaving according to these
values. Once this occurs, the soldier is well on his way
to instilling in himself the beliefs and values you are
trying to teach.
278

What Staff Sergeant Butler gave Sergeant Boyer was
a verbal reprimand, but it was delivered to teach and
counsel. Anything that is part of the process to get
someone to change his beliefs and behavior is teaching
and counseling.
282

Appendix B

Staff Sergeant Butler's counseling session was

directive. He told Boyer what he did wrong and what
he wanted him to do to improve. In directive counseling,
the counselor identifies the pro bl em and tells the
counselee what to do about it. Nondirective counseling
is helping the counselee determine the problem and
choose a course of action. In nondirecti ve counseling,
the counselee determines his own problem and solution
with the help of the counselor.
You-as the leader-have to determine if you should
be directive, nondirective, or some appropriate combination. It depends on who has the information about what
the problem is and how to solve it. In Boyer's case,
Staff Sergeant Butler had the information. Staff Sergeant
Butler told Sergeant Boyer that his beliefs were wrong,
but he did not tell him to change them. You cannot
order someone to change their beliefs and then enforce
that order. Do not give orders you cannot enforce. Butler
did attack Boyer's beliefs and explained why he thought
they are wrong. He then gave Boyer a significant
emotional shock when he told him he would relieve him
if he did not change his way of treating soldiers. Sometimes such a shock is necessary to start a process of
change.
Butler let Boyer know that he saw his good points.
He told Boyer that he wanted him to succeed and to

develop as a person and professional and that he would
do his part by giving Boyer daily lessons on leadership.
Butler also let Boyer know that if he did not behave
in strict accordance with his policies, he would not hesitate
to relieve him and recommend reduction.
Many think it's impossible to change a subordinate's
beliefs and values, that they are s_et by the time he
enters the Army. But good leaders can and do influence
the beliefs and values of their subordinates. To do this,
a leader must believe that he can. Staff Sergeant Butler
was a good leader who believed he could help Boyer
adopt better beliefs and values about leadership.
283

After finishing thie: counseling se~sion with Sergeant
l)oyer., Staff Sergeant Butler met with Private Mendez.
He told Mendez ·that he was, a superior soldier ·w ith ·the

the healing process ·of the wound _to Mendez's pride.

APPENDIX C

Coininun ication Technique s
T his appendix explains some simple, but extremely
useful techniques of person-to-person communication.
They will help you in your roles as teacher, counselor,
problem solver, and supervisor and as you implement
the programs of chapter 10. They will help you determine the facts of a situation, what people are thinking,
and why they are thinking it. They encourage a person
to talk and to tell you what he knows about a particular
problem or situation.
The technique of repetition is simply repeating the
last phrase of what the person said. It is used to draw
out further discussion. For example, you are talking to
a squad leader about how to improve training in your
unit. He says, "The biggest problem with training is
that we never know what is going on." You simply
ask, "You never know what is going on?" You say this
in a calm, unemotional tone of voice that shows you
are interested. This causes him to continue. He says,
"Why, yes, we don't get the training schedule until
Tuesday or Wednesday of the week before training.
This destroys motivation." This is important information
if you know that weekly training schedules are supposed
to be given to squad leaders and troops 3 weeks in
advance.
The technique of expansion causes the person to give
the questioner more information. Continuing with our
example, after the squad leader says, "This destroys

motivation," you say in an understanding tone of voice,
"How's that?" or "Could you explain that?" This will
cause him to see that you are concerned and that you
want him to continue. He may respond, "Well, we used
to get the schedule and work hard for 2 days planning
the n·ext week's training. But then the training schedule
would always get changed, so we quit planning."
The technique of clarification uses questions such as:
"I'm not sure I understand that; what does that mean?",
"Could you clarify that?", "What is the impact of
The major ideas for these communication techniques were learned from a series of lectures given by Dr.
James N. Farr in 1973, when he was the Director of the Center for Creative Leadership in Greensboro, North
Carolina.

287

Appendix C

that?", "Could you give me an example?" These types
of questions, especially asking for an example, can
result in a clear picture of what the person thinks and
why.
The technique of reflecting meaning involves repeating in different words the meaning of the person's last
speech. You do it in a way that blends with what he
has just told you, and it reinforces his thought. In our
earlier example, after the squad leader says, "This
destroys motivation," you could say, "Hmm, I see. The
planning of training at battalion and company level is
poor and this destroys motivation at squad level?" If
he sees this as the problem, he may say, "Yes, they
need to plan about a month in advance so we can plan.
Then, they need to keep changes to a minimum."
The technique of reflee.ting feelings is similar to
reflecting meaning, but it focuses on reflecting the
person's feelings. It is important to know how a person
feels about something. The ways he feels about himself,
others, his leaders, and his cause combine to determine
his morale. To determine how a person feels about
something he is discussing, say things like, "How did
that make you feel?" or "That must have been disappointing," or "That must have affected your morale."
In the example, after the squad leader complained
of training changes, you could say, "That must be very
frustrating." This response taps his feelings. He can
tell you are concerned. He opens up and says, "Frustrating! It sure is. It's depressing, too. The last minute
training changes since I've been in this· outfit, combined
with poor promotion opportunity and problems at home,
cause me to want out of the Army." Now you've determined that you have a serious morale problem with
this squad leader. Several serious problems, such as poor
training, have been identified through your application
of effective communication techniques.
Feedback is a form of communication. It tells you
what another person thinks or feels about something
you have said or done. Giving feedback and receiving
288

Appendix C

feedback are critical parts of communicating. You really
do not know that the person you are communicating
with understands you until he gives you some kind of
feedback that shows understanding. If you are observant, there are many ways to obtain feedback. The look
in a person's eye often will tell you if he understands
you or how he feels about what you are saying. What
the person says and does in response to your communication gives you feedback on his understanding. The
best way of obtaining feedback is to ask the person to
tell you his understanding of what you said.
In providing direction, implementing, and motivating,
it is critical that you know how to give and receive
clear, effective feed back.
Following are some principles for giving feedback:
• Aim before you fire. Consider the person's situation
and try to express your feedback so that he will understand it and consider it.
·
• Be tactful, but candid, when giving feedback to
seniors, subordinates, and others.
• Be as specific as possible. Do not tell someone that
you feel he has developed a "terrible" plan. Instead,
tell him exactly what you do not like about the plan
and why you do not like it, and then give him your
recommendations.
·
The following is an example of poor feedback ~nd
poor leadership. A squad leader was instructing his
soldiers on putting on the protective mask. Each soldier
had . to put on the mask within a certain time. One
soldier was highly motivated, but he was nervous and
his technique was in error. After this soldier failed on
his first try to meet the time standard, the squad leader
gave the soldier a dirty look and said in a sarcastic
voice, "You are a no go, you are not motivated!" The
soldier was embarrassed. The incident caused him to
resent his leader. What the soldier needed was specific
feedback and coaching from the squad leader on the
proper technique of donning the mask.
289

Appendix C

• Do not use emotion-packed words or tones of voice
when giving feedback. The above example shows the
negative effects of giving poor feedback.
• Give feedback in a manner and tone that show the
other person you are on his side and trying to help
him.
• Give feedback to the person in a tactful way that
clearly shows him what you think he is doing right or
wrong and how he is seen by other people. We cannot
see ourselves as others see us. Therefore, we need honest
feedback.
Following are some principles for receiving feedback:
• Do your best to be objective and listen closely to the
other person's feedback.
• Consider the feedback. Evaluate it honestly. If you
believe it is correct, take appropriate action. If you
believe it is incorrect, follow your own judgment.
• Seek constructive feedback from seniors, subordinates,
and other key people. People are hesitant to give other
people constructive, honest feedback. As a leader you
must be approachable. Show people that you appreciate
their efforts in giving you honest feedback. Do not
shoot or dislike the messenger who brings factual, bad
news; instead, enlist his aid in correcting the situation.
The communication techniques explained in this
appendix can be powerful aids in• Teaching and counseling.
• Solving the problems you face as a leader.
• Developing your unit.
• Determining if your guidance and orders are understood.
When using these techniques, it is important that
you use a calm, understanding tone of voice and that
your facial expressions show empathy and concern. If
you do, you will learn more about the person and what
he thinks and feels. These techniques will also help you
ensure that you understand the guidance and orders of
your seniors.

Leadership _Styles
Leadership style is the maniier and: apprOilch of
providing direction, implementing plans and orders, an~
motivating others.
This appendix explains a thought process · for• Analyzing_leadership situations to determine significant factors and other forces which can either help or
hinder the achievement of goals, missions, objectives,
or standards.
• Determining an appropriate mix of leadership actions
in terms of providing direction, implementing, and
motivating.
·
• Determining lead~ship styles, that is how ~est to
apply direction, implementation, and motivation actions.

ANALYZING THE SITUATION
The diagram shown here reflects the four major
factors and other forces involved in leadership situations.
·

291

This model was explained in chapter 2. Having read
chapters 1 through 10 of this manual, you are now
prepared to add additional forces to this basic model
of the four factors of leadership.
In nearly all situations, other people besides followers
can have a positive or a negative influence on the situation. Also, significant forces such as poor equipment,
poor maintenance, and poor training can exert a strong
influence on a leader's ability to influence others to
accomplish a mission. Leaders must be skilled at continually analyzing the forces in a situation such as the
be, know, and do attributes of subordinates and other
key people. The leader needs the willing support of key
people-subordinates, support personnel, peers, and
seniors. Leaders must be skilled at determining how to
influence followers and other key people to accomplish
the mission.
To determine what to do and how to do it, the leader
must first carefully analyze all the forces in the situation. In this analysis, he determines both the forces
that are for him (forces that will help accomplish the
mission) and the forces that are against him. Forces
for him may include• Well-trained, motivated followers.
• A competent senior leader who is a good teacher and
coach.
• Good relationships based on respect and trust with
key supporting people.
• Good weather.
• Good equipment.
• Good SOPs.
• Adequate time.
• Adequate information on what needs to be done and
how to do it.
• A clearly structured task.
Forces against him may be• Poorly trained subordinates.
• A senior leader who is a poor teacher and coach.
292

Appendix D

• A poor relationship based on mistrust and disrespect
between himself and the supply sergeant or other key
people.
• Internal conflicts among subordinates.
• Lack of discipline, professional values, and motivation.
• Lack of time.
• A high level of stress.
• An unstructured task.
• Lack of adequate information on how to do the task,
These lists are not complete. These are only examples
of the kinds of forces you must identify and deal with
in every leadership situation.
You must be thinking continually about how to
strengthen the positive forces and overcome or bypass
the negative forces. The negative forces are problems.
Prioritize them, then attack each one using the problemsolving process of chapter 7. Get help and advice from
people you trust such as peers, the chaplain, the command sergeant major, and others.
The following kinds of questions or considerations
will assist you in identifying and analyzing the positive
and negative forces in this analysis:
• Who has the information to help me accomplish this
mission or solve this problem?
• Do I know what I must do to accomplish the goal?
Who can help me clarify this?
• Do I know how to do what must be done? Who can
assist me in learning how?
• Am I motivated to do what must be done? Do I
believe that the outcome will be something I value?
The second, third, and fourth questions then need
to be directed at your subordinates, at key seniors, and
at other key people you have identified.
• Do my subordinates and other key people know what
to do?· If not, what can I do to correct this-? Use the
problem-solving process explained in chapter 7.
293

Appendix D --------------------------------------------------~

• Do my subordinates and other key people know how
to do what they must do to solve the problem or
accomplish the mission? If not, what can I do to correct
this? Use the problem-solving process.
• Are my subordinates and other key people motivated
to do what is necessary? Do they believe that something
of value will result · from their efforts? If not, how can
I influence their motivation? How can· I communicate
to them to influence their perceptions? Use the problemsolving process in chapter 7. Also read the sections on
human nature in chapter 6, on communication in
chapter 8, and on motivation in chapter 9.
These questions are only a starting point. Th~e and
other questions will lead to the information you must
have to make a correct analysis of the situation. A
correct analysis is necessary to determine an appropriate
mix of leadership actions and an appropriate style or
approach for carrying out the actions.
·

DETERMINING LEADERSHIP ACTIONS
After carefully analyzing the situation-identifying
the capability and motivation of key people and identifying other positive and negative forces-you are in
a position to apply your judgment. You apply your
judgment to• Determine what mix of 'leadership actions to take
(provide direction, implement, and motivate).

• Determin~ an appropriate style·· to use to carry out
the leadership actions.
Once you have decided what to do, you need to determine the best way to do it. Leadership styles are ways
of applying a mixt~e of the types of leadership. .

DETERMINING LEADERSHIP STYLES
There are three basic styles of leadership-authoritarian, participative, and delegative.
A leader is using the authoritarian leadership sty/,e
when he tells his subordinates what he wants done,
and how he wants it done, without getting their advice
294

Appendix D

or ideas. This style is clearly appropriate in many
military situations. Sometimes people think that a leader
is using the authoritarian style when he yells, uses
demeaning language, and leads by threats and abuse
of power. This is not the authoritarian style. It is
simply an abusive, unprofessional style of leadership.
When using the participative leadership style, the
leader involves one or more subordinates in determining
what to do and how to do it. In this style, however,
the leader maintains final decision-making authority.
He simply gets advice from one or more subordinates
and then makes the decision. This style is appropriate
for many leadership situations. Do not ever think that
getting good advice from a subordinate or using a
subordinate's good plan or good idea is a sign of weakness on your part. It is a sign of strength that your
subordinates will respect. On the other hand, you are
responsible for the quality of your plans and decisions.
If you believe your plan or your idea is better than
those offered by your subordinates, you must do what
you believe is right, regardless of pressure from subordinates to do otherwise.
When using the delegative leadership style, the leader
delegates decision-making authority to a subordinate or
group of subordinates. He is still responsible, however,
for the results of his subordinates' decisions. This style
is also appropriate for many situations.
The style you use for a particular situation depends
on your analysis of the situation and your judgment
of who has the necessary information to solve the
problem or to accomplish the mission.
Under the following conditions, the authoritarian
approach is normally appropriate:
• You have all of the information to solve the problem.
• You are short on time.
• Your subordinates are motivated.
If, however, you have the necessary time and you
want to gain more commitment and motivation from
subordinates, it is wise to use the participative style
296

Appendix D .....,.__________________________________________________

and involve key subordinates and other key people in
planning what to do and how to do it. Under the following conditions, the participative style is normally
appropriate:
• You have part of the information to solve the problem
or to accomplish the mission.
• Certain key subordinates and other people have some
of the information. Under these conditions, it is normally wise to involve these subordinates-get input
from them-in your planning.
The delegative style is appropriate when certain key
subordinates are able to analyze a problem or situation
and to determine what needs to be done and how to
do it. You cannot do everything. You must set priorities
and delegate certain tasks to subordinates.
There will be times when a subordinate is better able
than you to accomplish a certain task. For example, a
new lieutenant on his third day as platoon leader might
receive a task to plan individual training for the next
month. The platoon leader simply does not yet have
the required knowledge or experience. The platoon
sergeant has both. He knows the strengths and weaknesses of the platoon and how to plan and conduct
individual training. The platoon leader, therefore, could
delegate the task by saying, "Platoon Sergeant, I trust

your judgment. You determine what to do and how to
do it. I will approve your plan."
Let us change the above example. The platoon leader
has been in his job for several weeks and has observed
some weaknesses in the way the individual training
has been planned and conducted. He might then decide
to use a participative style to plan the next month's
individual training. To do this, he holds a leadership
and training seminar as explained in chapter 10. He
gets meaningful input from key troops, squad leaders,
and the platoon sergeant. He considers this input and
then makes a decision. His subordinates will appreciate
his listening to their concerns. If they are a part of
296

\
\

\

\

Appendix D

the planning process, they will be more motivated to
carry out the plan. (See the principles of motivation in
chapter 9.)
It is also possible to use a mix of styles in handling
a particular situation. A squad leader can call a meeting
of his squad. He can then say, "I have decided that
we will go to the field in 3 weeks for 3 days of challenging training. During the next hour I want your
ideas on what training we should do and how we
should plan it and conduct it." When he tells the squad
they are going to the field, he is being authoritarian.
When he says he wants their ideas on how to plan
and conduct the training, he is being participative.
Thirty minutes later he may be delegating tasks to
certain people.
In determining what approach or style of leadership
to use, a leader should be constantly analyzing the
actors and forces in the situation. He must ask himself,
"Who has the information and the attributes necessary
to help me analyze this situation, determine the causes
of problems, and plan and implement solutions?" The
answers to this question help him determine what to
do and what style to use in approaching the situation.
Leadership situations are complex, difficult, and
continually challenging. There are no easy rules for
applying your be, know, and do attributes to• Analyzing the situation.
• Determining significant positive and negative forces.
• Determining what to do in terms of direction,
implementation, and motivation.
• Determining the correct approach or style to use in
carrying out leadership actions.
Being a leader is tough, and that is why leaders
get paid more than followers. Leaders should be promoted according to their demonstrated competence and
potential to handle increasingly complex situations.
297

Appendix D ~---------------------------------------------------

The leader's creative thinking and his judgment are
the keys to the correct handling of leadership situations.
A leader's be, know, and do attributes have a great
impact on how he analyzes situations and applies his
judgment. A leader's beliefs, values, and character
influence how he thinks. The way he thinks determines
how he applies what he knows, and what he does. That
is why this manual has stressed the essential be, know,
and do leadership attributes. If a leader has these
attributes, he will have a good foundation for using
his judgment to determine how best to analyze situations and to take appropriate actions. The problemsolving process of chapter 7 is a tool for helping a
leader apply his judgment. Other parts of the manual,
such as the 14 principles of motivation explained in
chapter 9, are also tools to help a leader apply his
judgment and to determine what to do.
The leader must have a quick, flexible mind if he is
to stay with or ahead of the rapidly changing forces
during stressful leadership situations. He must continually identify and foresee changes in the important
actors and forces. As the forces change, he must change
his mix of actions and his style. One mix of actions
and one style may work one minute and in the next
minute a new or changed force is introduced into the
situation and a new mix of actions and a different style
are required. The leader must have good judgment
founded on the be, know, and do attributes. Only in
this way can he successfully meet the demands of
complex, stressful, rapidly changing leadership situations.

APPENDIX E

AssuDtption of A Leadership
Position
Assuming a leadership position is simply one of the
particular leadership situations every leader must face.
Everything discussed in this manual about applying
your be,. know and do attributes is relevant to assuming
a leadership position.
When assuming a leadership position, all your initial
efforts should be directed at• Determining what is expected of your unit.
• Determining what is expected of you.
• Determining the strengths and weaknesses of your
subordinates.
• Determining other key people whose willing support is
necessary to the accomplishment of your unit's missions.
Do not fall into the trap of believing that there are
some techniques that always work, such as observing
for 2 days or 1 week and then making changes. Such

a belief will cause you to miss the benefits of the
thought process explained in appendix D. When you
assume a leadership position, apply this thought process. Then talk to your senior leaders. Obtain a clear
understanding of the answers to the following questions:
• What is my mission?
• How does it :fit in with the mission of the next higher
unit?
• What functions am I responsible for, such as training,
maintenance, and administration?
• What standards must my unit meet?
299

Appendix E

• What policies and SOPs exist to assist me?
• What are the formal norms I am expected to comply
with? Are these formal norms productive?
• What are the informal norms I am expected to comply with? Which informal norms are productive? Which
are counterproductive?
• Who are the informal leaders in my unit? What are
their be, know, and do attributes? Are the informal
leaders positive or negative forces in terms of mission
accomplishment? What is the source of their power as
informal leaders?
• What are the strengths and weaknesses of my key
subordinates and my troops?
• Who are the key people who support mission accomplishment? What are their strengths and weaknesses?
• What are the strengths and weaknesses of my unit
in every required function-such as training, maintenance, administration, discipline?
These are key questions you should ask your seniors.
When asked in the right tone of voice and manner and
at the right time, these questions and others that flow
from them will provide the information you need to
correctly analyze the situation.
It is not enough, however, to just ask these questions
of your seniors. You need to ask these same questions
of all your key subordinates and of other people, like
the chaplain and the sergeant major, who can assist
you. If you have asked these questions in a sincere,
respectful way, you will gain the information you need
to apply your judgment to determine what to do.
The programs in chapter 10 on individual feedback,
group feedback, and leadership seminars are appropriate
to implement when you assume a leadership position.

duty in response to orders, or taking the right
action in the absence of orders. A disciplined
unit forces itself to do its duty in any situation.
Esprit-the spirit, the soul, the state of mind of the
unit. It is the overall consciousness of the unit

carries out this process by applying his leadership attributes (beliefs, values, ethics, character,
knowledge, and skills).

an individual. It is how a soldier feels-happy,
hopeful, confident, appreciated, or worthless,

strengthens courage, energy, and the will to
fight.
Motivation-the combination of a person's desire and
energy directed at achieving a goal. It is the
304

Glossary

cause of action. Influencing people's motivation
means getting them to want to do what you
know must be done.
Participative leadership-style of leadership in which
the leader involves one or more subordinates in
determining what to do and how to do it. He
maintains final decision-making authority.
Professional Army ethic-the basic professional

demand on the mind, emotions, spirit, or body.
Supervision-keeping a grasp on the situation and
ensuring that plans and policies are implemented properly.
Teaching-creating the conditions that cause someone

rewarding, and taking disciplinary measures are
all part of teaching.
Trait-any distinguishing quality or characteristic of
a person. A person demonstrates that he possesses a trait, such as moral courage, by consistently behaving in a morally courageous way,
regardless of the situation. For a trait to be

developed in a person, the person must first
believe in and value that trait. For example,
before a person can have moral courage, he
must believe in and value moral courage. Therefore, moral courage must be a belief and a value
of a person before it can become a trait of that
person. All of the traits explained in chapter 5
must first be believed in and valued before a
person can possess them as traits.
Values-ideas about the worth or importance of things,
concepts, and people. They come from a person's
beliefs.
