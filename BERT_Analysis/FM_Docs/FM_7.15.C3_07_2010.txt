related tasks and systems that facilitate understanding of the operational environment, enemy, terrain, and civil considerations. It includes tasks associated with intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations, and is driven by the commander. Intelligence is more than just collection. As a continuous process, it involves analyzing information from all sources (human, imagery, measurement and signature, signal) and conducting operations to develop the situation. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) 29 July 2010 FM 7-15, C3 2-1 Chapter 2 SECTION I – ART 2.1: INTELLIGENCE SUPPORT TO FORCE GENERATION 2-1. Intelligence support to force generation is the task of generating intelligence knowledge concerning an area of interest, facilitating future intelligence operations, and tailoring the force. It includes establishing intelligence communication and knowledge management architectures. These architectures enable collaboration among strategic, operational, and tactical intelligence organizations in the following areas— intelligence reach; collaborative analysis; data storage; processing and analysis; and intelligence production support to force generation consists of five tasks. (FM 2-0) (USAICoE) ART 2.1.1 PROVIDE INTELLIGENCE READINESS 2-2. Intelligence readiness operations develop baseline knowledge of multiple potential threats and operational environments. These operations support ongoing operations, contingency planning, and operational preparation. These operations and related intelligence training activities enable the intelligence warfighting function to support the commander’s intelligence requirements effectively.

Situation development is a process for analyzing information and producing current intelligence concerning the portions of the mission variables of enemy, terrain, and weather, and civil considerations within the area of operations before and during operations. The process helps the intelligence officer recognize and interpret indicators of threat intentions, and objectives. Situation development confirms or denies threat courses of actions (COAs), provides threat locations, explains what the threat is doing in relation to the friendly force commander’s intent, and provides an estimate of threat combat effectiveness. The locations and actions of noncombatant elements and nongovernmental organizations in the area of operations that may impact operations should also be considered. Through situation development, the intelligence officer quickly identifies information gaps, explains threat activities in relation to the unit’s operations, and assists the commander in gaining and maintaining situational understanding. Situation development helps the commander make decisions, including when to execute branches and sequels.

Police intelligence operations (PIO) is a military police (MP) function, integrated within all MP operations, which supports the operations process through analysis, production, and dissemination of information collected as a result of police activities to enhance situational understanding, protection, civil control, and law enforcement. Upon analysis, this information may contribute to commander’s critical information requirements, intelligence-led, time-sensitive operations, or policing strategies necessary to forecast, anticipate, and preempt crime or related disruptive activities to maintain order. Police intelligence results from the application of systems, technologies, and processes that analyze applicable data and information necessary for situational understanding and focusing policing activities to maintain law and order. (FM 3-19.50) (USAMPS) Notes: PIO function is not an intelligence discipline; it is a law enforcement function. However, it is within the critical intelligence task, “support situational understanding” that PIO best support the Army operations process and informs the intelligence process. PIO are essential to this task, particularly where irregular threats (criminal, terrorist, and insurgents) threaten the security of U.S. forces and military operations. This function supports and enhances the commander’s situational awareness and common operational picture through collection, analysis, and appropriate dissemination of relevant criminal, police information, and police intelligence. PIO are a vital tool of law enforcement and criminal investigators that distributes and focuses military police and criminal investigations assets. U.S. Codes, executive orders, Department of Defense (DOD) directives, and Army regulations contain specific guidance regarding the prohibition of intelligence personnel from collecting intelligence on U.S. citizens, U.S. corporations, and resident aliens.

Commanders establish, support, and allocate appropriate resources for a mission briefing and debriefing program. Conducting battle updates and after action reviews are separate tasks from the mission briefing and debriefing program. The intelligence officer develops a mission intelligence briefing plan and complementary debriefing plan to support the commander’s program. Soldiers receive a mission intelligence briefing before executing a patrol or similar operation.
