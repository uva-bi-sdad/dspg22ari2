Basic terms, their definitions, and their proponents.................................. xiv viii FM 7-15, C4 20 October 2010 Chapter 4 ART 4.0: The Sustainment Warfighting Function The sustainment warfighting function is the related tasks and systems that provide support and services to ensure freedom of action, extend operational reach, and prolong endurance. The endurance of Army forces is primarily a function of their sustainment. Sustainment determines the depth and duration of Army operations. It is essential to retaining and exploiting the initiative. Sustainment is the provision of the logistics, personnel services, and health service support necessary to maintain operations until mission accomplishment. Internment, resettlement, and detainee operations fall under the sustainment warfighting function and include elements of all three major subfunctions. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) Note: This task and many of its subordinate tasks encompass environmental considerations. + Logistics is the science of planning, preparing, executing, and assessing the movement and maintenance of forces. In its broadest sense, logistics includes the design, development, acquisition, fielding, and maintenance of equipment and systems. Logistics integrates strategic, operational, and tactical support efforts within the joint operations area and schedules the mobilization and deployment of forces and materiel.

Internment and resettlement (I/R) operations include the two major categories of internment operations and resettlement operations. These categories are further refined focusing on specific types of detainees and U.S. military prisoners while discriminating between civilian internees included as part of internment and those dislocated civilians (DCs) that may be retained as part of resettlement operations. Internment operations focus on all types of detainees and U.S. military prisoners. Although a part of internment operations, confinement refers to U.S military prisoners rather than internment (U.S. military prisoners are covered under ART 5.8.2). Resettlement operations focus on DCs, those civilians that are not part of the population of detainees. Military police conduct internment/resettlement operations to shelter, sustain, guard, protect, and account for populations (enemy prisoners of war (EPWs), civilian internees, DCs, or U.S. military prisoners) as a result of military or civil conflict, of natural or man-made disaster, or to facilitate criminal prosecution. Internment involves detaining a population or group that poses some level of threat to military operations. Resettlement involves quartering members of a population or group 20 October 2010 FM 7-15, C4 4-73 Chapter 4 for their protection. These operations inherently control the movement and activities of their specific population for imperative reasons of security, safety, or intelligence gathering.

(JP 4-02) (USJFCOM JWFC) ART 7.3.3.8 SUPPORT PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS 7-57. The military contribution to the public health sector, especially early in an operation, enables the complementary efforts of local and international aid organizations. The initial efforts of military forces aim to stabilize the public health sector. These efforts may include assessments of the medical and public health system such as infrastructure, medical staff, training and education, medical logistics, and public health programs. Following these initial response tasks, civilian organizations tailor their efforts to reforming the three public health sector through health systems strengthening and other public health capacity-building activities.

The primary role of military forces in support of elections is to facilitate civil order by providing a secure environment and should not be perceived as influencing the election outcome. U.S. forces should not be perceived as influencing elections by endorsing political platforms, parties, or candidates. Ideally, host-nation government and institutions will have the lead in developing and implementing elections with U.S. military in a supporting role. This support may include assisting the electoral commission in the planning and coordination of the election execution process and augmenting the host-nation security forces, as directed. Overt U.S. forces involvement in elections may be perceived as detrimental to an open, democratic, and legitimate election and taint the outcome. Planning and execution must be consistent with U.S. law, military guidance, and host-nation government regulations. The integrity of the election is the responsibility of the host-nation government or international election commission.

Economic recovery begins with an actively engaged labor force. When a military force occupies an operational area, the demand for local goods, services, and labor creates employment opportunities for the local populace. Local projects, such as restoring public services, rebuilding schools, or clearing roads, offer additional opportunities for the local labor pool. Drawing on local goods, services, and labor presents the force with the first opportunity to infuse cash into the local economy, which in turn stimulates market activity. (FM 3-07) (USACAC) 20 October 2010 FM 7-15, C4 7-21 Chapter 7 No. Scale Measure 01 Yes/No Unit implemented initiatives to provide immediate employment. 02 Yes/No Unit created employment opportunities for young males. 03 Yes/No Unit assessed the labor force for critical skills requirements and deficiencies. 04 Yes/No Unit established vetting program to ensure the reliability of the workforce. 05 Yes/No Unit implemented public works projects. 06 Time To assess the availability of civilian resources for civilian and military use.
