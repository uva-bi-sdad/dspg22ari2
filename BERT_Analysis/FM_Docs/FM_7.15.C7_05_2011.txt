Basic terms, their definitions, and their proponents .................................. xiv viii FM 7-15, C7 20 May 2011 Chapter 5 ART 5.0: Conduct Mission Command ψ ψ Mission command is the exercise of authority and direction by the commander using mission orders to enable disciplined initiative within the commander’s intent to empower agile and adaptive leaders in the conduct of full spectrum operations. It is commander-led and blends the art of command and the science of control to integrate the warfighting functions to accomplish the mission. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) Mission command is the warfighting function that develops and integrates those activities enabling a commander to balance the art of command and the science of control. It is an adaptation that captures what we’ve the Army has learned in a decade of war, including— • The changing roles and responsibilities of leaders in distributed and increasingly decentralized operations. • The requirement for leaders at every echelon to co-create the context for operations., • The importance of teaming and collaborating with joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational partners. • The need for leaders to anticipate and manage transitions during the course of a campaign. 20 May 2011 FM 7-15, C7 5-1 Chapter 5 SECTION I – ART 5.1: CONDUCT THE OPERATIONS PROCESS ψ 5-1. ψ The operations process consists of the major mission command activities performed during operations: planning, preparing, executing, and continuously assessing the operation. The commander drives the operations process through leadership. The activities of the operations process may be sequential or simultaneous. They are usually not discrete; they overlap and recur as circumstances demand. Commanders use the operations process to help them decide when and where to make decisions, control operations, and provide command presence. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) Ψ ART 5.1.1 PLAN OPERATIONS 5-2. Planning is the process by which commanders and the staff translate the commander’s visualization into a specific course of action for preparation and execution, focusing on the expected results. Planning begins with analysis and assessment of the conditions in the operational environment, and involves understanding and framing the problem and envisioning the set of conditions that represent the desired end state. Design and the military decisionmaking process enable commanders and staffs to plan conceptually. Planning includes formulating one or more supportable courses of action to accomplish the mission. Good plans foster initiative, account for uncertainty and friction, and mitigate risks. (FM 3-0) (USACAC) 5-2 FM 7-15, C7 20 May 2011 ART 5.0: Conduct Mission Command No. Scale Measure Tactical planning produced a commander’s decision, communicated an effective 01 Yes/No methodology, and facilitated mission accomplishment. Subordinate unit staffs were able to understand the order produced by the military 02 Yes/No decisionmaking process (MDMP). 03 Yes/No Time was available for plan rehearsal and refinement. ART 5.1.1.1 CONDUCT THE MILITARY DECISIONMAKING PROCESS 5-3. Employ the logic and techniques of a prescribed analytical process, the military decisionmaking process (MDMP), to determine a unit’s restated mission. Develop courses of action (COAs) to accomplish the mission. Recommend the most effective COA. Prepare orders and plans to communicate the selected COA, commander’s intent, and decisions to subordinates and coalition forces, focusing on the expected results.

Transitions often mark the change from one dominant type of operation, such as offense, to another such as stability. Commanders at all levels must possess the mental agility to rapidly transition from one type of operation to another. For example, at lower echelons, transitions occur when one formation passes through another, or when units must breach an obstacle belt. Links between phases and the requirement to transition between phases are critically important. Commanders establish clear conditions for how and when these transitions occur during planning. Although phases are distinguishable to friendly forces, the operational design conceals these distinctions from opponents through concurrent and complementary joint and Army actions.
