It is not like me at all that I live my life in a way that I believe there is a purpose for my life.
It is not like me at all that I live my life in a way that I am a person of dignity and worth.
It is not like me at all that I live my life in a way that My life has meaning.
It is not like me at all that I believe that in some way my life is closely connected to all
              humanity and all the world
It is not like me at all that I live my life in a way that The job I am doing in the military has enduring meaning.
