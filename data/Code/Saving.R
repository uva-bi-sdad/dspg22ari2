              Army perform the duties of medics, infantrymen, cooks, truck drivers, mechanics, legal clerks, aviators, and other occupations.
              We bring fuel to the tanks, scout for the enemy, listen to the enemy’s signals, and close in and defeat the enemy.
              We defend against air attacks, ensure Soldiers are paid accordingly, and process awards to recognize other Soldier’s
              accomplishments. As important as individual Soldier tasks are, we all know that these efforts support a team and that the
              whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Every team has a leader, and that leader is responsible for what the team does
              or fails to do. That is why obeying orders is the critical essence of discipline.", "Variation in upbringing, culture,
              religious belief, and tradition is reflected among those who choose to serve in the Army. Such diversity provides many
              benefits for a force globally engaged around the world. Good leaders value this diversity of outlook and experience and

              the interaction and relationships among team members essential to collaboration and critical to high performance.
              It accelerates collaboration by allowing the team members to further develop qualities of shared vision, trust, competence,

              been hypothesized. Smith et al. (1994) suggested that perhaps communication frequency is indicative of high levels of conflict

              changing conditions. Engages in multiple approaches when assessing, conceptualizing, and evaluating a course of action.", "The success of
              the U.S. Army is related directly to the quality of the professional relationships between its Soldiers, NCOs, and officers.
              The relationship between an individual Soldier, team, squad, and platoon with their NCO/officer is the cornerstone of our Army.
              When that bond forms, it can have the single most important impact on unit effectiveness and efficiency. Conversely, if that bond is broken,

              leads to a higher degree of actionable understanding. Through the dialogue, the team develops shared understanding and trust.
              When coaching a team exercise: Frame initial questions to clarify the task and the situation. There will often be disagreements on both.
              Find common ground. Try to get the team to come to agreement on one issue. Build to another agreement. When there is disagreement,

              moral and ethical qualities, helps determine what is right, and gives a leader motivation to do what is appropriate, regardless of
              the circumstances or consequences. It determines who people are, how they act, helps determine right from wrong, and choose what is right.")
