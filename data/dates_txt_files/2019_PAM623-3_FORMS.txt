2–29. “Relief for Cause” officer evaluation report instructions
If a rated officer or warrant officer is officially relieved (see AR 623–3), the following specific instructions apply to com- pleting a “Relief for Cause” OER:
a. DA Form 67–10–1 and DA Form 67–10–2.
  (1) The performance evaluation box check in part IV of the OER must reflect “UNSATISFACTORY” or “CAPABLE.” An “UNSATISFACTORY” recommendation is consistent with relief action and does not need further explanation. How- ever, raters who select “CAPABLE” must explain their recommendation and reasons in view of the action to relieve.
  (2) The senior rater’s potential evaluation in part VI, block a of DA Form 67–10 series OERs must reflect “NOT QUALIFIED” or “QUALIFIED.” A “NOT QUALIFIED” recommendation by the senior rater in part VI, block a is con- sistent with a relief action and does not need further explanation. However, senior raters who select “QUALIFIED” must explain their recommendation and reasons in view of the action to relieve.
  b. DA Form 67–10–3. The senior rater’s potential evaluation box check in part VI, block a of the DA Form 67–10–3 must reflect “UNSATISFACTORY” or “RETAIN AS COLONEL.” An “UNSATISFACTORY” recommendation by the senior rater is consistent with relief action and does not need further explanation. However, senior raters who select “RETAIN AS COLONEL” must explain their recommendation and reasons in view of the action to relieve. The rating restriction in paragraphs 2–29a and 2–29b does not apply to a rating official who has not directed the relief and does not agree with the relief. However, they must state their non-concurrence in the comments portion of the OER. The OER will identify the rating official who directed the relief. This official will clearly explain the reason for relief in their narrative portion of the OER. If the relief is directed by someone not in the designated rating chain, the official directing the relief will describe the reasons for the relief in an enclosure to the OER (see fig 2–8 for a sample “Relief for Cause” directed by a non-rating official memorandum).
  c. If the relief was directed by the senior rater or an individual other than the rated officer’s rating officials, the OER will be reviewed by the first Army officer in the organization or chain of supervision above the individual directing the relief. The reviewing official’s information will be annotated on the completed DA Form 67–10–1, DA Form 67–10–2, or DA Form 67–10–3 in part II, blocks f. Should the reviewing official provide comments, the reviewing official will select “YES” in block f7 and attach comments. For DA Forms 67–10–4 that require review, a memorandum will need to be prepared and attached to the completed evaluation (see fig 2–9 for a sample supplementary review for “Relief for Cause” memorandum). These documents are provided under the enclosure tab of the electronic OER (wizard application associated with the electronic form within the EES).
