SUMMARY of CHANGE
DA PAM 600–3
Commissioned Officer Development and Career Management
This pamphlet consolidates OPMS XXI changes to the Officer Personnel Management
System. Specifically, this pamphlet--
o  Serves as a key professional development guide for leaders to mentor their
   officers (chap 1).
o  Defines and reinforces the importance of branch and functional area
   qualification in the development of officers (chap 3).
o  Eliminates the separate officer skills and joint duty chapters and
   incorporates that information into the introductory Officer Personnel
   Management System (chap 3).
o  Introduces the Captains Career Course which combines the branch advanced
   course and the Combined Arms and Services Staff School (chap 3).
o  Details the Career Field designation process and the use of Career Fields as a
   management tool and organizes the basic branch and functional area chapters
   by Career Field (chap 3).
o  Details requirement for all officers to complete a baccalaureate degree prior
   to Captains Career Course (chap 4).
o  Addresses the requirement for raters and senior raters to comment on a
   potential Career Field for captains (chap 6).
o  Includes significant revisions to FA 90, Multifunctional Logistician
   Program, and FA 50, Force Management (chaps 28 and 34).
o  Consolidates acquisition and contracting chapters under FA 51, Army
   Acquisition Corps (chap 47).
o  Eliminates the chapters on FA 41, Personnel Programs Management and FA 54,
   Operations, Plans and Training, because these functional areas have been
   deleted.
o  Adds chapters for the new functional areas: FA 24, Information Systems
   Engineering; FA 30, Information Operations; FA 34, Strategic Intelligence; FA
   40, Space Operations; FA 43, Human Resource Management; FA 57, Simulations
   Operations; and FA 59, Strategic Plans and Policy.
o  Includes the new special terms: Career Field, Career Field designation,

well as a developmental experience in many branches and functional
areas. Overseas tours broaden the professionalism of the officer
corps, and assignment managers consider this element of tour equity
in each assignment action.
3–12. Individual career management
OPMS XXI with its combination of branch, functional area, and
branch/functional area generalist assignments results in multiple ca-
reer patterns. Negotiating through this multitude of possibilities to
meet the needs of the Army and the important needs of individual
aspiration is the result of the interaction among the responsible
agents within OPMS: the individual officer, the commander, the
proponent and the OPMD assignment manager. Each has an impor-
tant part to play in the career development of not only individual
officers, but of the officer corps as a whole.
   a. The individual. Officers, in many respects, are ultimately their
own career managers. While Army requirements dictate the final
outcome of all career development actions, in every case the officer
can participate in such decisions. Participation in the career develop-
ment process is possible at the basic branching point, volunteering
for training and education programs, selection of functional area,
preferences for Career Field, application for entry into special pro-
grams like the Army Acquisition Corps, and long-range planning of
career goals. The key is to be involved in career development by
making informed and logical decisions and acting on them. One
important element of an officer’s involvement is the accurate reflec-
tion of capabilities in the official personnel management files main-
tained by HQDA. The official military personnel file (OMPF), the
DA Form 4037 (Officer Record Brief) (ORB), and the career man-
agement individual file (CMIF) contain the data from which impor-
tant career development decisions are made for selection,
advancement, assignments and retention. Officers should review,
update and maintain these records throughout their careers. Officers
should also request periodic advice and counseling to remain in-
formed of career opportunities and to assess progress achieving
career goals.
   b. The commander. All officers look to their rater, senior rater,
and mentors for advice and career counseling. Some counseling is
official, such as the preparation and submission of DA Form 67-9
(Officer Evaluation Report) and DA Form 67-9-1 (Officer Evalua-
tion Report Support Form). Other forms of counseling are often
unofficial and relate to career patterns, advice about assignments
and duty positions. Regardless of the type of counseling, command-
ers should be factually informed before rendering advice. This pam-
phlet contains many of the career development facts that
commanders need to give wise counsel.
   c. The proponents. Proponents design life cycle development for
their branches and functional areas and monitor the overall career
development of officers in their inventories. Logical and realistic
career patterns, qualifying objectives and an accurate understanding
of attrition and promotion flows are vital ingredients in each branch
or functional area. Leader development action plans and life cycle
development models should be constructed to meet overall Army
requirements as well as branch and functional area objectives. Con-
stant communication with the officer population and the OPMD
assignment branches should be sustained to communicate goals and
objectives of the branch or functional area.
   d. OPMD assignment managers. Assignment and career manag-
ers at PERSCOM OPMD are responsible for fulfilling current and
future Army requirements while meeting the career development
needs of the various branches and functional areas. Additionally,
they balance the best interests of the individual officers against the
Army requirements. Career managers can provide candid, realistic
advice to officers about their developmental needs. As the executors
of Army and proponent programs, they operate within the current
policy, budget and legal factors to make decisions concerning as-
signments, schooling, manner of performance and subjective evalua-
tions of competitiveness for selection and retention. All officers
should stay in touch with their assignment managers to receive
guidance and advice on career development.

tour lengths of such assignments will be longer. Officers will have
more time to gain the requisite skills in their branch and their
branch/functional area generalist assignments. In particular, majors
will receive more branch qualifying time and increased stability.
OPMS XXI changes some previous distribution rules which
formerly applied to Infantry branch; officers of the branch who
serve in the Operations Career Field will work either in branch or
branch/functional area generalist positions. Infantry branch officers
who are designated as functional area officers in another Career
Field will no longer serve in Infantry branch billets.
   d. Deploy. Infantry branch officers are warfighters who remain
personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all
times. Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of
readiness or fixed site TDA organizations, all Infantry officers must
be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of
conflict. Infantry officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to
deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests; or as
individuals to support joint and multinational operations other than
war such as humanitarian and peace keeping missions. Infantry
branch officers must prepare themselves and their families for this
most challenging life cycle function.
   e. Sustain. OPMS XXI changes the manner of execution of three
major actions which affect officer career development.
   (1) Promotion. The implementation of Career Field based promo-
tion boards is a significant and fundamental change. Infantry branch
officers will compete for promotion only within the Operations
Career Field, eliminating the double counting which occurred
previously when officers competed in both their branch and their
functional area. Additionally, the percentage of below-the-zone (BZ)
promotions will decrease, and officers will be eligible for BZ pro-
motion one time for each grade.
   (2) Command. Infantry branch commanders (battalion and above)
will continue to be centrally selected for command. All Infantry
officer command opportunities are in the Operations Career Field.
These commands are organized into four functional categories: tacti-
cal, training and strategic support, institutional and TRADOC Sys-
tem Manager. Officers have the option of selecting the category or
categories in which they want to compete for command, while
declining competition in other categories. The CSL will announce
the results of the command selection process.
   (3) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the link-
age between officer development and OPMS XXI. Starting with
captain, the rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer
for the Career Field which best suits his abilities and interests.
   f. Develop. Officer development will continue to occur through a
methodical sequence of progressive assignments in troop units, staff
assignments and institutional training assignments. Self-development
continues to be an essential component of officer development. The
goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly employ fire-
power and maneuver skills in support of combined arms and joint
operations. Development occurs through the Army school system as
well; all officers selected for major should complete some form of

Armor assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities
as their Active Component counterparts.
   (1) Introduction. Reserve Component (ARNG and USAR) offi-
cers must meet the standards for schooling and operational assign-
ments discussed below to be considered fully qualified at each
grade. Because of geographical, time and civilian employment con-
straints, RC Armor officers may find it difficult to serve in the
operational assignments required at each grade to remain fully quali-
fied as an Armor officer. Nevertheless, RC Armor officers are
expected to complete the educational requirements discussed below
and to aggressively seek out the operational assignments necessary
for branch proficiency.
   (2) RC captain. To be considered branch qualified in the Armor
branch, captains must have:
   (a) Completed either Armor or Infantry OAC (MEL 6). (See DA
Pam 351-20, for military education requirements based on the type
of OBC completed and for constructive credit application
procedures.)
   (b) Obtained a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college
or university.
   (c) Completed CAS3 (effective 1 October 1994).
   (d) Successfully commanded an armor or mechanized infantry
company or troop for 36 months (plus or minus 12 months).
   (3) RC major. RC majors must have:

   (4) Battalion or brigade command. To be qualified for field artil-
lery battalion or brigade command, RC officers must be branch
qualified and meet the appropriate educational requirements for the
position (see para 12-8b(1) through (3) above).
   (5) Continuing development. Officers desiring consideration for
key positions in RC artillery units should aggressively pursue posi-
tions that develop essential war fighting leader skills. Officers
should continue self-development efforts to become an expert in all
aspects of fire support coordination to include joint and multina-
tional operations. Self-development should include correspondence
courses, civilian education and institutional training. Officers should
devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their
warfighting perspective.
   (6) Branch transfers. RC Field Artillery officers may have to
branch transfer during the course of their careers due to lack of
positions in their geographic area. When an officer transfers into
Field Artillery, completion of either OBC or OAC and minimum
time in a key position outlined in paragraph 12-8b(1) through (3) is
required before branch qualification is complete. Commanders will
consider the officer’s experience level in recommending which qual-
ification course is required. Commanders should closely manage
branch transfer officers and assign them to a qualifying position
concurrent with enrollment in the OBC or OAC or after completion
of the course. Officers should not be assigned to a qualifying posi-
tion prior to enrolling in or completing OBC or OAC.

officer development, see chapter 7 of this pamphlet.

   (2) Assessment. Officers who complete the qualification phase
report to Fort Campbell, KY, for a 2 to 5 day assessment phase that
includes the following: General Aviation Knowledge Test, Standard
Army Physical Fitness Test, Navy Class II Swim Test, psychologi-
cal evaluation, hands on Night Vision Goggle (NVG) navigation
flight evaluation, and formal military board.
   (3) Training. Officers who successfully complete the assessment
phase are assigned to the Special Operations Aviation Training
Company (SOATC) at Fort Campbell, KY. Officers attend a 17 to
26 week training program known as Green Platoon. In Green Pla-
toon, future ARSOA aviators are trained in specialized tactics, tech-
niques and procedures (TTP) and to the standards of time on target
(TOT) plus or minus 30 seconds using a map, clock and compass.
Depending on the aircraft assignment, officers can expect between
70 and 110 flight hours of training. Officers will also complete the
Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) Level C (High
Risk) training at Fort Bragg, NC, and MD9, Dunker and Water
Survival Training, at a naval facility.
   (4) Assignment. Upon successful completion of the SOATC train-
ing program, the officer is assigned to the operational battalions in
the SOAR. Officers are stabilized for the initial tour of 48 months.
The assignment is processed by the PERSCOM Special Manage-
ment Division, DSN 221-4042/8828, in close coordination with Avi-
ation Branch assignment officers.
   b. SOA career management. Although SOA officer professional
development has been incorporated into the traditional Aviation
branch officer professional development program, SOA professional
development differs in some respects because of the experience
level required to operate in the Special Operations environment.
Top-notch Aviation officers who possess Special Operations experi-
ence are essential to successful ARSOA mission accomplishment.
Therefore, to capitalize on existing SOA experience and reduce the
cost of unnecessary or redundant qualification training, SOA person-
nel managers rotate officers between the operational units for the
160th SOAR at Fort Campbell, KY, Hunter Army Airfield, GA, and
Howard AFB, Panama. Officers may frequently rotate between
these locations during their careers.
   (1) Company grade officers. Most of the 160th SOAR’s recruit-
ing efforts are focused on the company grade Aviation officer corps.
Company grade officers must acquire a specified flight hour and
proficiency level prior to being accessed into the 160th SOAR.
Company grade officers are accessed upon successful completion of
the Captains Career Course (5th year) or company command, or
both. The officer can expect an initial 48 month tour in the 16Oth
SOAR. Within the 4 year tour, the officer can expect to serve as a
platoon leader, battalion staff officer, SOF liaison officer or regi-
mental staff officer.
   (2) Field grade officers. Generally, only field grade officers se-
lected from the population of trained ARSOA officers are pro-
grammed for branch qualifying positions in the Regiment. Unlike
conventional aviation battalions, aviation commands in the 160th
SOAR are commanded by majors and are considered branch quali-
fying positions. Because of the limited number of major’s positions

   (2) Command. SF branch lieutenant colonel and colonel com-
manders will continue to be centrally selected for command. All SF
officer command opportunities are in the Operations Career Field.
Army wide these commands are organized into four functional cate-
gories: Tactical, Training and Strategic Support, Institutional and
TRADOC System Managers. Of particular importance are com-
mands within the 1st Special Warfare Training Group. Officers are
selected for these TDA commands based upon an overall manner of
performance comparable to that of officers selected for TOE com-
mand. Officers have the option of selecting the category or catego-
ries in which they desire to compete for command, while declining
competition in other categories. The results of the command selec-
tion process are announced in the Command Selection List (CSL).
The SF personnel proponent at the USAJFKSWCS closely monitors
the number of commands available to SF officers in order to
achieve branch professional development on par with that of the
other combat arms branches. Selected SMU commands are filled by
a special HQDA board. Officers are selected to command SMUs
generally in lieu of CSL commands, not as a second command.
Selected SMU positions are designated as second commands.
   (3) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the link-
age between officer development and OPMS XXI. Starting with
captain, the rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer
for the Career Field which best suits his abilities and interests. SF
raters and senior raters thus perform a critical function which helps
ensure quality officers are designated into both the Operations and
other-than-Operations Career Fields.
   f. Develop. Officer development will continue to occur through a
methodical sequence of progressive assignments in TOE units with
troops, staff/TDA billets, and institutional training positions. Self-
development continues to be an essential component of officer de-
velopment. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly
conduct special forces operations in support of the war fighting
CINCs. Development occurs through the Army school system as
well, and all officers selected for major should complete some form
of military education level (MEL) 4 training.
   g. Separate. The officer separation process remains the same as
for the rest of the Army.
15–8. Special Forces Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. Reserve Component captain, ma-
jor, lieutenant colonel and colonel branch transfer and career devel-
opment requirements are the same as for AC officers. Due to
geographical and recruiting realities of the Army National Guard
system, lieutenants may be assigned to SF companies, volunteer for
SFAS and, if selected, attend SFDOQC, language training and
SERE training. However, they will not be branch transferred to SF
until they meet all branch transfer requirements.
   b. Branch qualification and development opportunities. Reserve
Component captain, major, lieutenant colonel and colonel branch
qualification and developmental assignments as well as branch
transfer requirements are the same as for AC officers. RC officers
may not find a special forces unit with openings at their grade or
may be ineligible for promotion until finding a troop unit position at
the proper grade. Reserve officers’ civilian careers and other consid-
erations may limit them to serving in geographically available units.
Other options for such officers include duty in the Individual Ready
Reserve (IRR) with possible Individual Mobilization Augmentation
(IMA) Program positions or short-tour positions, Active Guard Re-
serve (AGR) Program positions, or positions in non-SF units. Some
officers may have to branch transfer. An RC officer may branch
transfer several times during his career and may not be able to
follow the normal Special Forces career model.
   c. Life cycle development model. The Reserve Component life
cycle development model for Special Forces officers is shown at
figure 15-2.

each grade, the length of service in a given position is not the focus;
the key is assignment diversity and sufficient time served during
each assignment to develop branch competence. The following
standards should be met:
   (1) Lieutenant.
   (a) Successfully complete EOBC by the end of the second year
(USAR) or 18 months (ARNG) of commissioned service.
   (b) Obtain a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or
university. This is required for promotion to captain.
   (c) Serve in leadership and other Engineer assignments, such as
staff positions at battalion level, for a minimum of 24 months.
   (d) Actively participate in professional reading programs and
continued corresponding studies.
   (2) Captain.
   (a) Successfully complete EOAC (either AC (Captains Career
Course) or RC curriculum) and CAS3; CAS3 is a requirement for
promotion to major.
   (b) Serve in at least one Engineer staff position for a minimum of
24 months.
   (c) Successfully command a company (highly desirable, but not
mandatory).
   (d) Captains should continue to broaden their understanding of
warfighting through enrollment in correspondence courses and other
independent study.
   (3) Major.
   (a) Successfully complete at least 50 percent of CSC.
   (b) Serve a minimum of 24 months in at least one Engineer staff
position.
   (c) Even though not a requirement for promotion to lieutenant
colonel, officers are encouraged to obtain a master’s degree from an
accredited college or university.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel.
   (a) Successfully complete CSC within three years after promo-

meet certain standards in terms of education and operational assign-
ments to be qualified in the Military Police branch at each rank.
Meeting these standards ensures the officer has acquired the skills,
knowledge and attributes necessary for branch proficiency and is
qualified for retention and/or promotion in the branch. At the rank
of captain, meeting these standards is considered branch qualifica-
tion. Military Police branch qualification requirements and field
grade standards are detailed below.
   (1) The most important objective for the RC Military Police
Corps captain is to become branch qualified at the company level.
The requirement for branch qualification is important in that it
ensures the officer is able to lead, train and care for soldiers and is
well rounded in the basic techniques needed to execute wartime
missions. A RC Military Police captain is considered branch quali-
fied upon successful completion of:
   (a) At least one Military Police assignment at the company or
battalion level.
   (b) CAS3 resident and nonresident phases. Captains with 4 or
more years time in grade should be enrolled in or have completed
CAS3.
   (2) A branch qualified Military Police Corps major should meet
the military education level required for promotion to lieutenant
colonel and demonstrate successful performance in any assignment
coded at the rank of major or above.
   (3) A branch qualified Military Police Corps lieutenant colonel
should meet the military education level required for promotion to
colonel and demonstrate successful performance in any assignment
coded at the rank of lieutenant colonel or above.
   (4) A qualified MP colonel should demonstrate successful per-
formance in any position requiring leadership, management and
executive skills commensurate with the rank of colonel.

   a. The Military Intelligence Total Force includes officers within
the Army National Guard and the U.S. Army Reserve. There are
significant opportunities for Reserve Component (RC) officers in
troop units and as Selected Reserve in the Individual Mobilization
Augmentee (IMA) program. The opportunities range from lieutenant
to general officer positions.
   b. All RC lieutenants branched MI will serve in Intelligence
positions within an RC troop unit or IMA positions. They must have
favorable special background investigations prior to attendance at
MIOBC. MI officers should follow a life cycle assignment pattern
of upwardly mobile, professionally challenging Intelligence assign-
ments culminating in senior officer status. Such positions include:
battalion and brigade S2; MI battalion and brigade commander;
division G2; State Intelligence officer; or Strategic MI detachment
commander. Key intelligence positions within the RC are generally
the same as for Active Component. Figure 19-2 depicts the MI RC
career life cycle with key positions.

has precedence, although there is flexibility on the sequence of
assignments. Ideally, CA branch officers should seek assignments in
the following order: team member, tactical support and/or functional
specialty team leader, staff officer at the battalion/brigade/command
level, executive officer, and command at the battalion/brigade/com-
mand level.
20–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
   a. Civil Affairs branch qualification positions. Officers in the CA
branch should serve ideally for a minimum of 24 months in the
following types of assignments:
   (1) Commanders of CA commands, brigades, battalions and
detachments.
   (2) Civil-military operations officers and staff officers, at all lev-
els, in CA units.
   (3) CA functional team and section leaders, at all levels, in CA
units.
   (4) CA instructors in service schools, including joint service
schools.
   (5) Unified and specified command staff positions that plan civil-
military operations.
   (6) Members of CA support teams, e.g., theater, operational, tac-
tical, in a theater of operations.
   b. Civil Affairs branch life cycle. Figure 20-1 displays the CA
branch life cycle with both branch qualifying and developmental
positions.
20–6. Requirements, authorizations and inventory
The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for CA branch
officers. The numbers of CA authorized billets allow adequate ca-
reer progression for CA officers.
20–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Civil Affairs
   a. Structure. The structure is somewhat different than that of the
other combat support units because of its high officer content and
absence of lieutenants.
   b. Acquire. Civil Affairs is the only nonaccession branch in the
USAR. Officers recruited into the branch should meet the prerequi-
sites in paragraph 20-3 a & b and have company grade combat arms
or combat support experience.
   c. Distribute. The vast majority of CA branch authorizations exist
within the TPU units of the USACAPOC. A limited number of IMA
and IRR authorizations in both TDA and TOE units exist for offi-
cers who may be constrained by the geographic locations of CA
units.
   d. Deploy. Civil Affairs branch officers are warfighters who
remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide
at all times. Whether assigned IRR, IMA, TPU or AGR programs,
all Civil Affairs officers must be deployable to accomplish missions
across the full spectrum of conflict. Civil Affairs officers may acti-
vate and deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adver-
saries and to protect national interests; or as individuals to support
joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitar-
ian and peace keeping missions. Civil Affairs branch officers must
prepare themselves and their families for this most challenging life
cycle function.
   e. Sustain. The CA branch falls within the Operations Career
Field. The changes from the implementation of OPMS XXI to the
areas of promotion, command and the Officer Evaluation Report
have yet to be determined for the USAR.
   f. Develop. Civil Affairs officers must complete professional mil-
itary education requirements in order to remain competitive for
HQDA selection boards. All officers selected for major must com-
plete some form of MEL 4 training and all officers selected for
colonel should complete MEL 1 training. In addition, self-develop-
ment is key to all CA officers. The uniqueness of the branch re-
quires officers to develop regional expertise and a foreign language
capability through self-development.
   g. Separate. CA officers are separated from the USAR in accord-
ance with AR 135-175.

   (1) Reserve Component Adjutant General Corps officers are as-
signed to AG branch positions in TOE units or TDA organizations
at ARNG or USAR commands where they perform the same func-
tions as Active Component Adjutant General Corps officers. Their
peacetime duties will be similar to their wartime duties except they
will also include those separate RC personnel management, adminis-
trative and operational reporting requirements unique to the ARNG
and the USAR.
   (2) Reserve Component career progression is often constrained
by the geographic dispersion of units. Often there are not sufficient
positions in a geographic area to continue in AG branch assign-
ments. Planned rotation into progressively challenging branch re-
lated positions by RC commands is essential to producing the best
qualified Adjutant General Corps officer. This includes assignment
between the Troop Program Unit organizations, IRR and IMA posi-
tions. If geographic constraints are such that assignment to AG
branch positions is not possible, officers are encouraged to seek
qualification and assignment in another branch or functional area
required in the geographic region.
   (3) Officers in the IRR may find assignments in Reinforcement
Training Units (RTU), Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA)
positions in active Army organizations, installations or HQDA agen-
cies, as well as tours of Active Duty for Special Work (ADSW) or
annual training. Assignment in the IRR can also be used for com-
pleting professional military education.
   (4) Job opportunities and assignments are the same for both male
and female officers.
   b. Branch qualification and development opportunities. Reserve
Component branch qualification standards are as follows:
   (1) Lieutenant phase (years 1 to 6). The Adjutant General Officer
Basic Course (AGOBC) is the starting point for newly accessioned
Adjutant General Corps officers. Reserve Component officers
should complete the resident AGOBC by the second year of service.
Officers should seek to serve in more than one unit position during
this phase allowing for maximum exposure to the diversified func-
tions within an Adjutant General unit. Officers are encouraged to
actively participate in professional reading programs and continued
corresponding studies.

branch qualification standards are as follows:
   (1) Lieutenant (years 1-6).
   (a) The FOBC is the starting point for newly accessed Finance
officers. RC officers should complete the resident FOBC by the end
of their second year (USAR) or 18 months (ARNG) of commis-
sioned service. Officers should seek to serve in more than one unit
position during this phase, allowing for maximum exposure to the
diversified functions within a finance unit. Typical Finance lieuten-
ant assignments include operations officer; cash control officer; dis-
bursing officer; chief, military pay; and battalion S1/S4. Officers
should actively participate in professional reading programs and
continue corresponding studies.
   (b) Reserve Component officers who have completed an officer
basic course other than FOBC and the FOBQ course in residence or
by distance learning will satisfy the FOBC requirement.
   (2) Captain (years 7-13).
   (a) Finance officers must complete the FOAC in residence or
through the Total Army School System (TASS). TASS includes
nonresident instruction through distance learning, Inactive Duty for
Training (IDT) and Active Duty for Training (ADT). Officers must
also complete CAS3 in residence or through TASS. CAS3 provides
officers training to enhance their performance as staff officers and is
required for consideration for promotion to major. During this

major.
   7. Having a cumulative total of 6 years of Quartermaster experi-
ence, of which 3 years should be in a TOE/TDA troop unit.
   (c) Phase III, major phase. At the grade of major, focus is on the
development of upper level staff skills and branch standards and
successful completion of 50 percent of Command and General Staff
College (CGSC) or completion of Phase II of the new Command
and General Staff Officer Course (CGSOC). In addition, RC officers
may obtain a skill identifier. Developmental objectives for this
phase are as follows:
   1. Completion of Quartermaster branch qualification.
   2. For branch transfer officers who have completed an OAC
other than Quartermaster, completion of the Supply and Service
Management Officers Course or RC-QMOAC is required. Branch
transfer officers who attain a high level of technical competence
through command of a Quartermaster unit, military or civilian expe-
rience or education in a Quartermaster related field, may apply for
credit for RC-QMOAC at the following address: Commander,
USAQMC&S, ATTN: ATSM-RC, Fort Lee, Virginia 23801. This
request should be substantiated with proof of experience and a
recommendation by the officer’s commander.
   3. Completion of 50 percent of the RC-CSC or completion of
Phase II of new Command and General Staff Officer Course
(CGSOC).
   4. Obtaining key RC developmental assignments such as battal-
ion/brigade/group XO/S3, support operations officer, or staff officer
at a DISCOM or COSCOM level.
   5. In addition to the above objectives, officers should further
develop their Quartermaster education. The Associate Logistics Ex-
ecutive Development Course (ALEDC), other U.S. Army Logistics
Management College courses, and an advanced degree all contribute
to the professional development of a Reserve Component Quarter-
master officer.
   (d) Phase IV and Phase V, lieutenant colonel and colonel. Phases
IV and V are in the utilization stages in a Reserve Component
Officer’s career. Emphasis is placed on an officer successfully com-
pleting lieutenant colonel and colonel level commands as well as
serving in key Quartermaster or multifunctional/logistical staff posi-
tions. In addition, all officers should strive to complete their military
education level requirements. The developmental objectives for
these phases are as follows:
   1. Completion of a precommand course when selected for lieu-
tenant colonel or colonel command.
   2. Completion of lieutenant colonel and colonel level command
requirements.
   3. Achievement of MEL 4 for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
The officer should continue to enhance military education through
other military courses. Upon promotion to lieutenant colonel, the
Chief, Army Reserve, and the Chief, National Guard Bureau, select
Reserve Component officers for participation in the U.S. Army War
College Distance Education Course to achieve MEL 1. Except
through an established resident program, completion of the U.S.
Army War College Distance Education Course is the only other
means by which an Army officer can receive credit for Senior
Service College (SSC) training.
   4. Obtain key RC assignments such as command, division G4,
MACOM/HQDA/DOD/joint level staff, and chief at USAR Com-
mand Headquarters or Headquarters State Area Command.
   5. For lieutenant colonels, completion of CGSC is required for
promotion to colonel.
   6. Lieutenant colonels are required by ARNG policy to have
completed CGSC to be assigned in battalion or higher commands
and in brigade executive officer or S3 positions. Lieutenant colonels
with 3 years of time in grade should complete CGSC to qualify for
assignment to any principal staff position at brigade or higher.

   (c) USAR battalion and group command selection. The founda-
tion for battalion and group command qualification in the USAR for
FA 39B is experience and above average job performance. When
evaluating USAR FA 39 officers for command the following should
be considered:
   1. FA 39B related training. The more FA 39B related training
attained the better.
   2. FA 39B assignment history. The officer should have met the
USAR captain and major branch qualification requirements detailed
in paragraphs 27-8c(1) and 27-8c(2). Certain FA 39B assignments
are more key than others. Officers who serve successfully in key
jobs should be considered more qualified for command than officers
who have not. However, manner of performance is the most impor-
tant criteria that distinguishes an officer and prepares him or her for
command selection. FA 39B duty positions that are considered key
for USAR command selection are: PSYOP group S3/XO or DCO,
PSYOP battalion command, PSYOP battalion S3/XO, and PSYOP
company command.

Component officers
   a. The FA 90 Reserve Component officer plays an important role
in the combat service supply mission, as the Reserve Components
comprise the majority of units and personnel in the CSS force
structure. The training RC officers receive prior to mobilization is
extremely important in enhancing wartime effectiveness.
   b. Professional development of Reserve Component officers is
divided into the following four phases from the grades of captain to
colonel.
   (1) Phase 1 (Captain). During this phase, an officer must become
branch qualified. The objective is to attend a Logistics Officer
Advanced Course or Combined Logistics Captains Career Course. If
the officer is assigned to a division or lower organization, then the
officer must complete the Support Operations Course (SOC). If the
assignment is to echelons above divisions (EAD), then the officer
must complete the Reserve Component Multifunctional Combat
Service Support (RCMCSS) Course or ALEDC Phase I (resident).
Officers assigned to a forward or rear corps support battalion may
attend either course.
   (2) Phase 2 (Major). At the rank of major, focus is on the
development of logistical skills and successful completion of the
Command and General Staff College (CGSC) or completion of the
Associate Logistics Executive Development Course (ALEDC) or the
Logistics Executive Development Course. In lieu of these options,
officers may complete SOC or RCMCSS to enhance education re-
quirements. Objectives for this phase are to meet basic branch quali-
fications and:
   (a) Serve a minimum of 24 months in any of the following FA
90 coded positions: battalion executive officer; primary staff in a
brigade, division, group, Theater Army Area Command (TAACOM)
or U. S. Army Reserve Command (ARCOM); support operations
officer; DISCOM, COSCOM, TAACOM, ARCOM or Regional
Support Command (RCS) staff officer; and equivalent TDA or indi-
vidual mobilization augmentee (IMA) position.
   (b) Pursue self-development opportunities. (See each basic
branch chapter.)
   (3) Phase 3 and 4 (Lieutenant colonel and colonel). Lieutenant
colonel and colonel are the refinement stages of an RC officer’s
career. Thereafter, focus is placed on an officer successfully com-
pleting lieutenant colonel or colonel level command as well as
serving in key FA 90 positions. Objectives include:
   (a) Officers are to complete a CSS precommand course when
selected for lieutenant colonel or colonel level command.
   (b) Officers who have attended the Industrial College of the
Armed Forces (ICAF) meet FA 90 education requirements.

these captains are USAREC marketing officers at recruiting brigade
headquarters. They are supervised and mentored by senior analysts
who groom them for personnel related assignments at USARC,
USAREC, OCAR and AR-PERSCOM. The majority of RC ORSA
positions are field grade and they generally exist in the USAR IMA
and AGR programs. Colonel positions are few and senior analysts
should seek branch/functional area generalist positions. Wartime
requirements for FA 49 qualified officers are significant. AR-
PERSCOM manages pre-trained individual manpower to support
mobilization requirements generated by shortages in Army, Army
Reserve and Army National Guard units. During mobilization, IRR
officers are subject to these assignments.
   c. Qualification and professional development. RC ORSA offi-
cers satisfy functional area qualification requirements and become
competitive for promotion when they attend military schools and
then seek assignments in positions of increased responsibility. The
following standards must be met (length of service in a given posi-
tion should not be narrowly construed; key is assignment diversity,
level of participation, and sufficient time within each assignment to
develop competence):
   (1) Captain.
   (a) Successfully complete basic branch advanced course (either
AC or RC curriculum) and CAS3; CAS3 is a requirement for pro-
motion to major.
   (b) Serve in at least one basic branch position for a minimum of
24 months.
   (c) Successfully command a company (highly desirable, but not
mandatory).
   (d) Complete ORSA MAC I or obtain a master’s degree in a
technical discipline listed in table 33-1.
   (e) Serve in at least one entry level ORSA position for a mini-
mum of 24 months.

resident Command and Staff College as soon as practical after
selection for major. Some FA 50 officers will be eligible to attend
SAMS and sister service staff colleges. Additionally, all FA 50
officers will graduate from the Force Management Course at the
Army Force Management School. All FA 50 officers selected for
colonel should complete Senior Service College (SSC), if selected
for resident or nonresident attendance by a HQDA board. FA 50
officers will be spread across all SSCs while concentrating on the
National War College and the Army War College.
   g. Separate. All FA 50 officers will separate from the Army in
the same manner as all other officers.

35–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Nuclear
Research and Operations
   a. Structure. Nuclear Research and Operations officers serve at
echelons above corps worldwide. FA 52 positions exist in Army
agencies, headquarters staffs, joint commands, and defense and na-
tional agencies. The majority of Nuclear Research and Operations
related billets will be in joint and defense agencies.
   b. Acquire. Nuclear Research and Operations officers comprising
a particular year group are designated into the functional area be-
tween their 5th and 6th years of service. The criteria for selecting an
officer to the Nuclear Research and Operations functional area in-
cludes type of civilian degree, grade point average, personal prefer-
ence and manner of performance.
   c. Distribute. After designation into the Institutional Support Ca-
reer Field at the rank of major, all Nuclear Research and Operations
officer assignments will be managed by the Functional Area Man-
agement and Development Division (FAMDD) in PERSCOM
OPMD.
   d. Deploy. FA 52 officers are warfighters who remain personally

to complete mandatory educational requirements. To meet profes-
sional development objectives, RC officers must be willing to rotate
between ARNG and USAR Troop Program Units (TPU), Individual
Ready Reserve (IRR), Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA)
Program, and the Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) Programs.
These transfers are necessitated by geographical considerations, as
well as the need to provide as many officers as possible the opportu-
nity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions. Addition-
ally, there may be occasions when RC officers will be transferred to
the IRR while they complete mandatory educational requirements.
Such transfers will be temporary and should not be seen as impact-
ing negatively on the officer’s career.
   (2) Due to the complexity and diversity of assignments in FA 59,
RC officers assigned to these positions must continually develop
their knowledge and analytical skills. RC officers awarded FA 59
will be offered the opportunity to pursue continuing education op-
portunities (civilian and military), and government internship
programs.
   d. Life cycle development model. The Reserve Component life
cycle development model for Strategic Plans and Policy officers will
essentially mirror that for Active Component officers, except that
assignments will not be limited to one component or control group
within a component. Figure 36-2 illustrates a typical RC FA 59
career.

performed by officers in PSYOP, CA, PA, Military Intelligence or
the Signal Corps. Officers trained in one or more of these fields are
prime candidates to receive FA 30 training and designation as an IO
officer. An IO officer who is unable to find a FA 30 position should
seek assignment in one of the supporting IO disciplines to continue
professional development.
   (5) Active Guard Reserve IO officers will rotate between troop
unit and staff positions within the unified commands, the joint staff,
DOD agencies, HQDA and its MACOMs, and the Army Reserve.
They should attempt to attend the same residence education courses
as their AC counterparts.
   (6) Job opportunities and assignments are the same for both male
and female officers.

model for IO officers is shown in figure 39-2. The model depicts

citizen soldier’s dual role presents a unique challenge in pursuing
such a distinct development program. To meet professional develop-
ment objectives, RC Space Operations officers must be willing to
rotate among Army National Guard (ARNG) and United States
Army Reserve (USAR) Troop Program Units (TPU), the Individual
Ready Reserve (IRR), and the Individual Mobilization Augmentee
(IMA), IRR-Augmentee, Joint Reserve Unit (JRU), and Active
Guard Reserve (AGR) programs. The need to provide as many
officers as possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leader-
ship and staff positions, as well as geographical considerations,
necessitate these transfers. Additionally, there may be occasions
when RC officers will be transferred to the IRR while they complete
mandatory educational requirements. Such transfers should not be
seen as impacting negatively on the officer’s career. The success of
an RC officer is not measured by the length of service in any one
component or control group, but by the officer’s breadth of experi-
ence, duty performance and adherence to the requirements described
herein. Every attempt will be made to assign RC officers to FA 40
or officer generalist (01A) positions. Unlike their AC counterparts,
geographic constraints limit the ability of RC officers to stay in FA
40 positions throughout their career. When barriers such as this
deny the opportunity to successfully participate in the USAR, offi-
cers are encouraged to seek qualification and utilization in another
functional area. RC FA 40 qualification standards are as follows:
   (1) Lieutenant. N/A.
   (2) Captain.
   (a) Obtain basic branch qualification.
   (b) Complete the Combined Arms and Services Staff School
(CAS3).
   (3) Major.
   (a) Successfully complete at least 50 percent of Command and
General Staff College or its equivalent.
   (b) Successfully complete the Space Operations Course.
   (c) Serve in a FA 40 position for minimum of 36 months (to
include space related schooling or training).
   (d) Officers are encouraged to obtain a master’s degree from an
accredited college or university in a space related discipline to
reinforce additional skills required for certain Space Operations
assignments.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel.
   (a) Successfully complete CGSC or its equivalent within 3 years
after promotion to lieutenant colonel.
   (b) Serve in a FA 40 position for minimum of 24 months (to
include space related schooling or training).
   (5) Colonel. All Space Operations officers selected for colonel
should apply for the U.S. Army War College Distance Education
Course (nonresident) if not selected for the resident course. They
will primarily serve as Space Operations officers on MACOM or
HQDA staffs as senior practitioners in their functional area, or may
be assigned to an officer generalist (01A) position.

44–7. Key life cycle initiatives for Simulations Operations
   a. Structure. The Army has no plans to make significant changes
to the structure of FA 57 organizations through FY 2006. There will
be changes to the authorizations of those units based on the restruc-
turing and recoding initiatives associated with the implementation of
OPMS XXI. Other minor changes are possible due to the iterative
nature of the restructuring and recoding process.
   b. Acquire. Some captains will be designated into the Simulations
Operations functional area between their 5th and 6th years of serv-
ice. Other officers will receive the FA 57 functional area and Infor-
mation Operations Career Field designations through a Career Field
designation process immediately after selection for major.
   c. Distribute. Assignment managers in PERSCOM FAMDD will
manage all FA 57 assignments. The National Simulation Center (FA
57 proponency office) will work in close coordination with
PERSCOM to ensure assignments are made in the best interests of
both the officer and the Army.
   d. Deploy. Simulations Operations officers are warfighters who

units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests;
or as individuals to support joint and multinational operations other
than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping missions. FA 48
officers must prepare themselves and their families for this most
challenging life cycle function.
   e. Sustain. Officers designated into the Operational Support Ca-
reer Field will compete within their Career Field for promotion to
lieutenant colonel and colonel.
   f. Develop. FA 48 incorporates a professional officer develop-
ment career plan offering maximum diversity for schooling and
assignment. All FAOs will be trained according to the three-part
training program approved by the Chief of Staff of the Army. This
means that every FAO will successfully complete training in a
language related to the officer’s AOC, earn a fully-funded graduate
degree through the ACS program and successfully complete a pe-
riod of in-country training at one of the program’s designated sites.
The FAO personnel proponent may, in some cases, waive a require-
ment for training based on a pre-existing skill or experience.
   g. Separate. FA 48 officers will separate from the Army in the
same manner as all other officers.
   h. Waivers. Commander, PERSCOM, may waive requirements,
when appropriate, based on the needs of the service and the demon-
strated ability to serve successfully in FAO regional specialist as-
signments. These exceptions will be coordinated with the FAO
proponent at HQDA ODCSOPS (DAMO-SSF) prior to granting the
waiver.
46–8. Foreign Area Officer Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. Reserve Component FA 48 offi-
cer development objectives and qualifications basically parallel
those planned for their Active Component counterparts. Junior offi-
cers must develop a strong foundation through assignments in their
basic branches before specializing in their functional area. For spe-
cific information about the process and pre-requisites for designa-
tion as a Reserve Component FAO, refer to AR 135-11.
   b. Functional area qualification and developmental opportuni-
ties. Even though Reserve Component officers are limited by geo-
graphical considerations, they should strive for FA 48 assignments
that yield the same developmental opportunities as their Active
Component counterparts.
   c. Life cycle development model. The Reserve Component life
cycle development model for FA 48 officers is shown at figure 46-

velopmental assignments.

47–8. Army Acquisition Corps Reserve Component
officers
   a. The Army National Guard and the U.S. Army Reserve have
many Reserve officer positions in FA 51. Upon mobilization and
during peacetime training assignments, officers assigned to these
positions must be qualified to function as Army Acquisition offi-
cers. Accordingly, they must meet at least the minimum education,
training and experience requirements of the Army Acquisition Corps
at their respective grade levels. The Army Acquisition Corps repre-
sents the Total Army, both Active and Reserve Components (RC).
The Army National Guard and Army Reserve contribute much to
our Army Acquisition Workforce in day to day peacetime opera-
tions, during contingencies and in times of mobilization. These
personnel must be certified acquisition professionals. The RC will
be provided education, training and acquisition work experience
opportunities comparable to that provided Active Component per-
sonnel. Differences in Active Component officers and RC officers
will exist. One difference allows Acquisition RC officers to dual
track rather than single track. This will allow RC Acquisition offi-
cers to acquire and maintain professional certification and provide a
valuable pool of deployable assets for contingency operations. Much
of the extensive and detailed career management guidance, such as
progressive and exclusive acquisition assignments, minimum tour
length, advanced schooling and prohibition from TOE command,
cannot reasonably be applied to RC officer careers. Except for AAC
officers who leave the Active Component and join the RC, it is not
possible normally for RC officers to acquire 4 full years of acquisi-
tion experience in uniform. Reserve officers ordinarily acquire their
acquisition expertise in their civilian careers, either in Government
or industry. Granting equivalent credit based on civilian experience,
coupled with recurring education under the DOD financed Defense
Acquisition University (DAU) consortium of schools/courses, will
allow the RC to maintain the professional acquisition workforce
needed to support the Total Army and meet the legal requirements
of DAWIA.
   b. Eligible RC officers may compete for both PM positions at the
lieutenant colonel and colonel level along with AC officers and
AAC civilians. These RC officers will be slated off the OML to
programs that support the RC.

   a. Structure. Chaplain officers serve at all echelons worldwide.
   b. Acquire. Chaplain officers will continue to be accessed into
the Chaplain branch primarily by direct commissioning.
   c. Distribute. Assignments for Chaplain officers will continue to
be managed by the Chief of Chaplains.
   d. Deploy. Chaplain branch officers must remain personally and
professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all times. Whether
assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed
site TDA organizations, all Chaplain Corps officers must be deploy-
able to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict.
Chaplains may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential
adversaries and to protect national interests; or as individuals to
support joint and multinational operations other than war such as
humanitarian and peace keeping missions. Chaplain Corps officers
must prepare themselves and their families for this most challenging
life cycle function.
   e. Sustain. Chaplain officers will compete within the Chaplain
Corps for promotion to all grades.
   f. Develop. Chaplain branch incorporates a professional officer
development career plan offering diversity for schooling and assign-
ment. As Chaplain officers progress through their careers, in addi-
tion to advanced military schooling opportunities, they become
eligible for additional civilian training, which prepares them for
specialty positions.
   g. Separate. Chaplain officers will separate from the Army in the
same manner as all other officers.
49–8. Chaplain Corps Reserve Component officers
The Chaplain Reserve Component (RC) officer is an integral part of
the Total Army Chaplaincy. The Reserve Component, the Army
National Guard and the U. S. Army Reserve, are the majority of the
units and personnel in the Total Army Chaplaincy. Branch qualifica-
tions and standards are the same for the ARNG and USAR Chap-
lains as they are for the Active Component Chaplains.
   a. General career development. Developmental patterns and ob-
jectives are the same for the Reserve Components with the follow-
ing exceptions:
   (1) Chaplain candidates are RC only officers of the staff special-
ist branch with the 00A56 (Chaplain Candidate Program) designa-
tion. Chaplain candidates are seminary students who are working to
establish their academic and ecclesiastical credentials, in order to
seek an appointment as a Chaplain. Their training parallels much of
the Chaplain Officer Basic Course, while providing ministry practi-
cum experiences. These ministry practicums include ministry at
various installations, in Army medical centers, and in the discipli-
nary barracks. Candidates can enter RC or Active Component (AC)
Chaplain assignments upon completing their academic and ecclesi-
astical credentials and receiving an endorsement from their church
bodies.
   (2) The Chaplain Officer Basic Course for Reserve Chaplains is
the same as the course provided AC Army Chaplains, except
CHOBC Phase II instruction may be taken through a correspond-
ence method for RC officers. Reserve Component promotion to
captain requires completion of all phases of CHOBC.
   (3) The Chaplain Officer Advanced Course (CHOAC) presents
the same instructional material for RC and AC Army Chaplains.
However, RC Chaplains take CHOAC Phases I and IV in residence
and CHOAC Phases II and III by correspondence. Reserve Compo-
nent promotion to major requires completion of all four phases.
   (4) The Combined Arms and Services School (CAS3) is optional

Chapter 50
Army Medical Department
50–1. The Army Medical Department description
   a. The Army Medical Department (AMEDD) is a special branch
of the Army whose mission is to provide health services for the
Army and, as directed, for other agencies, organizations and military
Services. Six separate officer Corps or branches provide the leader-
ship and professional expertise necessary to accomplish the broad
soldier support functions implicit to the mission. Specific informa-
tion on AMEDD officer professional and career development may
be found in detail in DA Pamphlet 600-4.
   b. The key to the distinctive personnel management system of the
AMEDD is the six individual Corps, each with a defined mission;
some with missions provided for by statute. The separate nature of
the many disciplines that combine to make the total health care
delivery system dictates some diversity in approach to the manage-
ment of the personnel within that system. The AMEDD capitalizes
upon the diversity of its Corps and is committed to developing and
selecting the very best qualified officer from all its Corps for key
leadership positions. The Surgeon General is responsible for
AMEDD officer career management within the general policies es-
tablished by the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, HQDA. The
Director of Personnel, Office of The Surgeon General, and the
Commander, PERSCOM, manage AMEDD officers with the advice
and assistance of the six AMEDD Corps chiefs and professional
consultants.
50–2. Officer Personnel Management System XXI (OPMS
XXI) relevance
OPMS XXI has significant relevance to AMEDD officer profes-
sional military education. All AMEDD officers will complete the
AMEDD Captains Career Course and Command and General Staff
College (CGSC). Attendance at resident CGSC and Senior Service
College (SSC) is determined by a HQDA selection board. AMEDD
officers not selected for resident programs will complete CGSC by
correspondence or through U.S. Army Reserve sponsored studies.
AMEDD officers selected as alternates for resident SSC attendance
are highly encouraged to enroll in the U.S. Army War College
Distance Education Course.
50–3. Army Medical Department Reserve Component
officers
   a. Reserve Component AMEDD officers serve the same role and
mission as their Active Component (AC) counterparts. The unique
nature of the RC soldier’s role as a citizen soldier poses a challenge
for professional development. RC officers are expected to follow the
officer professional military education requirements as closely as
possible except that RC officers have increased time windows to
complete mandatory education requirements. Current promotion eli-
gibility requirements do not require military education beyond the
AMEDD Officer Basic Course (AOBC) for non-67A AMEDD offi-
cers. However, with the implementation of the Reserve Officer
Personnel Management Act (ROPMA), professional military educa-
tion may be a discriminator for selection by centralized boards.
   b. To meet professional development objectives, RC officers
must be willing to rotate between Army National Guard (ARNG)
and U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) Troop Program Units (TPU), Indi-
vidual Ready Reserve (IRR), Individual Mobilization Augmentee
(IMA) program, and the Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) pro-
grams. These transfers are necessitated by geographical and struc-
tural considerations, as well as the need to provide as many officers
as possible with the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership,
clerical and staff positions. Rotation among components and control
groups is encouraged and assignments to IRR allows time to com-
plete military education requirements. The success of an RC officer
is not measured by length of service in any one control group but by
the officers breadth of experience, duty performance and completion
of professional development milestones. For more information on
typical RC officer career paths, refer to DA Pamphlet 600-4.

Functional area
A functional area is a grouping of officers by
technical specialty or skill, which usually re-
quires significant education, training and ex-
perience. An officer receives his or her
functional area between the 5th and 6th years
of service. Individual preference, academic
background, manner of performance, training
and experience, and needs of the Army are
all considered during the designation process.

A duty position requiring a broad understand-
ing of Army leadership, doctrine, policy,
force structure and management. An officer
generalist position is not identified with or
limited to one specific branch or functional
area, but indicates that any officer may be
assigned to the position. For example, both
