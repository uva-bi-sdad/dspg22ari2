Part One
Philosophy and Management
Chapter 1
Introduction
1–1. Purpose
a. This pamphlet serves primarily as a professional development guide for all officers. It does not prescribe the path
of assignments or educational requirements that will guarantee success, but rather describes the full spectrum of
developmental opportunities an officer can expect for a successful career. This document also serves as a mentoring
tool for leaders at all levels and is an important personnel management guide for assignment officers, proponents, and
Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) selection board members. Its focus is the development and career
management of all officers of the U.S. Army. Officer development for the Future Force should effectively balance
breadth and depth of experience. All assignments are important to sustain a trained and ready Army. The outdated
philosophy of “checking the block” in certain positions at every grade has encouraged officers to be more concerned
about holding the “right jobs” in order to achieve “branch qualification” than about the quality of the experience gained
in each job. The focus of every officer should be on bringing the Warrior Ethos to every job and every facet of their
development. Officers are charged with fighting and winning America’s wars. Regardless of branch or functional area
(FA), they use challenging assignments at all levels to help them hone through experience that they have learned,
through their formal education, about leading and training soldiers. Operational factors—the constraints of time, Army
requirements, positions available, and readiness—all influence the amount of time an officer will need to acquire
appropriate leadership skills. Success will depend not on the number or type of positions held, but rather on the quality
of duty performance in every assignment. It is tied to individual contribution, and related to the individual officer’s
definition of success in the profession of arms. Previously accepted conventions regarding personnel management and
branch qualification no longer apply. Not all officers will be afforded opportunities to perform all types of duty. The
types and extent of duties and assignments are articulated in the following chapters. For this publication, the term
“officers” encompasses warrant officers (WOs), company grade officers, and field grade officers. A warrant officer one
(WO1) is commissioned upon promotion to chief warrant officer two (CW2). All officers are direct representatives of
the President of the United States. In this pamphlet, there are brief descriptions about active duty officers of The Judge
Advocate General’s Corps (JAGC), Chaplain Corps, and the Army Medical Department (AMEDD). Chapters relating
to officer education, general promotion policies, and officer evaluation apply to all special branches as well. The
governing regulation for this pamphlet is AR 600–3.
b. Officers are encouraged to read all branch and FA chapters, regardless of branch FA, military occupational
specialty (MOS), or career field held, because unique and valuable lessons in Army culture and officer professional
development are found in every chapter.
c. This pamphlet documents the 1st revision since the Officer Personnel Management System (OPMS) XXI study of
1998 and incorporates the results of the Warrant Officer Personnel Management Study (WOPMS) XXI of 2000, as well
as recommendations from the Army Training and Leader Development panel studies from 2000–2003. These comprehensive efforts are essential because fundamental change is required for the Army officer corps to lead forces in the
early 21st century across the range of military operations. Current Army personnel management practices were shaped
by both OPMS XXI and WOPMS XXI efforts, and are now referred to simply as OPMS. The OPMS enhances the
warfighting capability of the Army; provides all officers with a reasonable opportunity for success; and fulfills Army
requirements with an officer corps balanced with the right grades and skills. Although a WO personnel management
system has been in place since the 1970s and was further defined by the Total Warrant Officer Study (TWOS) of 1986,
the subsequent studies mentioned above reinforced the need for a development and career management system that
provides for the career development needs of the WO segment of our officer corps. The change to better integrate WOs
into the officer corps recommended in the comprehensive studies enhances the effectiveness and professionalism of the
WO corps through improvements in training, development, assignment, promotion, and retention practices.
d. This revision is the first in a series of programmed revisions to capture the evolution of OPMS as a result of
Army Transformation. Subsequent revisions will add specific features of a transformed Officer Education System
(OES) as they are finalized.

and war. It is the conviction that military service is much more than just another job. It defines who officers are and
what officers do. It is linked to long–standing Army Values and the determination to do what is right and do it with
pride. Soldiers enter the Army with their own values, developed in childhood and nurtured through experience. They
are shaped by what they have seen, what they have learned, and whom they have met. But once soldiers put on the
uniform and take the oath, they have adopted a Warrior Ethos and promised to live by Army Values. Army Values
form the very identity of the Army. Army Values are non–negotiable and apply to everyone at all times in all
situations. The trust that soldiers have for one another and the trust the American people put in soldiers demands that
soldiers live up to these values. These values are interdependent; that is, they support one another. You cannot follow
one value and ignore another. The 7 values that guide the Army are Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor,
Integrity, and Personal Courage. Leaders must believe in these values, model them in personal actions, and teach others
to accept them. Officers require a demonstrated mastery of branch, FA or MOS specific skills, and grounding in these
7 values to successfully lead soldiers in the 21st century. Officer leaders who adopt a Warrior Ethos and a Joint
expeditionary mindset will be confident that they are organized, trained, and equipped to operate anywhere in the
world, at any time, in any environment, against any adversary to accomplish the assigned mission.
1–5. Leader development overview
a. Leader development is the means for growing competent, confident, self–aware leaders who are prepared for the
challenges of the future in combined arms, Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational operations. Future
force leaders must be multifunctional, capable of supporting the range of military operations within the Joint,
interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational environment, comfortable with ambiguity, information systems literate, and capable of intuitive assessments of situations for rapid conceptualization of friendly courses of action. Through
the leader development process, the Army develops leaders with character and competence for today and tomorrow to
be trainers, role models, and standard bearers. Leader development through progressive, sequential, and continuous
education and experience throughout one’s career benefits the Army and the leader.
b. The Army’s leader development and education system trains, educates, and grows Army leaders who are the
centerpiece of a campaign quality Army with a Joint expeditionary mindset. Leader development is accomplished in 3
domains—operational, institutional, and self–development.
(1) In the operational domain, leader development is principally gained through firsthand combat and contingency
operational experience, from lessons learned, and from individual and collective training, assessment, and feedback
from superiors, peers, and subordinates. Operational experience is the linchpin component of leader development from
which officers learn “what right looks like.”
(2) The institutional domain provides standards based training and education that develop Army leaders who are
grounded in an ideal of service to the Nation, instilled with a Warrior Ethos, have a common doctrinal foundation, are
self–aware, innovative, adaptive, and are capable of taking initiative and successfully operating as part of a Joint team
in the range of military operations within the contemporary operational environment. This domain provides training on
common soldier tasks and selected critical tasks, and leverages education and information technologies to develop,
maintain, and distribute training and educational materials for individual soldier and unit use. Institutional leader
development builds on leaders’ operational experiences and enables lifelong learning through resident and non–resident
schooling at Army, Joint, and civilian schools using live–virtual–constructive training as a foundation for experiential
learning.
(3) Self–development is the 3rd domain of leader development and an essential component of lifelong learning.
Self–development is a goals–based, feedback driven program of activities and learning that contributes to professional
competence, organizational effectiveness, and professional development. Individual and organizational assessment and
feedback programs in the operational and institutional domains, linked to developmental actions, grow competent and
confident leaders and result in trained and ready organizations and units. Developing Army leaders to meet the needs
of the Army and the Nation requires agile and innovative leader development and education systems.
c. Department of the Army (DA) Pam 350–58 describes the Army’s approach to leader development. The Deputy
Chief of Staff, G–3 (DCS, G–3) is the proponent for DA Pam 350–58 and is the single DA staff proponent for Army
Training and Leader Development. As such, the DCS, G–3 is responsible for approval and management of the Army
Training and Leader Development Program. To accomplish this, the DCS, G–3 conducts a Training and Leader
Development General Officer Steering Committee (TLGOSC) semiannually to identify deficiencies and recommend
improvements in training policy, strategy, and capabilities.
1–6. Mentoring, counseling, and coaching
a. Today’s leaders have the critical responsibility to develop future leaders who are prepared to meet tomorrow’s
challenges. An essential component of this development is mentoring. The term mentorship refers to the voluntary,
developmental relationship between a person of greater experience and a person of lesser experience that is characterized by mutual trust and respect.
b. Mentorship impacts both personal development (maturity, interpersonal, and communication skills) as well as
professional development (technical and tactical knowledge and career path knowledge).
c. The goal of mentorship is to assist the lesser experienced person in reaching his/her personal and professional

2

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

potential. It is critical to understand that mentorship is not any one behavior or set of behaviors, but rather includes all
of the leader development behaviors (for example, counseling, teaching, coaching, and role modeling) that are
displayed by a trusted advisor.
d. The strength of the mentorship relationship is the fact that it is based on mutual trust and respect. Assessment,
feedback, and guidance accelerate the developmental process and enhance performance. When this occurs within a
mentoring relationship, even higher performance results.
e. Mentoring requires taking advantage of any opportunity to teach, counsel, or coach to build skills and confidence
in the mentored. Mentoring is not limited to formal sessions but can include every event from quarterly training briefs
to after–action reviews to casual, recreational activities.
f. One of the most important legacies that today’s senior leaders can leave on the Army is to mentor junior leaders
to fight and win future conflicts. Mentoring develops great leaders to lead great soldiers.
1–7. Officer Personnel Management System overview
a. Historical perspective. Officer personnel management reviews and analysis have been on a continuum of
constructive change for many years. The OPMS was instituted in 1972 as a result of the U.S. Army War College Study
on Military Professionalism and a follow–on analysis directed by the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel. Numerous
changes in personnel management policy were incorporated into OPMS between its implementation in 1975 and 1981.
After passage of the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) by Congress in 1981, the Chief of Staff,
Army, ordered a major review to examine the impact of the legislation on OPMS policies. As a result, OPMS II was
developed in 1984 to accommodate the changes brought about by DOPMA, including the creation of FAs, dual
tracking and Regular Army (RA) integration. These and other mostly evolutionary proposals were implemented
beginning in 1985. Two years later, the Chief of Staff, Army, directed a review of officer leader development to
account for the changes in law, policy, and procedures that had occurred since the creation of OPMS II. As a result of
the study, the Leader Development Action Plan was approved for implementation in 1989. Over 50 recommendations
representing the latest revisions to the officer personnel system were incorporated into OPMS. During the last decade,
the Army has undergone significant changes with widespread affect on the officer personnel system brought about by
the drawdown at the end of the Cold War and by major legislative initiatives. The Goldwater–Nichols Act of 1986,
also known as the Department of Defense (DOD) Reorganization Act, required the Services to improve interoperability
and provided the statutory requirements for Joint duty assignments, Joint tour credit, and Joint military education. In
1986, Congress also passed Public Law 99–145, which specified the acquisition experiences and education necessary
for an officer to be the project manager of a major weapons system. This law later led to the creation in 1990 of the
Army Acquisition Corps. The Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvements Act (DAWIA) of 1990 placed additional
requirements on Acquisition Corps officers and directed them to single track in their FA. Congressional Title XI (1993)
Legislation placed additional officer requirements on the Active Army in support of the Army National Guard and the
U.S. Army Reserve (USAR). The Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act (ROPMA) in 1996 brought the Reserve
Component (RC) officer promotion systems in synchronization with the Active Army. This legislation established a
best qualified promotion system for RC officers, thereby replacing the fully qualified system previously used and
allowing full integration into OPMS.
b. Current perspective. With an 8–year span since the last formal OPMS review, the Deputy Chief of Staff, G–1
(DCS, G–1) assembled a team of senior field grade officers to examine a series of OPMS–specific issues and
determine whether a general review of the entire officer system was warranted. This OPMS XXI Precursor Study
Group, under the direction of the commanding general (CG), Personnel Command (PERSCOM), now U.S. Army
Human Resources Command (USA HRC), ultimately reviewed more than 60 individual issues. Based on the collective
body of these issues, the DCS, G–1 recommended to the Chief of Staff, Army that a comprehensive review of the
OPMS was necessary. As a result, the OPMS XXI Task Force convened in July 1996 to review and recommend
changes to the officer personnel management system. Consistent with the task of developing capabilities to meet the
challenges of the next century, the Chief of Staff, Army, instructed the Task Force to link their work with other
ongoing Army planning efforts. In designing the personnel system for the future, the Chief of Staff, Army, directed that
the Task Force also create a conceptual framework integrating OPMS with the Leader Development System, ongoing
character development initiatives, and a new officer evaluation report. The focus was to take the Army in a direction to
meet its vision of the future instead of simply solving individual problems. The Task Force concluded that OPMS
should incorporate a holistic, strategic human resource management (SHRM) approach to officer development and
personnel management. In addition, the Task Force called for the creation of an officer career field–based management
system composed of 4 career fields: Operations, Operational Support, Institutional Support, and Information Operations. Under OPMS, officers are designated into a single career field after selection for major (MAJ) (O-4) and serve
and compete for promotion in their designated career field from that point on in their career. The results of these
strategic recommendations, approved by the Chief of Staff, Army, in December 1997, form the basis for the latest
changes to the OPMS.
c. Purpose. The purpose of OPMS is to enhance the effectiveness and professionalism of the officer corps. The
OPMS encompasses all policies and procedures by which Army field grade, company grade, and WOs are trained,
educated, developed, assigned, evaluated, promoted, and separated from active duty. The OPMS consists of personnel

management policies and procedures that assure a deployable and professional officer corps—capable of meeting the
challenges of the Future Force as embodied in Joint operations concepts.

1–8. Warrant officer personnel management overview
a. Historical perspective. Personnel management of warrant officers (WOs) is the product of a number of dynamic
yet disparate systems and events. The present Warrant Officer Program was announced in a DA circular on 12 April
1960. This publication outlined utilization policies, criteria for selection of WO positions, and instructions for
conversion to the current WO MOS system. However, the conception of a WOPMS can only be traced back to 1966,
when a study group was formed at the DA level. The group’s mission was to develop a formal WO career program that
would be responsive to future Army requirements while concurrently offering sufficient career opportunities to attract
high quality personnel. The study group examined all aspects of the Warrant Officer Corps and made a number of
recommendations in areas such as pay, promotion, utilization, and education. As a result of these recommendations,
actions were initiated to provide more attractive career opportunities for WOs. A tri–level education system was
established by the end of 1972 which provided formal training at the basic or entry level for WOs in 59 occupational
specialties, at the intermediate or mid–career level for 53 specialties, and at the advanced level for 27 specialties. By
the close of 1975, the Army’s capability for professionally developing the Warrant Officer Corps had been significantly
expanded and WOs were being offered developmental opportunities not available to their predecessors. In 1974, the
Warrant Officer Division was created at PERSCOM (now USA HRC) to provide centralized career management for all
but Judge Advocate General and AMEDD WOs. In the 1981 DOPMA, officer career management was codified, but
DOPMA specifically excluded WOs. To fill that void, the Chief of Staff, Army chartered a TWOS in 1984. The
TWOS introduced a number of substantial changes including a new definition of WO. The TWOS also resulted in
requirements–based position coding in authorization documents and a training philosophy of “select, train, and utilize.”
The Warrant Officer Management Act (WOMA) was introduced in Congress shortly after the publication of TWOS,
signed into law in December 1991 and is the current basis for the management of WOs on the ADL. The WOMA is
the WO counterpart of DOPMA. It provided for management of WOs by years of WO service rather than total service,
automatic RA integration at the CW3 level, created the rank of CW5, permitted selective retention and retirement, and
eliminated the dual promotion system. In February 1992, the Chief of Staff of the Army approved the Warrant Officer
Leader Development Action Plan (WOLDAP). The WOLDAP expanded upon the foundation of TWOS and WOMA
and provided a blueprint for the leader development of WOs in the Army of the future. The plan contained specific
recommendations on issues dealing with training, assignments, civil education, and other subjects for both active and
reserve WOs.
b. Current perspective. In 2000, the Chief of Staff, Army chartered the Army Training and Leader Development
Panel (ATLDP) to conduct a series of studies to recommend changes to leader development education for all segments
of the Army. The WO study by this panel developed a further revision of the TWOS definition of WOs for the Future
Force as—“The WO of the Future Force is a self–aware and adaptive technical expert, combat leader, trainer, and
advisor. Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the WO administers, manages,
maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment across the full range of Army operations. Warrant
officers are innovative integrators of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident warfighters, and developers of
specialized teams of soldiers. They support a wide range of Army missions throughout their careers.” This new
definition is relevant today and will remain so for the Future Force. The WO specific component of OPMS features—
(1) A structure that optimizes WO utilization and provides sustainable inventories.
(2) An acquisition program to access quality candidates in sufficient numbers, with appropriate requisite background
and skills, and at the appropriate time in the candidates’ careers.
(3) Clearly defined WO personnel policies and professional development requirements.
(4) A means to maintain WOs’ technical expertise on current and new systems in their units.
(5) Distribution of the right WO to the right place at the right time. Building on the long history of WO service to
the country, the WO component of OPMS provides the mechanisms for professional development and appropriate
personnel management for WOS throughout their careers.
c. Purpose. The purpose of the WO component of OPMS is to enhance the effectiveness and professionalism of the
WO corps while thoroughly integrating management practices and leader development education within the larger field
and company grade officer corps. The OPMS encompasses all policies and procedures by which Army WOs are
procured, trained, educated, developed, assigned, evaluated, promoted and separated from active duty. The OPMS
assures a deployable, professional WO corps capable of meeting the challenges of the Future Force.
d. Coordination. The personnel proponents provide guidelines concerning career patterns and leader development.
The coordinating agency for Active Army WOs is USA HRC, ATTN: AHRC–OPW, 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria

1–9. Force Stabilization and career development
a. General. Force Stabilization manning practices and policies will be the cornerstone of a modular Future Force
with a Joint expeditionary mindset. The Force Stabilization approach to manning will provide increased levels of
readiness and combat effectiveness for Army units by implementing several personnel turbulence reducing manning
methods. It will reduce moves, stabilize, and provide predictability for soldiers and families. It provides the basis for
synchronizing the soldier’s life cycle to the unit’s operational cycle.
b. Strategies. The Force Stabilization process will be based on 2 primary manning strategies— unit focused stability
(UFS) (including life cycle and cyclic methods) and stabilization (includes individual replacement system). The
individual replacement system will continue to exist, to some extent, to meet Army Transformation personnel goals,
and retain flexibility and sustainability for units with a constant mission requirement.
(1) Unit focused stability. This consists of 2 stabilization methods; life cycle and cyclic. Cyclic management is a
combination of the advantages of the individual replacement system and life cycle management.
(a) Life cycle management. Units will initiate life cycle management as designated by the DCS, G–3 implementation
timeline. Life cycle manning synchronizes soldier assignments with the unit’s operational cycle. Goals of this manning
method are to build better trained and cohesive units and to maximize a unit’s readiness and deployability during its
ready phase. Total optimal cycle length is 36 months.
1. There are 3 phases in a life cycle— reset, train, and ready. The reset phase is the conclusion of the current life
cycle and initiation of a subsequent iteration. It will last approximately 2 months. During the reset phase incoming and
outgoing personnel simultaneously conduct transition activities (HHG, CIF, in/out process, property and equipment
transfer, and so forth). In the train phase, life cycle units conduct a specified period of focused training from individual
through collective, culminating with a validation exercise at a Combat Training Center (CTC) or a Major Readiness
Exercise (MRE) in a local training area. The ready phase marks an approximately 2 year period in which a unit is
available for employment. During this phase a unit can be scheduled for Deployment Ready Brigade (DRB) type
missions and incorporated into the Division’s Personnel, Tasking, and Training Management System (PTTMS), which
outlines red, amber, and green cycles. Individual and collective level sustainment training continues throughout the
ready phase.
2. Officers assigned to a life cycle management unit will be synchronized to arrive during the reset phase of the unit
operational cycle. For the remainder of the unit’s operational cycle, officers will remain in the unit, training and
preparing for war, deployment, or any expeditionary requirement. The unit commander is responsible for repositioning
officers to appropriate leadership positions, as required.
3. In life cycle units, most losses are replaced in an annual replacement package. Critical losses are replaced using
individual replacements in a specific grade and MOS to cover the loss of personnel in unique positions limited to 10
percent of the authorizations.
4. Promotions will not automatically alter positions. For example, there is nothing inherently wrong with a captain
(CPT) (O–3) who performs as a company executive officer. If promotion causes the officer to be excess to authorized
positions of the unit, the officer will remain in the assignment until the conclusion of the unit life cycle. Such action
will not be considered negatively when determining the officer’s future potential for promotion. The unit commander
may reassign the officer anywhere inside the unit to best accomplish the unit’s missions.
5. Junior officers who are branch detailed and assigned to a life cycle managed unit are not eligible to transition to
their controlling branch or attend the transition course until the reset phase of that unit.
6. Battalion/brigade command tour length will coincide with the length of assignment in life cycle managed units.
7. Officer attendance at military leader development courses is preferred will be deferred to occur during the reset
phase. Commanders may send officers to these courses in a TDY and return status during the ready phase when it does
not conflict with operational requirements.
(b) Cyclic management. Cyclic management is focused on headquarters elements above brigade level and low
density/high impact units where continuity of operations is paramount. The goals of cyclic management are to
synchronize the soldier’s assignment to the operational cycle of the unit, increasing unit readiness and enhancing
cohesion while retaining flexibility in personnel management. Cyclic management consists of 2 phases, a sustain phase
and a ready phase. During the 1–2 month duration of the sustain phase, leader and soldier assignments are organized
into personnel replacement packages synchronized to arrive within this short phase. The ready phase begins at the end
of one sustain phase and continues approximately 10 months to the beginning of the subsequent sustain phase. New
personnel are rapidly integrated into the team as this integration only occurs once per cycle. Total cycle optimum
length is 12 months.
1. Officers assigned to a cyclic–managed unit are synchronized to arrive at the beginning of the sustain phase of the
unit operational cycle. Each officer assigned to this unit remains in the unit for their stabilized tour, which is a multiple
of the cycle lengths. Officers will depart during the sustain phase at completion of their 36 month tour but prior to the

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

5

unit preparing for its next ready phase. In a cyclic–managed unit, losses are replaced using individual replacements in a
specific grade and MOS to replace the loss of personnel in critical positions. Promotion eligibility windows will be
considered in assignments to cyclic–managed units. If promotion timing causes officers to be excess to the authorized
positions of the unit, the officer will remain in the unit until the next sustain phase. Officers will not be penalized for
working temporarily in a position below their current rank. Movement of personnel within the cyclic–managed unit is
at the discretion of the unit commander.
2. Junior officers who are branch detailed and assigned to a cyclic–managed unit are not eligible to transition to
their controlling branch or attend the transition course until the sustain phase of that unit.
3. Battalion/brigade command tour length policy does not require adjustment for cyclic–managed units. Changes of
command will be synchronized to occur during a sustain phase.
4. Officer attendance at military professional development courses is preferred during the sustain phase. Commanders may send officers to these courses in a temporary duty (TDY) and return at anytime except during an operational
deployment.
(2) Stabilization. The stabilization strategy is a set of policy and regulatory constraints, overlaid on the existing
personnel system, that provide for longer initial tours at selected major continental United States (CONUS) locations.
The goal is to stabilize soldiers and families for as long as possible, moving them only to support requirements based
upon needs of the Army, leader development, and soldier preference. Stabilization through company level assignments
would optimize cohesion within the units. Soldiers attend professional development courses such as the Captain’s
Career Course and return to their stabilization unit whenever possible. Following this initial “extended” tour, leaders,
when appropriate, will serve repetitive assignments at their stabilized installation or region unless they are required to
depart for professional development or institutional Army requirements.
(a) Stabilization will initially begin at CONUS installations which house Table of Organization and Equipment
(TO&E) maneuver combat brigades. Expansion to other installations will be based on those installation’s capabilities to
sustain junior officers for a complete extended initial tour. Junior officers initially assigned to a CONUS installation
will be stabilized at this first installation for an extended period of time that allows for branch development at the grade
of CPT. This initial extended tour may include hardship tours or attendance at leader development schools (TDY or
permanent change of station (PCS)), but in each case the officer will return to their stabilization installation. Filling life
cycle units may require officers to attend leader development schools and PCS to a different installation.
(b) The length of battalion/brigade command tours is under review.
(c) The commander, in consultation with HRC, will have greater influence over procedures in selection and
attendance for officer personnel at military schools. However, officers will not normally attend military schools under
conditions that will permanently remove them from their stabilization unit prior to branch development assignments as
a CPT.
(d) Stabilization supports transition to UFS and will generally be established first. A unit designated for management under either concept of UFS will still fall under the stabilization of the parent installation.
c. Manning. The Force Stabilization system of manning methods will set conditions for commanders to build highly
cohesive combat teams for the combatant commander’s use. These methods will assist both the Army and unit
commanders with management of external and internal personnel turbulence. External turbulence refers to personnel
moves into or out of the unit–under–consideration determined and managed by HQDA. The unit commander manages
internal turbulence involving personnel moves within the unit–under–consideration. Under Force Stabilization, the unit
manages internal moves within subunits and between subunits to meet both needs of the unit and officer development
on that installation. The brigade and battalion–level command teams must consider these factors when seeking the right
balance between leader development needs of officers and mission needs. As our Force Stabilization manning systems
continue to evolve, further detailed information will be accessible through HRC web resources.
1–10. Officer Evaluation System overview
a. The Officer Evaluation System supports OPMS by identifying those officers best qualified for advancement and
assignment to positions of increased responsibility. It includes assessments of officer performance and potential in their
organizational duty environment, their military and civilian academic environments, and by a DA review process.
b. The Officer Evaluation Reporting System (OERS) is a subsystem of officer evaluations. The primary function of
OERS is to provide information from the organizational chain of command to be used by HQDA for officer personnel
decisions. This critical information is documented on the DA Form 67–9 (Officer Evaluation Report) (OER) and the
DA Form 1059 (Service School Academic Evaluation Report) (AER). The information contained on these evaluation
reports is correlated with the Army’s needs and individual officer qualifications to provide the basis for officer
personnel actions such as promotion, career field designation, retention in grade, elimination, retention on active duty,
reduction in force, command and project manager designation, school selection, and assignment. An equally important
function of the OERS is to encourage the professional development of the officer corps through structured performance

6

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

and developmental assessment and counseling. The OERS is an important tool for leaders and mentors to counsel
officers on the values, attributes, skills and actions necessary to improve performance.

Chapter 2
Officer Leader Development
2–1. Leader development process
The 3 domains of leader development— institutional training, operational assignments and self–development— define
and engage a continuous cycle of education, training, selection, experience, assessment, feedback, reinforcement, and
evaluation. Learning, experience, and feedback provide the basis for professional growth. Throughout their Army
careers, leaders develop steadily as this cycle repeats in a logical, progressive, and continuous sequence. Successful
platoon leaders, for instance, often become key staff officers, and then continue schooling and assignments that further
prepare them for company command. Overall, the leader development process enhances leader capabilities so leaders
can assume positions of greater responsibility. The over–arching priority of the leader development process is to
develop self–aware and adaptive leaders of character and competence who act to achieve decisive results and who
understand and are able to exploit the full potential of current and future Army doctrine.
2–2. Domains of leader development
a. Institutional training. The institutional Army (schools and training centers) is the foundation for lifelong learning.
During institutional training, leaders learn the knowledge, skills, and attributes essential to high–quality leadership
while training to perform critical tasks. When these leadership dimensions are tested, reinforced, and strengthened by
follow–on operational assignments and meaningful self–development programs, leaders attain and sustain true competency in the profession of arms. Institutional training provides the solid foundation upon which all future development
rests. Institutional training provides the progressive, sequential education and training required to develop branch/FA
technical and tactical competencies as well as the core dimensions of leadership. The bedrock of institutional training at
all levels among company grade, field grade and WOs is taught in the small group instructional (SGI) format where
greater emphasis is placed on an individual student officer’s contribution to and participation in the learning process.
b. Operational assignments. Operational assignments constitute the 2nd domain of leader development. Upon
completion of institutional training, leaders are ideally assigned to operational positions. This operational experience
provides them the opportunity to use, hone, and build on what they learned through the formal education process.
Experience gained through on–the–job training in a variety of challenging assignments and additional duties prepares
officers to lead and train soldiers, both in garrison and ultimately in combat. The commander or leader in the unit plays
a significant and instrumental role in this area. Commanders and other senior leaders are particularly responsible for
mentoring, which is vital to the development of junior officers. They introduce the officer to their unit and establish
leader development programs. They explain both unit and individual performance standards, and provide periodic
assessments and continual feedback to develop the officer. Beyond accomplishing the mission on a daily basis,
developing subordinate leaders is a professional responsibility, which must be carried out to guarantee the quality of
future leaders.
c. Self–development. Learning is a lifelong process. Institutional training and operational assignments alone do not
ensure that Army officers attain and sustain the degree of competency needed to perform their varied missions. The
profession of arms requires comprehensive self–study and training. Leaders must commit to a lifetime of professional
and personal growth to stay at the cutting edge of their profession. They must keep pace with changing operational
requirements, new technologies, common weapons platforms, and evolving doctrines. Every officer is responsible for
his or her own self–development. Self–assessment and taking appropriate remedial or reinforcing action is critical to a
leader’s success. Self–development programs include activities that stretch the individual beyond the demands of
on–the–job or institutional training. Self–development, consisting of individual study, research, professional reading,
practice, and self–assessment is accomplished via numerous means (that is, studying, observing, and experiencing) and
is consistent with an officer’s personal self–development action plan and professional goals. Self–development is the
key aspect of individual officer qualification that solidifies the Army leader development process.
2–3. Leader development studies and principles
a. The 2003 Army Vision and Joint Vision 2020 introduce new and challenging leader development opportunities
for the 21st century officer corps. Consistent with these efforts, significant OPMS studies in 1971 and 1984, the OPMS
XXI study beginning in 1996, the WOPMS XXI study beginning in 1999, and the ATLDP studies from 2000 to 2003
have reviewed and updated the officer personnel system to ensure it remains responsive to evolving needs and future
challenges.
b. The OPMS XXI Task Force was formed in 1996 to assess the viability of the officer personnel system and in
1997 recommended nearly 100 changes in the way officers should be managed, developed, and promoted in the future.
The follow–on WOPMS XXI Study Group, formed in 1999, assessed WO development and management required to

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

7

support Army Transformation through this century. Finally, the ATLDP studies identified additional recommended
changes to officer education and leader development for the Future Force. These changes, many of which are outlined
in this pamphlet, are essential to developing an officer corps with the appropriate character and competencies to
respond to evolving challenges.
c. Six principles were inherent in these studies and are tenets of officer development and career management. These
principles serve as a frame of reference for the individual officer, commander, mentor, and branch and FA proponents.
(1) Leader development is doctrinally based with FM 1–0, providing the foundation for warfighting doctrine. It
articulates the constitutional and legal basis for being, the national security objectives, the spectrum of warfare, and
beliefs concerning the profession of arms to include the professional Army ethic and values. FM 3–0 is the keystone
warfighting doctrine for subordinate and tactical level doctrine, professional education, and individual and unit training.
FM 7–0 tells how you should train, including the senior leader’s role. FM 22–100 outlines the core dimensions of
leadership and the basis for leadership excellence. Together, these references provide the foundation needed to develop
competent, confident leaders capable of assuming positions of greater responsibility and create the conditions for
sustained organizational success.
(2) Leader development programs should be responsive to the environment, including such factors as law, policy,
resources, force structure, world situation, technology, and professional development.
(3) An officer’s success should be measured in terms of contribution. An officer’s professional goals are directly
related to his or her own definition of success in the profession of arms.
(4) High quality soldiers deserve high quality leaders. This principle is the heart of leader development and breathes
life into all aspects of the 7 Army fundamental imperatives—training, force mix, doctrine, modern equipment, quality
people, leader development, and facilities.
(5) We recognize as a philosophy that leaders can be developed. While a principle in itself, it is inextricably linked
to the philosophy of shared responsibilities among the individual leaders; the schoolhouses, branches and FA proponents throughout the Army; and the commanders in the field.
(6) Leader development is cooperative and holistic. The individual officer, unit commanders, mentors, and Army
educational institutions all share in the responsibility for developing leaders at every level.
2–4. Leader development and the Officer Education System
a. Company and field grade officers. The OES prepares company and field grade officers for increased responsibilities and successful performance at the next higher level. Its goal is to produce a broad based corps of leaders who
possess the necessary values, attributes, and skills to perform their duties and serve the Nation. These leaders must
know how the Army runs and demonstrate confidence, integrity, critical judgment, and responsibility while operating
in an environment of complexity, ambiguity, and rapid change. To build effective teams capable of supporting Joint
and multinational operations in this environment, they must be adaptable, creative, and bold amid continuous organizational and technological change. The evolution of the OES for the Future Force and changes on the near horizon are
discussed in chapter 4.
(1) Common core. Common core is the consolidation of common skills training and training subjects prescribed by
law, Army regulations, or other higher authority. These subjects comprise the tasks all officers are expected to perform
successfully, regardless of branch. Common core instruction begins at precommissioning and continues at each
educational level. The instruction is progressive and sequential, building upon the skills and knowledge acquired
through previous training and operational assignments.
(2) Entry level officer training: Officer Basic Course and Basic Officer Leader Course. To address shortcomings
identified by the ATLDP (officer) study, the Army is currently transitioning from the traditional Officer Basic Course
(OBC) to the Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC). The objective of BOLC is to develop technically competent and
confident platoon leaders, regardless of branch, who are grounded in leadership, basic technical and tactical skill
proficiency, physically and mentally strong, and embody the Warrior Ethos. To achieve this objective, BOLC capitalizes on experience–based training, logically structured to build upon and reinforce previous lessons. The BOLC occurs
in 3 phases. The BOLC I is precommissioning training conducted by the traditional precommissioning sources. It
provides the foundation of common core skills, knowledge, and attributes desired of all newly commissioned lieutenants (LTs). The BOLC II is a common block of instruction designed to further develop all new Army LTs into
competent small unit leaders with a common warfighting focus and Warrior Ethos. The BOLC III consists of
branch–specific technical and tactical training conducted at branch school locations (see para 4–2b(1)).
(3) Captains’ Officer Education System. The Army’s program of formal education for CPTs is under review and
will change as part of OES transformation. The review has already resulted in termination of CAS3 for Active Army
officers and transfer of the CAS3 Program of Instruction (POI) into existing OAC and Advanced Distributed Learning
(ADL) POI. The future CPTs’ OES is still evolving, will continue to have a branch and combined arms focus, and will
be linked to the next duty assignment.
(4) Intermediate Level Education. The Intermediate Level Education (ILE), previously known as the Command and
Staff Officer Course is the Army’s current means for training and educating officers to prepare them for duty in field
grade command and staff positions. Based on recommendations from the ATLDP (officer), the Army transitioned to

8

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

ILE for all field grades. With full implementation in fiscal year (FY) 2005, ILE provides a quality resident education
for all new field grade officers to prepare them for their next 10 years of service. The ILE consists of a common core
of operational instruction offered to all Army Competitive Category (ACC) and special branch officers, with additional
tailored education opportunities linked to the requirements of the officer’s branch or FA. It is designed to produce
officers with a Warrior Ethos who are grounded in warfighting doctrine, and who have the technical, tactical, and
leadership competencies to be successful at more senior levels in their respective career fields (see para 4–2b(3)).
(5) Senior Service College. The SSC provides senior level professional military education and leader development
training. The Army’s SSC, the Army War College (AWC), prepares military, civilian and international leaders to
assume strategic leadership responsibilities in military or national security organizations. It educates students about
employment of the U.S. Army as part of a unified, Joint or multinational force in support of the national military
strategy; researches operational and strategic issues; and, conducts outreach programs that benefit the Nation (see para
4–7e).
b. Warrant officers.
(1) The WOLDAP was approved by the Chief of Staff of the Army on 27 February 1992 and laid the basis for the
Warrant Officer Education System. The WOLDAP was a total Army plan designed to ensure WOs were appointed,
trained, and used to a single standard. Key provisions of WOLDAP included—
(a) An accession goal of 8 years or less time in service for WO candidates.
(b) Establishment of a comprehensive WO education system.
(c) Conditional appointment to WO1 upon successful completion of WO candidate school.
(d) Civilian education goals of an associate’s degree prior to eligibility for promotion to CW3 and a bachelor’s
degree prior to eligibility for promotion to CW4.
(e) Establishment of the Warrant Officer Career Center (WOCC).
(f) Pinpoint assignments for CW5s.
(2) The ATLDP warrant officer study recommended that the Army make a fuller integration of WOs into the larger
officer corps. In recognition of expanding leadership roles for WOs in the Future Force, the study called for a single
world–class leader development education system that would have distinct components for WO, company grade, and
field grade officers. The study also called for combining WO, company grade, and field grade officer training, as
appropriate, wherever required common officer skills are taught.
(3) The goal of the warrant officer–specific portion of OES is to produce a corps of highly specialized experts and
trainers who are fully competent in technical, tactical, and leadership skills; creative problem solvers able to function in
highly complex and dynamic environments and proficient operators, maintainers, administrators, and managers of the
Army’s equipment, support activities, and technical systems. Warrant officer leader development is a continuous
process beginning with pre-appointment training and education. OES prepares warrant officers to successfully perform
in increasing levels of responsibility throughout an entire career. OES provides the pre-appointment, branch
MOS–specific, and leader development training needed to produce technically and tactically competent WO leaders for
assignment to platoon, detachment, company, battalion, and higher-level organizations.
(4) Common core is the consolidation of common skills training and training prescribed by law, Army regulations or
other higher authority. It comprises the tasks all warrant officers are expected to perform successfully regardless of
branch. Common core instruction begins at pre-appointment and continues at each educational level (basic level,
advanced level, and senior level). The instruction is progressive and sequential and builds upon the skills and
knowledge acquired through previous training and operational assignments.
(5) Pre–appointment training qualifies individuals to serve as officers. The purposes of pre–appointment training are
to educate and train candidates, assess their readiness and potential for appointment to WO, and to prepare them for
progressive and continuing development. All WO candidates (Active Army and RC) must attend the resident Warrant
Officer Candidate School (WOCS) at Fort Rucker, AL. Warrant Officer Candidate School graduates are conditionally
appointed to warrant officer one, grade WO1. The appointment is contingent upon certification by the MOS proponent
that the WO is technically and tactically qualified to serve in the authorized WO MOS.
(6) The WOBC are branch specific qualification courses that ensure newly appointed warrant officers receive the
MOS–specific training and technical certification needed to perform in the MOS at the platoon through battalion levels.
Training is performance oriented and focuses on technical skills, leadership, effective communication, unit training,
maintenance operations, security, property accountability, tactics, and development of subordinates.
(7) The WOAC is a combination of common core and MOS proponent training that prepares the officer to serve in
senior positions at the CW3 level. The WOAC includes 2 phases— a non–resident common core module and a resident
phase which includes a common core module and MOS specific module. Career status (that is, voluntary indefinite
status) is required for enrollment in the non–resident phase and selection for promotion to CW3 is a mandatory
prerequisite for resident attendance (see para 4–7i).
(8) The Warrant Officer Staff Course (WOSC) is a branch–immaterial resident course which focuses on the staff
officer and leadership skills needed to serve in grade of CW4 positions at battalion and higher levels. The course
educates and trains officers in the values and attitudes of the profession of arms and in the conduct of military
operations in peace and war. The course prepares WOs for duty as senior technicians and staff officers. Instruction

includes decisionmaking, staff roles and functions, organizational theory, structure of the Army, budget formation and
execution, communication, training management, personnel management, and special leadership issues (See para 4–7j).
(9) The Warrant Officer Senior Staff Course (WOSSC) is the capstone for WO professional military education. It is
a branch–immaterial resident course which provides master–level professional WOs with a broader Army level
perspective required for assignment to grade CW5 level positions as technical, functional, and branch systems
integrators and trainers at the highest organizational levels (see para 4–7k).

Chapter 3
Officer Personnel Management System and career management
3–1. Mission
a. The OPMS is implemented by the USA HRC Officer Personnel Management Directorate (OPMD). The mission
of OPMS is to—
b. Access and designate officers in the right numbers and with the right skills to satisfy current and projected Army
requirements.
c. Develop the professional skills and Warrior Ethos of officers through planned schooling and sequential, progressive assignments.
d. Assign officers to meet Army requirements.
e. Separate officers to meet individual and Army needs.
3–2. Factors affecting the Officer Personnel Management System
Various factors continuously influence the environment in which OPMS operates. In turn, changes in that environment
necessitate continuous adjustments and alterations of policy by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G–1 (DCS, G–1). Factors
that influence OPMS policy are—
a. Law. Congress passes legislation that impacts on officer career development through required changes in related
Army policy. The DOPMA of 1981 created active duty strength limits for officers in grades above chief WO,
promotion flow and timing points and the integration of RA and other than Regular Army (OTRA) into common
patterns. Tenure for these officers was an essential ingredient in the legislation. However, as the world threat and force
structure changed, legislative revisions to the original DOPMA were sought to afford better flexibility in strength
management. The Department of Defense (DOD) Reorganization Act of 1986 (Goldwater–Nichols Act) impacted on
the officer corps by instituting Joint officer management provisions requiring a number of officers in the Army to serve
in Joint duty assignments as field grade officers. In 1986, Congress also passed Public Law 99–145, which specified
the acquisition experiences and education necessary for an officer to be the project manager of major weapon systems.
This law later led to the creation of the Army Acquisition Corps. Warrant officer professional development is
influenced directly by laws limiting the size of the Army and budgetary concerns. The 1986 law also aligned Army
warrant officers to those of the other services in that all appointments to chief WO (CW2 through CW5) would be by
commission instead of by warrant. In 1991, the WOMA was passed which created a uniform system for WO grade
management and control similar to the one used to manage company and field grade officers (DOPMA).
b. Policy. New laws often create changes in policy. Policy is also the purview of the Executive branch, which acts
through the Department of Defense. An example of how legislation impacts on DOD and Army policy is the creation
of the Army Acquisition Corps (AAC) in 1990. During 1989, the military departments studied an Executive and DOD
review of Public Law 99–145 and the Packard Commission report on acquisition. In January 1990, the Secretary of the
Army announced the implementation of the AAC based on a Presidential order and DOD directives that instructed the
Services to create an acquisition corps.
c. Budget. Funding limitations and allocations imposed by Congress affect the entire spectrum of officer management. The size and composition of the officer corps, accessions, strength management, promotion rates and
pin–on–points, schooling, education programs and permanent change of station (PCS) timing are but a few of the areas
affected by budget decisions and subsequent policies. The defense budget reflects the will of Congress in meeting the
perceived military threat as well as the global and national economic challenges. Future budget decisions will continue
to impact the Army and its officer corps.
d. Proponent vision. The duties of the proponent (as outlined in AR 600–3) are executed, in part, by the publication
of this pamphlet. Each proponent has responsibility for a branch, FA, or career field and oversees the entire life cycle
development for its officer population. Proponents project future requirements for officer skills and sustain or modify
elements of force structure and inventory to meet future needs. They define the 3 domains of leader development:
institutional, operational, and self-development. Proponents design and articulate doctrine–based work for specific
branches, FAs, or MOS by grade that is documented in TOE/TDA positions and clearly described in career patterns.
These patterns of officer development are embodied in life cycle development models. They are the diagrams of life
cycle management provided in this pamphlet and used by OPMD assignment branches to execute the proponent career

10

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

programs. As proponents modify officer skill requirements or development models to meet changing conditions, the
OPMS and this pamphlet will be updated.
e. Officer needs. At any given time, the officer inventory reflects American society as a whole and may span over 4
decades of age groups. Career expectations, job satisfaction, discipline, priorities, leader abilities, educational aptitude,
importance of family, and cultural values vary widely among serving year groups. The Army, through OPMS, responds
to the mission and requirements of the force, as well as the individual needs and preferences of the officer.
f. Technology and specialization. Besides the obvious advancements in science and technology evident in the
Army’s warfighting equipment, the quantum increase in information and required decisionmaking inherent in modern
doctrine and warfare necessitate a degree of multifunctionality and balance of specialization, as well as breadth and
depth of experiences within the officer corps. Complex and lethal weapons, Joint and multinational doctrine and
organizations, and a global political and economic connectivity require the utmost competence in the officer corps.
Such skills are mastered through self–development, mentoring, a combination of civilian and military educational
programs and a series of challenging, developmental assignments. This is particularly the case for the WO corps, the
Army’s technical experts, and FA designated officers as they must provide accurate and timely technical advice and
counsel across the range of military operations.
g. Special programs. Special programs meet a unique requirement for the Army. Many of these programs are Army
initiatives. Authority higher than the Army directs some other programs, and law mandates some. One current example
is the long–term, Congressionally mandated requirement with special significance to both the Active Army and Reserve
Component Program. Active Army officers advise and assist RC units, and promote and enhance Total Force
interoperability. As more RC units are mobilized and deployed, less AC assistance will be required in the future. RC
officers are also stationed in AC organizations to lend their experience and expertise to the AC force. Participation in
this program is a professionally challenging as well as professionally rewarding experience. The Director, Installation
Management Agency (IMA) oversees life cycle functions in Garrison Command Management. They provide a
dedicated corps of colonel (COL) (O–6) and lieutenant colonel (LTC) (O–5) garrison commanders who provide direct
support to soldiers, civilians, family members, and to senior mission commanders worldwide.
3–3. Officer Personnel Management System concept
a. The OPMS is an evolutionary system that balances the needs of the Army with the aspirations and developmental
requirements of the entire officer corps; warrant, company and field grade. Modified by external environmental factors,
as well as doctrine, the dynamics of force structure and leader development principles, OPMS will serve the officer
corps and the Army into the 21st century. Inherently flexible, the system is designed to respond to a variety of
doctrinal, proponent, commander and individual initiatives to meet emerging needs. Additionally, an annual review
process ensures that OPMS continues to adapt to changing Army requirements. This flexibility is embedded in OPMS
subsystems, which are interrelated and affected by each other’s changes. These subsystems are:
(1) Strength management. Army requirements, law, budget and policy define the number of officers, by grade and
specialty. The combination of these factors results in the determination of the numbers of officers to access, promote,
develop, assign and separate. Since each of these factors is dynamic, the number, grade and branch, FA or career field
of officers within the inventory are also dynamic. As Army requirements for force structure change, the officer
inventory will also change and be realigned to meet the needs of the resulting force structure.
(2) Career development. Each branch, FA or officer skill proponent has defined the appropriate mix of education,
training and sequential, progressive assignments needed by the officer corps at each grade level. The demands of each
specialty are reflected in subsequent branch or proponent chapters as life cycle development models. HRC must
develop each officer’s career, both Active Army and reserve components, by using these models while balancing Army
requirements and policies for officer management. To ensure the career development of all officers, HRC operates in
concert with various responsible agents in OPMS: the individual officer; the personnel proponents; commanders in the
field and the senior Army leadership. Officer career development is a responsibility shared by all. These life cycle
development models portray the full range of experiences for the development of our future leaders.
(3) Evaluation. The Army officer structure is pyramidal. The apex contains very few senior grades in relation to the
wider base. Advancement to increasingly responsible positions is based on relative measures of performance and
potential. The mechanism to judge the value of an individual’s performance and potential is the OER described in
detail in chapter 6. All OPMS subsystems are affected by the evaluation report. Promotion, school selection, career
field designation and command selection, retention in service and career development opportunities are all based on the
information contained in the OER.
(4) Centralized selection. The hub around which all the subsystems revolve is centralized selection. Strength
management, career development and evaluation of individual contribution occur in the series of centralized DA and
HRC selection boards for retention, career status, schooling, promotion, field grade command designation and selective
early retirement. These boards employ the evaluation reports, life cycle development models and strength requirements
to advance individuals to the next stage of career development. Officers generally flow through the centralized
selection subsystem by groupings based on date of rank (DOR). Company and field grade officer groupings are termed
cohort year groups. Warrant officer groupings are called the inclusive zone of eligibility. Each board is preceded by a
zone announcement that specifies the makeup of the cohort or inclusive zone. Centralized selection perpetuates the

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

11

ideals, cultural values, ethics and professional standards of the Army by advancing and retaining only those individuals
best qualified to assume positions of greater responsibility. Centralized selection has evolved over time to account for
the impact of law, policy, budget, Army and officer needs, and proponent vision.
b. Additionally, the Army’s requirements of the officer corps are incorporated in OPMS selection procedures to
assure adequate attention is given to the wide variety of career possibilities within the personnel management system.
3–4. Company and field grade officer career patterns
a. The development of officer values, attributes, skills and actions to meet the needs of the Army is accomplished
through the adherence to life cycle models for each branch and FA. These life cycle models depict the schooling,
operational assignments and self–development goals that produce the required qualifications for officers in each grade
by branch and FA. Proponents develop life cycle models based on Army requirements. Proponents closely monitor
Army doctrine and force structure and make adjustments to the life cycle development and utilization model as
necessary to ensure their branch or FA remains relevant, responsive and ready to meet the Army’s evolving needs for
officer skills.
b. The new officer developmental model, introduced at figure 3–1, is designed to provide proponents an overarching
concept of officer professional development and a point of reference for branches in the development of each
proponent life cycle model. The developmental model portrays a much less prescriptive model designed around
developing a Joint and expeditionary professional officer corps. These qualities also require proponents not only to
focus on developing Joint experience but also interagency, intergovernmental and multinational experience in our
officer corps. Inherent in the Army Officer Professional Development Model is a campaign quality that clearly
indicates the critical importance of both the generating and operating forces. Flexible timelines will enable officers to
serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate time to gain skills and experience and also
support unit readiness and cohesion.

c. The focus of the junior company grade officer is to gain the requisite branch technical and technical and tactical
skills, to develop a Warrior Ethos, and to gain important leadership experience in company grade developmental
assignments. For some branches these technical and tactical skills include company-level command. For other branches
these may not include command but other skills important to a modular, Joint and expeditionary Army. career field
designation points will be adjusted to allow officers to build skills required for our current and Future Force.
d. The Officer Professional Developmental Model highlights the significance of the Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational educational developmental zone with the intention of building multifunctionality in
field grade officers and developing the skills required by the combatant commanders. As officers continue to serve in
varying developmental assignments they acquire a general depth and breadth of skills and experience leading up to the
senior executive levels of the officer corps. Officers who develop specialty skills and experience continue to develop
and build on those special skills unique to their career field support to the operating and generating force.
e. The developmental model portrays the focus of officer professional development. Future updates will be aligned
with emphasis toward Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational educational experience. Accordingly,
proponent career models will reflect the varied assignment opportunities and career paths that provide the skills and
experience needed to develop officers to meet the demands of a campaign quality Army.
f. The size of the officer inventory is limited. As Army doctrine and force structure change, it may be necessary to
realign the strength and professional development goals of each branch and FA to meet new challenges. Under OPMS,
company grade officers are accessed into the Army’s basic branches. Their basic branch becomes their basic specialty;
and, through a series of educational and developmental assignments, they are given the opportunity to hold some of the
branch developmental assignments outlined by their proponent. At the end of their company grade years, CPTs are
designated into 1 of 4 officer career fields in which they continue their development as field grade officers in one
specialty, either in their basic branch or in a FA. Some officers will retain the FA specialty and be designated into the
Operational Support (OSCF), Institutional Support career field, or Information Operations career fields (OPCF). Others
will retain their basic branch affiliation and enter the Operations career field. Officers in the RCs will also undergo
career field designation with their Active Army counterparts; but modification to the process is necessary to accommodate personnel management considerations unique to the ARNG/USAR. Accessioning policies for the Army Acquisition Corps and Special Forces branch are unique and are addressed in their respective chapters.
g. Following career field designation, officers are assigned to positions requiring expertise in the particular specialty
associated with each officer’s designated career field, either branch skills or FA skills. In addition, these officers may
be assigned to branch/FA developmental positions throughout the Army that require those leadership and managerial
skills common to all officers. Assignments of field grade officers to branch/FA developmental positions are made with
the same professional development considerations afforded branch and FA assignments (see the glossary for a
discussion of branch/FA developmental assignment criteria).
h. The career field–based management concept is the heart of OPMS. Its basic premise is that company and field
grade officers can serve throughout their careers in a variety of assignments centered on their branch and/or FA.
Multiple successful career paths are possible under OPMS. One of the major objectives of OPMS is to professionally
develop officers in their designated branch or FA through the interactions of the individual, the proponent, OPMD, and
the field commander. These interactions are embodied in the process of officer development—
(1) Development in a designated specialty. There are 39 branch and FA specialties in OPMS. The differences
between a branch and FA are—
(a) Branch. A branch is a grouping of officers that comprises an arm or service of the Army and is the specialty in
which all officers are commissioned or transferred, trained, and developed. Company grade officers hold a single
branch designation and may serve in repetitive and progressive assignments associated with the branch. They may not
be assigned to more than one branch (see AR 310–25 and para 8–2 of this pamphlet).
(b) Functional area. An FA is a grouping of officers by technical specialty or skills other than an arm, service or
branch that possess interrelated groups of skills and perform tasks that usually require significant education, training
and experience. Although FA requirements are predominately in the field grades, some CPTs will serve developmental
tours in their FA. After career field designation, FA officers will serve repetitive and progressive assignments within
their FA. An officer may not be assigned to more than one FA at a time (see chap 8).
(2) Officer professional education. This includes resident and non–resident instruction, on–the–job training, individual study and when appropriate, civilian education.
(3) Planned, sequential, and progressive operational assignments. Assignments made by OPMD assignment
branches using the life cycle development models.
(4) Career development counseling and mentoring. Conducted by commanders at all levels as well as by HRC
career managers.
(5) Designation and election of branches, FAs and career field.
(a) Branch designation. Upon commissioning, LTs are designated in a basic branch for entry on active duty, training

14

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

and initial assignment. Some combat support and combat service support LTs are branch detailed. LTs selected for
Signal, Quartermaster, Ordnance, Transportation and Finance branches, when required, are detailed to a combat arms
branch for 2 years, or until their life cycle or cyclic units are in a reset period. LTs selected for Military Intelligence
and Adjutant General branches, when required, are detailed for 4 years. Under the branch detail program, officers
attend the company grade level education at the school of the branch to which they are detailed. On completing the
2–year detail, they attend a branch transition course before they return to their designated branch. Company grade
officers in the 4-year detail program receive transition branch training in conjunction with their enrollment in the
Captain’s level education. During the early years of service, career development within the branch follows the
proponent’s life cycle model. Generally, the first 8 years of service are devoted to branch developmental assignments
and training that prepares the company grade officer for further advancement. Company grade officers may request, in
writing, a voluntary branch transfer in accordance with AR 614–100, paragraph 4–2. Detailed officers must be
approved for branch transfer by their detail branch, basic branch and HRC (AHRC–OPD–C), in addition to meeting the
requirements of AR 614–100. Prior to selection for promotion to Captain, officers may volunteer for Special Forces
training and, upon successful completion of training, will receive a branch transfer into Special Forces branch.
Selection for Special Forces training is made by cohort year group and upon selection for promotion to CPT.
(b) Functional area request submission. All Army competitive category officers in the grade of CPT between their
5th and 10th years of commissioned service may submit their FA requests to HRC. This is done through the Officer
Assignment Preference online submission page. This process replaced the Functional Area Designation Board. Officers
may submit up to 3 FA requests, and may change their selections at any time up until the career field Designation
Board. This submission allows officers to inform HRC and the FA proponents of the FAs they are interested in
working in. The FA proponents will use this information to identify and select officers having the requisite skills and
experience needed for training and service in that FA. Officers may also contact the respective FA assignment officer
or their basic branch assignment officers to inquire about prospective assignments or utilization.
(c) Career field designation. Six months prior to consideration for promotion to MAJ, CPTs will submit preference
statements concerning their branch and FA designation priorities. Immediately following the MAJ’s promotion board,
officers selected for promotion are designated into a career field for branch or FA specialization. (Army Acquisition
Corps (AAC) officers are considered to be career field designated upon entry into FA 51 at about the 8th year of
service (see chap 47).) OPMS restructured the Army Competitive Category (ACC) by grouping interrelated branches
and FAs into field grade officer management categories called career fields. The career field designation process
determines in which specialty they will continue their field grade development; either in their branch or in their FA.
Management of field grade officer development in career fields recognizes the need to balance specialization of the
officer corps and the inherent requirement for officers to gain deeper expertise in a technologically advanced and
increasingly complex environment. The CFD process is carried out by a HQDA centralized board. As in centralized
selection, these boards consider officer education, training and experience; evaluation reports; life cycle development
models; officer preferences; and strength requirements to ensure that the needs of the Army are met for future field
grade officer requirements in each career field. Each career field has its own unique characteristics and development
model for field grade officers, which reflects the readiness requirements of the Army today and into the 21st century.
Field grade officers in all career fields are assigned across the Army in TOE and TDA organizations (see chap 8 for
career fields and their composition).
i. Some positions in the Army are independent of branch or FA coding and are designated as branch/FA generalist
or immaterial positions. Some company and field grade officers should expect to serve in these assignments at various
times during their careers, regardless of their designated career fields. Examples of these key generalist positions are
aide-de-camp, Inspector General (IG), U.S. Army Recruiting Command (USAREC), Congressional liaison, Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC), and U.S. Military Academy (USMA) faculty and staff. Officers are selected for
these and other similar positions based on overall manner of performance, previous experience, military and civilian
education, and estimated potential for further service.
j. Both branches and FAs may require more specific job skills and qualifications to further prepare their officers to
meet highly specialized position requirements. These specific skills are called areas of concentration (AOC). Areas of
concentration are described in the branch/FA chapters of this pamphlet.
k. Branch/FA development fosters a mastery of skills, knowledge and attributes for an officer’s grade in a specific
branch or FA. In the profession of arms, branch/FA development is a rite of passage into assignments of increased
scope, authority and responsibility. Branch development enables Captains to achieve mastery of common core and
branch skills, knowledge and attributes that assures the strong professional development foundation essential for
success in the field grades. Generally speaking branch development for CPTs equates to completion of the appropriate
company grade level education followed by successful performance as a company grade officer, the most challenging
level of assignment and test of character, competence and potential for junior officers. In some branches, force
structure precludes the opportunity for all CPTs to command. In these branches, completion of the appropriate
company grade level education and successful performance in a key staff position affords branch development
opportunity. Branch development for majors results from completion of the appropriate field grade intermediate level
education and successful performance in a branch or FA qualifying assignment. For officers in OPCF the appropriate
field grade level education is the ILE core curriculum followed by the Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

15

(AOWC). Most branches recognize key staff assignments at division, brigade, and battalion level as the best means to
prepare their majors for leadership positions in the senior grades. For FA officers, MAJs begin with completion of ILE,
but the wide variety of specialized skills, knowledge, and attributes demanded by the FAs require a diverse mix of
training, education, and FA experience. Thus, each FA has its own unique qualification course that the officer must
complete after completing ILE. Functional area officers must then serve successfully in utilization assignments within
their FA. In parts II through IV of this pamphlet, each proponent describes the spectrum of opportunities for company
and field grade officers.
l. The OPMS introduced significant changes to the field grade officer promotion system. While policies and
procedures for promotions through the grade of MAJ remain unchanged, promotions in the field grades are managed
differently. Under OPMS, MAJs and LTCs compete for promotion from within their respective career fields. Additionally, below–the–zone selections are limited to 5 to 7.5 percent of considered population. Field grade officers receive
only 1 consideration for secondary zone selection for promotion to a given grade. Selection for promotion is based on
the fundamentals of performance and potential for further service. These are measured by the officer’s relative standing
with his peers as indicated in the evaluation reports, assignment history and branch and FA development opportunities
afforded. The selection boards are instructed as to the number of field grade officers to select based on Army needs,
law, policy and budget. Additionally, the boards receive guidance on the officer qualities expected for promotion. All
of this information is contained in the Secretary of the Army’s Memorandum of Instruction (MOI) issued to the board.
Members of the board use DA Pamphlet 600–3 to determine branch and FA qualifications. Congress and the Secretary
of the Army approve promotion selection lists prior to publication.
3–5. Warrant officer definitions
The Army WO is a self–aware and adaptive technical expert, combat leader, trainer, and advisor. Through progressive
levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the WO administers, manages, maintains, operates, and
integrates Army systems and equipment across the full spectrum of Army operations. Warrant Officers are innovative
integrators of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident warfighters, and developers of specialized teams of
soldiers. They support a wide range of Army missions throughout their career. Warrant officers in the Army are
accessed with specific levels of technical ability. They refine their technical expertise and develop their leadership and
management skills through tiered progressive assignment and education. The following are specific characteristics and
responsibilities of the separate, successive WO grades.
a. Warrant officer one. An officer appointed by warrant with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and
position given by the Secretary of the Army. WO1s are basic level, technically and tactically focused officers who
perform the primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, and advisor. They also
perform any other branch-related duties assigned to them. They also provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance,
and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. WO1s have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions and tasks assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational
responsibility for how well their command performs its mission. WO1s primarily support levels of operations from
team or detachment through battalion, requiring interaction with all soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide
leader development, mentorship, and counsel to enlisted soldiers and NCOs.
b. Chief warrant officer two. CW2s are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment
level and position as given by the President of the U.S.. CW2s are intermediate level technical and tactical experts who
perform the primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, and advisor. They also
perform any other branch-related duties assigned to them. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and
supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. They have specific responsibility for accomplishing the
missions and tasks assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility for
how well their command performs its mission. CW2s primarily support levels of operations from team or detachment
through battalion, requiring interaction with all soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide leader development,
mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs, other WOs and company-grade branch officers.
c. Chief warrant officer three. CW3s are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment
level and position as given by the President of the U.S.. CW3s are advanced-level technical and tactical experts who
perform the primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor.
They also perform any other branch-related duties assigned to them. They provide direction, guidance, resources,
assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. CW3s have specific responsibility for
accomplishing the missions and tasks assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility for how well their command performs its mission. CW3s primarily support levels of operations
from team or detachment through brigade, requiring interaction with all soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide
leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs, other WOs and branch officers. CW3s advise commanders on WO issues.
d. Chief warrant officer four. CW4s are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment
level and position as given by the President of the U.S.. CW4s are senior-level technical and tactical experts who
perform the primary duties of technical leader, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator and advisor. They also
perform any other branch-related duties assigned to them. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and

16

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. CW4s have specific responsibility for accomplishing the
missions and tasks assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility for
how well their command performs its mission. They primarily support battalion, brigade, division, corps, and echelons
above corps operations. They must interact with NCOs, other officers, primary staff, and special staff. CW4s primarily
provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs, other WOs and branch officers. They have
special mentorship responsibilities for other WOs and provide essential advice to commanders on WO issues.
e. Chief warrant officer five. CW5s are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment
level and position as given by the President of the U.S.. CW5s are master-level technical and tactical experts who
perform the primary duties of technical leader, manager, integrator, advisor, or any other particular duty prescribed by
branch. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform
their duties. CW5s have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions and tasks assigned to them. CW5s
primarily support brigade, division, corps, echelons above corps, and major command operations. They must interact
with NCOs, other officers, primary staff and special staff. They provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and
counsel to WOs and branch officers. CW5s have special WO leadership and representation responsibilities within their
respective commands. They provide essential advice to commanders on WO issues.
3–6. Warrant officer career patterns
a. The development of the professional attributes and technical capabilities of Army warrant officers to meet the
needs of the Army is accomplished through proponent-designed career development models for each career field. These
career development models describe schooling, operational assignments and self-development goals for warrant officers
in each grade. Career development models are based on Army requirements, indicating the numbers and types of
warrant officers to be accessed, retained, promoted, schooled and assigned by MOS. Proponents monitor the Army
documents pertinent to their career fields since any change to the force structure may require a change to the WO
inventory.
b. The size of the WO inventory is limited by various factors. As requirements change, strength and professional
development goals of each career field are aligned accordingly. Warrant officers are accessed into a specific career
field and can normally expect to spend their entire career in that field. Branch, career field, and MOS are defined in
appendix A. These terms as they pertain to warrant officers are further explained below—
(1) Branches are the officially designated categories within the service that separate personnel and functions.
Examples of branches are Field Artillery, Infantry, Quartermaster, Aviation, and so forth. Warrant officers are
appointed in the U.S. Army at large but contribute directly to the success and missions of the specific branches.
Warrant officers wear the insignia of the branches they support. Branch proponents play a significant role in the
management of WO career fields, development of life cycle development models, and providing proponent based
training for warrant officers.
(2) Career fields for WOs are groupings of duty positions made up of mutually supporting skills. Examples are food
service, supply, human resources, aviation, and so forth. For most WOs, career field is synonymous with MOS.
However, some career fields, notably aviation and automotive maintenance, provide for progressive movement through
multiple military occupational specialties.
(3) An MOS is an assigned specialty that most WOs hold, with variations, for their entire career. The list of
specialties, with general description of duties, by grade, is contained in DA Pam 611–21.
c. Not all assignments within an officer’s career will directly relate to the WO’s career field or MOS. Some WO
positions are MOS immaterial but career field specific; that is, any qualified WO within a specific branch (aviation,
artillery, and so forth) may be assigned to the position. Others are designated MOS as well as career field immaterial;
that is, any qualified WO, regardless of MOS and career field, may be assigned to the position. Some positions in
leader development, professional development, personnel management, training, and training development require the
assignment of the best qualified WO, regardless of MOS or career field.
3–7. Introduction to officer skills
A skill identifier identifies specific skills that are required to perform the duties of a particular position and are not
related to any one branch, FA or career field. There are over 250 skills in the current Army regulation, many of which
require special schooling, training, and experiences in which qualification is maintained.
3–8. Joint officer professional development
a. Joint duty assignments.
(1) The provisions of Title 10, U.S. Code Armed Forces, specify that officers on the ADL may not be appointed to
the grade of brigadier general (BG) unless they have completed a full tour of duty in a Joint duty assignment (JDA).
Additionally, effective 1 October 2007, officers must have the ASI of 3L (Joint Specialty Officer) to be considered for
promotion to BG. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy (ASD(FMP)) may waive that JDA
requirement on a case-by-case basis for scientific and/or technical qualifications for Corps of Engineers, Military Police
Corps, Military Intelligence, Finance Corps, Chemical Corps, Ordnance Corps, Army Acquisition Corps and Public
Affairs officers; Comptrollers; Nurses and Medical, Dental, Veterinary and Medical Service officers; Chaplains; Judge

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

17

Advocate officers; officers serving in a JDA for at least 12 months that began before 1 January 1987; officers serving
in a JDA at least 180 days on the date the board convenes; and lastly, for the “good of the Service.” A JDA is a
designated position in a multi-Service or multinational command or activity involved in the integrated employment or
support of the land, sea or air forces of at least 2 of the 3 military services. The preponderance of an officer’s duties
involves producing or promulgating National Military Strategy, Joint doctrine and policy, strategic and contingency
planning, and command and control of combat operations under a unified command. The Goldwater–Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 provides statutory requirements as set forth in 10 USC for Joint duty
assignments, Joint tour credit, and Joint military education.
(2) The Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL) is a consolidated list of JDAs approved for Joint credit by the ASD
(FMP). Presently, the JDAL has approximately 3200 billets for Army MAJs through COLs.
b. Joint duty credit. The statutory tour length for a JDA is 3 years for field grade officers and 2 years for general
officers. After completing a full tour of duty in a JDA, they will be awarded the 3A (Joint Duty Qualified) skill
identifier. An officer begins to accrue Joint duty credit upon assignment to a Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL) billet
and stops accruing Joint duty credit on departure. Critical Occupational Specialty (COS) officers (MAJ to COL) may
receive full tour credit for serving at least 2 years in their initial JDA. In specific instances, up to 60 days of
constructive credit may be awarded toward full tour credit. Field grade officers who serve at least 10 months in a JDA
may receive cumulative tour credit. Cumulative tour credit may be combined to receive full tour credit when the
minimum JDA tour length of the billet is met (24 to 36 month billets) and the cumulative total equals 36 months. An
individual waiver signed by the Secretary of Defense is required to remove an officer from a JDA prior to full tour
completion.
c. Joint specialty officers. JSOs are educated and experienced in the employment, deployment and support of unified
and multinational forces to achieve national security objectives. Joint specialty officers provide continuity for Joint
matters that are critical to strategic and operational planning and serve within the Joint arena and their service. Field
grade officers eligible for the JSO designation must meet the highest standards of performance, complete both phase I
and II of a Joint Professional Military Education program and successfully complete a full tour of duty in a JDA. The
Secretary of Defense may waive the education requirement provided the officer has successfully completed 2 full tours
of duty in a JDA. Officers approved by the Secretary of Defense will be awarded the 3L (Joint Specialty Officer) skill
identifier.
d. Joint Professional Military Education. Professional Military Education (PME) is the systematic instruction of
professionals in subjects that enhance their knowledge of the science and art of war. JPME is that portion of PME
concentrating on instruction of Joint matters. Program for Joint Education (PJE) is a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff-approved body of objectives, policies, procedures and standards supporting JPME requirements for JSO nomination. PJE is a shared responsibility of the military service colleges and the National Defense University (NDU). The
National War College (NWC) and Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF) curricula encompass the entire PJE
(phase I and phase II). Other educational institutions approved by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff conduct
PJE phase I, while the Armed Forces Staff College (AFSC) conducts PJE phase II. Field grade officers who complete
both PJE phase I and PJE phase II satisfy the educational requirements for JSO nomination.
(1) Program for Joint education phase I. PJE phase I is that portion of the PJE that is incorporated into the curricula
of intermediate and senior-level military service PME schools and other appropriate educational programs that meet
PJE criteria and are accredited by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
(2) Program for Joint education phase II. PJE phase II is that portion of PJE that complements PJE phase I. PJE
phase II is taught at AFSC to both intermediate and senior-level students. Field grade officers must complete PJE phase
I to be eligible to attend PJE phase II. Under exceptional conditions, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff may
approve a direct-entry waiver to permit an officer to complete PJE II without having completed PJE phase I. PJE phase
II is integrated, along with PJE phase I, into the curricula at the NWC and ICAF.
(3) Other programs. Other programs, as approved by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, may satisfy the
phase I requirement.
(4) Program for Joint education phase II graduates. The Army must ensure that the following requirements are met
by officers who graduate from each of the NDU schools (for example, the NWC, the ICAF or the AFSC) for each FY:
(a) All JSOs must be assigned to a JDA as their next duty assignment following graduation, unless waived on a
case-by-case basis by the ASD (FMP).
(b) More than 50 percent (defined as 50 percent plus one) of all non–JSO graduates from each of those schools must
be assigned to a JDA as their next duty assignment following graduation. One–half of the officers subject to that
requirement (for each school) may be assigned to a JDA as their second (rather than first) assignment following
graduation, if necessary for efficient officer management. The Army shall coordinate with the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff to document compliance.
3–9. Company grade development
a. Branch specific development. This phase commences upon entry on active duty and generally lasts through the
10th year of service (see fig 3–1). Currently, officers begin the development process by attending the Officer Basic

18

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

Course (OBC), now termed Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC) of their assigned branch. Under a transformed OES
based on changes recommended by the Army Training and Leader Development Panel–Officer (ATLDP–O), officers
will begin their professional development by attending BOLC II, followed by BOLC III (see para 4–2b(1) for
additional information).
(1) Basic education. Basic Officer Leader Course II marks the beginning of a company grade officer’s formal
military professional development training following commissioning. The branch BOLC III prepares officers for their
1st duty assignment and provides instruction on methods for training and leading individuals, teams, squads, and
platoons. Additionally, the course provides officers with a detailed understanding of equipment, tactics, organization,
and administration at the company, battery or troop level.
(2) Initial assignments. After officers graduate from BOLC III, branch assignment officers in OPMD will assign the
majority of officers to a branch duty position. Included in these assignments are CONUS or overseas troop units where
officers begin to hone their leadership skills. All junior officers should seek leadership positions in troop units
whenever possible. Troop leadership is the best means to become educated in Army operations and build a solid
foundation for future service.
(3) Captains Officer Education System. The Army’s current formal education process for CPTs is the Captains
Career Course (CCC). CPTs OES is under review, however; and will change as part of the Army’s ongoing effort to
transform. Future CPTs OES will feature company command and staff competencies, a branch and combined arms
focus, an introduction to Joint operations, digital skills, and knowledge and application based instruction. It will
leverage learning technologies and be less than 6 months in length.
(4) Captains Career Course. Officers normally attend their branch CCC following selection for promotion to CPT.
This is the 2nd major branch school officers attend before company level command. The course combines the
instruction formerly taught in the branch Officer Advanced Course (OAC) and the Combined Arms and Services Staff
School (CAS3). Selected CPTs deemed to have demonstrated superior performance in their basic branch may be
selected to receive this training at schools other than their basic branch. A Field Artillery officer, for example, may
attend the Armor CCC. This cross training benefits officers of both branches. Officers seeking accession into Special
Forces will normally attend the Infantry CCC (see para 4–2b(2)).
(5) Branch opportunities. All company grade officers must focus their efforts during the company grade years on
mastering the basic skills of their specific branch, regardless of the FA and career field they will later enter. Much of
the value an officer brings to a specialized FA is dependent on experience gained by leading soldiers and mastering
basic branch skills. Unit command is the essence of leadership development at this stage of an officer’s career. Officers
who have demonstrated the potential and desire to command soldiers fill command positions. The number of company
commands within a specific branch may not afford all officers the opportunity to command at the CPT level.
Command opportunities for CPTs are found in traditional tables of organization and equipment (TOE) line units or
tables of distribution and allowances (TDA) units in training, garrison, and headquarters organizations. (For information unique to a particular branch, refer to that branch’s chapter in part II of this pamphlet.)
b. Post–initial branch development. Between the 8th and 12th years of service and after a company grade officer has
been afforded branch development opportunities, a number of options become available for continued career development. At this time, career managers at OPMD assess the officer’s developmental objectives for the post-branch
development phase based on assignment patterns completed, relative manner of performance achieved, individual
preferences and Army requirements available for the next developmental stage. The types of assignments and developmental patterns for this phase are as follows:
(1) Branch assignments. The range of further assignments to branch coded positions is a function of the Army’s
requirements and officer availability. These assignments may include staff and faculty positions at service schools,
Combat Training Center (CTC) duty or staff positions in tactical or training units. Branch assignments further develop
the basic branch skills and employ the officer’s accumulated skills, knowledge and attributes.
(2) Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Some company grade officers may serve in positions coded 01A
(Officer Generalist) or 02A (Combat Arms Generalist). These branch/FA generalist positions do not require an officer
from a specific branch or FA but may be performed by an officer with certain experiences, manner of performance, and
demonstrated potential. Such assignments include USAREC staff and command positions, ROTC or USMA faculty and
staff, and MACOM staff positions.
(3) Functional area development. Some company grade officers are considered for available training and assignment
in FA coded positions. Based on the life cycle model of the FA proponent, branch officers attend specialized training
courses in their respective fields to prepare them for this career developing assignment. For example, an Information
Systems Management officer (FA 53) could be scheduled for the Systems Automation Course in route to an FA 53
coded position. Each FA proponent has established specific courses to prepare officers to be successful. Attendance at
these schools is usually in a TDY status en route to the FA assignment. Most tours for FA duty are in CONUS for
CPTs and generally last 3 years. This initial schooling and assignment in an FA is an important 1st step in achieving
qualification in a skill and may influence subsequent career field designation. Some CPTs may not receive FA training
since most FA structure exists at the field grade level.
(4) Advanced Civil Schooling (ACS). Each year approximately 450 officers attend civilian academic institutions to

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

19

obtain graduate level degrees in designated disciplines. The final number varies based on budget, policy, and Army
requirements. The Army Educational Requirements System (AERS) operates on the premise that about 5,000 positions
in the Army, primarily in TDA organizations, require officers with the advanced academic education necessary for
accomplishing the functions relative to those positions. The majority of these assignments are in FA billets, with some
branch–coded positions also in the structure. These positions are annually assessed to determine how many officers
should be entered into each academic discipline. The criteria for selection are based on the branch or FA skill required,
academic proficiency measured by undergraduate performance and scores from the Graduate Record Examination
(GRE) or Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), ability to be accepted by an accredited college, and manner
of performance to indicate strong potential for future service. Proponents must forecast the education and utilization of
ACS graduates to meet projected needs since the degrees typically take 12 to 22 months to complete. The specific
follow–on assignment or utilization is often determined about 6 to 9 months prior to graduation (see branch and FA
chapters for ACS requirements). Army regulation 621–1 is the governing regulation and specifies the method by which
officers may apply for ACS.
(5) Training With Industry. Some branches and FAs participate in Training With Industry (TWI), where officers are
assigned to a civilian industry to observe and learn the technical and managerial aspects of that field. The total number
of training quotas varies annually from 50 to 70 based on budget, policy, and requirements. Officers selected for this
program must be proficient in their branch, have a manner of performance that reflects a strong potential for future
service, and be able to serve a utilization tour upon completion of training. The TWI program is outlined in AR 621–1
and in the specific branch and FA chapters later in this pamphlet.
(6) Army Acquisition Corps. Between their 7th and 8th year of service, about 150 CPTs are accessed into the Army
Acquisition Corps (AAC) (FA 51) to be professionally developed in this highly specialized FA. The HRC hosts an
Acquisition Accession Board annually to select branch–qualified CPTs for FA 51. The AAC officers may receive a
fully funded master’s degree (if not already at civilian education level 2), attend the Materiel Acquisition Management
Course and other FA related training, and serve repetitive assignments in their acquisition specialties to prepare them
for critical acquisition positions at field grade level. The AAC, created in early 1990, is described in detail in chapter
48 of this pamphlet.
(7) Early career field designation. Some FAs require lengthy education and training prior to officer utilization.
Officers accepted by these FAs will be designated into the career field early. Being trained in these FAs and entering
the career field early will not change an officer’s promotion potential to MAJ. Information regarding these specific
career fields is available at https://www.perscomonline.army.mil/opmd/opmd.htm.
(8) Selection for promotion to major. Normally an officer within a cohort year group enters the primary zone of
consideration for MAJ in their 10th year of service. Below–the–zone consideration occurs a year earlier. The OPMS
strives to maintain the promotion opportunities reflected in the DOPMA. For promotion to MAJ, the objective selection
rate is 80 percent.
3–10. Major development
a. This phase, which generally encompasses the 12th to 17th years of service, begins with selection for promotion to
MAJ. This is a critical period in an officer’s career life cycle that demands an acute awareness of important HQDA
centralized boards and the preparations they require. The junior field grade years serve to develop the officer cohort in
a variety of branch or FA assignments within their career field.
b. The general development goals are to complete military education level 4 (ILE), and meet other basic branch or
FA qualification criteria prior to consideration for promotion to LTC. ILE will provide a quality resident education for
all new field grade officers to prepare them for their next 10 years of service (see para 4–6).
c. MAJs in the Operational Support, Institutional Support, and Information Operations career fields without FA
experience will begin their FA professional development phase. Officers designated into FAs should expect training
and education opportunities to focus on their areas of specialization and include progressive and repetitive assignments
of increasing responsibility. Each of the FA chapters in this pamphlet outlines developmental positions.
d. The Joint Duty Assignment List contains approximately 1150 MAJ authorizations. MAJs will continue to have
the opportunity for assignment to Joint duty positions as an integral part of their development (see para 3–8).
e. Cohort year group officers are considered for promotion to LTC in their 16th year of service as they enter the
primary zone of consideration. Based on DOPMA promotion objectives, about 70 percent of a cohort year group of
MAJs attain the grade of LTC.
3–11. Lieutenant colonel development
a. This phase generally occurs between the 17th and 22d years of service. Those selected for promotion to LTC now
begin the senior field grade years, where they make the maximum contribution to the Army as commanders and senior
staff officers. Attaining the grade of LTC is often considered to be the hallmark of a successful career, although each
officer defines success differently. Officers in the grade of LTC serve as senior leaders and managers throughout the
Army providing wisdom, experience, vision and mentorship mastered over many years in uniform.
b. The career development goals for an LTC are to gain branch, FA and skill proficiency at the senior levels through

20

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

assignments and schooling. Most of these officers will serve in high visibility billets in either their branch or FA, with
a possible assignment to a branch/FA developmental position.
(1) Branch assignments. LTCs can expect branch–coded assignments to both TDA and TOE positions. These billets
can range from positions within a battalion through echelons above Corps (EAC). However, the TDA structure requires
the greater portion (almost 70 percent) of the senior field grade expertise and experience. Here, the officer’s development over the years is used to fulfill the doctrinal, instructional, policymaking and planning needs of the Army. Branch
proponents have outlined developmental standards in their respective chapters of this pamphlet.
(2) Functional area assignments. The OPMS recognizes the need for balanced specialization to meet the Army’s
challenges in the 21st century. The system design allows officers to serve in repetitive assignments within an FA to
gain a high degree of expertise. Functional area proponents have outlined developmental standards in their respective
chapters of this pamphlet.
(3) Joint duty assignments. The JDAL contains approximately 1350 LTC authorizations and officers will continue to
have the opportunity for assignment to Joint duty positions as an integral part of their development (see para 3–8).
(4) Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Some officers will serve outside their branch or FA in billets
coded as branch/FA generalist. Such assignments are found throughout the Army in troop and staff organizations from
the installation to DA level.
(5) Centralized command selection. A centralized board at HQDA selects a limited number of officers for command
from the Operations career field. The LTC Command Selection List (CSL), which contains both TOE and TDA
commands, has 3 categories. The 1st consists of tactical units at divisional, Corps and echelons above Corps levels.
This tactical category also includes MACOM assets directly involved in combat operations. The 2nd category is
training and strategic support, which consists of MACOM assets not directly involved in combat operations. The 3rd
category, institutional, is composed of garrison and USAREC commands. The Army Acquisition Corps (AAC)
conducts a similar HQDA level board to select LTC commanders and product managers (PM). Only certified AAC
officers can compete for these positions. The command board meets annually to select commanders from the eligible
cohort year groups. These officers usually assume command within the next FY, and most serve in those command
positions for 2 or 3 years. Approximately 2 of 5 eligible officers will command battalions. MAJs in a promotable status
as well as LTCs are eligible for consideration until their 21st year of Active Federal Commissioned Service. Command
opportunity varies based on force structure and the command categories for which an officer competes. On average,
LTCs serve in their command tours during their 18th through 20th years of service. Once the board makes its
selections and conducts a preliminary slating for category, OPMD assignment branches conduct a slating process.
AHRC coordinates this slating process with the major Army commands; and the Chief of Staff, Army, reviews and
approves the slate.
(6) Senior Service College. The annual SSC (military education level 1 (MEL 1)) selection board reviews the files
of LTCs after their 16th year of service. The SSC is the final major military educational program available to prepare
officers for the positions of greatest responsibility in the Department of Defense. There are about 350 resident seats
available each academic year within the SSC network. These include attendance at the Army War College (AWC), the
Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF), the National War College (NWC), other Service colleges and resident
fellowships at governmental agencies and academic institutions. Approximately 30 to 35 percent of a cohort year group
is selected to attend during their years of eligibility that runs between the 16th and 23d years of service. The SSC
selection board examines the eligible population and produces an order of merit list containing 1,300 names. The top
350 officers are activated for resident attendance while the remainder are contacted by their branch or FA managers
and encouraged to apply for the 150 annual active duty seats in the U.S. Army War College Distance Education
Course. Only the resident SSC courses and non–resident Army War College course award MEL 1 upon completion.
SSC graduates are assigned to organizations based on guidance from the Chief of Staff, Army. Tours following
graduation are to the Army Staff (ARSTAF), Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), major Army
command (MACOM), and combatant command staffs in branch, FA, branch/FA generalist or Joint coded positions.
c. Cohort year group officers are normally considered for promotion to COL in the primary zone in their 21st year
of service. Below–the–zone selection is possible, and officers will only be considered once prior to their primary zone
consideration. The DOPMA objective selection rate for promotion to COL is 50 percent.
3–12. Colonel development
a. Those officers selected for promotion to COL continue their senior field grade phase that concludes with their
separation or retirement from active duty or selection for promotion to BG. Attaining the grade of COL is realized by a
select few and truly constitutes the elite of the officer corps. As COLs, their maximum contribution to the Army is
made as commanders and senior staff officers.
b. The general career development goals for COLs are to further enhance branch or FA skill proficiency through
additional senior level assignments and schooling. COLs in the Operations career field will serve in high–level staff
positions while alternating between branch and branch immaterial billets. COLs in the other 3 career fields will serve
primarily in their FA with limited opportunity to serve in branch immaterial billets.
(1) Branch assignments. Many COLs can expect to receive assignments to branch coded positions at the brigade,

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

21

division, Corps and echelons above Corps in the TOE environment. TDA organizations throughout the Army also need
the expertise of senior field grade officers. Almost 70 percent of the COL authorizations are in the TDA structure.
(2) Functional area assignments. Under OPMS, FA officers work predominantly in their specialties after selection
for promotion to MAJ. Having risen above their peers at the grade of MAJ and LTC, those promoted to COL are truly
the world–class specialists in their respective fields. These officers will serve primarily in senior managerial billets
across the Army coded for their specialty.
(3) Joint duty assignment. The Joint Duty Assignment List contains approximately 620 COL billets in branch and
FA positions. Officers who did not serve as MAJs or LTCs in the JDAL should continue to seek Joint development.
COLs who completed the requirements for JSO status, may serve 2nd and 3rd tours in positions coded Joint critical
(see para 3–8).
(4) Senior Service College. The annual SSC selection board reviews the files of COLs until their 23rd year of
service. The majority of COLs will either attend the resident training or be awarded MEL 1 certification from the U.S.
Army War College Distance Education Course during the latter 3 years of their eligibility window (see para 3–11b(6)
for SSC–level courses).
(5) Centralized command selection. Some officers in the Operations career field are selected for command at the
COL level. The COL level Command Selection List (CSL) includes 4 categories of TOE and TDA organizations for
which officers are centrally selected by a HQDA board to command in a given FY. Three of the categories are the
same as those for LTC; the 4th is TRADOC System Manager. Most positions are branch coded and branch officers
compete within designated categories for these positions. An HQDA level board also selects AAC program managers.
Officers are eligible for COL command selection until their 26th year of service. The HQDA command boards meet
annually to select promotable LTCs and serving COLs for assignment to command positions during the following FY.
The opportunity varies by branch and ranges from 16 percent to 50 percent. The command board prepares a slate to
category and an initial slate to units. The final slate to unit is prepared by OPMD. Slates are approved by the Chief of
Staff, Army, and are coordinated with the MACOMs. The majority of officers in a cohort year group do not command;
they make their maximum contribution to the Army in other important branch or FA senior staff assignments.
(6) Former brigade commander assignments. COLs completing brigade command are assigned to positions designated by the Chief of Staff, Army, as requiring the skills of former commanders. These post–command assignments
may be to branch, branch/FA generalist assignments or Joint coded positions. Emphasis is placed on Joint duty
assignments for those officers without a Joint qualifying tour.
3–13. Warrant officer development
In subsequent chapters, career development models are detailed by career fields and MOS. Entry level WOs are
accessed according to the needs of the Army. Once accepted, the applicant must attend the WOCS, conducted by the
WOCC at Fort Rucker, AL. This is a high stress course that tests the mental, emotional, and physical stamina of
candidates to determine their acceptability into the WO corps. The focus of the course is common material that
provides the skills, knowledge, and behaviors required of all WOs, regardless of specialty. Upon course completion, the
candidate is eligible for appointment to the grade of WO1 but is not yet MOS qualified.
a. Warrant officer one/chief warrant officer two. After graduating from WOCS, the new WO1 must attend a WOBC
conducted by his/her proponent school. The WOBC provides functional training in the applicable MOS and reinforces
the leadership training provided in WOCS. Upon successful completion of WOBC, the WO is awarded an MOS and
given an initial operational assignment. Operational assignments continue for the next several years. Throughout this
period, WOs should continue their self–development, to include the pursuit of civil education goals. The civil education
goal at this career point is an associate’s degree or equivalent prior to eligibility for selection to CW3. After promotion
to CW2, at approximately the 3rd year of WO service, WOs can enroll in prerequisite studies for the WOAC, an MOS
immaterial course administered by the Distributive Education Section of the WOCC. Completion of this course renders
the officer eligible to attend his/her resident WOAC.
b. Chief warrant officer three/chief warrant officer four. Warrant officers will attend the resident portion of their
proponent controlled WOAC not later than 1 year after their promotion to the grade of CW3. At this point, WOs
should actively pursue the next civil education goal, a baccalaureate’s degree or equivalent, prior to eligibility for
selection to CW4. Warrant officers will attend the WOSC conducted at the WOCC not later than 1 year after their
promotion to CW4. Some proponents may provide follow–on functional training at this point. Upon graduation from
the WOSC, the WO will serve in positions designated for the grade of CW4.
c. Chief warrant officer five. Upon selection to the grade of CW5, WOs are required to attend the WOSSC at the
WOCC. Again, proponent schools may provide a follow–on portion of this course. Upon completion of the WOSSC,
the WO will serve the remainder of his/her career in positions designated for the grade of CW5.
3–14. Assignment process and considerations
a. The life cycle of a cohort year group spans 30 years of service. Some officers from a cohort may attain general
officer status and be retained in service beyond that point. Some WOs may attain the grade of CW5 and also serve up
to 30 years of WO service.
b. The assignment process throughout an officer’s career is based on several factors and considerations. The
22

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

environmental factors in which OPMS III operates can affect the assignments an officer may receive. The assignment
process has these elements—
(1) Army requirements. The central engine that drives the OPMS III and the assignment process is Army requirements. Army requirements are those positions that must be filled by officers to accomplish our wartime and peacetime
missions. When an officer leaves a position, the losing agency generates a requisition for a replacement. Army
requirements for officers are specified on the various TOE and TDA structures. Grade, branch, FA, skill, and special
remarks are documented for each position within The Army Authorization Documents System (TAADS), which is
maintained by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G–3. Annually, the Army projects positions to be filled and places officers on
permanent change of station (PCS) orders to occupy the vacancies. Within OPMD, requisition cycles are opened
quarterly, and the assignment branches determine which officers meet the position requirements and are available for
the assignment.
(2) Availability for assignment. Officers are considered available for assignment when they complete the required
tour length as specified in AR 614–100 for CONUS and outside continental United States (OCONUS) locations.
Department of Defense and Army policies for tour length are changed based on a variety of external factors, to include
budget limitations. Force Stabilization will be an important factor in future assignment decisions.
(3) Career development needs. Career development in the officer’s designated branch, FA, or MOS is important to
the assignment manager, however, Force Stabilization will be an equally important consideration. Each branch and FA
has a life cycle development model. The officer’s career needs are examined in light of these models to ensure the next
assignment is progressive, sequential and achieves the career development goal for that grade.
(4) Other assignment considerations. Besides Army requirements, availability and career development, the assignment managers scrutinize other considerations in arriving at an appropriate assignment.
(a) Preference. Officers should frequently update their preference statement for location, type of assignments,
personal data, career development goals and education and training needs. Assignment managers may not be able to
satisfy all preferences because of dynamic requirements, but they do attempt to satisfy as many as possible.
(b) Training and education. Whenever possible, assignment managers provide schooling en route to the officer’s
next assignment to meet the special requirements of the position. Civilian educational goals that are specific requirements of positions or career development will also be considered during the assignment process.
(c) Personal and compassionate factors. Personal crises occur in every officer’s career. The OPMD assignment
managers attempt to assist in such circumstances by adjusting the assignment. However, officers should apprise their
assignment manager of such personal or compassionate considerations at the time they occur and not wait until an
assignment action is pending. In some cases, formal requests for compassionate deferment from assignment or request
for reassignment are needed. Officers should coordinate with local soldier support activity for processing such
documents. Officers with family members having special needs should enroll in the Exceptional Family Member
Program.
(d) Overseas equity. Overseas equity must be a consideration when selecting officers for assignments. With the
Army serving in a variety of overseas locations, the equitable distribution of OCONUS and unaccompanied tours
among all officers is a morale concern as well as a developmental experience in many branches and FAs. Overseas
tours broaden the professionalism of the officer corps, and assignment managers consider this element of tour equity in
each assignment action.
3–15. Individual career management
The OPMS with its combination of branch, FA, and branch/FA generalist assignments results in multiple career
patterns. The OPMS allows the extremely technical career management fields to provide specific leader and technical
training for company grade, field grade, and WOs. Negotiating through this multitude of possibilities to meet the needs
of the Army and the important needs of the individual is the result of interaction among the individual officer, the
commander, the proponent and the OPMD assignment manager. Each has an important part to play in the career
development of not only individual officers, but of the officer corps as a whole.
a. The individual. In many respects, officers are ultimately their own career managers. While Army requirements
dictate the final outcome of all career development actions, in every case the officer must participate in such decisions.
Participation in the career development process is possible at the basic branching/career management field designation
point, volunteering for training and education programs, selection of FA, preferences for career field, application for
entry into special programs and long–range planning of career goals. The key is to be involved in career development
by making informed and logical decisions and acting on them. One important element of an officer’s involvement is
the accurate reflection of capabilities in the official personnel management files maintained by HQDA. The official
military personnel file (OMPF), the DA Form 4037 (Officer Record Brief) (ORB), and the career management
individual file (CMIF) contain the data from which important career development decisions are made for selection,
advancement, assignment and retention. Officers should review, update, and maintain these records throughout their
careers. Officers should also request periodic advice and counseling from commanders, supervisors, senior officers and
AHRC career managers to remain informed of career opportunities and to assess progress achieving career goals.
b. The commander. Commanders play a critical part in development by understanding the roles of all their officers,

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

23

their education and development needs and incorporating them into a unit Officer Professional Development (OPD)
process. All officers look to their rater, senior rater, and mentors for advice and career counseling. Some counseling is
official, such as the preparation and submission of DA Form 67–9 and DA Form 67–9–1 (Officer Evaluation Report
Support Form). Other forms of counseling are often unofficial and relate to career patterns, advice about assignments
and duty positions. Regardless of the type of counseling, commanders should be factually informed before rendering
advice. This pamphlet contains many of the career development facts that commanders need to give wise counsel.
c. The proponent. Proponents design life cycle development models for their branches, FA and MOS and monitor
the overall career development of officer populations. Logical and realistic career patterns, qualifying objectives, and
an accurate understanding of attrition and promotion flows are vital ingredients in each branch or FA. Leader
development action plans and life cycle development models should be constructed to meet overall Army requirements
as well as branch, FA and career field objectives. Constant contact with the officer population and the OPMD
assignment branches should be sustained to communicate goals and objectives of the branch and FA.
d. The Officer Personnel Management Directorate’s assignments manager. Assignment and career managers at
AHRC OPMD are responsible for fulfilling current and future Army requirements while meeting the career development needs of the various branches, FAs and career fields. Additionally, they balance the best interests of the
individual officers against the Army requirements. Career managers can provide candid, realistic advice to officers
about their developmental needs. As the executors of Army and proponent programs, they operate within the existing
policy, budget and legal framework to make decisions concerning assignments, schooling, manner of performance and
subjective evaluations of competitiveness for selection and retention. All officers should stay in touch with their
assignment managers to receive guidance and advice on career development.

Chapter 4
Officer Education
4–1. Scope
a. Training and education requirements. Common training requirements apply to all officers and specify the skills,
knowledge and attributes required of every officer. Other training and education requirements for branch, FA or skill
codes apply to officers in a particular specialty.
b. Training and education methods. Officer education occurs in institutional training, in operational assignments and
through self–development. Institutional training represents the resident training an officer receives in military and/or
civilian institutions. Self–development encompasses non–resident schooling including individual study, advanced distributive learning, research, professional reading, practice and self–assessment.
4–2. Officer Education System transformation process
a. Strategic objective. The strategic objective of the OES transformation is to create an education and training
system operationally relevant to the current force, but structured to support the Future Force by producing more
capable, adaptable and confident leaders through continuous investment in personal growth and professional development throughout their careers. To achieve this objective, the Army will embed an experiential and competency–based
education and training model in its education system. This model will integrate current technological capabilities to
rapidly advance learning in both individual and collective training requirements while providing Army leaders the right
training and education in the right medium, at the right time and place for success in their next duty. This model will
support our service culture and Warrior Ethos and produce leaders who can resolve dilemmas under stress, make
decisions, and lead formations. The institutional side of the Army will become a series of leadership laboratories
focused on learning, growing, achieving competency, and getting better training into units.
b. Transformation focus. Just as the Army transforms to the Future Force to meet the challenges of the 21st century
security environment, so too will the Army transform its education system in order to train and educate the leaders who
will command and lead that force. Transformation of the OES is based on a documented rationale for change, including
findings and recommendations from the Army Training and Leader Development Panel (ATLDP) officer studies. The
Army will implement 3 high payoff institutional training and education initiatives for officers. For LTs, the Army will
transition from traditional OBC to BOLC. The CCC is currently under review and will change as part of OES
transformation. For MAJs, the Army transitioned from the Command and General Staff Officer Course (CGSOC) to
ILE. The new course provides the right education, in the right medium, to the right leader at the right time and place.
This strategy meets the Army’s needs and officer expectations, and develops full spectrum leader competencies across
all grades.
(1) The BOLC is a group of courses designed to develop technically competent and confident leaders, regardless of
branch, who are grounded in leadership and field craft, are physically and mentally strong, and embody the Warrior
Ethos. To achieve this objective, BOLC capitalizes on experience–based training, logically structured to build upon and
reinforce previous lessons. The BOLC is conducted in 3 phases. BOLC I is the precommissioning phase and

24

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

encompasses all military training conducted by the traditional precommissioning sources. The purpose of precommissioning training is to educate and train cadets/officer candidates, assess their readiness and potential for commissioning/
appointment as junior officers, and prepare them for progressive and continuing development. Pre-commissioning
training qualifies individuals to serve as officers by providing the foundation of common core skills, knowledge, and
attributes desired of all newly commissioned officers. After commissioning/appointment, officers attend BOLC II.
BOLC II is a common block of instruction designed to further develop all new Army Competitive Category (ACC) and
special branch officers into competent small unit leaders with a common war fighting focus and Warrior Ethos. It
accomplishes this through a 6–week, field intensive training course that offers challenging and realistic leadership
opportunities. BOLC II is purposely designed to allow new junior officers to receive integrated instruction with officers
from other branches of the Army. Upon completion of BOLC II, officers progress to BOLC III, a course of branchspecific technical/tactical training conducted at branch school locations. The length of this phase varies according to
individual branch requirements. BOLC will benefit the Army by increasing the maturity; confidence and competence of
its officers, and by producing officers who have a common bond with their combined arms peers and are ready to lead
small units upon arrival at their first assignment. The Army projects that BOLC will be fully implemented in the 4th
quarter of FY 2006.
(2) The Army’s program of formal education for CPTs is under review and will change as part of OES Transformation. The review has recently resulted in termination of CAS3 for active component officers, and absorption of the
CAS3 POI into existing CCC POIs and Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL). The ongoing RC CAS3 classes across
the U.S. and overseas, as well as the advanced distributed learning classes will continue. USAR will continue to teach
CAS3 for the foreseeable future. The Army Training and Doctrine Command will continue to work with the Army
National Guard and Office of the Chief of Army Reserves to develop alternatives to existing RC OAC and CAS3
courses. The future CPTs OES, which is still evolving, will continue to have a branch and combined arms focus,
address JPME learning areas specified in the CJCS Officer Professional Military Education Policy (OPMEP), and
retain training on company command and staff competencies. Emphasis will be placed on assignment-tailored training
focused on specific primary staff positions, realistic scenario- driven command training, and minimal time away from
the family. The new course will leverage learning technologies, be less than six months in length, and be linked to the
next duty assignment.
(3) The 3rd OES Transformation initiative, ILE, will provide all CPTs and MAJs who have between 8 and 12 years
of service with the same common core of operational instruction, and additional tailored education opportunities tied to
the officer’s specific career field/branch/FA. The ILE is designed to provide a quality, tailored education, linked to the
OPMS, to prepare officers for their next 10 years of service. This program of instruction will produce field grade
officers with a Warrior Ethos who are grounded in warfighting doctrine, and who have the technical, tactical, and
leadership competencies and skills to be successful in their respective career fields. The common core curriculum is
delivered in residence at Fort Leavenworth for operations career field officers, selected FA officers, selected RC
officers, and the traditional complement of sister service and international officers. Generally, officers in the other
career fields and special branches will attend the common core course at one of several campus sites, known as
"Course Locations," where qualified Command and General Staff College (CGSC) faculty will instruct them. RC
officers may attend The Army School System (TASS) classrooms located in CONUS and overseas, or take the core
curriculum via an advanced distributed learning course (ADL) course. To complement the core course and obtain
career field credentialing, officers in the information operations, operational support, and institutional support career
fields attend respective FA qualification courses. For a small number of proponents, this tailored educational experience also includes advanced civil schooling (ACS). Officers in the operations career field attain career field credentialing through attendance at the follow-on, seven month Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course (AOWC) at Fort
Leavenworth that focuses on planning and executing full spectrum operations at the tactical and operational levels.
History, leadership, and Joint instruction will continue to receive heavy emphasis throughout the curriculum. Simulations will be used extensively to drive the learning, and multiple opportunities will be provided for officers to practice
their warfighting competencies and skills. This learning model will send field grade officers back to the Army better
prepared to run staffs, support commanders, mentor junior officers, and eventually command battalions and brigades.
The result will be a significant improvement in the tactical and operational warfighting capability of Army and Joint
staffs. As the Future Force education courses indicated above are implemented, this pamphlet will be updated to reflect
those changes. Until that time, the information presented in subsequent paragraphs will remain valid.
4–3. Current Force paths to officer education.
Current force educational models will be followed in parallel with Future Force models during the transformation
period between FY 2004 and FY 2007. Current force officers enter active duty with diverse educational backgrounds
and civilian experience. This diversity is amplified by the great variety of service experiences among officers with
different branches and FAs. The current officer education system permits officers to build upon achievements and
experience and progress to a higher level of learning. Opportunities exist for resident and non–resident instruction.
There are multiple paths to obtaining a professional education. Officers may follow different paths to achieve success,
even where they share the same branch, FA or MOS.

4–4. Guides for branch, military occupational specialty or functional area development courses
a. Education requirements are satisfied by both the Army’s military schools and by civilian institutions. The Officer
Basic Course and the branch CCC includes training specific to a company grade officer’s branch. The Command and
Staff College (CSC) and Senior Service College (SSC) provide opportunities for advanced military and leader
development training. The WOBC and WOAC include training appropriate to the officer’s specialty. The WOSC and
WOSSC provide opportunity to enhance functional specialty education. Specialized courses offered by military and
civilian institutions provide additional opportunities for assignment oriented FA and career field education. Other
Services and elements of the Federal Government offer courses that support officer professional development. Advanced education may consist of resident and/or non–resident courses.
b. Numerous courses support both Army requirements and the professional needs of individual officers. It is difficult
to anticipate and specify the many combinations of courses that apply to both Army and individual needs. (However,
representative courses particularly suitable for various branches, MOS, and FAs are discussed in detail in paragraphs
4–7, 4–16, and 4–17. Also, see branch and FA specific chapters in this pamphlet.)
c. Functional area training is discussed below.
(1) Functional area training develops in an officer the necessary skills and technical qualifications to perform the
duties required of an FA. Courses of study leading to graduate degrees at civilian colleges and universities can meet
these needs.
(2) The Army’s objective is to have all officers receive instruction qualifying them in their FA. This is accomplished
through either temporary duty (TDY) and return or TDY en route during an officer’s permanent change of station
(PCS).
d. The primary reference for Army courses is DA Pam 351–4. Most of the courses listed in the FA chapters include
course identification numbers that are assigned an established code. (These codes are explained in DA Pam 351–4, para
1–8.) The references listed below can assist officers in planning their FA development:
(1) AR 350–1.
(2) Reserved.
(3) AR 621–1.
(4) AR 621–7.
(5) DA Pam 351–4.
(6) DODD 5010.16–C.
e. Detailed information, including enrollment procedures for correspondence courses, is included in DA Pam 351–4.
In many cases, correspondence courses paralleling the numbered resident courses listed in DA Pam 351–4 are
available. The correspondence courses represent an important alternative means of career field development to many of
the resident courses because of their flexibility and convenience.
f. DA Pam 351–4 lists some of the applicable DOD courses. More complete listings of such courses appear in DOD
5010.16–C, indexed both by function and by responsible institution.
g. Occasionally, a course may be found under an Army number and the number of another Service and listed in
more than one catalog. A few of the courses listed have no numbers. In such cases, officers may want to contact the
responsible school for pertinent descriptive material.
h. While the Army recognizes the value of all correspondence courses, the only non–resident courses that qualify for
award of a military education level (MEL) designation for Active Army officers on the ADL are the U.S. Army War
College Distance Education Course for MEL 1 and the Command and Staff Course (CSC) non–resident courses for
MEL 4. Although some phases of WO MEL training are/can be completed by non–residence, WOs must complete the
resident portion to be considered MEL complete.
i. The Army Training Requirements Resource System (ATRRS) is the Army system of record for training. This
system allows officers to research information regarding different schools and courses. The system is also used to track
enrollment and interfaces with personnel systems to record the completion of courses.
j. Active Army soldiers are encouraged to attend Total Army Training Study (TATS) courses taught at Total Army
School System (TASS) battalions. These courses are resident courses. These are different from Reserve Component
Configured Courses (RCCC), which are not treated as resident courses.
4–5. Non–resident schools and instruction
a. All officers are encouraged to further their branch, MOS, or FA education through appropriate courses of
non–resident instruction. The successful completion of a given level of non–resident instruction is considered on an
equivalent level of attainment to, but does not rule out, future attendance at a resident course of instruction. An
exception is enrollment in the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course, which does rule out attendance at a
resident Senior Service College.
b. Equivalent level of attainment means that an officer who has reached a specific military education level through
non–resident instruction receives the same consideration in assignment, promotion and future schooling as an officer
whose military education level was reached through resident instruction. Officers who do not have the opportunity to
attend a resident course should complete the level of professional military education appropriate to their grade through
26

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

non–resident instruction. There is no equivalent level of attainment for the OBC/WOBC where resident participation is
required.
c. Non–resident instruction allows officers to advance their professional education and their careers, thereby enhancing their overall performance and potential. Military school courses available through correspondence, with and without
a resident phase, are listed in DA Pam 351–20, ATRRS, the Total Army School System (TASS), and the TRADOC
online library.
4–6. Educational counseling
The numerous educational opportunities and frequent moves in the Army often make it difficult to plan educational
programs. Officers frequently need professional educational counseling and should turn to their mentor, rater, assignment officer in OPMD, their local Army Education Center or an education counselor at the appropriate service school.
The WOCC is another excellent source for WO education counseling. Another excellent resource for all officers is
their individual commanders and supervisors. In addition, many civilian institutions provide counseling services.
4–7. Military schools
a. Basic Officer Leadership Course. Upon commissioning, an officer is assigned a career branch in which the
emphasis for training and development during the officer’s first 7 to 8 years of active duty occurs. Graduates of all
commissioning sources receive training in their assigned or detailed branch at a BOLC immediately after commissioning. The BOLC prepares newly commissioned officers for their 1st duty assignments with instruction on methods for
training individuals, teams, squads, and platoons. In addition, the course includes sufficient instruction to provide
officers with an understanding of the environment of the company, battery or troop including tactics, organization and
administration. Officers receive training on most LT–level common and branch tasks in BOLC II and III. There is no
active duty service obligation for BOLC II and III attendance.
b. Branch detail program. Upon commissioning, selected LTs branched Signal, Quartermaster, Ordnance, Transportation, and Finance are detailed to a combat arms branch for a minimum of 2 years or longer if assigned to a life cycle
unit. Selected Military Intelligence and Adjutant General officers are detailed for 4 years. LTs under the branch detail
program attend the OBC and participate in branch specific training for the branch to which they are detailed. On
completing the detail, officers attend a 4–week branch transition course before they return to their designated branch.
Officers in the 4–year program receive transition branch training in conjunction with their enrollment in the CCC. All
officers continue to participate in branch specific training once they are reassigned back to their designated branches.
c. Captains Career Course. The branch CCC prepares company grade officers to command and train at the
company, battery or troop level and to serve as staff officers at battalion and brigade levels. There is a 1–year active
duty service obligation for attendance at a branch CCC.
d. Command and Staff College.
(1) The ILE is the Army’s formal education program for MAJs. It is a tailored resident education program designed
to prepare new field-grade officers for their next 10 years of service. It produces field grade officers with a Warrior
Ethos, a Joint, expeditionary mindset, who are grounded in warfighting doctrine, and who have the technical, tactical,
and leadership competencies to be successful at more senior levels in their respective career fields. ILE consists of a
common core of operational instruction offered to all officers, and additional tailored education opportunities tied to the
requirements of the officer’s branch or FA. Completion of the 3-month common core ILE course results in Intermediate Staff College (ISC) and Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) 1 designations.
(2) To be eligible to attend a Command and Staff College (CSC), officers must be senior CPTs or higher with
between 8 and 12 years of officer service, and have less than 14 years of Active Federal Commissioned Service
(AFCS). Additionally, officers must have graduated from or have credit for completing a branch CCC.
(3) The majority of operational career field officers will attend ILE at Fort Leavenworth, KS. However, some
officers attend the Navy, Marine, or Air Command and Staff Colleges, the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security
Cooperation (WHINSEC), or a foreign school that has been granted ILE equivalency. School selections result from a
comparative appraisal of all eligible officers, including a careful review of these elements: the scope and variety of
tasks performed and how well they were performed, the degree or level of responsibility, the trend of efficiency up or
down, intelligence and independent judgment in implementing decisions, and an estimate of potential. Officers selected
for attendance at other than the Army Intermediate Staff College must first attend the ILE common core at a course
location site, TDY enroute. Operations career field officers will receive qualification course credit upon completion of
other than Army Intermediate Staff Colleges i.e. international of sister service schools, and will be credentialed ILE.
Other than Operations career field officers may attend international and sister service schools, but must still attend their
respective qualification courses to be credentialed ILE.
(4) The Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP) is a yearlong resident course taught by the School of
Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) at the US Army Command and General Staff College. The purpose of the AMSP
is to provide the Army and the other services with specially educated officers for command and general staff positions
at tactical and operational echelons. The program provides its graduates an advanced education in the military arts and
sciences focused at the operational level. Additionally, the program provides training in the practical skills needed to
plan and conduct battles, major operations and campaigns and in adapting doctrine and techniques to the changing
DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

27

realities of war. Applicants must be ILE qualified or resident students in ILE or sister service resident programs. There
are 84 (60 Army, 24 RC, other Service and international officers) students selected for attendance each year. The
Director, SAMS, accepts applications from August through October of each year.
e. Senior Service College.
(1) The Senior Service Colleges (SSCs) are at the apex of the military schools system and award MEL 1 credit.
SSCs prepare officers for senior command and staff positions within the Army and DOD. These colleges include the
Army War College, the National War College (NWC), the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF), the Naval
War College, the Air War College, the Inter-American Defense College (IADC), other accredited international senior
military service colleges, or any one of approximately 20 civilian and military fellowship programs.
(2) Each year the Army sends 6 or 7 Senior Service College selectees to the Advanced Operational Art Studies
Fellowship (AOASF) at the Army Command and General Staff College’s School for Advanced Military Studies to be
trained for subsequent assignment as theater level planners. The Air Force and Navy Departments send one officer each
to provide a Joint perspective to the student body. Allied officers are also enrolled to provide a multinational
perspective. Army and Marine Corps officers stay at SAMS for 2 years; Air Force, Navy, and allied officers stay for
only 1 year. AOASF focuses on the skills and knowledge required for campaign planning in and between theaters of
war across the entire spectrum of conflict.
(a) The focus of the first academic year is on planning and operations at the theater strategic level at unified,
component, and Joint task force level headquarters. Students follow a rigorous set curriculum, with emphasis on
national security strategy, military theory, strategic studies, military history, and campaign planning.
(b) Second year fellows serve as seminar leaders for the Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP) seminars,
coordinate operational level Exercise Prairie Warrior planning, and perform other duties such as the revision of FM
100–5. Upon completion of the fellowship, fellows are normally assigned to multinational, Joint, and component staff
positions associated with operational level planning.
(3) Officers who have completed 16 years AFCS, have credit for ILE schooling, do not have more than 23 years
AFCS as of 1 October of the year of entry into the college, and are serving as LTCs or COLs as of the board’s
convening date are eligible to attend an SSC. The annual Army SSC Selection Board selects officers on a bestqualified basis. Branch and FA floors, based on Army requirements, are considered during the SSC selection process.
There is a 2-year active duty service obligation for attendance at resident MEL 1 schooling.
(4) The U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course provides an alternate means of attaining MEL 1
schooling. Eligible officers who apply are compared against the most current promotion list to COL and most current
SSC Selection Board Order of Merit List (approximately 1,300 names) to determine the final slate. AR 350–1 describes
the details of the selection and application processes. The course is the only non–resident program that results in the
awarding of MEL 1 upon completion. Once officers have enrolled in the correspondence course, they are no longer
eligible for resident SSC attendance.
(5) Only resident attendance at SSCs or completion of the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course
awards MEL 1 credit.
f. Joint Professional Military Education.
(1) The JPME program is a Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) approved body of principles and conditions that prescribe, at
both the CSC and SSC levels, the educational requirements for Joint Specialty officer nomination. The Command and
Staff Colleges and Senior Service Colleges encompass only one phase (phase I) of JPME. The Armed Forces Staff
College (AFSC) conducts the final phase (phase II) of the JPME program for those officers who have attended resident
CSC or SSC schooling. The NWC and the ICAF curriculums encompass the entire JPME program.
(2) The JPME program prepares field grade officers to work effectively with other members of the Armed Forces
and other Federal agencies and is designed to accomplish the following objectives:
(a) Provide officers a broad base of Joint professional knowledge.
(b) Develop officers whose professional backgrounds and military education improve the operational excellence of
Joint military forces throughout the spectrum of war.
(c) Improve the quality of military strategic thought.
(d) Develop officers skilled in attaining unity of effort across Service, agency and national lines.
(3) Eligibility requirements for attendance at NWC and ICAF are outlined in paragraph 4–7e.
(4) The majority of officers attending NWC and ICAF can expect to have follow–on Joint assignments.
g. Warrant Officer Candidate School. All WO candidates (Active Army and RC) must attend the resident WOCS.
The WOCS graduates are conditionally appointed to warrant officer one, grade WO1. Appointment is contingent upon
certification by the MOS proponent that the WO is technically and tactically qualified to serve in the authorized
warrant officer MOS.
h. Warrant Officer Basic Course. Upon graduation from WOCS and appointment to WO1, each officer will attend
functional specialty training. The WOBC is a functional specialty development course taught at various proponent
schools that prepares newly appointed officers for their assignments as WO1. Training is performance oriented and

28

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

focuses on technical skills, leadership, effective communication, unit training, maintenance operations, security, property accountability, tactics, and development of subordinates. WOBC graduates are recognized by MEL code 7. Branch
proponents are responsible for developing and updating WOBC training and technical certification standards.
i. Warrant Officer Advanced Course. The Warrant Officer Advanced Course (WOAC) is MOS–specific and builds
upon the SKA developed through previous training and experience. The course provides officers the leader, tactical,
and technical training needed to serve in company and higher-level positions. WOAC training consists of 2
components:
(1) Prerequisite studies. A non–resident phase administered by the WOCC. This phase includes training in common
skills needed by all WOs regardless of MOS. It includes instruction in staff skills and roles, communicative arts,
decisionmaking, quantitative skills, personnel service support, staff leadership and management, training management,
mobilization, and tactical sustainment. The course objective is to enhance and sharpen communicative and staff skills,
which help prepare the officer for the resident WOAC and subsequent CW3 assignments. Officers on the ADL will be
automatically enrolled in this course at about the 6th year of WO service. Officers who are not enrolled by their 6th
year of WO service should contact their career manager at AHRC. Army Reserve WOs will be scheduled for
attendance shortly after promotion to CW2.
(2) Resident course. CW2s are eligible to attend their MOS WOAC. Active duty list WOs will attend the advanced
course at their respective proponent school not later than 1 year after promotion to the higher grade. National Guard
warrant officers complete this training prior to promotion to CW3. Army Reserve warrant officers not on the ADL
must complete this training prior to selection for CW3. The branch phase varies in length depending on the branch.
Primary focus is directed toward leadership skill reinforcement, staff skills, and advanced MOS–specific training. The
course consists of in-depth training in MOS- specific and branch–immaterial tasks. Graduates of the WOAC receive the
designation of MEL 6.
j. Warrant Officer Staff Course. The WOSC is a resident course conducted at the WOCC. This course focuses on
the staff officer and leadership skills needed to serve in the grade of CW4 at battalion and higher levels. The course
which includes instruction in communication skills, staff skills and relationships, problem solving and decisionmaking,
educates and trains officers in the values and attitudes of the profession of arms and in the conduct of military
operations in peace and in war. CW3s are eligible to attend the WOSC. ADL warrant officers will complete this course
not later than one year after promotion to CW4. National Guard warrant officers will complete this course prior to
promotion to CW4. Army Reserve warrant officers will complete this course prior to selection to CW4. WOSC
graduates are recognized by MEL code 4.
k. Warrant Officer Senior Staff Course. The WOSSC is the capstone for WO professional military education. It is a
branch immaterial 2–week resident course conducted at the WOCC. The WOSSC provides a master level professional
WO with a broader Army level perspective required for assignment to CW5 level positions as technical, functional, and
branch systems integrators and trainers at the highest organizational levels. Instruction focuses on “How the Army
Runs” and provides up–to–date information on Army level policy, programs, and special items of interest. CW4s are
eligible to attend the WOSSC. ADL WOs will complete this course not later than 1 year after promotion to CW5.
National Guard WOs must complete this course prior to promotion to CW5. Army Reserve WOs will complete this
course prior to promotion to CW5. Graduates are recognized by MEL code 1.
4–8. Department of Defense and Department of State schools
Based on Army requirements, OPMD may designate officers to attend courses at schools operated by the Department
of Defense, Department of State and Foreign Service Institute.
4–9. Foreign schools
Each year, based on quotas received by the U.S. Government, approximately 30 qualified officers are selected to attend
26 foreign schools in 15 different countries as students. AR 350–1 contains a list of the foreign schools that U.S.
officers attend. Foreign Area Officers receive preference for most of these schools.
4–10. Language training
More than 50 language courses are offered to meet Army requirements for officer linguists. The majority of these
courses are longer than 20 weeks, requiring the officer to PCS to a Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California,
or Washington, D.C. Officers are language trained only if being assigned to a language coded position. Officers trained
at Government expense test in that language every year and are expected to maintain their proficiency at a 2/2 level as
measured by the Defense Language Proficiency Test.
4–11. Aviation training
All aviation officers attend initial entry flight training in conjunction with their officer basic course (WOBC/OBC).
Company grade officers may volunteer for initial entry flight training in rotary wing aircraft under the provisions of
AR 611–110. Aviation qualification and transition training is based on worldwide aviation requirements. Aviators

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

29

requiring additional skills normally receive training during a permanent change of station (PCS) move. All officers may
volunteer for aircraft specific or MOS–specific training. Course descriptions and prerequisites are in DA Pam 351–4.
4–12. Pre-command course
The pre-command course (PCC) is the Chief of Staff, Army’s program. It prepares selectees for command by providing
a common understanding of current doctrine and by providing both new and refresher training in selected functions and
duties. PCC attendance is mandatory for all centrally selected battalion and brigade commanders. The PCC program
goal is to ingrain warfighting and combined arms thinking into commanders. Branch and specialty schools focus on
tactical and technical proficiency, system proficiency and hands-on training. The Fort Leavenworth PCC focus has a
broader base that provides up-to-date information on the Army wide level of policy, programs and special items of
interest. Combat arms brigade and battalion commanders and selected combat service support commanders attend the
Tactical Commanders Development Course (TCDC), designed to improve their ability to synchronize combat power on
the battlefield. Combat arms brigade and battalion commanders and direct support field artillery and engineer battalion
commanders also attend the Battle Commanders Development Course (BCDC) following TCDC. The focus of BCDC
is battle command: the art of battle decisionmaking, leading and motivating soldiers and their organizations into action
to accomplish missions at least cost to soldiers. Army Special Operations forces officers attend the Army Special
Operations forces PCC and the Joint Special Operations Forces Pre-Command Course (JSOFPCC) to train command
selectees in current doctrine, organizations and capabilities, training management, leader development and command
responsibilities. Selected officers are also scheduled for language training and the Senior Officer Legal Orientation
(SOLO) Course. Officers are scheduled by OPMD for PCC training as dates and locations for command are
determined.
4–13. Other military schooling
Many military school courses provide the knowledge or skills necessary for a specific assignment. Officers may apply
for these courses or are scheduled by OPMD, HRC for such courses to qualify for a specific assignment. Complete
information on such courses is contained in DA Pam 351–4.
4–14. Application for military schools
Officers do not apply as students to centrally selected military schools. They receive automatic consideration for
centrally selected schools when they enter the appropriate zone of eligibility (except those officers who have completed
the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course). Officers may apply for training through their assignment
officers if they desire training en route to the next assignment or through their command channels if TDY and return to
the installation is appropriate. OPMD, HRC may automatically schedule such training if necessary for the position.
4–15. Service obligation
a. Attendance at military courses of instruction or civilian education programs at Government expense will incur a
service obligation. AR 350–100 governs all service obligations to include which courses of instruction result in an
active duty service obligation, what the policies and procedures are for computing service obligations and how service
obligations are fulfilled. Policies in AR 350–100 take precedence over other Army publications if there is a conflict.
b. An active duty service obligation (ADSO) differs from a requirement to be assigned to an Army Educational
Requirements System (AERS) position. An ADSO is a specific period of active duty that an officer serves before
eligible for voluntary separation. Assignment to an AERS position may be required in addition to the ADSO for the
Army to derive the greatest benefit from Government sponsored civilian education. AR 621–108 specifies the types of
education that require assignment to an AERS position.
4–16. Civilian education
a. The Army Advanced Civil Schooling program has 2 objectives: to meet Army requirements for advanced
education and to provide selected officers the opportunity to satisfy their educational aspirations.
b. Company grade officers are required to obtain a baccalaureate degree from a qualifying educational institution
prior to attending the CCC.
c. Officers should take advantage of opportunities for advanced education and should consider their civilian
education background when determining their qualifications for study in a given discipline. Officers who want to
pursue advanced degrees should do so in an academic discipline that supports their designated branch, FA, or MOS.
On completion of schooling, officers are assigned by grade, branch, FA, MOS, civilian education level (CEL), and,
when possible, academic discipline (or related discipline set) for initial utilization in an AERS validated position. In
this manner, specific Army requirements are satisfied while simultaneously contributing to the professional development of the officer corps and the satisfaction of an officer’s educational aspirations.
d. The appropriate proponent determines academic disciplines that support each branch, FA, or MOS.
4–17. Education programs
Officers may pursue full–time studies toward a master’s or doctoral degree through either fully funded or partially

funded programs or a bachelor’s degree through the Degree Completion Program. Officers are encouraged to pursue
advanced degrees particularly when there is an opportunity to do so in coordination with resident training such as CSC
and SSC. Officers with liberal arts undergraduate degrees should not be dissuaded from their pursuit of graduate
education in the sciences. Available education programs are discussed in general below. (AR 621–1 governs specific
civil school programs.)
a. Fully funded programs. Under these programs, the Army pays all tuition costs and reimburses officers up to $600
per FY for textbooks and supplies. In addition, the Army provides officers with full pay and allowances and moves
officers and their families to the college or university of study. Normally, the period of schooling does not exceed 18
months. Officers may not draw veterans’ benefits concurrent with fully funded education.
(1) Advanced degree program. Selected officers attend graduate school to meet specific Army requirements established by the AERS. On completing graduate studies, officers are assigned to AERS positions according to branch or
FA, grade and appropriate academic skills. Utilization assignments are for 1–3 years. Officers can also expect future
1–3 year utilization assignments to capitalize on the knowledge gained through participation in this program. Primary
zone of consideration to attend graduate school normally occurs on completion of the CCC, with sufficient basic
branch or MOS experience, and 6 to 8 years of Active Federal Commissioned Service (AFCS); but no later than the
17th year of service.
(2) Short course training. Tuition funds allocated to organizations are available for unprogrammed training that is
needed for current job performance when the training is less than 20 weeks and is in subjects for which the Army has
no in-house training capability.
(3) Fully Funded Legal Education Program (FLEP). The Judge Advocate General’s (TJAG) Funded Legal Education Program provides instruction leading to a law degree at an approved civilian school at Government expense
(normally 3 academic years) for up to 25 selected company grade officers each FY. Upon completion, the officer
accepts an appointment in the JAGC for the period of the active duty obligation incurred under the provisions of AR
27–1, chapter 14, and AR 350–100. The FLEP is the only approved program currently available for Army officers to
study the legal profession. Program participants perform on–the–job training duties under the supervision of a Staff
Judge Advocate (SJA) or legal officer designated by TJAG when school is not in session for 5 days or longer. Program
participants who do not finish school, or fail to pass the bar exam after 2 attempts, return to service in their basic
branch.
(4) Training With Industry . This program provides training in industrial procedures and practices not available
through military service schools or civilian education. TWI provides officers with vital knowledge, experience and
perspective in management and operational techniques to fill responsible positions in Army commands and activities
that normally interface with civilian industry. It provides the trainee an opportunity to grapple with real problems
inherent to the business environment. Currently, these programs are concentrated in the areas of transportation,
procurement, logistics management, research and development, public affairs, banking, communication-electronics,
advertising and marketing, physical security, artificial intelligence and automation systems. The programs are normally
10 months with a predetermined follow-on assignment focusing on the experience gained. AR 621–1 provides
information on application procedures.
b. Partially funded programs. Under these programs, the officer bears the cost of all tuition, fees and textbooks.
Many officers elect to use their in-service veterans benefits (if applicable) to help defray educational costs. The Army
provides officers with full pay and allowances and moves officers and their families to the school location if the
schooling is 20 weeks or more. Participants attending schools for less than 20 weeks attend in a permissive TDY
status. After their branch notifies officers that they are accepted into the program, it is their responsibility to select and
be accepted by an accredited college or university.
(1) Degree Completion Program (DCP). This program authorizes officers up to 18 months of full-time civilian
education to complete undergraduate or graduate degree requirements. Officers who lack an undergraduate degree are
encouraged to pursue studies on their own; however, the Army can assist by providing up to 1 year to allow
completion of the degree. Company and field grade officers pursuing an advanced degree must agree to study in an
academic discipline that supports their branch or FA (or, in some cases, a designated skill). The primary zone of
consideration for the graduate level is the 5th through the 17th year of service.
(2) Cooperative degree programs. Selected students attending schools such as the Command and General Staff
College (CGSC), the Logistics Executive Development Course (LEDC) at the Army Logistic Management College,
and certain Senior Service Colleges (SSCs) are offered the opportunity to participate in various courses conducted by
cooperating civilian institutions. Attendance at these courses is concurrent with the military schooling. After graduation, officers are authorized up to 12 months to complete graduate degree requirements as full-time resident students at
the civilian institution. Those attending SSC normally pursue studies during the summer school sessions immediately
before and after the military course. In all cooperative degree programs, officers pay for educational costs.
c. Fellowships, scholarships, or grants. According to AR 621–7 eligible officers may apply for permission to accept
fellowships, scholarships or grants offered by corporations, foundations, funds or educational institutions. Participation
in such programs normally does not exceed 1 year and incurs an ADSO.

4–18. Tuition assistance
Eligible officers pursuing off duty undergraduate or graduate civilian education courses may apply for tuition assistance
under the provisions of AR 621–5. If approved, the Army pays up to 100 percent of tuition costs. Individual officers
pay all other amounts, such as fees for registration and matriculation and the cost of books and supplies. Participants
agree in writing to remain on active duty for a minimum of 2 years after completing the course or courses. (See AR
621–5, paragraph 2–9b(1))
4–19. Eligibility criteria and application procedures
a. Since many elements of the programs discussed in this chapter differ, officers should consult the governing Army
regulations for the specific eligibility criteria and application procedures.
b. Selection for full-time civil schooling is governed by the needs of the Army; the officer’s demonstrated
performance, and his or her academic background. Officers pursuing a graduate degree should choose a discipline that
fulfills the professional development requirements of the officer’s designated branch, FA, or MOS. In addition,
applicants must have completed the CCC. Since selection for full-time schooling programs is based in part on the
availability of the officer, OPMD retains schooling applications until the applicant withdraws from further consideration or becomes ineligible by virtue of military performance or years of service. Officers selected for Advanced Civil
Schooling should expect a utilization assignment immediately after graduation. Officers who attend fully funded
educational programs are normally subject to recoupment if, prior to completing their required service obligation, they
separate from the Army voluntarily or involuntarily.

Chapter 5
Officer Promotions
5–1. General
This chapter covers the active duty promotion system for officers through the grade of COL. This system constitutes a
vital aspect of military personnel management affecting each officer and, therefore, must be legally correct and
logically sound. Further, it must be administered fairly and equitably; to do otherwise would jeopardize the effectiveness of the officer corps.
5–2. Promotion process objectives
a. Though the specific procedures for selecting officers for grade advancement have varied over time, the objectives
of this process have remained constant:
b. Ensure advancement to the higher grades of the best-qualified officers.
c. Meet Army branch/MOS/FA and grade requirements.
d. Provide career incentive.
e. To promote officers based on the whole person concept and potential to serve in the next higher grade.
f. Although not an objective, identifying and eliminating ineffective officers is another result of the promotion
process.
5–3. Statutory requisites
The objectives of the promotion system are consistent with statutory requisites and the realities of the Army structure
and authorizations.
a. The legal basis for the officer promotion system is contained in 10 USC. This law prescribes strength and grade
authorizations, promotion list components, promotion procedures, and separation procedures resulting from non–selection. The statutory requirements of 10 USC have been promulgated through regulatory, directive, and policy means in
the establishment and administration of the promotion system.
b. The DOPMA became effective 15 September 1981. The DOPMA was a major revision to 10 USC and is now the
basis for the management of the company/field grade officer corps. In 1984, the DOPMA provisions of 10 USC were
amended to overcome certain unintended consequences of the original act and to give the Service secretaries more
flexibility in limiting eligibility for promotion consideration. The current law:
(1) Establishes statutory limitations on the number of officers who may serve in senior grades.
(2) Provides common law for the appointment of RA officers and for the ADL service of Reserve officers.
(3) Provides uniform promotion procedures for officers in the separate Services.
(4) Provides common provisions governing career expectation in the various grades.
(5) Establishes common mandatory separation and retirement points for regular commissioned officers.
(6) Increases the amount of separation pay for officers separated involuntarily short of retirement.
(7) Provides related authorities to manage the officer force under the revised personnel system.
(8) Increases the flexibility of Presidential authority under mobilization in times of declared crisis.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

c. The WOMA was passed into law as part of the Fiscal Year 1992/1993 National Defense Authorization Act and
went into effect on 5 December 1991. WOMA is a major revision to Title 10 of the USC and has become the basis for
the management of the active duty WO corps. The current law established:
(1) Single promotion systems for warrant officers.
(2) Tenure requirements based upon years of WO service.
(3) The grade of CW5.
(4) Authorization for the Secretary of the Army, to convene boards to recommend, retirement-eligible warrant
officers, for selective mandatory retirement.
5–4. Active duty list
a. Background. The DOPMA and WOMA revised the laws providing for the establishment of separate RA
(permanent) and Army of the U.S. (AUS) (temporary) lists and established a single, consolidated ADL. The DOPMA
and WOMA, as revised, provide for the following:
(1) Establishment of an initial active duty list. No later than 6 months after 15 September 1981, all officers of the
Army serving under Chapter 36 of Title 10 USC as amended by DOPMA (except for those identified in 10 USC 641)
will be placed on the ADL in the same relative seniority that they held on 14 September 1981. Pre–WOMA relative
seniority was determined according to seniority criteria outlined in AR 600–8–29, chapter 1, and was primarily based
on the AUS date of rank a WO held on 4 December 1991.
(2) Adjustment to the active duty list. Adjustments to the ADL are made to maintain the relative seniority among
officers of the Army as it existed on the day before the effective date of the law. Under provisions of Title 10 USC
741, the Secretary of the Army did establish and/or adjust the ADL date of rank (DOR) of any company/field grade
officer who was serving on active duty on 14 September 1981. Any RA or USAR officer, who on the effective date of
DOPMA (15 September 1981) was serving on active duty in a temporary (AUS) grade that was equal to their
permanent (RA or USAR) grade, was awarded an ADL date of rank equal to that held in their AUS grade. WOMA
provided for the establishment of an initial ADL that placed all warrant officers of the Army serving under Title 10,
USC, in the same relative seniority, which they held on 4 December 1991.
b. Current law. As required by 10 USC, the Army maintains a single ADL on which officers are to be carried in
order of seniority. They are considered for promotion, each time a selection board is convened to consider officers in
an established DOR zone of consideration for their competitive category. The provisions of Title 10 USC 741 and 742
relate to rank among officers of the same grade as follows:
(1) Establishes relative rank of the various officer grades.
(2) Provides that rank among officers of the same grade or equivalent grade is initially determined by date of rank.
An officer with an earlier date of rank is senior to an officer with a later date of rank.
(3) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army have prescribed rules for breaking date-of-rank ties and
general rules for establishing dates of rank when breaks in service, service credit and placement on the ADL
determinations must be made. DOR and rank/precedence criteria have been published in AR 600–8–29, chapter 2.
(4) To maintain the relative seniority among warrant officers of the Army as it existed on the day before the
effective date of the law, the Secretary of the Army established/adjusted the ADL on 4 December 1991. Any RA or
USAR WO who, on the effective date of WOMA, was serving on active duty was awarded an ADL date of rank equal
to the highest grade, temporary (AUS) or permanent (USAR or RA), he or she had achieved.
5–5. Promotion process
a. Title 10 USC provides for a single promotion process of all officers on active duty and on the ADL, regardless of
their component. Active duty Reserve officers serving on the ADL are no longer considered by Reserve boards.
b. The effect of the 10 USC/DOPMA/WOMA on the tenure and retirement opportunity for officers is shown in table
5–1.
c. The WOMA mandated a single promotion process for all warrant officers on active duty and the ADL, regardless
of their component. The requirement for WOs to be recommended by 2 different selection boards (temporary and
permanent) for promotion to the next higher grade was eliminated. On 5 December 1991, WOs serving on active duty
assumed as their permanent grade the highest grade, temporary (AUS) or permanent (USAR or RA), they had held.
Active duty reserve officers serving on the ADL are no longer considered by a reserve board.

5–6. Army grade structure
a. The distribution of grades at MAJ and above is controlled by 10 USC and may be further constrained by
Congress, the Office of the Secretary of the Army, or the Chief of Staff, Army. Although 10 USC is subject to revision
and modification, the basic concept remains unchanged. In effect, the by–grade number of field grade officers allowed
depends on total officer authorized strength levels, which are based on the total size of the Army and prescribed by the
Secretary of the Army.
b. The distribution of grade CW5 is established and controlled by 10 USC and WOMA and may be further
constrained by Congress, the Office of the Secretary of the Army, or the Chief of Staff of the Army. Although Title 10
and WOMA is subject to revision and modification, the basic concept remains unchanged. In effect, the number of
CW5 positions depends on the total WO authorized strength level. The total number of WO authorizations is based on
the size of the Army and is prescribed by the Secretary of the Army.
5–7. Promotion flow
a. Changes in authorizations, losses and promotions to the next higher grade create fluctuations in both the time in
service (TIS) and time in grade (TIG) at which promotions occur. Under ideal circumstances, each qualified officer
would advance through the grade structure with some degree of predictability. However, a relatively standardized
promotion flow does not occur consistently due to expansion and contraction of the Army, changes in promotion
policies and variations in officer losses each year.
b. Title 10 USC establishes minimum TIG requirements for promotion to the next higher grade as shown in table
5–2.
c. The promotion timings, as stated in Department of Defense Instruction 1320.13 are expressed in terms of the
years of Active Federal Commissioned Service (AFCS) at which promotion occurs. The promotion opportunity
(DOPMA rate), as stated in DODI 1320.13, is the percentage of total selects over the eligible in the zone population.
Promotion timing and opportunity objectives are shown in table 5–2.
d. Changes in authorizations, losses, and promotions to the next higher grade create fluctuations in the point within a
WO’s career at which promotions occur. Under ideal circumstances, each qualified WO should advance through the
grade structure with some degree of predictability. This relatively standardized promotion flow is not consistently
obtainable due to expansion and contraction of the Army, changes in promotion policies, and variations in WO losses
each year.
e. WOMA establishes minimum time in grade (TIG) requirements for promotion to the next higher grade. The WO
promotion flow objective may be expressed in terms of years at which, WO service promotions occur. History has
consistently revealed that rapid promotions, in terms of reduced time in grade, have occurred during periods of force
expansion. Conversely, promotions have always slowed down when force reductions occur. The current WO promotion
flow objectives are shown in Table 5–2.

5–8. Below–the–zone promotions
The below–the–zone or secondary zone promotion capability is designed to allow the accelerated promotion of
outstanding officers who have demonstrated performance and indicated potential clearly superior to those who otherwise would be promoted. Below–the–zone promotions apply only to promotion to the grades of CW3, CW4, CW5,
MAJ, LTC and COL. Officers will receive only one below–the–zone consideration per grade. By law, the number of
officers recommended for promotion from below–the–zone may not exceed 10 percent of the total number recommended; except that the Secretary of Defense may authorize that percentage to be increased to not more than 15
percent. Army policy sets the Army Competitive Category (ACC) below–the–zone promotion capability at 5.0 to 7.5
percent. Note that AMEDD, Chaplain Corps and The JAGC are not part of the ACC.
5–9. Competitive categories
Each officer on the ADL is grouped in a competitive category for promotion as authorized in Title 10 USC and
prescribed in DOD Directive 1320.12. Competitive categories are established to manage the career development and
promotion of certain groups of officers whose specialized education, training, or experience, and often relatively
narrow utilization, make separate career management desirable. Officers in the same competitive category and career
field (see para 8–1b) will compete among themselves for promotion. There are 6 competitive categories for company
grade officers: the Army Competitive Category includes all branches and FAs other than the special branches; Chaplain
and Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) are in separate categories; and the Army Medical Department has a category for the
Medical and Dental Corps and a category for all other Medical Department branches. There are 9 competitive
categories for field grade officers; 3 additional due to career field designation. There are 2 competitive categories for
the WO corps, technical and aviation warrants.
5–10. Impact of Officer Personnel Management System evolution
With the implementation of OPMS revisions, changes have occurred in company grade, field grade, and warrant officer
personnel management. These changes affect only Army Competitive Category officers and warrant officers.
a. Promotion plan. As part of OPMS, the Army defines primary and secondary zones of consideration for field
grade promotions by basic year groups. The in–the–zone population, or primary zone, is usually established by the
dates the first and last due course officer was promoted from a specific year group. A due course officer is one who
has been on continuous active duty since commissioning as a second lieutenant (2LT) (O–2) and who has neither failed
selection for promotion nor been selected for promotion from below–the–zone. This primary zone is accessed into the
Army, and at times shaped, to achieve a promotion opportunity (table 5–2) that is relatively similar over a period of the
next 5 years. This procedure has become known as the 5–year Field Grade Promotion Plan. OPMS revisions have not
changed this policy.
b. Decentralized selections. The officer’s local commander approves promotion to first lieutenant (1LT) (O–1) and
CW2. Normally, the battalion commander promotes with the recommendation of the company commander. Although
the promotion is thought of as being automatic upon completion of a specific period of active duty, the promotion is
based on an officer’s demonstrated performance. Officers who fail promotion to 1LT and CW2 are generally released
from active duty or discharged.
c. Centralized selections. Officers promoted from CPT through COL and CW3 to CW5 are selected by HQDA

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

35

centralized boards. Selection boards are asked to recommend fully or best qualified (as appropriate) officers from an
inclusive zone of consideration (ZOC). The ZOC includes officers from above, in and below the promotion zone.
When the number of officers being considered exceeds the maximum number to promote, the boards operate under
best–qualified criteria. Centralized boards, except CPT, are provided minimum promotion requirements (floors) by
branch, FA or area of concentration to ensure the Army’s skill and grade mix balances with its needs. Recommendations are based upon branch, MOS, and FA competency, the potential to serve in the higher grade and the whole person
concept. Factors considered include—
(1) Performance.
(2) Embodiment of Army Values.
(3) Professional attributes and ethics.
(4) Integrity and character.
(5) Assignment history and professional development.
(6) Military bearing and physical fitness.
(7) Attitude, dedication, and service.
(8) Military and civilian education and training.
(9) Concern for soldiers and families.
d. Special branches. Promotion within special branches (AMEDD, Chaplain Corps and JAG Corps). The officer
promotion system reinforces all other personnel management programs to acquire and retain the right number of
officers, with the proper skills, to meet the Army’s needs. The objective of promotion within the special branches is to
maintain an orderly promotion flow that replaces losses, meets changing requirements, and recognizes uneven attrition
rates within these competitive categories. Provisions of the system include mandated floors by branch, FA or AOC and
the optional employment of selection ceilings. Selection opportunity may vary among competitive categories based
upon projected requirements in the higher grades
e. Instructions to promotion boards. Each board receives a Memorandum of Instruction from the Secretary of the
Army providing guidance for the selection process. Copies of these memorandums are released to the officer corps
following approval and public release of the board results. That portion pertaining to specialization has been expanded
significantly to indicate that, in today’s Army, the specialist has a significant role and responsibility. The instructions
highlight the need for the different officer professional development patterns required for accomplishing the Army’s
total mission. Instead of a single traditionally accepted career pattern through various grades, multiple paths for
advancement exist as the Army recognizes divergent Service needs and individual capabilities. Further, instructions to
promotion boards prescribe that promotion potential will be determined, for the most part, based on an officer’s record
of performance in their designated branch or FA and the officer’s overall performance.
f. Promotion board membership. Personal qualifications, experience, and performance determine promotion board
membership. The MACOM commanders recommend board members (COL and below) from lists provided by the
HQDA Secretariat for Selection Boards of eligible candidates who meet qualifications in a broad spectrum of military
fields. Following policy guidance from the Secretary of the Army, membership is designed to adequately reflect the
skills, commands and diversity of the competitive category under consideration. The Director of Military Personnel
Management, ODCS,G–1, approves the final slate of members on behalf of the Secretary of the Army. The Chief of
Staff, Army, approves general officer membership.
g. Special selection boards. Special selection boards (SSBs) are convened as required to consider officers with dates
of rank above or in the promotion zone who were erroneously omitted from consideration or whose official records
contained material errors seen by the original board. Erroneous entries or omissions on the Officer Record Brief (ORB)
generally do not justify reconsideration by a SSB. The officer’s responsibility to review his or her ORB at least
annually and the provision of AR 600–8–29 entitling officers in the zone of consideration to submit a letter to the
president of the board are considered sufficient opportunity to overcome minor administrative deficiencies.

Chapter 6
Officer Evaluation System
6–1. Overview
a. The Officer Evaluation System identifies those officers most qualified for advancement and assignment to
positions of increased responsibility. Under this system officers are evaluated on their performance and potential
through duty evaluations, school evaluations and HQDA evaluations (both central selection boards and AHRC officer
management assessments).
b. The assessment of an officer’s potential is a subjective judgment of the officer’s capability to perform at a
specified level of responsibility, authority or sensitivity. Potential is normally associated with the capability to perform
at a higher grade. However, the Army also assesses the officer’s potential for retention and increased responsibility
within a specified grade.

36

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

c. Officer qualifications provide the real link between the needs of the Army and individual officer performance.
They focus on an officer’s background in terms of experience and expertise and include such items as specialty
qualification, successful performance in demanding positions, civil and military schooling and physical profile. Performance is the execution of tasks in support of the organization or Army missions. While results or accomplishment
of a series of tasks is the primary focus, the manner in which tasks are approached and a general adherence to officer
corps professional values are also important. The performance assessment by HQDA differs significantly from that
accomplished in the organizational duty environment. The organizational duty assessment involves personal knowledge
of the situations surrounding a specific performance for a specified period of time. The HQDA assessment is
accomplished by an after–the–fact assessment of a series of reports on performance over a variety of duty positions and
covering the officer’s entire career.
6–2. Officer Evaluation Reporting System
a. The Officer Evaluation Reporting System is a subsystem of the Officer Evaluation System. It includes the
methods and procedures for organizational evaluation and assessment of an officer’s performance and an estimation of
potential for future service based on the manner of that performance.
b. The official documents of these assessments are the OER and the AER.
(1) The performance evaluation contained on the OER is for a specific rating period only. It focuses on comparing
the officer’s performance with the duty position requirements and the standards of the rating officials. Performance
includes the methods or means of effort used by an officer in accomplishing tasks assigned by superiors or implied by
the duty position. The results of his or her efforts or degree of task accomplishment and the degree of compliance with
the professional norms or values that apply to all officers regardless of duty position, grade or specialty.
(2) The potential evaluation contained on the OER is a projection of the performance accomplished during the rating
period into future circumstances that encompass greater responsibilities. The primary focus of this assessment is the
capability of the officer to meet increasing levels of responsibility in relation to his or her peers.
(3) The AER is prepared for officers who take part in resident and non–resident training at service schools and
civilian educational institutions. It explains the accomplishments, potential, and limitations of students while attending
courses. Only one AER is authorized for each reporting period.
c. The OER system is directly linked to the OPMS career field designation process. Raters and senior raters are
required to record an FA and career field recommendation in Parts Vc and VIId respectively on each OER rendered for
an Army Competitive Category (ACC) CPT. These rating chain recommendations, given by rating officials over a
series of OERs, will provide pertinent information for career field Designation Boards.
6–3. Relationship with Officer Personnel Management System, leader development, character
development process
a. The primary function of the Officer Evaluation Reporting System is to provide information from the organizational chain of command to be used by HQDA for officer personnel decisions. The information contained in the OER
is correlated with the Army’s needs and individual officer qualifications. It provides the basis for OPMS personnel
actions such as promotion, career field designation, elimination, retention in grade, retention on active duty, reduction
in force, command and project manager designation, school selection, assignment and specialty designation.
b. An equally important function of the Officer Evaluation Reporting System is to encourage the professional
development of the officer corps. To accomplish this, the system uses the Army’s leadership doctrine to relate teaching,
coaching, counseling and assessing values, attributes, skills and actions to performance and professional development.
The OER also requires rater and senior rater input regarding FAs and career fields, unique/special qualifications and
future positions (Parts Vc and VIId) that strongly support OPMS indoctrination throughout the officer corps. Particularly valuable is the developmental counseling fostered through senior officers linking the Army’s evaluation system to
its leader development and personnel management systems. Developmental counseling is the responsibility of senior
officers to provide feedback concerning professional growth, potential and career pathways to success. While these
aspects of developmental counseling through mentorship have always been a major element of the evaluation process,
they must be continually emphasized.
c. Raters will conduct periodic follow-up performance counseling with rated officer to make needed adjustments to
objectives utilizing the DA Form 67–9–1. For LTs/WO1s quarterly counseling is mandatory; for CPT/CW2, goal is
once around midpoint (3–6 months); field grade and CW3/CW4/CW5 follow-up counseling is on an as needed basis.
d. Raters will conduct mandatory, quarterly follow-up performance/developmental counseling with their LTs/WO1s
utilizing the DA Form 67–9–1A, Developmental Support Form (DSF), to adjust/update performance objectives and
developmental tasks on both the support form and the DSF. The requirement of the box check Part IVd, DSF, is for the
rater to evaluate the rated officer’s compliance with the DSF requirements if the rated officer rates LTs/WO1s. If the
rated officer does not rate LTs/WO1s, the "NA" block should be checked.
e. The Officer Evaluation Reporting System support form process provides further impetus to continual 2–way
communication so that the rated officer is made aware of the specific nature of his or her duties and is provided an
opportunity to participate in the organizational planning process. The rater uses the communication to give direction
and development to subordinates, to obtain information about the status and progress of the organization and to
DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

37

systematically plan for accomplishing the mission. The senior/subordinate communication process also facilitates the
discussion of career guidance with the rated officer, to include the decision process for his or her future OPMS career
field. This enables the rated officer to take advantage of the superior’s experience when making FA, career field or
assignment related decisions.
f. All access to WO1 OERS is restricted after selection to CW3. Restricted access will be accomplished by moving
all WO1 OERS (DA Form 67–9) and associated documents from the ’performance’ ("P") section to the ’restricted’
("R") section of the Official Military Personnel File (OMPF). Simultaneously, the WO1 hard copy OERS and
associated documents will be removed from the career management information file (CMIF). This will effectively
remove from a WO’s performance file, information which, may simply be a reflection of an initial learning curve, and
thereby preclude its use for personnel management decisions later in an officer’s career. These functions will occur
during the month following the release of the CW3 promotion list.
g. All access to 2LT OERs is restricted upon promotion to the rank of CPT. All 2LT OERs are moved from the
performance ("P") section to the restricted ("R") section of an officer’s Official Military Personnel File (OMPF).
Simultaneously, 2LT OERS are also removed from each officer’s Career Management Individual File (CMIF), the file
managed by career managers at AHRC.
h. Completion of Part VIIb, of the Officer Evaluation Reporting System, (DA Form 67–9) is not required for CW5s
being evaluated under the provisions of AR 623–105. Evaluation reports, in the grade of CW5, arriving for processing
at the respective component’s headquarters on or after 1 November 1999, will receive a "not evaluated" label
overlaying the boxes in part VIIb. As an exception to paragraph 3–26c(6), AR 623–105, narrative comments in Parts
Vb and VIIc of this report ( CW5 ) may be handwritten in black ink. In order to be processed and placed on the
officer’s OMPF, reports with handwritten comments must be legible. All other provisions of paragraph 6–4, AR
623–105, concerning narrative gimmicks remains in effect.
i. Part VIIb of the OER (DA Form 67–9) will not be completed for company grade officers (LT and CPT) and WO1
or CW2. The Army’s focus for company grade branch commissioned officers and junior grade warrant officers is on
developing leadership skills, technical management competency and fostering closer unit cohesion. Commanders will
employ expanded developmental plans and counseling tools for all their officers below the MAJ and CW3 levels as
part of a more flexible officer development process documented through the Developmental Support Form (DA Fom
67–9–1A). Senior rater profiling will still be an important tool for use in rating officers at the grades of MAJs and
CW3 and higher.
j. For further information on the Officer Evaluation System, see AR 623–1, AR 623–105, and DA Pam 623–105.

Chapter 7
Reserve Component Officer Development and Career Management
7–1. Introduction
a. This chapter discusses the unique aspects of leader development, professional development and career management of Army National Guard (ARNG) and USAR officers. It also details how Army RC officers are affected by
OPMS revisions.
b. The RC of the Army include the ARNG and the USAR. When not in a Federalized status (under Federal control),
the ARNG comes under control of the states, the territories of Guam and the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico or the District of Columbia. The Army Reserve is a Federal force within DA.
c. The ARNG and the Army Reserve operate under separate and distinct systems according to specific laws and
regulations. However, since the purpose of the RC is to augment the Active Army in times of need, it is imperative that
the implementation of these laws and regulations allow for the seamless integration of RC units and individuals into the
Active force.
7–2. General description of the Reserve Component
a. The RC consists of 3 categories: the Ready Reserve, the Standby Reserve, and the Retired Reserve. All Reserve
and Guard manpower is assigned to one of these 3 categories. This chapter focuses on the Ready Reserve.
b. The Ready Reserve is the largest category in the RC and contains the overwhelming majority of pre–trained
military manpower to augment the Active Army in time of war or national emergency. The Ready Reserve consists of
the Selected Reserve, the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) and the Inactive National Guard (ING).
(1) The Selected Reserve consists of the following:
(a) Units manned and equipped to serve and/or train either as operational or as augmentation units. Operational
units train and serve as units; augmentation units train together, but when mobilized, lose their unit identity, being
subsumed into an active unit or activity. Soldiers assigned to Army Reserve and ARNG units fall into this category,
which is divided into 2 subgroups—
1. Troop program unit Reservists. Trained unit members who participate in unit training activities on part time basis.

38

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

These soldiers are required to perform (drill) 48 Unit Training Assemblies (UTAs) per year and 14 days (15 days for
ARNG) per year in annual training (AT) status. These members are in a paid status while performing these duties.
2. Active Guard Reserve. Active Guard Reserve status is defined as officers serving in an active duty status for at
least 180 days, performing administrative and training duties in direct support of the ARNG and USAR. These are
Guard or Reserve members of the Selected Reserve who are ordered to active duty or full–time National Guard duty
for the purpose of organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing or training the RC units. The primary objective of
the AGR program is to improve the readiness of the RC.
(b) Training pipeline (non–deployable account). The non–deployable account consists of selected Reserve enlisted
soldiers who have not yet completed initial active duty for training (IADT), all officers who are in training for
professional categories, undergraduate flying training, chaplain candidates, health profession students, early commissioning program participants, and cadets enrolled in the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP).
(c) Individual Mobilization Augmentation (IMA) (Army Reserve only). Trained individuals assigned to an Active
Army, Selective Service System or Federal Emergency Management Agency organization’s billet that must be filled on
or shortly after mobilization. Officers assigned to this control group perform at least 12 days of AT each year and are
assigned to a specific duty position in an Active Army unit or organization.
(2) The IRR (Army Reserve only) consists of those Army Reserve Ready Reservists who are not in the Selected
Reserve. The IRR is a manpower pool comprised principally of individuals having had training, having served
previously on active duty or in the Selected Reserve, and having some period of their military service obligation
remaining or another contractual commitment. Members voluntarily may participate in training for retirement points
and promotions with or without pay. Individual Ready Reserve members may be (but are not presently) required to
meet the same training requirements as Selected Reservists. Required training (involuntary) may not exceed 30 days a
year.
(a) Control Group—Annual Training. Ready Reserve officers with a training obligation, but who do not belong to
an Army Reserve unit. They must perform AT when so directed.
(b) Control Group—Reinforcement. All other non–unit Ready Reserve officers not assigned to another control
group.
(c) Control Group—Officer Active Duty Obligor. Active duty officers who are appointed in the Army Reserve but
do not enter onto active duty at the time of their appointment. These officers maintain their obligated status and may be
ordered to active duty or duty with an ARNG or Army Reserve unit.
(d) Control Group—Dual Component. Regular Army of the United States enlisted soldiers or WOs who hold Army
Reserve commissions or warrants.
(3) Inactive National Guard (ING) personnel (ARNG only) consists of National Guard personnel in an inactive
status in the Ready Reserve, not in the Selected Reserve, attached to a specific National Guard unit. To remain ING
members, they muster once a year with their assigned unit, but do not participate in training activities. Inactive
National Guard soldiers are considered mobilization assets of the unit. Similar to other IRR, some ING members have
legal and contractual obligations. Inactive National Guard members muster once a year but may not participate in
training activities for points or pay and are not eligible for promotion.
c. The Retired Reserve is comprised of all Reserve officers and enlisted personnel who receive retired pay on the
basis of active duty and/or reserve service; all Reserve officers and enlisted personnel who are otherwise eligible for
retired pay but have not reached age 60 and who have not elected discharge and are not voluntary members of the
Ready or Standby Reserve; and other retired reservists. All retired members who have completed at least 20 years
active duty (Regular or Reserve), regardless of the retired list to which assigned, may be ordered to active duty
involuntarily whenever required as determined by the Secretary of the Army in accordance with 10 USC 688 or
voluntarily under the authority of 10 USC 12301(d).
7–3. Company and field grade Officer Personnel Management System–Army National Guard and
Officer Personnel Management System–U.S. Army Reserve
a. The purpose of OPMS–ARNG and OPMS–USAR is to effectively and efficiently manage assigned company and
field grade officers through the personnel proponent life cycle development models. The effective implementation of
the RC OPMS increases the effectiveness and professionalism of the Army Reserve and ARNG officer corps by
producing officers who meet the same qualifications as their Active Army counterparts, and who are able to perform
effectively in their branch or FA as a part of the Total Army team. All branches and FAs in the Active Army under
OPMS are open to the RC and are reflected in the RC force structure. One variance from the AC implementation of
OPMS is the career field designation process which requires modification to accommodate ARNG and Army Reserve
unique personnel management considerations.
b. Reserve Component OPMS is the cornerstone of the professional development and utilization programs for all
RC company and field grade officers. Its goal is to develop RC officers in the right numbers and skills to meet the
functional requirements of the Army in the event of mobilization, as well as to develop officers with technical,
managerial, administrative, and leader skills to serve in positions of increasing responsibility throughout the DOD.
While the goals of OPMS for the RC are the same as those for the officer on the ADL, laws and regulations specific to

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

39

the ARNG and Army Reserve affect its implementation. Accordingly, OPMS is divided into 2 subprograms for RC
implementation purposes—
(1) OPMS–ARNG is a function of the state, within the guidance and policies established by HQDA and NGB.
(2) OPMS–USAR is administered by Army Human Resources Command (AHRC)–St. Louis, MO. The AHRC–St.
Louis manages all USAR officers not serving in the Active Army, regardless of the component or control group to
which they are currently assigned. More specific guidance for OPMS–USAR is addressed in AR 135–175 and AR
140–10, and for the Active Guard Reserve Program in AR 135–18.
c. Commanders play a significant role in the development of subordinate officers. With the reduction of personnel
resources, the RC will select only the best-qualified officers for leadership positions. The RC will consider officers for
command and high-level staff positions regardless of their component affiliation. Cross component consideration
ensures that the RC continue to select and train the best qualified officers for these positions.
7–4. Application of Officer Personnel Management System to Army National Guard and U.S. Army
Reserve company and field grade officers
a. Implementation. The implementation of the Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act (ROPMA) in 1996
brought the RC company and field grade officer promotion systems in synchronization with the Active Army. It
established a best–qualified promotion system for RC officers, replacing the fully qualified system previously used.
b. Officer Personnel Management System–Army National Guard. This system identifies positions and officers to fill
those positions. The essential element of OPMS–ARNG is to match the qualifications of the officer with the
requirements of the position as found in authorization documents. Constraints in applying the OPMS system to the
ARNG include the geographical location of the state force structure and the limited size of the state officer inventory.
OPMS–ARNG, when properly executed, develops officers in adequate numbers and assigns officers according to the
needs of the ARNG in each state by considering mission requirements in conjunction with the individual officer’s
competence and desires. OPMS–ARNG provides for the most efficient utilization and maximizes the professional
satisfaction of each officer.
c. Officer Personnel Management System–U.S. Army Reserve. Army Reserve career management and officer development objectives are to—
(1) Develop Army Reserve officers in the required numbers and grades and with the right skills to satisfy the
mobilization requirements of America’s Army, taking maximum advantage of the inherent abilities, attributes and skills
of the individual officer.
(2) Assign officers according to the best interests of the U.S. Army Reserve’s needs and the officer’s competence
and desires. However, the needs of the Army are primary.
(3) Improve the motivation and professional competence of the Army Reserve officer corps.
7–5. Professional development
a. Army National Guard.
(1) The significant difference between OPMS–ARNG and similar systems in the Army Reserve and Active Army is
in the decentralization of OPMS responsibility. OPMS–ARNG is a function of the state within the guidance and
policies established by HQDA and the National Guard Bureau (NGB).
(a) Within those guidelines, the objective is to develop officers in adequate numbers and with the right skills to fully
satisfy ARNG requirements while maximizing and taking advantage of each officer’s inherent skills and abilities.
(b) Duty assignments are made at the state level based on the force structure of the state, officers available to fill
vacancies, unit readiness and geographic considerations.
(c) Appointments, promotions, branch transfers, evaluations, separations and other similar personnel actions are
administered by the state.
(2) Officers, boards, commanders and personnel managers should be aware of the uniqueness of the RC environment and the implications of citizen soldiering. The concepts of equivalent assignment and constructive credit must be
understood. There are numerous leadership positions within the state ARNG structure that do not fall into the
traditional definition of TOE/TDA command. LT level through general officer level leadership and command positions
should be recognized, desired as potential assignments, and considered in promotion and selection board procedures.
There are also TDA staff positions that equate with battalion and brigade staff positions. These are considered
equivalent positions.
(3) Many ARNG officers are leaders in industry, the community and in the corporate world. Many positions in
corporations provide training and experience not only useful to the military but closely related to military specialty
skills Officers at all levels should be sensitive to the relationship between civilian occupations and training and military
skills. Being the financial officer for a corporation certainly provides evidence of qualification as a military finance
officer. Leadership in a civilian occupation provides evidence of potential for military leadership positions. These are
examples of constructive credit possibilities that should be considered in determining an officer’s qualification for
branch and FA designation, and award of areas of concentration and skills. Army regulation 611–1, chapter 4 provides

40

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

guidance for evaluating civilian education and occupation experience in the classification of ARNG officers. Officers
may also apply for constructive or equivalent credit for military education courses in accordance with AR 135–155.
(4) The Officer Personnel Classification Board (OPCB) can determine an officer to be qualified in his or her duty
position, however, the officer may not be considered fully qualified until meeting other related criteria in this pamphlet
(for example 12 months service in an FA assignment or 36 months as a commander). The officer does not have to be
considered fully qualified in his or her BR–AOC or FA–AOC to be considered for favorable personnel actions.
Additional requirements beyond the mandatory military education for award of the area of concentration AOC will not
preclude the officer from being promoted or reassigned.
b. U.S. Army Reserve. The development of the professional attributes and capabilities of Army Reserve officers to
meet the mobilization needs of the Army is known as officer professional development. While Army Reserve officers
share the same mission as their AC counterparts, the unique nature of the Army Reserve soldier’s role as a
citizen–soldier poses a challenge for professional development. However, Army Reserve officers are expected to follow
AC officer development patterns as closely as possible, except that Army Reserve officers, in some instances, have
increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. To meet professional development objectives,
Army Reserve officers may need to rotate among TPU, IRR, and the Individual Mobilization Augmentee Program.
These transfers are necessitated by geographical considerations, as well as the need to provide as many officers as
possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions. Additionally, there may be occasions
when officers should transfer to the IRR while they complete mandatory educational requirements. Such transfers will
be temporary and should not be seen as impacting negatively on the officer’s career. The success of an officer is not
measured by length of service in any one component or control group, but by the officers breadth of experience, duty
performance and adherence to branch and functional requirements.
7–6. Professional development processes
The basic processes of officer professional development are as follows:
a. Leader development.
b. Rotation of assignments, to include planned and progressive assignments between components and control
groups.
c. Continuing education (military and civilian).
d. Branch transfers and FA/skill alignment.
e. Civilian acquired skills.
f. Evaluations.
g. Promotions.
7–7. Leader development
a. The RC leader development program develops the values, attributes, skills and knowledge of ARNG and Army
Reserve soldiers to meet the mobilization needs of the Army. Reserve Component officers must be properly trained in
order to perform effectively in the event of mobilization. The development of RC officers is a continuous, progressive,
and sequential process made up of 3 pillars— institutional training, operational assignments, and self–development.
(1) Institutional training. There are varieties of schools, both resident and non–resident, that provide the RC officer
with military educational opportunities. These educational programs, which are designed to increase and update the
professional knowledge of each officer, have the secondary goal of satisfying promotion and assignment prerequisites.
Officer military education requirements are shown in table 7–1 (for exceptions, see AR 135–155 and NGR 600–101).
Operational experience through duty assignments augments what has been learned in the formal education process. To
the maximum extent possible, RC officers receive operational assignments that allow them to apply the knowledge and
leadership skills learned in institutional training. This is especially critical for company grade officers and junior
warrant officers. Junior officers should be assigned to troop units. This phase in development is critical to developing
leadership competencies and instilling the Army Values necessary in the officer corps. Careful planning and programming by agencies, commanders and the individual officer is essential to maximize the career potential and efficient use
of officer skills, knowledge, and attributes. Experience gained through challenging and varied assignments enhances
officer development and provides trained officers able to meet the dynamic needs of the RC.
(2) Operational assignments. The assignment and transfer of officers is a collective effort between the career
management officer, the officer and his or her unit. The applicable TOE or TDA prescribes the grade, branch, and
MOS requirements for positions to which officers may be assigned. In the RC environment, assignment options are
constrained by the force structure and demographic and geographic limitations. For these reasons, RC officers may
need to accept assignments throughout the Selected Reserve. Reserve Component officers must also realize the
possibility of occasional and temporary transfers to the IRR, especially in conjunction with the completion of
Professional Development Education (PDE) requirements. These transfers provide the officer an opportunity to complete required studies without the distraction of a troop assignment and allow other officers the opportunity to gain
troop leadership experience.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(3) Self–development. Each officer has a responsibility for professional development from the time of commissioning or appointment. Individual study, reading, research and interpersonal skills development and assessment are critical
parts of leader development. AGR, Active Duty for Special Work (ADSW), and Key Personnel Upgrade Program
(KPUP, ARNG only) are ways to enhance that development.
b. Although it is not specifically one of the domains of leader development, mentorship is the foundation upon
which these domains rest. Mentorship is the act of proactively developing each subordinate through observing,
assessing, coaching, counseling, and evaluating which results in treating people as they should be treated with fairness
and equal opportunity. Mentorship is a critical component of leader development since it is a force multiplier. The
domains of leader development (institutional training, operational assignments and self- development) primarily affect
the officer. Mentorship affects not only the mentored officer; it sets the tone for the relationship that the mentored
officer will have with those he or she will mentor in the future. The importance of mentorship is enhanced by the
limited amount of time that RC officers will spend in units serving under more senior officers who can serve as
mentors.

7–8. Company and field grade officer career management
a. Army National Guard
(1) Career management for ARNG officers is conducted in accordance with HQDA and NGB policy and regulations
and is administered at the state level by authority of the adjutant general. Duty assignments are made at the state level
based on the force structure of the state, available officers, unit readiness requirements and geographic considerations.
Promotions, branch transfers, evaluations, separations and other personnel actions are administered by the state within
HQDA and NGB policy guidance. Appointments, branch designations or changes and promotions require Federal
recognition orders issued from NGB on the recommendation of a Federal recognition board conducted at the state.
(2) The NGB is the conduit between HQDA and the states to ensure that the objectives of OPMS III are fully
incorporated in OPMS–ARNG. The personnel directorate at NGB assists the state adjutants general and their staffs in
administering OPMS–ARNG by establishing policy and guidance reflecting America’s Army systems. The personnel
directorate is the proponent for regulations, policy and procedures governing OPMS–ARNG.
(3) The State Adjutants General oversee the direction and effectiveness of the officer career management programs
in their respective states. This includes the designation of branches and FAs and the awarding of AOC and skills, as
well as the operation of personnel administration. The adjutant general appoints the state officer personnel manager
(OPM), who is the primary representative of the adjutant general in implementing and administering OPMS–ARNG.
The OPM ensures that all aspects of OPMS–ARNG are administered and serves as the principal advisor to the adjutant
general. The OPM maintains the management records, evaluates the requirements within the state, and monitors the
career development of officers available to fill those requirements. The OPM manages the officer inventory.
(4) Leader development should be emphasized as a primary command responsibility. Commanders at all levels assist
in the administration of OPMS–ARNG by:
(a) Coordinating with the state OPM to develop and properly guide the career of officers in their command.
(b) Recommending assignments according to the qualifications, attributes, potential and desires of their officers.
(c) Serving as mentors and conducting periodic evaluations and counseling.
(d) Recommending professional development schools and training.
(5) Unit personnel officers, especially at the battalion level, play a vital role in career management for ARNG
officers by:

42

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(a) Maintaining liaison with the state OPM.
(b) Assisting officers in maintaining their records.
(c) Counseling officers concerning requirements for designation of branches and FAs.
(d) Maintaining the Military Personnel Records Jacket.
(e) Making recommendations to the commander and the OPM for changes to the personnel status of officers.
(6) Official Military Personnel Files (OMPF) for all ARNG commissioned officers are maintained at NGB. The
OMPF is used by DA selection boards when considering ARNG officers for promotion under AR 135–155. The
appropriate State Adjutant General maintains a field military personnel records jacket for each officer.
(7) The individual officer has the final responsibility for ensuring that he or she is progressing to the maximum level
within OPMS–ARNG. The officer establishes goals and evaluates progress, making the adjustments necessary to
achieve personal goals and professional proficiency.
(8) The designation of special branches and the award of AOC for Army Medical Department (AMEDD), Chaplain
Corps, and the JAGC officers is a function of HQDA. At the time of application for appointment, the state requests
predetermination, through NGB, of qualifications in the branch in which the applicant wishes to serve. Special branch
officers may be awarded skill indicators if qualified and essential to the actual or potential assignment as determined by
the adjutant general (see NGR 351–1).
b. U.S. Army Reserve.
(1) Prior to the implementation of OPMS revisions, career management in the Army Reserve was decentralized and
unfocused. Officers assigned to TPUs essentially managed their own careers by establishing relationships with the unit
and command of assignment. Soldiers in the IRR and IMA programs relied upon the Army Reserve Personnel Center
(AR–PERSCOM, the precursor of AHRC–St Louis) for administrative and personnel action support; but, there was no
concerted effort to actively manage the careers of officers. Under the auspices of OPMS, AHRC–St Louis is the
centralized career management agency for all Army Reserve officers not assigned to the Active Army. The key
individual in the career management cycle is the Career Management Officer (CMO). The CMO has the duty of
developing the most professionally competent Army Reserve officers possible by consistently providing meaningful
training opportunities and assignments for officers within their areas of management responsibility. Additionally, the
CMO provides valuable and realistic guidance through individual counseling regarding the officer’s educational
requirements and prospective assignments to career enhancing positions relative to his or her professional development
goals. Officer personnel management ensures that sufficient numbers of highly qualified Army Reserve officers are
available to meet mobilization requirements and to assume positions of increasing responsibility. To accomplish this,
the CMO ensures that the intellectual and professional growth of all officers meets Army needs.
(2) Although the CMO is a key agent in career management, the officer is primarily responsible for his or her own
career. The successful management of Army Reserve officers requires a full and ongoing partnership between the
CMO and the officers he or she manages. It is essential the lines of communication between the CMO and the officer
remain open and bi–directional at all times. Army Reserve officers must fully understand the requirements to remain
highly competitive in the ROPMA environment. Further, officers must take steps to remain mobilization ready at all
times. An Army Reserve officer who is not mobilization ready is not an asset to the Army and will not have a future in
America’s Army.
7–9. Warrant officer career management
Career management is of critical importance to the modern RC WO. Most RC warrant officers have their civilian goals
and projections programmed several years into the future. However, coordinated management of RC warrant officers’
military careers is a recent innovation. The modern RC WO is a complex person with numerous skills and disciplines,
both civilian and military. The need for a thorough, professionally designed leader development plan is both obvious
and imperative. The career RC WO must be well trained to fill his or her mobilization role.
a. Army National Guard.
(1) Army National Guard WO career management is the responsibility of the State Adjutants General.
(2) The National Guard Bureau (NGB) communicates DA policy to the State Adjutants General in all matters
concerning WO career management.
(3) Leader development is a primary command responsibility. Commanders at all levels assist in the administration
of WOLDAP–ARNG by coordinating with the OPM to develop and properly guide the career of each officer in their
command, recommending assignments according to qualifications, aptitudes, potential and desires of their officers,
serving as mentors, conducting periodic evaluations and counseling, and recommending leader development schools
and training.
(4) Organization personnel officers, especially at battalion level, play a vital role in career management for ARNG
warrant officers. The responsibilities of the personnel officer include maintaining liaison with the OPM, assisting
warrant officers in maintaining their records, counseling warrant officers concerning requirements for designation of
MOS and FAs, maintaining the MPRJ, and making recommendations to the commander and the MPMO for changes to
the personnel status of warrant officers.
(5) Warrant officers have the final responsibility for ensuring they are progressing satisfactorily in their professional

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

43

development. They establish goals and evaluate progress, making necessary adjustments to achieve personal goals and
professional proficiency.
(6) The OMPF for all ARNG warrant officers are maintained at NGB. The appropriate State Adjutant General office
maintains a field military personnel record jacket for each WO.
(7) The Adjutant General of the state establishes unit location and stationing.
b. U.S. Army Reserve.
(1) Commanders and personnel management officers (PMOs) are charged with the duty of developing the most
professionally competent USAR warrant officers possible by consistently providing meaningful training opportunities
for the warrant officers within their area of management responsibility. The PMO has training programs available
which are designed to provide a balance of military experience during each USAR WO’s career.
(2) The TPU is one important training vehicle. In the TPU, WOs gain the operational assignment experience
necessary for leader development. In this area, commanders must be closely involved with the developmental process
of their subordinate WOs by offering progressive and sequential assignments and ensuring that appropriate skills,
knowledge, and attitudes are developed.
(3) A balance must be maintained between assignments to TPUs and assignments within the IRR. Diversity of
assignment reduces the probability of narrow, limited training and assignment experience. Stagnation in any category
of assignment can be counterproductive to the development of the individual officer, as well as improperly utilizing the
availability of assignments to enhance the professional capability of the entire WO corps.
(4) In the IRR, the WO is able to update his background by training with the Active Army in progressive career
field assignments. This type of assignment is called “counterpart training.” Individual mobilization augmentee assignments may also be available.
c. Warrant officer management considerations.
(1) Army National Guard. To properly plan for the development and assignment of warrant officers into positions of
increasing responsibility, it is necessary to have an overview of the State force structure and an inventory of WO
positions. States develop a State Master Development Plan (SMDP) as a tool for this purpose. The SMDP allows for
analysis of all MOSs authorized by State force structure documents to determine career progression patterns for warrant
officers within the State. The SMDP is used to determine how many warrant officers in each MOS the Adjutant
General needs to develop. The proper selection, training, and utilization of WOs is dependent on each State’s MOS
requirements. Institutional training must be completed at the appropriate WO career point, the best qualified WOs must
receive progressive operational assignments in recognition of their demonstrated skills, and all WOs must be aware of
their responsibility to achieve the highest possible goals of self–development.
(a) All WOs are assigned according to individual qualifications that are properly documented.
(b) The professional capabilities of all WOs are developed through planned and progressively responsible assignments. This ensures a sufficient number of qualified WOs at all times to accomplish assigned missions.
(c) All WOs have equal opportunity for promotion selection and for higher assignments on the basis of their
demonstrated abilities.
(d) All WOs are aware of the guidelines and expectations in their career planning.
(2) U.S. Army Reserve. Decisions on assignments will be made on the basis of the "whole person" concept and unit
requirements. Military training priorities must be integrated with the officer’s civilian job and personal/community
responsibilities.
(a) The PMO will ensure that the background information on each WO is complete. Each record will be reviewed to
determine the extent and quality of activity during service. Those IRR officers without recent active participation may
be programmed for counterpart training, if available, with an active component unit prior to consideration for
assignment to a troop unit.
(b) Warrant officers serving in the IRR will be considered for reassignment to a TPU or an IMA assignment based
on the following factors. The PMO must ensure that officers have the prerequisite and, when appropriate, civilian
schooling required to prepare them for the reassignment.
1. Availability and type of TPUs within a reasonable commuting distance (AR 140–1), normally within a 50–mile
radius or a 90 minute travel time. Distance is based on travel by car, one way, under normal traffic, weather, and road
conditions over the most direct route to the WO’s home or current residence.
2. Prior experience, both Active Army and RC, and the level of this experience compared to a typical WO of the
same grade, MOS/FA, and age.
3. Career field and level of military schooling or potential to acquire the required skills within 3 years of
assignment.
4. Amount of time the WO can make available for military activities and officer’s preferences for types of
assignments.
7–10. Career management life cycle
a. Warrant officer one. An officer appointed by warrant with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and
position given by the Secretary of the Army. WO1s are basic level, technically and tactically focused officers who
44

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

perform the primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, and advisor. They also
perform any other branch-related duties assigned to them. They also provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance,
and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. WO1s have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions and tasks assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational
responsibility for how well their command performs its mission. WO1s primarily support levels of operations from
team through battalion, requiring interaction with all soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide leader development, mentorship, and counsel to enlisted soldiers and NCOs. The appropriate WOBC must be completed within 2
years of appointment to be a mobilization asset and remain in the ARNG and Army Reserve.
b. Chief warrant officer two. A commissioned officer with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and
position as given by the Secretary of the Army. CW2s are intermediate level technical and tactical experts who perform
the primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, and advisor. They also perform
any other branch- related duties assigned to them. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and
supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. They have specific responsibility for accomplishing the
missions and tasks assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility for
how well their command performs its mission. CW2s primarily support levels of operations from team through
battalion, requiring interaction with all soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide leader development, mentorship,
advice, and counsel to NCOs, other warrant officers and company grade branch officers.
c. Chief warrant officer three. A commissioned officer with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and
position as given by the Secretary of the Army. CW3s are advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform
the primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They
also perform any other branch-related duties assigned to them. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance,
and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. CW3s have specific responsibility for accomplishing
the missions and tasks assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility
for how well their command performs its mission. CW3s primarily support levels of operations from team through
brigade, requiring interaction with all soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide leader development, mentorship,
advice, and counsel to NCOs, other warrant officers and branch officers. CW3s advise commanders on WO issues.
d. Chief warrant officer four. A commissioned officer with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and
position as given by the Secretary of the Army. CW4s are senior level technical and tactical experts who perform the
primary duties of technical leader, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator and advisor. They also perform any other
branch-related duties assigned to them. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision
necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. CW4s have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions
and tasks assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility for how well
their command performs its mission. They primarily support battalion, brigade, division, corps, and echelons above
corps operations. They must interact with NCOs, other officers, primary staff, and special staff. CW4s primarily
provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs, other warrant officers and branch officers. They
have special mentorship responsibilities for other warrant officers and provide essential advice to commanders on WO
issues.
e. Chief warrant officer five. A commissioned officer with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and
position as given by the Secretary of the Army. CW5s are master–level technical and tactical experts who perform the
primary duties of technical leader, manager, integrator, advisor, or any other particular duty prescribed by branch. They
provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties.
CW5s have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions and tasks assigned to them. CW5s primarily support
brigade, division, corps, echelons above corps, and major command operations. They must interact with NCOs, other
officers, primary staff and special staff. They provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to warrant
officers and branch officers. CW5s have special WO leadership and representation responsibilities within their
respective commands. They provide essential advice to commanders on WO issues.
f. Lieutenant. This period of an RC officer’s career is predominantly developmental in nature. The officer is
educated in branch and leadership skills and should acquire maximum practical experience through assignment to troop
units. Basic Officer Leadership Course (BOLC) all phases must be completed within 2 years of commissioning for an
officer to be a mobilization asset and remain in the Army Reserve and ARNG. A baccalaureate degree from an
accredited educational institution is required for promotion to CPT.
g. Captain. Reserve Component CPTs gain advanced leadership experience, be afforded branch development
opportunities and begin development in a Field Artillery. CCC, which may be completed in residence or in a Reserve
Component Configured Course (RC3), is a prerequisite for CAS3 and should be completed before company command.
The minimum grade requirement for attendance at CCC is 1LT. Company command and battalion staff experience are
desired during this period. Branch developmental requirements vary from proponent to proponent. Most proponents
require company level command or key staff experience in branches with limited command opportunity, and completion of CCC for branch development. Completion of CAS3 is a requirement for promotion to MAJ and for subsequent
enrollment in ILE.
h. Major. As a MAJ, the RC officer continues to develop in his or her branch and FA. Utilization in the FA may
occur during this period as the officer acquires staff and leadership experience and knowledge appropriate to levels of

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

45

higher responsibility. Opportunities exist for officers to serve as a company commander, XO or S–3 in an AC unit,
USAR or NG unit. These opportunities warrant the same consideration regardless of whether the unit is AC, USAR or
NG. A qualified MAJ is one who has completed at least 50 percent of ILE or has completed the Advanced Logistics
Executive Development Course/Logistics Executive Development Course (ALEDC/LEDC), as appropriate, for promotion to LTC.
i. Lieutenant colonel. At the LTC level, the RC officer applies the skills in his or her branch or FA in management
and leadership positions of greater responsibility. Senior staff and command experience are desired at this level.
Effective 1 October 1993, LTCs who have not completed CGSOC, now ILE within 3 years of promotion are subject to
removal from active status. Completion of ILE is necessary for assignment as brigade executive officer or brigade S3
and for promotion to COL. Completions of ILE and branch pre–command courses are also required for assignment at
battalion level or higher command positions. The Chief of Staff, Army, may waive the branch PCC requirements for
command. Even with a waiver, the officer still must complete ILE and branch PCC within the 1st year of command or
be subject to removal from command.
j. Colonel. At the COL level, the officer applies the skills in his or her branch or FA in management or leadership
positions of greater responsibility. The HQDA, DOD, and Joint staff, as well as command experience, are desired at
this level. Effective 1 October 1996, Senior Service College became a prerequisite for promotion to general officer.
Officers selected for brigade command have the same branch PCC requirements as battalion commanders.
7–11. Management considerations
a. Army National Guard.
(1) General. To properly plan for the development and assignment of officers into positions of increasing responsibility, an overview of the state force structure and an inventory of officer positions is necessary. States develop a State
Master Development Plan (SMDP) as a tool for this purpose. The SMDP allows for analysis of all branches authorized
by state force structure documents to determine career progression patterns for officers within the state. The SMDP is
used to determine how many officers in each branch, FA, and AOC the adjutant general needs to develop.
(2) Career planning. Orderly career planning provides for progressive duty assignments and military schooling to
meet current needs and develop officer skills for future assignments. The success of the officer career planning and
management program is dependent upon policies and plans that ensure:
(a) All officers are assigned according to individual qualifications that are properly documented.
(b) The professional capabilities of all officers are developed through planned and progressively responsible assignments. This ensures a sufficient number of qualified officers are available at all times to accomplish assigned missions.
(c) All officers have equal opportunity for promotion selection and for higher assignments based on their demonstrated abilities.
(d) All officers are aware of the guidelines and expectations concerning career planning.
b. Army Reserve.
(1) Previous active duty assignments. When evaluating an officer’s active duty assignments, consideration should be
given to the duty positions held by the officer, as well as his or her experience level. Active duty experience should be
capitalized upon by assigning these officers to positions in which they can share their experiences and expertise.
(2) Experience. The officer’s record should be reviewed for previous assignments, the level of assignment, command and staff experience, active duty for training (ADT) assignments, and other RC oriented training.
(3) Military education. The officer’s record should be reviewed for military schools that have been completed.
Enrollment into resident and non–resident schools should be accomplished in a timely manner to ensure successful
completion of military education requirements. Education that incurs a service obligation must be fulfilled in either the
unit that sent the officer or in a like-type unit. Although CMOs are not responsible for ensuring that managed officers
complete the requirements, they play an important role in monitoring the officer’s progress until the course is
successfully completed.
(4) Civilian background. CMOs should evaluate the officer’s civilian education and occupational background for
potential skills, knowledge and attributes that have military applications. Consideration may be given for designation of
a skill identifier for a civilian-acquired skill.
(5) Level of participation. The most critical factor in an officer’s development is his or her willingness to participate
in leader development over an extended period of time. The successful Army Reserve officer keeps his or her CMO
informed of the type of duty, training and education that best conforms to the officer’s attributes, interests and
professional development needs. Although statutory and regulatory requirements for participation in education and
training exist, the Army Reserve remains a volunteer organization. Ideally, every officer participates in educational
opportunities to the maximum extent possible within the funding constraints that exist within the Army Reserve
environment. It is also realized that Army Reserve officers are constrained by civilian employment, family considerations and community responsibilities. However, Army Reserve officers must make every attempt to participate
consistently in training and education opportunities. Failure to do so may result in the officer’s administrative
elimination from the service through either voluntary or involuntary means (board action).
(6) Branch officers serving in command positions. Army Reserve officers must meet branch criteria for the type of

46

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

unit they will command. This requirement is fundamental to our America’s Army concept; therefore, requesting a
waiver from this requirement is strongly discouraged. Officers can request a waiver through their chain of command
and CMO to the Chief, Army Reserve. In the absence of compelling reasons, approval of the request is not likely.
(7) Reassignment–Individual Ready Reserve. Officers serving in the IRR are considered for placement in a TPU
position or an individual mobilization augmentee assignment based upon current position availability and the officer’s
career progression needs. The CMO ensures that officers have the military and civilian schooling necessary for TPU or
individual mobilization augmentee assignments, while taking the following factors into consideration:
(a) Availability and type of TPU within a reasonable commuting distance. Officers are assigned according to
established procedures using the request vacancy system (see AR 140–1 and applicable directives).
(b) Availability and type of individual mobilization agumentee assignments currently available.
(c) Prior experience (both Active Army and RC) and the level of this experience compared to a typical officer of the
same grade, branch, FA and time in service/time in grade.
(d) Career field and level of military and civilian schooling or potential to acquire the necessary skills within 3 years
of assignment.
(e) Obligated members of the annual training control group or Officer Active Duty Obligor (OADO) control group
may be involuntarily assigned to a TPU or individual mobilization augmentee position vacancy.
(8) Reassignment—troop program unit officers. A thorough review of an officer’s file will be completed upon
transfer to the IRR, and the officer should be prepared to discuss future career development needs and type of
assignments desired. Assignments to the IRR should only occur as part of the officer’s career management plan (to
complete PDE requirements), or to alleviate undue family hardship. An officer in the IRR should continue to seek
training opportunities to remain current in branch and/or FA skills.
7–12. Individual mobilization augmentee and/or drilling individual mobilization augmentee
assignments (U.S. Army Reserve)
a. General. Army Reserve officers fill a number of key positions throughout DOD and other governmental agencies.
These positions are used to rapidly expand the agencies during the early phases of mobilization. Pre–selected, specially
qualified officers are assigned to these positions and are trained during peacetime to augment the commands and
agencies to enhance mission accomplishment upon mobilization. These officers are called IMAs/DIMAs and are
assigned to Army Reserve Control Group—IMA in a Selected Reserve status. IMAs are given pre–mobilization
orientation and qualification training for the positions to which they are attached. This is accomplished during 12–day
annual training tours. Officers assigned as DIMA receive an additional 12 days of training per year in an IDT status,
which are performed with their unit or organization of attachment. These tours are coordinated between the unit or
organization, the CMO, and the officer(see AR 140–145 for more on the Individual Mobilization Augmentee Program).
b. Training. Individual mobilization augmentee officers training requirements are coordinated through the gaining
agency. All requests for training in lieu of, or in addition to, annual training tours are submitted on DA Form 1058–R
(Application for Active Duty for Training, Active Duty for Special Work, Temporary Tour of Active Duty, and Annual
Training for Soldiers of the Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve) through the proponent agency to
Commander, AHRC–St. Louis, ATTN: ARPC–PL, 1 Reserve Way, St. Louis, MO 63132. AHRC–St Louis publishes
orders if the unit or organization concurs and funds are available. Units or organizations should provide IMA/DIMA
officers the opportunity to participate by completing projects for retirement credit throughout the year.
c. Federal employees. Federal employees are declared available for mobilization by their employing command or
agency. As IMA officers, DA civilian employees may not hold IMA positions with the same HQDA general or special
staff element in which they are employed. Army Reserve members should report employment conflicts to their
proponent agencies and AR–PERSCOM CMOs when they occur.
7–13. Company and field grade officer education
a. Resident courses. Reserve Component officers are authorized to attend resident Army service schools to become
qualified in their present or projected assignments as funds and allocations allow. Attendance at resident service
schools is the preferred option for all RC officers since it allows for peer–to–peer interaction and an ongoing exchange
of ideas and experiences. It also allows RC officers to interact with their AC counterparts and provide them with
information about the RC. It is understood, however, that not all RC officers will be able to attend all service schools
in residence due to budgetary, time or training seat constraints. For this reason, type of school attendance (resident or
non–resident) is not a discriminator for promotion or duty assignment in the RC. Officers may also attend courses that
contribute to the military proficiency of the unit or enhance their specific abilities. The DA Pam 351–4, as supplemented by pamphlets and directives from the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command and the NGB, provides
information concerning courses of instruction offered at Army schools and various agencies in DOD.
b. Non–resident courses. With the exception of the Basic Officer Leadership Course, military schools may be taken
through non–resident courses, The Total Army School System (TASS) and through correspondence courses. CCC,
CAS3 and ILE are available in both TASS and non–resident versions. The CMOs at AHRC–St Louis (for Army
Reserve) and the State OPM (for ARNG) should ensure that officers are enrolled in military education courses in a

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

47

timely manner to ensure that all RC officers remain fully competitive for promotion and assignment considerations.
Table 7–2 discusses the options available for RC officers to complete their military education and the amount of time
that each officer has to complete the non–resident instruction after enrollment before being dropped from the school.
c. Branch and functional area educational requirements. All RC officers are designated a branch upon appointment.
Branching decisions are made based upon the needs of the Army, although officer preference is considered. Branching
is usually determined prior to commissioning, although RC officers can be rebranched at any time based upon the
needs of the service until they attend BOLC; at which point their branch is fixed. Once an officer has attended BOLC,
he or she cannot be re-branched until they have either attended another OBC or completed other branch development
courses (such as CCC).
(1) Basic Officer Leadership Course. All officers attend BOLC in his or her branch to meet branch development and
mobilization requirements; no alternative training method is available. Although attendance at BOLC immediately after
commissioning is preferable, RC officers must complete BOLC within 2 years of commissioning.
(2) Captains Career Course. Reserve Component officers will generally attend CCC between their 5th and 12th
years of service. While attendance in residence is preferred, RC officers may complete CCC through RC configured
curricula, which normally entail 2 phases (one in correspondence and one in an active duty status). Completion of CCC
is required for branch development.
(3) Combined Arms and Services Staff School. RC officers will generally attend CAS3 between their 7th and 13th
years of service, but only after successful completion of CCC. Attendance at CAS3 is mandatory for enrollment in ILE.
RC officers may attend the 6–week resident school or opt for the 2–phase RC configured curriculum (one phase in drill
status; the other in an active duty status).
(4) Functional area training. Reserve Component officers may apply for FA designation once promoted to CPT.
Although an FA is not a branch, it is an area of specialization requiring additional training or experience. Many courses
provided through the DOD and in the civilian community support FA training and qualification, as does civilian work
experience. For example, some officers are qualified as Operations Research/Systems Analysts (ORSA) in their civilian
profession; yet do not possess the ORSA (FA 49) FA. Since this FA is chronically short throughout the Army, these
officers will be strongly encouraged to apply for it based on their civilian experience. FA selection is therefore based
on such factors as the officer’s experience and abilities, geographical requirements and the needs of the Army. FAs
allow RC officers to broaden the scope of their experience and enhance both their assignment and promotion potential.
d. Intermediate Level Education. This mid–level school prepares MAJs for assignments at the division and Corps
level, as well as Joint assignments. The school is branch non–specific and provides training in the military arts and
sciences, as well as introductory courses in geopolitical issues and on how the Army runs. Reserve Component officers
also receive credit for ILE by attending the resident or non–resident Marine Corps, Navy, or Air Force CGSC and the
Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC).
e. Senior Service School requirements. SSCs provide field grade officers with advanced professional education in
both military and sociopolitical topics. The SSCs, which include the Army War College and university fellowships,
prepare officers for senior leadership positions throughout the DOD.
(1) Field grade refresher courses. Branch refresher courses are conducted by branch proponent schools to provide
current doctrine in branch matters and special subjects for field grade officers. While no credit for promotion is given
for attendance at these courses, the opportunity to update professional knowledge is of great value to RC officers.
(2) Language training. Where a TOE or TDA position requires language proficiency, officers may apply for
language acquisition or sustainment training at either the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, CA, or the ARNG
Language Center. These resident courses are very lengthy, lasting from 25 to 60 weeks.
f. Civilian education. The standard for civilian education for officers in the U.S. Army is a baccalaureate degree.
Most officers commissioned into the RC already have a baccalaureate degree; however, some officers commissioned
through the state Officer Candidate School (OCS) do not. Table 7–3 lists the educational requirements applicable to the
appointment and commissioning of officers without baccalaureate degrees. Effective 1 October 1995, in accordance
with the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1995, a baccalaureate degree from an accredited educational
institution is required for promotion to any grade above 1LT. Army Nurse Corps officers appointed on or after 1
October 1986 must possess a baccalaureate degree in nursing (accredited by an agency acceptable to HQDA) prior to
promotion to MAJ.
g. Other military education.
(1) Total Army School System (TASS). TASS offers CAS3 and ILE to RC officers. Since 1 October 1993, OAC/
CCCs have been offered through the branch proponent schools in RC configured courses. The TASS option offers an
excellent opportunity for completing educational requirements because of the presence of qualified instructors and the
interaction with fellow officers.
(2) Army Institute for Professional Development (AIPD). The Army Institute for Professional Development at Fort
Eustis VA, administers the Army Correspondence Course Program (ACCP). The ACCP provides progressive educational opportunities through correspondence for a wide variety of subjects. This type of military education is particularly well suited for RC officers who cannot take advantage of resident courses. Many courses are targeted at specific

48

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

assignments, such as motor officer, personnel officer or dining facility officer. DA Pam 351–20 contains enrollment
information, addresses and telephone numbers for course coordination.
7–14. Warrant Officer Education System
a. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to outline the methods available to warrant officers in completing military
education requirements and civilian education goals as they progress through their military careers.
b. Military education.
(1) The DA MOS proponents conduct courses in both Active Army and RC configured versions combining
correspondence and ADT phases for most occupational specialties.
(2) Warrant officer training under the Warrant Officer Education System has 5 levels that provide warrant officers
with performance–based certification and qualification training. The Warrant Officer Education System trains and
develops warrant officers for progressively more difficult and complex assignments. The new course titles align more
closely with comparable commissioned officer courses for consistency and ease of understanding by the Army at large.
All warrant officers, supervisors, and commanders must familiarize themselves with the new Warrant Officer Education System and understand the affect on WO leader and professional development. The 5 levels of Warrant Officer
Education System are—
(a) Warrant Officer Candidate School. This course provides candidates with initial WO training. Graduates are
appointed to warrant officer, WO1. Completion of WOBC within 2 years (a 1 year extension may be granted on a case
by case basis) of WO appointment is required.
(b) Warrant Officer Basic Course. This is proponent training that provides MOS–specific instruction and certification following WOCS and is characterized by an increased emphasis on leadership. This course is an ARNG
requirement for promotion to CW2 and an Army Reserve requirement for promotion to CW2 and CW3.
(c) Warrant Officer Advanced Course. This training provides additional training for warrant officers serving at the
company and battalion level and is a 2–phase course consisting of—
1. Warrant Officer Advanced Course prerequisite studies phase. This is a mandatory non–resident course that must
be completed prior to attending resident WOAC training. Effective 1 October 1998, the Action Officer Development
Course (AODC) (ST7000) was adopted as the resource for this distance learning course. It can be completed online via
the Internet, and provides warrant officers serving in CW2 or higher duty positions relevant training in topics such as
management techniques, communication skills, preparing and staffing documents, meetings and interviews, problem
solving, writing, coordinating, briefings, and ethics. In keeping with the Warrant Officer Education System model,
enrollment must occur after promotion to CW2 in order to qualify for WOAC Prerequisite Studies credit. The course
must be completed within one year of enrollment; however, CW2s now have the flexibility to enroll at any convenient
time between 24 and 48 months of total WO service. Completion of the AODC is mandatory requirement for
promotion of all ARNG warrant officers to CW3 including those awarded an MOS that does not have an advanced
course. To enroll online, go to http://www.adtdl.army.mil/cgi–bin/atdl.dll/accp/st7000/top.htm and follow enrollment
instructions.
2. Warrant Officer Advanced Course resident phase. This course is administered and conducted by individual
proponents and is an ARNG requirement for promotion to the grade of CW3. For Army Reserve warrant officers,
successful completion is a requirement for promotion to CW4 and CW5 until 2010 when it will be a requirement for
promotion to CW3 and CW4.
(d) Warrant Officer Staff Course. This common core 5–week resident course prepares warrant officers to serve in
staff positions at the brigade and higher levels. The WOSC is an ARNG requirement for promotion to CW4. (At this
time, WOSC is not a prerequisite for the WOSSC). For Army Reserve warrant officers, successful completion will be a
requirement for promotion to CW4 and CW5 beginning in 2010.
(e) Warrant Officer Senior Staff Course. The WOSSC is a 2–week resident course is conducted at the WOCC, Fort
Rucker, AL, and prepares warrant officers selected for promotion to chief warrant officer, W5, to serve at the highest
level staff positions. (This course is an RC requirement for promotion to CW5).
(3) Correspondence courses. The Army Institute for Professional Development (AIPD) at Fort Eustis, VA is
responsible for the administration of the Army Correspondence Course Program (ACCP). The ACCP provides
progressive education opportunities through correspondence for a wide variety of subjects. This type of military
education is particularly suited for RC personnel who cannot take advantage of resident courses. Many courses are
targeted at specific assignments. DA Pam 351–20 contains enrollment information and addresses/telephone numbers for
course coordination.
(4) Language training. Where the MTOE or TDA position requires language proficiency, warrant officers may
apply for language training at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, CA or the ARNG Language Center in
Puerto Rico.
c. Civilian education. There is a demand for warrant officers with an education beyond high school level to
accommodate the changing technological environment within the Army. The RC WO corps must keep pace with these
changes if it is to meet the challenges of the future. Applicants for initial appointment must meet all MOS–specific
additional civilian education requirements as specified for the particular WO specialty. Applicants whose native

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

49

language is not English must be tested and achieve a minimum raw score of 80 on the English Comprehension Level
Test (ECLT). Civilian education goals are as follows:
(1) The ARNG goal for warrant officers is the attainment of a specialty related associate’s degree or 60 college
semester hours by the 8th year of WO service.
(2) The Army Reserve goal for warrant officers is the attainment of a specialty related associate’s degree or 60
college semester hours by the 5th year of WO service.

7–15. Promotion
Law for promotion automatically considers commissioned officers of the RC who are on the Reserve Active Status List
(RASL) when they have served the required years in grade. AR 135–155 requires that each USAR WO who is in an
active status be considered for promotion at such time as he or she has served the required number of years in grade.
Promotion consideration occurs whether officers are assigned to an ARNG unit, TPU or control group, except for the
Standby Reserve (Inactive) and the Inactive Army National Guard. RC officers assigned to an ARNG unit or USAR
TPU have an additional opportunity for promotion to fill unit position vacancies at such time as they have completed
the education and time–in–grade requirements. Warrant officers in the Standby Reserve (Inactive) and ING are not
considered for promotion. U.S. Army Reserve WOs assigned to TPU have the additional opportunity to be considered
for promotion to fill unit vacancies at such time as they have completed the required years in grade, without regard to
total years of service. ARNG warrant officers are promoted by the State Adjutant General to fill vacancies in ARNG
units. Time in grade requirements for vacancy promotions are contained in AR 135–155, table 2–1. Army Reserve WO
promotion time lines are shown in AR 135–155, table 2–1.1. ARNG promotion time lines are outlined in NGR
600–101, chapter 7.
7–16. Selection eligibility for company and field grade officers
a. General. To be eligible for selection for promotion, an RC officer, other than a WO, not on extended active duty
must:
(1) Be on the RASL.
(2) Be an active member and participating satisfactorily in RC training.
(3) Meet the prescribed military educational requirements shown in table 7–1, paragraph 7–8.
(4) Meet the prescribed civilian educational requirements of 10 USC 12205. The code states that no person may be
appointed to a grade above the grade of LT in the Army Reserve or be Federally recognized in a grade above the grade
of 1LTas a member of the Army National Guard unless that person has been awarded a baccalaureate degree by a
qualifying institution. This does not apply to the following:
(a) The appointment to or recognition in a higher grade of a person who is appointed in or assigned for service in a
health profession for which a baccalaureate degree is not a condition of original appointment or assignment.

50

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(b) The appointment to or recognition in a higher grade of any person who was appointed to, or Federally
recognized in, the grade of CPT before 1 October 1995.
(c) Recognition in the grade of CPT or MAJ in the Alaska Army National Guard of a person who resides
permanently at a location in Alaska that is more than 50 miles from each of the cities of Anchorage, Fairbanks, and
Juneau by paved road, and who is serving in a scout unit or a scout supporting unit.
(5) Meet the prescribed civilian educational requirements of AR 135–155.
(a) Army Nurse Corps officers appointed on or after 1 October 1986 must possess a baccalaureate degree in nursing
from an accredited educational institution prior to promotion to MAJ.
(b) Officers other than Army nurses appointed on or after 1 October 1987 must possess a baccalaureate from an
accredited educational institution prior to promotion to MAJ.
(6) Have served the required time in grade shown in table 2–1, AR 135–155.
b. Reserve appointments. Upon release from active duty, officers with Reserve appointments are transferred in the
grade satisfactorily held while on the ADL and, if accepted, may transfer to an ARNG unit or USAR TPU; otherwise,
they are transferred to the IRR. The officer also retains his or her time in grade. Officers on the ADL selected for
promotion, removed from the ADL before being promoted, and transferred to the RASL in the same competitive
category, shall be placed on an appropriate promotion list for Reserve of the Army promotion without the need for
further consideration. Regular Army officers who leave active service must apply and be accepted for a first–time
Reserve appointment to enter Reserve duty.
7–17. Promotion selection board
a. The minimum military education requirements shown in table 7–1, paragraph 7–8, are a prerequisite for promotion. Since annual selection boards consider officers for promotion far enough in advance of the date on which the
required time in grade will be completed as prescribed in table 2–1 or 2–1.1, AR 135–155, educational requirements,
both military and civilian, must be completed no later than the day prior to the date the board considering the officer
convenes. The promotion board schedule is established annually by HQDA and is adjusted as required.
b. After the board reports its findings and the recommendations receive final approval, each officer will be sent a
letter notifying him or her of either selection or non–selection. This promotion action cannot be accomplished unless
the officer has been found physically qualified for retention and possesses a valid, current security clearance.
c. Selection boards consider the promotion of officers for all grades 1LT to COL. Officers considered qualified and
selected for promotion to 1LT will be promoted when they have completed 2 years service in grade. 2LTs are not
promoted unless they have completed an Army Basic Officer Leadership Course. 2LTs who are not obligated and not
promoted upon completion of 42 months commissioned service are separated.
d. Warrant officers of the ARNG are appointed and promoted by the States under section 8 of the U.S. Constitution.
In order for an ARNG WO to be concurrently promoted and receive Reserve Warrant Officer of the Army designation,
the State promotion action must be federally recognized. To accomplish this process, the promotion action requires the
conduct and examination by a Federal Recognition Board (FRB). The Senior Regular Army Advisor (SRAA) of the
State for the numbered Army Area (CONUSA) commanders appoints Federal Recognition Boards. Appointments to the
Federal Recognition Board are made by authority of the Secretary of the Army. The Secretary of the Army provides
administrative instructions and guidance to be used by the Federal Recognition Board in a memorandum of instruction
to the board. Federal Recognition Boards consist of a total of 3 commissioned officers of the Active Army and the
ARNG who are senior to the officer being considered. The senior member of the board will serve as president of the
board. A minimum of one member (preferably 2) should be in the same branch as the officer to be considered. The
board will consist of at least one minority member as a voting member, if possible, when minorities are being
considered. Normally, at least one female officer will be appointed as a voting member whenever there are females
being considered. When feasible, a commissioned aviator will be included as a member of the board when considering
promotion of aviation warrant officers. Applicants for ARNG promotion are examined IAW NGR 600–101.
e. The Army Reserve CW3 and CW4 selection board selects officers for promotion without regard to vacancies in
the next higher grade using a "fully qualified" methodology. The Army Reserve CW5 selection board selects officers
for promotion utilizing a "best qualified" methodology and considers both MOS and promotion ceilings when
determining who will be promoted to fill the projected vacancies in authorized CW5 positions. Army Reserve selection
boards will be composed of at least 7 members: a BG as board president, 2 COLs, and 4 CW5s. At least 1/2 of all
selection board members will be RC officers not on active duty. Each selection board will consist of at least 1 minority
member as a voting member. Normally, at least 1 female officer will be appointed as a voting member whenever there
are females being considered. Army Reserve unit vacancy boards, when needed, convene on a date announced by
HQDA. Selection boards convene each year as announced by HQDA.

Chapter 8
Introduction to the Officer Career Fields
8–1. Introduction
a. Overview. The Army has structured company and field grade officers in the Army Competitive Category (ACC)
by grouping branches and related FAs into personnel management categories called career fields. Warrant officers are
grouped by related MOS skills also called career fields but which are not synonymous with those career fields
associated with company and field grade officers (see paras 3–5 and 3–6 for more information). From this chapter
forward, warrant officers will refer to branch chapters to find career development and life cycle development models.
b. Career field designation. Officers are designated into a branch or FA in a career field by a HQDA–centralized
selection board immediately following their selection to MAJ. Some FAs will have officers who are career field
designated between the 7th and 10th year of service. The function of the Career Field Designation Board (CFDB) is to
meet Army requirements by designating officers into a branch or FA in 1 of 4 career fields: Operations, Information
Operations, Institutional Support, and Operational Support. The CFDB considers the officer’s preference (forwarded to
AHRC OPMD approximately 6 months prior to the board), rater and senior rater input, officer’s experience and
qualifications and Army requirements.
8–2. Career branches
a. Definition. A branch is a grouping of officers that comprises an arm or service of the Army in which, as a
minimum, officers are commissioned, assigned, developed and promoted through their company grade years. Officers
are accessed into a single basic branch and will hold that branch designation. An accession branch admits officers upon
commissioning; a non–accession branch admits experienced officers from the accession branches. With the exception
of Special Forces and Civil Affairs, all other branches are accession branches. Special Forces branch recruits officers
with a minimum of 3 years experience. (See chapter 15 for further discussion.) Officers will serve their first 8 to 12
years developing the leadership and tactical skills associated with their branch. They will continue to wear their branch
insignia throughout their military service. All career branches are in the Operations career field.
b. Assignments. Through company grade years, most officers will serve predominately in positions from within their
basic branch. Some officers will serve in FA or branch/FA generalist positions (not related to a specific branch or FA)
as a company grade officer. Following career field designation, officers will be assigned to positions within their career
field (basic branch or FA) or to generalist positions. This type of assignment pattern promotes assignment stability and
development within a branch or FA.
c. Branch categories. The branches of the Army are categorized in the paragraphs below. Some branches may fall
under more than one category as noted in AR 600–3, paragraph 3–2.
(1) Combat Arms branches are—
(a) Infantry (11).
(b) Armor (19).
(c) Field Artillery (13).
(d) Air Defense Artillery (14).
(e) Aviation (15).
(f) Special Forces (18).
(g) Corps of Engineers (21).
(2) The combat support branches are—
(a) Signal Corps (25).
(b) Military Police Corps (31).
(c) Military Intelligence Corps (35).
(d) Civil Affairs (RC only) (38).
(e) Chemical Corps (74).
(3) The combat service support branches are—
(a) Adjutant General Corps (42).
(b) Finance Corps (44).
(c) Transportation Corps (88).
(d) Ordnance Corps (91).
(e) Quartermaster Corps (92).
(4) The special branches are—
(a) The Judge Advocate General’s Corps (55).

(f) Army Medical Specialists (65).
(g) Army Nurse corps (66).
(h) Medical Service Corps (67–68).
8–3. Functional areas
a. Definition. An FA is a grouping of officers by technical specialty or skill, which usually requires significant
education, training and experience. An officer receives his or her FA while serving as a company grade officer.
Individual preference, academic background, manner of performance, training and experience, and needs of the Army
are all considered during the designation process.
b. Assignments. Depending on FA educational requirements, professional timelines of the individual officer and
individual preference, officers may serve in an FA assignment during their company grade years after they have
completed branch development requirements. After career field designation, with the exception of the Multifunctional
Logistician Program (FA 90) officers, FA officers not serving in the Operations career field will no longer serve in
their basic branch. Functional area 90 positions are filled by officers from Transportation Corps (Branch 88), Ordnance
Corps (Branch 91), Quartermaster Corps (Branch 92), Aviation (AOC 15D) and Medical Service Corps (MFA 67A);
all of whom remain affiliated with their branch. Functional area 39, FA 51, and FA 90 are the only FAs that afford
command opportunity (see their respective chapters for further discussion).
(1) Psychological Operations (37)
(2) Civil Affairs (38)
(3) Multifunctional Logistician Program (90)
(4) Human Resource Management (43)
(5) Comptroller (45)
(6) Academy Professor, U.S. Military Academy (47)
(7) Operations Research/Systems Analysis (49)
(8) Force Management (50)
(9) Nuclear Research and Operations (52)
(10) Strategic Plans and Policy (59)
(11) Telecommunications Systems Engineering (24)
(12) Information Operations (30)
(13) Strategic Intelligence (34)

(17) Simulations Operations (57)
(18) Foreign Area Officer (48)
(19) Army Acquisition Corps (51)
8–4. Garrison Command Management Program
The Installation Management Agency oversees life cycle functions in Garrison Command Management. Structured,
resourced for and focused on a transformed Army, Installation Management Agency is a field operating agency under
the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management, HQDA. In addition to managing 181 installations Army–wide, Installation Management Agency is the proponent for the Garrison Command Management Program. As the
single point of contact on issues related to garrison command management, Installation Management Agency is actively
engaged in life cycle functions to include garrison force structure; selection criteria for the LTC and COL Command
Selection Lists (CSL); training and education of garrison commanders; development of a professional certification
system; garrison command tour lengths; post garrison command utilization tours; professional development and career
progression of former garrison commanders; and contributing to HQDA guidance to selection boards. Garrison
commanders and staffs are centrally managed from 7 Installation Management Agency regional offices worldwide, all
reporting to the Installation Management Agency headquarters in Arlington, VA. Although wearing the distinctive
Installation Management Agency patch, garrison commanders and staffs are on the 1st team of senior mission
commanders, managing the Army’s power projection and power support platforms while providing home station
support to soldiers, civilians, retirees, veterans, and their family members.

Part Two
Operations Career Field
Chapter 9
Introduction to the Operation Career Field

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

53

The Operations career field (OPCF) comprises officers who embody the Warrior Ethos and the heritage, values, and
traditions of the Army and their respective branches and FAs. The OPCF officers, through career–long professional
development, exhibit the Joint and expeditionary mindset of an Army at war and transforming to a Future Force. Their
expert ability to lead, train, and employ their soldiers and organizations throughout the range of full spectrum
operations demonstrates the Army’s ability to engage and defeat an enemy force. As experts in maneuver, maneuver
support, and maneuver sustainment, OPCF officers, trained, educated and experienced in combined arms operations,
fight and win the Nation’s wars and achieve directed national objectives at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels
of war. The career field coordinator for the OPCF is the CG, TRADOC.
9–1. Unique features of the Operations career field
a. The Operations career field provides the overwhelming majority of opportunities to command units on the
Command Selection List.
b. The unique functions performed by the Operations career field are full spectrum operations at the tactical,
operational, and strategic levels described in FM 3.0 and Joint Vision 2020.
c. A unique feature of the Operations career field is the ILE program for Operations career field officers. All
Operations career field officers will attend CGSC at Fort Leavenworth. After completion of ILE common core, all
Operations career field officers will attend the career field qualification course, the Advance Operations Warfighting
Course (AOWC) also at Fort Leavenworth. Upon completion of both common core and AOWC, the officer will obtain
ILE and JPME 1 certification. As Operations career field officers attend these 2 courses, they should aggressively seek
to complete an advanced degree either through the Master of Military Art and Science Program or through other
advance degree producing programs available at Fort Leavenworth. Some OPCF officers may attend DA G–3 approved
equivalent ILE education in lieu of the resident course at Fort Leavenworth. Selected OPCF officers may also attend
foreign and sister service intermediate level education institutions. OPCF officers attending those courses will receive
credit for AOWC.
9–2. Composition
a. Adjutant General Corps (Branch 42). The Adjutant General Corps officers manage the Army’s military human
resources, systems and functions performed under the human resource umbrella of the DCS, G–1. Duty positions
associated with the Adjutant General Corps exist throughout the Army, and require thoroughly trained and properly
employed officers. They provide the knowledge of military human resource operations, systems, relationships and
interfaces, staff coordination, and provide personnel services and support to the commander and soldiers throughout the
full spectrum of operations.
b. Air Defense Artillery (Branch 14). The Air Defense Artillery employs Army air and missile defense forces
together with Joint and combined arms forces to dominate, enable, and exploit the 3rd dimension of the Joint Battle
Space to win across the full spectrum of operations
c. Armor (Branch 19). Armor officers conduct mobile armored combat operations and engage in the full spectrum of
combat operations. When assigned to armor units, they close with and destroy the enemy using fire, maneuver, and
shock effect. When assigned to cavalry units, they perform reconnaissance, provide security, and complete economy of
force missions.
d. Aviation (Branch 15). Aviation officers employ aviation assets to conduct combat missions to find, fix, and
destroy any enemy through fire and maneuver. Aviation units provide combat support and combat service support in
coordinated operations as a member of the combined arms team. Aviation officers accomplish their mission using both
fixed–wing and rotary–wing aircraft.
e. Civil Affairs (Branch 38 U.S. Army Reserve only). This branch identifies soldiers and units organized, trained, and
equipped to conduct Civil Affairs operations and support Civil–Military Operations (CMO) in Joint, interagency and
multinational environments. Their mission is to expedite military operations by using Civil Affairs generalists and
functional specialists to assess, plan, execute, and transition activities that assist populations and their institutions in
establishing the capability, to deter or defeat threats to civil society. Civil Affairs officers conduct their operations
through, with, or by indigenous populations and institutions (IPI), international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, or other governmental agencies applying all instruments of national power. Civil Affairs officers provide
military capabilities not available elsewhere in the armed forces. These include regional orientation, language,
cross–cultural communication, mediation, and civilian acquired skills. Civil Affairs forms the nucleus of the Army’s
civil-military operations expertise for Army Special Operations forces and conventional forces.
f. Chemical Corps (Branch 74). The Chemical Corps officers provide expert technical knowledge to commanders
and staff and advice to commanders at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels about military operations and
domestic support to civil authorities involving the full range of concerning chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear (CBRN) hazards, which includes CB warfare agents, radiological material, nuclear weapons effects, and
industrial hazardous materials. The primary goal of the Chemical officers is to maximize the warfighters ability to
conduct operations in a CBRN environment by reducing vulnerability and minimizing the effects of CBRN weapons.
This is accomplished by thorough planning and employment of CBRN defense capabilities including individual and
collective protection, biological detection systems, CBRN and hazardous materials (HAZ MAT) reconnaissance,

54

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

warning and reporting of CBRN events, and decontamination or removal of CBRN hazards. Chemical officers also
plan, coordinate, and execute employment of obscurants smoke and flame as to enhance combat power multipliers.
Chemical officers are embedded throughout the force to support Army combat, combat support, and combat service
support units. Chemical officers are involved in combating weapons of mass destruction and force protection programs.
Chemical officers also support other services, domestic CBRN response units and are assigned to the Office of the
Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the Joint Staff, DA staff, combatant command Joint commands and staffs, and Federal
agencies.
g. Corps of Engineers (Branch 21). The Corps of Engineers officers provide the Army and Nation with the
necessary expertise for combat and construction engineering and topographic support on the battlefield; construction
and maintenance of our Nation’s civil works projects; the development and protection of the Nation’s water resources;
and emergency engineering support to the Nation in the event of natural or manmade disasters. Engineer activities
range from planning and executing mobility, countermobility, survivability, and general engineering missions in
support of the warfighting commanders to providing topographic products and terrain analysis in support of military
operations to directing complex military and civil construction programs worldwide. Engineer officers lead their units
to fight as infantry, if required.
h. Field Artillery (Branch 13). Field Artillery officers integrate, synchronize and employ lethal and non–lethal fire
support capabilities in support of Joint and combined arms operations. Field Artillery officers orchestrate the placement
of fires and effects on enemy targets using rockets, missiles, and cannons along with other combined arms and Joint
assets. Field Artillery officers execute this critical fires and effects mission, in many cases, as direct members of
maneuver force units. Field Artillery officers must be intelligent, versatile, adaptive, and tough to ensure they enhance
the efforts of every force they support. Field Artillery officers are proud, relevant, and ready Warriors, disciplined,
flexible, well trained, and fully proficient in their profession as the king of battle.
i. Finance Corps (Branch 44). Finance Corps officers have the critical mission of supporting Army, Joint, coalition,
and multinational operations by paying for local or host nation products or services. The corps fulfills its missions by
providing timely commercial vendor and contractual payments, payment for programs such as weapons for cash,
rewards, and cash for information (HUMINT), banking and currency support, military pay support, non–U.S. pay
support, travel payments, essential cost capturing and accounting information, solatium payments, and process enemy
prisoner’s of war pay and possessions in accordance with the Geneva Convention. Finance officers are the Army’s
financial managers and are usually among the 1st to establish a new theater, as they must lay the critical groundwork of
banking, procurement and contracting support for host nation assistance.
j. Infantry (Branch 11). Infantry officers train and lead units that close with the enemy by means of fire and
maneuver in order to destroy or capture him, or to repel his assault by fire, close combat, and counterattack. Infantry
officers and their units fight dismounted or mounted according to the mobility means provided and the weapons
systems utilized. The Infantry forms the nucleus of the Army’s fighting strength around which the other arms and
services are grouped. When not in combat, the Infantry maintains a state of readiness in preparation for immediate
combat worldwide employment.
k. Military Intelligence (Branch 35). Military Intelligence officers are primarily concerned with the intelligence
aspects of the Army’s mission. This encompasses intelligence, counterintelligence, cryptology and signals intelligence,
security, order of battle, interrogation, aerial surveillance, imagery interpretation, human intelligence, measurement and
signature intelligence, and all related planning organization, training and operations. The primary function for Military
Intelligence officers is the collection, analysis, production and dissemination of intelligence.
l. Military Police Corps (Branch 31). Military Police Corps officers contribute to battlefield success by performing
combat and combat support operations. Combat operations consist of both direct and indirect engagements against
threat forces in contiguous and non–contiguous areas of operation. The Military Police Corps performs 5 main
functions— maneuver and mobility support operations, internment and resettlement operations, area security operations, law enforcement operations, and police intelligence operations. Maneuver and mobility support operations
facilitate in expediting the movement of combat resources throughout the battlefield. Internment and resettlement
operations involve the collection, evacuation, and internment of enemy prisoners of war, high–risk detainees, U.S.
military Prisoners and/or dislocated civilians. Area security operations focus on protecting the force by providing
security for critical sites, assets, high–risk personnel, and by formulating and implementing aggressive anti–terrorism
measures. Law enforcement operations provide for the stability and order within a given area of operation through the
conduct of law enforcement, criminal investigations, support to customs operations, and by assisting with dislocated
civilians moving throughout the area of operations. Police intelligence operations (PIO) support, enhance, and contribute to the common operational picture and situational understanding. Police intelligence operations ensure intelligence
obtained and developed during the conduct of the other MP functions is provided to the overall intelligence effort.
During peacetime, Military Police provide the full spectrum of law enforcement support to the Army’s post, camps,
and stations while, in many cases, simultaneously conducting training focused on the other 4 MP functions in
preparation for the next conflict.
m. Ordnance Corps (Branch 91). The Ordnance Corps officer ensures that the maximum number of weapons
systems, vehicles, and equipment are operationally ready and available at all times; that the ammunition required for
weapons systems and soldiers is at the right place at the right time and in the right quantities to support the warfighter;

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

55

and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) support is provided, when required. Ordnance officers are skilled leaders and
supervisors of large numbers of soldiers, and they manage large inventories of equipment and supplies.
n. Quartermaster Corps (Branch 92). The Quartermaster Corps officers provide the expertise to support the Army’s
warfighters supply, services, and distribution information strategy. The span of activity encompasses the planning,
development, organization, allocation, operation, regulation, and support of the Army’s Supply Chain Management
Systems and facilities. Serving in positions requiring a comprehensive knowledge of supply and material distribution
information management, field feeding, petroleum products, water, general supplies, laundry and shower, fabric repair,
aerial delivery, parachute rigging, sling–load operations, mortuary affairs and salvage disposal for the Army and for
other armed services.
o. Signal Corps (Branch 25). The Signal Corps officers provide and manage signal support for the command and
control of combined arms forces. Signal support is the collective, integrated, and synchronized use of information
systems, resources and services in theater tactical, strategic, and sustaining base environments. Signal support encompasses automation, communications, visual information, records management, printing and publications.
p. Special Forces (Branch 18). Special Forces is a basic branch of the Army. Special Forces (SF) are multipurpose
forces capable of rapid response to contingencies throughout the world. Their mission is to conduct special operations
across the full range of military operations in any operational environment in peace, contingencies or war. Special
Forces teams expand the range of available options in a variety of scenarios where the commitment of conventional
military forces is not feasible or appropriate. They provide military capabilities not available elsewhere in the armed
forces. Special Forces operations are inherently Joint, often multinational or interagency in nature and are focused at
the operational and strategic levels. Special Forces operations are frequently conducted through, with, or by indigenous
forces. As representatives of the United States in a foreign country, SF soldiers serve as teachers as well as warriors.
They interact closely with and live under the same conditions as the indigenous people. They conduct peacetime
operations and promote regional stability in areas where conventional forces normally do not operate. Their continuous
forward presence assists in creating the conditions for stable development, thereby reducing the risk of armed conflict.
q. Transportation Corps (Branch 88). Transportation Corps (TC) officers provide combat service support in numerous ways. They provide expertise in the planning, development, organization, allocation, operation, regulation, and
management of the Army’s transportation systems, facilities, and automation. They are responsible for the worldwide
movement of units, personnel, equipment, and supplies in peace and war. They are required to move critical supplies
rapidly, under positive control, through an integrated, transportation–based global distribution system, bypassing
routine warehouse/storage functions from the source to the combatant. Transportation Corps officers leverage emerging
technologies and information management on the digitized battlefield while providing movement control, in–transit
visibility and direct delivery to deployed forces in a dynamically fluid, nonlinear battlefield. They routinely work at
any of the 3 levels of war: tactical, operational, and strategic, and possess a wide breadth of expertise in ground (truck
and rail), sea, and air movements in support of Joint and combined operations. The Transportation Corps is “The
Spearhead of Logistics” as nothing happens until something moves.
r. Psychological Operations (FA 37). Psychological Operations (PSYOP) is 1 of the 3 FAs in the Operations career
field. Psychological Operations officers possess expertise in assessing target audiences; developing PSYOP campaign
plans, programs, and products; disseminating PSYOP products; and synchronizing PSYOP activities into strategic,
operational, and tactical peacetime and combat operations. Psychological Operations officers execute the PSYOP
campaign plan in support of maneuver commanders across all levels of the operational spectrum. Psychological
Operations officers must remain knowledgeable of the specific vulnerabilities to foreign influence from information
and other forms of behavioral/attitudinal change associated with a specific region of the world, to include foreign
language competency, political–military awareness, and cross–cultural communications. Conducting PSYOP requires
abilities to successfully interact with military and civilian officials at the national and theater level as well as with host
nation military and civilian officials intended to influence and effect behavioral change. This interaction is necessary
for managing the development of valid PSYOP actions and products in support of a regional combatant commander or
Joint task force; obtaining PSYOP–related intelligence; developing pre–test and post–test PSYOP products (measures
of effectiveness); providing PSYOP support to foreign internal defense (FID) and internal defense and development
(IDAD) operations in support of country teams; and providing PSYOP support to counter–drug operation, counter–mine and counter–terror operations.
s. Civil Affairs (FA 38). The CA FA combines regional and cultural awareness and expertise, language competency,
political–military analytical skills, cross–cultural communication, mediation, and an ability to potentially leverage
resources typically outside military control in the conduct CA operations and support civil military operations in Joint,
interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational environments. The CA’s officers unique skills enable them to
expedite military operations by assessing, planning, facilitating, and transitioning activities conducted by functional
specialists, indigenous populations and institutions, international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, or other
governmental agencies applying all instruments of national power. Civil Affairs forms the nucleus of the Army’s
civil–military operations expertise for Army Special Operations forces and conventional forces.
t. Multifunctional Logistician Program (FA 90). The logistician program FA plans and directs multifunctional
logistical operations from the factory to the foxhole, across the entire spectrum of logistical functions. Functional area
90 officers are not career field designated at their 10th year of service as are other FA officers. Functional area 90

56

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

officers are experienced in integrating the functions of supply, transportation, maintenance, aviation logistics, medical
service administration and field services.
9–3. Career options
a. General considerations. The Operations career field has diverse assignment opportunities that afford officers
numerous career development paths within its assigned branches and FA. During their company grade years, all
officers master their basic branch unique skills, knowledge and attributes while developing and perfecting their direct
leadership skills. The goal of the professional development of OPCF field grade officers is to produce high performing
leaders with operational and strategic leadership skills while sustaining highly qualified tactically and operationally
oriented officers to lead their respective branches/FAs in combat and on other assigned missions. Operations career
field officers professionally develop through a continuous cycle of experience, education, and training. They are
responsible for applying organized sets of principles and facts in the general domains of leadership, operations, tactics
and equipment. This base of knowledge is obtained through continuous learning through attendance at professional
development institutions, duty in operational assignments and progressive self–development. All CSL commands are in
the Operations career field.
b. Branch/functional area generalist positions. CPTs and above can expect to serve in generalist assignments that
may or may not be directly related to their branch/FA, but which are important to the Army. Operations career field
officers serve in both officer generalist (01A) and combat arms generalist (02A) assignments. These assignments
include recruiting command, ROTC instructor, service school/USMA faculty and staff, or AC in RC duty.
c. Joint assignments. Field grade officers serve in Joint organizations worldwide. Joint experience is important to the
professional development of all OPCF officers. Operations career field officers should aggressively seek Joint duty
assignments after branch developmental assignments at the grade of MAJ. The provisions of 10 USC specify that
starting in FY 2007 officers on the ADL may not be appointed to the grade of BG unless they are Joint Specialty
Officers (JSO). Officers gain the JSO designation by receiving full credit for a Joint duty assignment and having JPME
II certification.
d. Graduate education. Officers in the Operations career field should also pursue graduate level education to
enhance their professional development. The challenges of leadership, operational planning and execution in the
contemporary operating environment requiring enhanced cultural awareness require officers with skills, knowledge and
attributes that are enhanced by advanced civil schooling. Whether in academic programs focused on branch specific
disciplines or the broader degrees in information technology, business, management, international relations, government
or history, officers in the Operations career field will benefit greatly from graduate education. The analytical skills and
intellectual foundation taught in these advanced studies enable officers to use these hard–earned skills to work through
the most challenging issues facing the Army.

Chapter 10
Infantry Branch
10–1. Unique features of Infantry Branch
a. Unique culture of Infantry Branch. The Infantry culture is the basis for the Army’s Warrior Ethos, and it is
derived from the harsh realities of Infantry combat, which are close, personal, and brutal. Infantry officers are unique
for their level of commitment and their ability to synchronize all aspects of the combined arms and Joint team on the
battlefield. Although Infantry officers are assigned to vehicular and non–vehicular organizations comprised of light,
mechanized, airborne, ranger, air assault and Stryker formations within Heavy, Infantry and Stryker Brigade Combat
Teams, all infantrymen are linked through the core competency to close with and destroy the enemy in ground combat.
The Infantry is “One Infantry—our Army’s Infantry.” Infantry officers must understand the characteristics of each type
of infantry, with the understanding that what differentiates them are the means of delivery to the battlefield. Infantry
officers must also understand the characteristics of other combat arms, such as Armor, Field Artillery, Air Defense,
Aviation and Special Forces. In this way, the infantryman remains the principal combat leader on the battlefield.
b. Unique purpose of Infantry Branch. The Infantry Branch is the combat arms branch with the mission to close
with and destroy the enemy by means of fire and movement to defeat or capture him, or repel his assault by fire, close
combat and counterattack.
c. Unique functions of Infantry Branch. Infantry leaders are expected to synchronize all elements of combat power
on the battlefield to defeat the enemy. Infantry officers are prepared to train, lead, and employ all types of Infantry and
other combat arms assets on the battlefield in the full spectrum of military operations. The Infantry arrives on the
battlefield by parachute assault, air assault, mechanized vehicle, wheeled vehicle or on foot. Insertion means are
dependent upon the mission, enemy, terrain and weather, and time available.
d. Unique features of Infantry Branch. Infantry officers work at all levels of command and staff and can perform the
following functions and tasks:
(1) Command and control Infantry and combined arms forces in combat.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

57

(2) Provide coordination for employment of combat arms forces at all levels of Joint, Army, and coalition
commands.
(3) Develop doctrine, organizations, and equipment for Infantry unique missions and formations.
(4) Instruct Infantry skills at Service schools and combat training centers.
(5) Provide service in positions requiring general combat skills such as staff officers in all levels of headquarters and
activities requiring combat arms expertise.
(6) Serve as Infantry instructors at pre–commissioning programs, Service schools, and colleges.
(7) Serve as Infantry advisors to ARNG and USAR organizations.
10–2. Officer characteristics required
a. General. Infantry Branch requires officers who are, first and foremost, leaders of soldiers. They should be
mentally and physically disciplined and well versed in Infantry and combined arms tactics, techniques, and procedures.
Infantry leaders will embody the Warrior Ethos. They will place the welfare of their soldiers ahead of their own, and
they will adhere to Army Values without exception. Their example will inspire others to achieve the same level of
commitment and professionalism. Additionally, there are several branch unique skills that require professional development. Infantry Branch has proponency for the following skills:
(1) 3X–Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle.
(2) 3Z–Mortar Unit Officer.
(3) 5P–Parachutist.
(4) 5R–Ranger.
(5) 5S–Ranger/Parachutist.
(6) 5Q–Pathfinder.
(7) 6B–RSTA/Long Range Surveillance Leader.
b. Competencies and actions common to all. Infantry officers must be premier warfighters who can apply the 4 core
dimensions of leadership; values, skills, attributes and actions. These 4 core dimensions form the basis of what a leader
must be, know, and do. The values and attributes set the basis for the character of the leader— what a leader must be.
The skills developed by a leader establishes his/her competence— what a leader must know. The actions that a leader
takes constitute leadership in its purest form— what a leader must do. The leadership framework describes a leader of
character and competence who acts to achieve excellence across the spectrum of operations and daily activities.
(1) Values. The 7 Army Values are loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage.
Values are at the core of everything the Army is and does. The Army is an institution of people with unique and
enduring values. The people of all grades who make up the Army must embrace Army Values. These values provide a
sense of purpose necessary to sustain soldiers in combat and to help resolve ambiguities in operations other than war.
Officers are entrusted with developing and fostering Army Values in the people who make up the Army. Infantry
officers will embody Army Values at all times and will demand that others adhere to them as well.
(2) Leader attributes. Attributes are the fundamental qualities and characteristics that define a person or organization. These fall into 3 categories—mental, physical, and emotional.
(a) Mental attributes describe aptitudes and capacities for learning that leaders should possess and develop. Included
in this category are will, self–discipline, initiative, judgment, confidence, intelligence, and cultural awareness.
(b) Physical attributes specify physical characteristics or aptitudes that can be developed and nurtured with time and
effort. Included in this category are health fitness, physical fitness, stamina, military bearing, and professional bearing.
(c) Emotional attributes are those capacities that contribute to how one feels and substantially contribute to
leadership. Included in this category are self–control, balance, and stability.
(3) Leader skills. Skills are synonymous with competencies. Competence is of primary importance for all Army
officers. The Army recognizes that officers must develop 4 types of skills—
(a) Interpersonal skills reflect competence in communicating with people.
(b) Conceptual skills refer to competence in handling ideas.
(c) Technical skills reflect competence with things.
(d) Tactical skills refer to the ability to integrate all of the above and apply them to warfighting.
10–3. Critical officer development assignments
a. Company grade.
(1) Lieutenant.
(a) Following commissioning, Infantry LTs will attend Basic Officer Leader Courses (BOLC) II and III. Entry–level
officers from all branches will attend BOLC II prior to their branch basic course in order to be imbued with the
Warrior Ethos and provide a common fundamental tactical framework for leader development. Following BOLC II,
Infantry officers will attend the Infantry BOLC III, which emphasizes leadership, tactics, maintenance, and technical
and tactical competence with weapons and equipment common to the Infantry. Following BOLC III, all Infantry LTs
have the opportunity to attend Airborne and Ranger schools. Additionally, any officer assigned to a mechanized unit

58

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

following BOLC III will attend the Bradley Leader’s Course (BLC). Some officers will be selected to attend the
Mortar Leader Course. Regardless of unit of assignment and follow–on schools, the objective is for Infantry LTs to
serve no longer than 9 months at Fort Benning in order to ensure that they are able to complete the requisite
assignments in their 1st duty station to provide them with the skills, knowledge, and experience necessary to build a
successful foundation.
(b) All Infantry LTs are encouraged to volunteer for Ranger training due to the intense tactical and leadership
training it provides. Achieving the standards for graduation from Ranger school is an indication that an officer
possesses the skills and stamina necessary to effectively lead soldiers in the Infantry.
(c) Infantry LTs should seek developmental positions that enable them to hone their leadership skills and develop
proficiency to prepare them for increased responsibility. After completing BOLC III and specialized schooling, as
outlined above, LTs will be assigned to an installation. The installation will then further assign them to a unit where
they can be used at company level to the maximum extent possible. LTs should expect to serve in company level
positions to develop the necessary skills, knowledge, and experience discussed above. Typical career progression for a
LT is as follows:
1. Rifle platoon leader.
2. Specialty platoon leader (scout, mortar, AT, support platoon, and so forth).
3. Company executive officer.
4. Headquarters, Headquarters Company executive officer
(d) Early assignment as a TOE platoon leader is critical, as it provides LTs with the opportunity to learn their craft
while simultaneously developing leadership skills. Most LTs will be assigned from BOLC and follow–on schools under
some aspect of the life cycle management model, and they will remain at their 1st duty station for 3 years. Selected
LTs may be assigned to TDA assignments as well. Regardless of the location and tour length, it is imperative that
Infantry LTs master the tactical and technical aspects of their craft and develop as leaders at their 1st duty station.
(e) Upon promotion to CPT, an Infantry officer should be fully versed in the tactics, technical aspects, and
leadership challenges common to Infantry operations at company level and below. He should understand combined
arms employment of all types of Infantry. He should have a working knowledge of Special Operations and Close Air
Support (CAS).
(2) Captain.
(a) Officers will attend CCC either TDY and return or as a PCS as soon after promotion as possible, consistent with
operational needs, in order to maximize the number of officers qualified to command. Officers will generally not
command before attendance at CCC. Exceptions may be requested through the Chief of Infantry Officer Assignments
at HRC, but must be for operational reasons and there must be no other viable alternative within the command. The
CCC is designed to prepare officers to serve as company commanders and to educate themselves in basic staff
procedures. Specialized training will be scheduled for officers after CCC on an as needed basis. Ideally most, if not all,
officers attending CCC will be assigned to a different type of Infantry organization (vehicular or non–vehicular) than
they served in at their 1st duty station. Exceptions may be made based on operational needs.
(b) CPTs should aggressively seek command and service in battalion and brigade level staff positions to further their
understanding of Infantry leadership and tactics. A key developmental assignment for a CPT is command of a TOE
Infantry company for 18 months, plus or minus 6 months. Second commands should be limited, and total command
time should not exceed 26 months (2 x 12 month commands and 2 months for change of command inventories) unless
operational needs dictate a different course of action. Some officers will be assigned in locations where they might
command again, such as the 75th Ranger Regiment and 3rd Infantry Regiment (Old Guard). The U.S. Army Infantry
Center and School also has significant 2nd command opportunities to include the Ranger Training Brigade and the
507th Parachute Infantry Regiment. Life cycle manning will result in some officers commanding for longer periods of
time, and some for less, depending on where the unit is in the life cycle when the officer takes command. Officers who
command TDA companies encounter significant responsibilities and are therefore, extremely well prepared for MTOE
command. TDA company commanders having their 1st commands at the U.S. Army Infantry Center and School will
be given the highest consideration to follow–on MTOE assignments to compete for MTOE company command. The
Infantry encourages officers to seek company command opportunities in the Infantry Training Brigade and Basic
Combat Training Brigade prior to attendance at ICCC. There is no time limit restriction in these commands and
officers will still remain eligible for tactical company commands following ICCC.
(c) After command, Infantry officers can expect to serve a tour in the institutional Army. Typical assignments that
continue to contribute to an officers’ development include Small Group Instructor (SGI) at one of the proponent
schools, Combat Training Center (CTC) Observer Controller (O/C), Active Army/RC advisor, and highly selective
assignments such as Aide–de–Camp and Army and Joint Staff. Project Warrior remains a viable developmental
assignment and one of the most effective in preparing CPTs for future assignments as MTOE battalion field grade
officers. Project warrior is a program where a CPT, following highly successful company command, serves 2 years at a
CTC as an O/C, followed by 2 years as an instructor/doctrine writer at one of the proponent schools prior to ILE. Other
assignments for post–command CPTs include OCS company commander and tactical officer and BOLC II instructor.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

59

In addition, the Infantry also has a large number of assignments to ROTC duty, USAREC, school instructor, USMA
staff and faculty, and other nominative assignments such as foreign exchange officer.
(d) In the future, Career Field Designation Boards should meet between the 7th and 10th years of service, thus
impacting an officer’s career in the CPT years. Currently, the Army Acquisition Corps (AAC) will admit a small
number of officers at year 8 of service. Career fields are discussed in more detail in Paragraph 3.
b. Field grade.
(1) Major.
(a) Officers will submit preferences and undergo a career field designation board upon selection for MAJ. This DA
board is run in the same manner as promotion boards, and it designates a career field for each officer considered. The
officer will then serve in that career field for the rest of his time in the service. Infantrymen will have several options.
They may elect to stay in the Operations career field, or they may elect to change to another area of expertise, such as
information operations, institutional support, or operational support. A detailed description of these career fields is
contained in OPMS pamphlets and briefings circulated throughout the Army, and the options will be explained on an
officer’s preference statement when it becomes available through his/her AKO online account. After promotion to
MAJ, officers will attend ILE and compete for subsequent selections and promotions with other members of the same
career field. For those who remain in the Operations career field, Infantry Branch will manage their professional
development and assignments. Those officers who designate or are designated to another career field will be managed
by their new career field assignment team. Regardless of what career field an Infantry officer chooses or is selected for,
this officer will continue to wear the crossed rifles designating his basic branch of Infantry. He should help propagate
the Warrior Ethos and educate other officers on the unique and powerful contribution Infantry officers make at all
levels of the Army.
(b) Infantry MAJs will attend a resident ILE course at Fort Leavenworth at some time during their time as a MAJ or
during their last 2 years as a CPT. Officers who attend ILE prior to their CFD board will be required to select
Operations career field on their CFD preference statement. Attendance at this course will be universal for all year
groups after 1993, and will be at the discretion of Infantry Branch who will coordinate with the officer’s chain of
command to determine the best COA for the unit and the officer.
(c) As an adjunct to ILE, Infantry officers should consider attendance at the School of Advanced Military Studies
(SAMS) at Fort Leavenworth. This course produces expert operational planners and graduates are valuable members of
operational level warfighting staffs. Being a graduate of SAMS increases opportunities for key developmental assignments at these levels.
(d) Following ILE, Infantry MAJs should continue to pursue those developmental assignments that provide them
with the skills, knowledge, and experience necessary for senior levels of command and staff. For Infantry MAJs, key
developmental assignments include 12 months or more in 1 of the following positions:
1. Battalion operations officer
2. Battalion executive officer
3. Brigade operations officer
4. Brigade executive officer
5. Division/UEx chief of plans
6. Division/UEx chief of operations
7. Senior Ranger regimental liaison officer
(e) While 12 months is desired, an officer should serve for as long as possible in key developmental assignments,
with the general rule of 2 for a total of 24–36 months. Commanders should bear in mind that any officer who gets
additional time or additional key developmental positions could be taking those same opportunities away from their
peers and they should coordinate with Infantry Branch before pursuing that COA. Infantry MAJs should bear in mind
that, if they have not had experience in both vehicular and non–vehicular formations as LTs and CPTs, they will likely
be assigned to a type of Infantry they have not served in following ILE.
(f) The professional development objective for Infantry MAJs is to prepare for command and future service as a
field grade officer in the Army. To do this, Infantry officers should aggressively pursue the assignments listed above.
Each of the key developmental assignments listed above have a marked impact on an officer’s potential to command,
and the principle objective of service as a MAJ is to prepare officers to command.
(g) After completing key developmental assignments, MAJs will routinely be assigned “away from troops.” This can
include a variety of assignments, such as higher level staff, ROTC, USMA, CTC O/C, Active Army/RC duty, service
school instructors, and CGSC staff and faculty. Infantry Branch will assign as many MAJs as possible, given
requirements and professional development timelines, to Joint duty. Joint duty should be viewed as a tremendous
opportunity for Infantry MAJs and is consistent with the CSA’s guidance that—we are all Joint officers serving in an
Army billet.
(2) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Officers will be considered for promotion and have their 1st look for battalion command in the same year.
Command Selection List commands are organized into 3 categories: tactical, training and strategic support (TSS), and
Institutional. Infantry LTCs and promotable MAJs are eligible to compete in all 3 categories. They can select all 3 or
60

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

any subset of categories through AKO online and their preference statement after it opens for their year group. LTCs
will have 4 looks for battalion command. Once selected, they may decline without prejudice within 30 days and
compete again in future boards. After 30 days, declination will be with prejudice, and officers will be unable to
compete for future command. In general, Infantry officers are encouraged to compete in any category in which they
believe they could make a contribution, thereby providing the Army the maximum opportunity to make use of their
talents. All battalion commands are considered key developmental assignments. Officers selected in the tactical
category will generally be slated to battalions of the type with which they are most familiar. Training and strategic
support and institutional categories are slated based on previous experience and potential for success. Personal
preference is considered, and officers can indicate their preference through their AKO online preference statement.
Commanders will generally serve for 2 years. Tactical battalion commanders may serve for a longer or shorter period
as part of life cycle management. The decision on how long an officer will command will be initiated by the command
in which he serves. Commanders will not change command while deployed to a combat theater. Thus, the command
must decide if they will have to extend, curtail, or leave as is each battalion command in their organization considering
deployment plans and the dates when each commander assumed command. Successful command is defined as more
than 12 months and equal to the length of time dictated by operational considerations. Longer and shorter times in
command are not necessarily a reflection of the quality of an officer’s performance in command. They are more likely
the result of the impact of deployment schedules.
(b) Command selection includes only a small percentage of the total LTC population. Thus, many LTCs will serve
for many years at that grade. This is by design, and promotion to LTC is the mark of a successful career. Officers can
serve as LTCs for up to 28 years total commissioned federal service. Infantry assignments include the following: Joint
staff, higher level DOD and Army staff, division and Corps staff, Active Army/RC duty, CTC duty, service school
staff, exchange officer, and ROTC Professor of Military Science (PMS). An ROTC selection board determines ROTC
assignments. They require an advanced degree, and there are several administrative requirements. Officers interested in
service as a PMS should contact their assignment officer 9–12 months prior to the board.
(c) Former battalion commanders (FBCs) will be assigned to specific billets coded for FBC and will be assigned
based on needs of the Army. All FBC assignments are vetted through the director, OPMD. Some examples of FBC
billets include division G–3, CTC TF Senior O/C, Joint staff, Office of the SECDEF, Army, Corps or division staff,
TRADOC duty, Infantry Branch chief in officer or enlisted assignments, USAREC duty, or 75th Ranger CSL
command.
(d) LTCs are eligible for consideration for Senior Service College (SSC) between 18 and 23 years of active federal
commissioned service.
(3) Colonel.
(a) Infantry COLs contribute to the Army by serving in critical assignments to include command. There are
additional categories for command not available at LTC level, but the process is the same for selection at COL.
Officers are afforded the opportunity to select the categories in which they will compete through their AKO online
window when it opens. Categories include tactical, TSS, garrison, USAREC, Training Support Brigades (Active Army/
RC) and TRADOC System Managers (TSM). All COL level commands are considered key developmental
assignments.
(b) Additional assignments for COLs include Joint staff, Corps and MACOM staff, OSD, DOD, and ARSTAFF,
Active Army/RC billets, NGB, instructors, department chairs, USMA, and CGSC staff.
(c) Officers selected for COL who have not been selected for SSC should apply for the U.S. Army War College
Distance Education Course.
10–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Precedence. Assignments will primarily focus on satisfying the needs of the Army and the warfighting commanders. The second most important consideration will be the professional development needs of the officer.
b. Preference. Officer preference is genuinely considered in all assignment actions. Officers should call and discuss
any impending assignment action with their assignment officer before working anything on their own. Needs of the
Army will take precedence over personal preference, but assignment officers will always attempt to match preference
and needs of the Army.
10–5. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. Our goal is to provide the Army with fully qualified Infantry officers to serve as combat leaders at all
levels. Additionally, we must design and support a healthy, viable, career path for the advancement of Infantry officers
so that they can feel a sense of job satisfaction and advance in the field.
b. Officer Personnel Management System implementation. OPMS XXI has transitioned to OPMS III or just OPMS.
It is fully implemented as of this writing and it will continue to be adjusted as needed to meet the needs of the Army.
c. Requisition system. The requisition system is designed to meet the needs of commanders and units across the
Army. There are 3 general types of requisitions to which Infantrymen might be assigned— CMF 11, Infantry specific;
O2A, which is combat arms generalist; and O1A, which is grade specific but does not specify a skill set. OPMD

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

61

distribution division creates requisitions based on the needs of the Army, and then apportions them to the various
branches for fulfillment. Infantry branch will fill 11 requisitions first, 02A billets next and O1A billets last in order to
ensure all branches fill the maximum number of assignments.
d. Assignment process. There are often more requisitions than available officers in a given assignment cycle.
Therefore, Infantry officers should contact their assignment officer NLT 6 months from their anticipated date of
relocation to ensure the AO has the opportunity to consider and attempt to fulfill the officer’s personal preference.
Officers should retain situational awareness by checking the Infantry Branch web page at regular intervals. All
available Infantry assignments are listed on the web pages by grade. Infantry branch will not be able to assign officers
to billets not listed on the Infantry branch web pages. There are 3 simple rules an Infantry officer should apply when
requesting an assignment. Enter the net 6–12 months prior to the move, ask for something the branch must fill, and
don’t change your mind.
e. Assignment considerations. Assignment officers are Infantrymen serving away from soldiers at HRC. They will
consider the following factors when making assignments:
(1) Needs of the Army.
(2) Special skills possessed by the officer.
(3) Professional development needs of the officer.
(4) Policy considerations, such as PCS costs, stabilization and tour equity.
(5) Officer potential for advancement.
(6) Personal preference and special needs of the officer and his dependents.
10–6. Key officer life cycle initiatives for the Infantry
a. Structure. The Army will adjust the size of Infantry branch to meet the needs of the Army. As we continue to
prosecute the Global War on Terrorism, there may be some adjustment to the number and type of Infantry formations
across the Army in order to better form the fighting force for success on the battlefield.
b. Acquire. Officers will continue to enter the Infantry through the U.S. Military Academy, Reserve Officers’
Training Corps and Officer Candidate School. Accessions are based on the needs of the Army, and there is little
opportunity for direct commissioning in the Infantry.
c. Distribute. The distribution pattern for Infantry officers will continue to focus on preparing and resourcing
commands for combat. Wherever possible, officers with recent combat experience will be rotated to deploying combat
units to maximize the value of their experience or to TDA assignments where they can pass on their experience and
their Warrior Ethos to the training base.
d. Deploy. Infantry officers remain the Army’s principle warfighters. Whether assigned to TOE organizations or
TDA organizations, all Infantry officers must be prepared to deploy on short notice anywhere in the world to lead
Soldiers. Infantry officers may deploy as part of a larger organization or as individual replacements. In either case, they
are expected to prepare themselves and their families for this challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustain. There are 3 primary characteristics of our sustainment model: Promotion, Command, and Officer
Efficiency Reports (OER’s).
(1) Promotion. The implementation of career field based promotions has narrowed the competition for promotion.
Infantrymen will compete with other Operations career field (OPCF) officers.
(2) Command. Commanders of battalions and brigades will be centrally selected. Officers will continue to have a
choice regarding the type of commands they compete for, but are encouraged to compete in all categories for which
they are qualified and in which they think they will succeed.
(3) Officer Evaluation Reports. The OERs reflect potential and indicate the career field in which an officer might
best serve the Army. They are the means selection boards use to determine who will be promoted and who will
command. An officer’s OERs must stand alone when considered against his peers by a board member.
f. Develop. Officer development continues through a methodical sequence of progressively more complicated
assignments and personal development as depicted in figure 10–1. The goal remains to develop Infantry officers who
are unique for their level of commitment and their ability to synchronize all aspects of combat power on the battlefield.
Development will also continue through schooling. Officers will attend branch schools through the grade of CPT.
When selected for MAJ, they will attend ILE and achieve ILE status. If selected for COL and Senior Service School,
they will become MEL I qualified. If selected for COL but not Senior Service School, officers are encouraged to apply
for acceptance in the Army War College Distance Learning Program.
g. Separate. The Army separation procedures remain in accordance with AR 600–8–24 except when stop loss/stop
move are employed. Officers who are considering separating from the Army should contact their assignment officer as
soon as possible.

a. General career development. Reserve Component Infantry officer development objectives and qualifications
basically parallel those planned for their Active Army counterparts. Even though geographical considerations limit
some RC officers, all should strive for Infantry assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as their
Active Army counterparts.

Chapter 11
Armor Branch
11–1. Unique features of Armor Branch
a. Unique purpose of Armor Branch. Armor Branch encompasses Armor or combined arms organizations that close
with and destroy the enemy using fire, maneuver and shock effect; and cavalry and reconnaissance organizations that
perform reconnaissance, provide security and engage in the full spectrum of combat operations.
b. The Way Ahead. The Army transformation and the contemporary operating environment will significantly affect
how the Armor Branch trains, assigns and develops officers. While the focus of the Armor Branch has always been the
development of combined arms warriors, the Army’s ongoing transformation institutionalizes this concept through the
transition to combined arms formations. This will drive an increased focus on mounted maneuver operations for
company grade officers, transitioning to a combined and Joint operational focus for field grade officers. Regardless, the
assignment of Armor officers will continue to be based on the needs of the Army, the professional development needs
of the officer, and the officer’s preference. While HRC will make every effort to synchronize the 3 priorities, the needs
of the Army and the professional development needs of the officer must continue to take precedence over individual
preference.
c. Unique functions performed by Armor Branch. Armor officers fulfill their mission by commanding, directing and
controlling mounted maneuver, combined arms organizations; providing expertise on the employment of combined
arms forces at all staff levels; and developing the doctrine, organizations, training, materiel and leaders necessary to
support the mounted maneuver mission. The initial focus of Armor officers is the development of technical and tactical
armor and reconnaissance skills. Following the initial focus on Armor and Cavalry skills development, Armor officers
begin to develop a broader focus on mounted maneuver, combined arms and Joint warfare as they progress through
their careers.
d. Unique features of work in Armor Branch. The Armor branch currently has 3 areas of concentration (AOCs) and
3 skills. Detailed descriptions of the AOCs and skills listed below can be found in DA Pam 611–21.
(1) Armor officer, general (19A). These officers perform in staff positions requiring skills involving general armor
or cavalry practical experience. These officers should possess appropriate technical and tactical institutional Armor
School training in both tank and cavalry/scout weapons systems and have developed tactical expertise in mounted
combined arms warfare.
(2) Armor (19B). These officers perform in command or staff positions in mounted maneuver units with tanks or
mobile gun systems (MGS). Armor officers must complete AOBC prior to their initial assignment.
(3) Cavalry (19C). These officers perform in command or staff positions in cavalry and reconnaissance organizations. Cavalry officers must have completed either the Scout Platoon Leader Course or the Cavalry Leader Course.
(4) Additional skills. Additional skill identifiers associated with Armor area of concentration—
(a) M1A2 Abrams Tank (3J)
(b) M1A1 Abrams Tank (3M)
(c) M2/M3 Bradley CFV/IFV (3X)
e. Branch participation.
(1) Armor Branch participates in the branch detailing of combat support (CS) and combat service support (CSS)
branch officers into Armor for development and growth at the grade of LT. Officers detailed Armor (branch code 19)
will lose their Armor designation upon completion of their branch advanced course.
(2) Armor Branch is closed to female officers under the Secretary of Defense direct ground combat rule. Male
officers of other branches who desire a branch transfer to Armor should submit a request in accordance with AR
614–100, chapter 4.
11–2. Officer characteristics required
a. Competencies and actions common to all. Armor officers are valued for their skills as leaders, trainers, and
planners— skills which are acquired and perfected through realistic training, professional military education and
service in the most demanding positions Armor Branch offers. The Armor Branch values both critical warfighting
operational force assignments and the generating force assignments. The goal of the branch is to provide each officer
with a series of leadership, staff, and functional assignments; institutional training; and self–development opportunities
in order to develop combined arms warriors with well rounded backgrounds and an understanding of how the Army
runs.
b. Unique skills. Armor officers should display consistently outstanding performance across a wide variety of
MTOE warfighting and TDA training and staff positions. Armor officers should demonstrate excellence in their

66

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

warfighting skills; technical proficiency; a well developed understanding of mounted Joint and combined arms warfare;
and the ability to lead, train, motivate, and care for soldiers.
11–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. Branch development.
(1) Lieutenant. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop the
requisite Armor branch skills, knowledge, and attributes. The focus of the officer at this stage of his career is on
development of Armor and Cavalry tactical and technical warfighting skills and the utilization of these skills in an
operational assignment.
(a) Education. The Armor BOLC III must be completed during this phase. The BOLC provides the Armor LT the
basic skills necessary to function as a tank platoon leader and an overview of Cavalry tactics and techniques. Prior to
assignment to a Cavalry Platoon, the Armor LT should attend the Scout Platoon Leader Course. In addition, the Armor
LT may attend Ranger School, Battalion Maintenance Officer Course (through distance learning), Infantry Mortar
Platoon Officer Course, Airborne School, M1A1 Tank Commander Certification Course (Gowan Field, ID), M1A2
Tank Commander Certification Course, M3A3 Scout Commander Course or MGS/Stryker Commander Course. Additional training following AOBC is primarily dependent on the LT’s unit of assignment.
(b) Assignments. The critical assignment during this phase is serving as a platoon leader in a brigade combat team.
Historically, all qualified Armor LTs have had the opportunity to serve as Armor or cavalry platoon leaders. The
typical Armor LT will be assigned as a platoon leader or staff officer in a reconnaissance or combined arms
organization upon completion of the basic course. In addition, a limited number of Armor LTs will serve as TRADOC
training company executive officers or staff officers. However, the initial assignment for all Armor LTs should be to a
TOE operational unit. Other typical assignments for LTs are battalion or squadron special platoon leader (support,
scout or mortar), company or troop executive officer, battalion or squadron liaison officer (LNO), battalion or squadron
adjutant (S1), S3 air or logistics officer (S4) and battalion or squadron maintenance officer (BMO/SMO). An Armor
officer may also serve in a staff position after promotion to CPT, but prior to attendance at the Armor Captain’s Career
Course. A limited number of armor LTs will serve at the same installation through the completion of company
command as a CPT. These officers will attend the CCC in a TDY and return status, then return to the same installation
to complete their initial assignment as a CPT. The ability of an Armor officer to remain at the same installation for 2
initial assignments will be dependent on the Armor grade structure at that installation and the needs of the Army.
(c) Self–development. Self–development during this phase should focus on tank and cavalry tactical fundamentals,
troop leading procedures, leadership skills, tank gunnery, organizational maintenance, resupply operations, basic
administrative operations and other branch technical proficiency skills.
(d) Desired experience. Each Armor LT must complete BOLC III (MEL 7), successfully serve in an operational
TOE platoon leader assignment, then supplement his technical and tactical abilities through assignment to a specialty
platoon or staff position. The goal is to develop LTs with an understanding of mounted maneuver tactics at the platoon
level.
(2) Captain. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop mounted
maneuver officers who have exhibited leadership skills as a company commander and staff officer in an operational
unit, and who have rounded out their knowledge through successfully completing one or more assignments in the
generating force. Armor CPTs who have served in both operational and generating force positions have honed their
tactical skills and expanded their capabilities through their functional assignment. The Armor Branch wants to develop
CPTs with operational expertise and who are prepared to provide significant contributions to the generating force.
(a) Education. Completion of a branch CCC is mandatory during this period. The majority of Armor officers will
attend the Armor branch CCC training, while a select few will attend other branch CCCs. Officers assigned to a
cavalry/reconnaissance organization after completion of CCC will normally attend the Cavalry Leader Course. Officers
must obtain a baccalaureate degree prior to attending the CCC.
(b) Assignments. The critical developmental assignments during this phase are a combination of company/troop
command and service as a primary staff officer. Armor officers may serve on operational or generating force unit staffs
at the brigade/regiment and battalion/squadron level prior to command. Most Armor officers will be assigned to a
brigade combat team for a 3–year assignment immediately following completion of CCC. (During the Army transformation to a unit focused assignment system, officers my serve varying tour lengths as 3–year stabilized assignments are
phased in over several years.) A few select company commanders will serve their company command and staff
assignments in a TRADOC TDA organization. To provide operational command opportunity to the maximum number
of Armor officers, Armor Branch will assign a number of CPTs to TDA commands following AC3 and prior to
assignment to a BCT. Additionally, a limited number of armor CPTs will be assigned to a TDA command following a
BCT assignment. TDA company commanders having their first commands at the Armor Center will be given the
highest consideration to follow–on MTOE assignments to compete for MTOE company command. This program
increases operational command opportunity and ensures the integration of officers with operational experience into the
Armor Center to support the critical DOTMLPF mission. Upon completion of company command, a full spectrum of
assignments is possible. The purpose of these assignments is to further develop the officer’s knowledge base, provide a
more well–rounded focus, and meet the needs of the Army. Examples of these assignments are provided below:
DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

67

1. TDA staff
2. Active Army/RC training support brigade
3. CTC trainer or observer/controller
4. Service school instructor or small group instructor
5. Doctrine developer
6. Training developer
7. UAEE company commander or staff
8. MACOM staff
9. USMA faculty and staff
10. USAREC
11. Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) instructor
12. Functional area assignment
13. Wide variety of combat arms or branch immaterial positions.
(c) Self–development. During this phase, Armor officers must hone their leadership, tactical and technical skills and
concentrate on those critical tasks required to accomplish their wartime mission while winning on the battlefield. The
officer should also begin to develop a more thorough understanding of combined arms operations in a Joint
environment.
(d) Functional area program. Armor CPTs may voluntarily choose to request an FA designation; however, it is not
mandatory. By requesting designation, the officer is notifying FA managers that he is interested in serving an FA
assignment as a CPT. Certain FAs have extensive educational and training requirements that may have an impact on
the career field designation process at the grade of MAJ, and upon future assignments. Release to an FA assignment is
subject to approval by the chief, Armor Branch, HRC, and is based on Army requirements.
(e) Army Acquisition Corps. Small numbers of Armor officers from each year group will be accessed into the Army
Acquisition Corps. The primary look is in year 6 of a CPT’s career, and then the officer will be re–looked during years
7–8. The Acquisition Corps conducts a DA level selection board. All applications for transfer must be made directly to
the Acquisition Manager, OPMD, AHRC. This takes place at the 8th year of service. Volunteers make up most of the
accession numbers, while a few officers may be re–branched based on their academic degree. Officers accessed into
the Army Acquisition Corps will be branch transferred to Army Acquisition Corps after selection for promotion to
MAJ.
(f) Desired experience. The critical Armor assignment at this level is successful service as a company commander.
There is no substitute for company command that develops an Armor officer’s leadership and tactical skills and
prepares him for future leadership assignments at successively higher levels of responsibility. While the goal is to
provide each Armor CPT 18 months company command time, the key is the quality of the experience rather than time.
Armor CPTs should also expand their tactical and technical capabilities through assignment as a primary staff officer
prior to assignment as a company commander. Additionally, Armor CPTs must: Complete the branch training phase of
a CCC (military education level MEL 6) and obtain a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university
before attending the branch CCC (CEL 5). Officers not holding a degree can compete through the degree completion
program (DCP) in accordance with AR 621–1, chapter 4. The Armor CPT should coordinate the DCP with the Armor
Captains Assignments Officer.
(3) Majors. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to expand the officer’s
mounted maneuver tactical and technical experience and continue to develop him as a combined arms warrior and
leader with a comprehensive understanding of combined arms warfare in a Joint and expeditionary environment.
Additionally, through a series of operational staff and generating force functional assignments, the Armor MAJ
continues to increase his contribution to the institutional Army and his understanding of how the Army runs. The key is
to prepare the Armor MAJ for future battalion command and for increasingly complex generating force assignments.
(a) Career Field Designation Board. Armor officers will undergo a CFDB upon selection for MAJ. This HQDA
board will decide in which of the 4 career fields each officer is best suited to serve. Decisions are based on the needs
of the Army, the officer’s preference, rater and senior rater’s recommendations, and the officer’s skills and training.
The 4 career fields are— Operations, Operational Support, Information Operations, and Institutional Support. Assignments after promotion to MAJ will be managed by OPMD Armor Branch for the Operations career field officers and
by the FA assignment managers for officers in all other career fields. Armor officers who remain in the Operations
career field will receive both branch assignments and branch immaterial assignments.
(b) Education. Military education required during this phase is completion of ILE. Officers selected for the School
of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS), following AOWC, must serve an initial utilization tour as a corps (UEy) or
division (UEx) plans/assistant G3 officer.
(c) Assignments. Assignments during this phase is battalion/squadron XO/S3 or brigade/regiment XO/S3. There is
no substitute for preparing an Armor officer for future command and for building his mounted maneuver and combined
arms skills. The Armor MAJ may further expand his tactical and technical skills by serving in staff assignments at UEx

68

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

level and higher. Armor majors will also meet the Army’s mission requirements and build on their institutional skills
through varied generating force and Joint assignments. Examples of Armor MAJ assignments are—
1. Active Army/RC S3/XO
2. Doctrine developer
3. Training developer
4. DA staff officer
5. Joint assignment (following completion of an S3/XO assignment is a primary opportunity for Armor MAJs to
complete a Joint assignment). Only a limited number of Armor MAJs; however, will become Joint qualified due to the
limited number of positions and the Army requirements for MAJs.
6. Brigade, division, or Corps staff
7. CTC trainer
8. UAEE S3/XO
9. Major Army command staff
10. CGSC staff and faculty
11. Service school instructor
12. U.S. Military Academy faculty and staff
13. ROTC assistant professor of military science (APMS)
(d) Self–development. Armor MAJs are expected to continue self–development efforts to build intellectual capital,
strategic perspective and hone operational skills. Armor MAJs will be required to develop and utilize a diverse set of
skills as they move between combined arms leadership positions in TOE/TDA and functional Armor or immaterial
assignments.
(e) Desired experience. The critical assignment for an Armor MAJ is battalion/squadron XO/S3 or brigade/regiment
XO/S3. There is no substitute for this operational experience to build tactical and technical competence in mounted
maneuver. The goal at this stage of the officer’s career is to hone his skills in the planning and execution of combined
arms warfare and to develop expertise in the Joint operational environment. The officer’s operational expertise should
be supplemented by further service in positions of increasing responsibility in the generating force. Additionally,
Armor MAJs must complete ILE common core and AOWC (MEL 4/ILE).
(4) Lieutenant colonel. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is demonstrated
excellence in tactical skills, technical proficiency and the ability to lead, train, motivate and care for soldiers in both the
staff and command environments. As the Armor officer increases in grade, his opportunity to serve in the operational
force will decrease as the percentage of positions in the generating force increases. The officer’s previous generating
force assignments prepare him for his expanded role in the generating force serving in positions of increasing
responsibility.
(a) Education. LTCs selected for command complete a pre–command course and may be selected for Senior Service
College following command.
(b) Assignments. Officers selected for LTC in Armor should seek assignments of greater responsibility in branch and
branch immaterial positions. The objective in LTC assignments is greater contribution to the branch and the Army. It is
important in this phase of an Armor officer’s career that he serves in an assignment that further develops his Joint
combined arms skill set and improves warfighting skills. The most critical assignment for Armor LTCs in the
Operations career field is battalion level command. Armor officers selected for LTC command will remain competitive
for promotion to COL and brigade command. Those Armor LTCs selected for command will serve 2 to 3 years in
command at battalion level. Armor officers are selected for Command Selection List (CSL) commands in 3 functional
categories— tactical (TOE); training and strategic support (TDA); and institutional (garrison and USAREC). Typical
duty assignments for LTCs could include—
1. Tactical or TDA battalion command.
2. Combat Training Center task force trainer.
3. Brigade or regiment executive officer.
4. Division (UEx) G–3 (This may migrate to a COL assignment).
5. Division (UEx) or Corps (UEy) staff.
6. Service branch school staff and instructors.
7. HQDA or Joint staff.
8. TSB battalion commander
9. UAEE battalion command or staff
10. XO/S3 positions in an Active Army/RC training support brigade
11. RC support
12. ROTC PMS
13. MACOM staff

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

14. Note that assignment opportunity for some Armor LTC positions will be limited to former battalion
commanders.
(c) Self–development. During this phase of an Armor officer’s career, self–development takes the form of self–assessment, off–duty civil schooling and perfecting mentoring and managerial skills. The officer should also continue to
hone his combined arms warfighting skills and his understanding of the Joint operational environment.
(d) Desired experience. The goal of Armor Branch development is to prepare every officer for command of a
combined arms warfighting organization at the LTC level. While not every officer will command, and Armor LTCs
will provide exceptional contributions to the Army in the generating force, the focus remains the development of
officers imbued with technical and tactical knowledge of the Joint, combined arms, mounted maneuver warfare. The
critical assignment for an Armor LTC is command. There is no substitute for selection and successful service as a
commander for preparing the Armor officer for service as a COL. While the typical command tour has historically
been 24 months, due to ongoing operational deployments, unit transitions, and the implementation of life cycle
managed units, command tours may range from less than 24 months to 36 months in length.
(5) Colonel. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is sustainment of warfighting, training and staff skill, along with utilization of leadership, managerial, and executive talents.
(a) Education. Officers selected for COL should have graduated, be in attendance or be selected to attend Senior
Service College.
(b) Assignments. Armor COLs contribute to the branch by serving in crucial assignments in branch and combat arms
branch immaterial positions. The critical task during this phase is to maintain branch competency (warfighting skills).
Officers should make maximum use of their talents. Assignments will tend to be utilization tours rather than
developmental. Armor officers will make full use of the branch and managerial skills and executive talents to meet the
needs of the Army. A critical assignment for an Armor COL in the Operations career field is selection for brigade or
regimental command. Armor officers selected for brigade command will serve in the same 3 command CSL functional
categories as LTCs, plus they can compete for TRADOC Systems Manager positions. Garrison command tour lengths
are 24 months but can be extended to 36 months. Critical assignments for COLs include—
1. Brigade, regiment, or garrison command.
2. CTC operations group commander/chief of staff.
3. Division (UEx) chief of staff.
4. Corps (UEy) or Field Army assistant chief of staff, G–3.
5. Executive officer to a general officer.
6. Department director for U.S. Army Armor Center.
7. HQDA or Joint staff.
(c) Self–development. Armor COLs must maintain their branch skills and keep current on all changes that affect the
soldiers they command and/or manage. Joint assignments are important during this phase.
(d) Desired experience. The primary goal at this stage is to fully utilize the experience and knowledge gained in a
position where the officer can provide a significant contribution to the operational and generating force. The critical
assignment for an Armor COL is brigade level command. No other position provides the Armor officer the opportunity
to fully utilize his depth of experience in Joint and combined arms warfare and to capitalize on is functional generating
force assignments in service to the Army. However, only a limited number of armor officers will have the opportunity
to command. Those officers not selected for command will continue to provide exceptional service in generating force
and Joint assignments of increasing responsibility. These officers also provide the critical bridge between the operational and generating force, and serve as the advocate of commanders in key staff elements.
b. Joint assignments. Armor officers will be considered for Joint duty assignment based on the needs of the Army,
professional development needs of the officer and availability of a Joint assignment. Armor officers and units will
continue to be called on to participate in Joint operations around the world. Joint experience, developed through
sequential assignments, will provide the Joint perspective on Army operations to be successful now and in the future.
11–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. The professional development goal of Armor branch is to produce and sustain highly qualified
officers who are tactically and operationally oriented to lead Soldiers and command units in combat and perform other
assigned missions. Assignments in combined arms organizations will be made to develop the officer’s overall ability to
achieve that goal. The officer’s assignments will be based on needs of the Army, the officer’s professional development requirements, and the officer’s preference. While Armor Branch, HRC makes every effort to support individual
officer’s assignment preferences, the needs of the Army and the officer’s professional development needs must take
priority.
b. Precedence. Certain assignments in Armor Branch will occur in a precedence sequence. Other assignments to
include professional military training are not constrained, but if possible should occur in sequence. Command positions
will have precedence over staff positions. These positions develop an officer’s ability to command at various levels
throughout a career. For example, before an officer can be a battalion/squadron S3, he will have had a successful
company/troop command. The normal sequence for a MAJ for professional development is education, battalion/

70

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

squadron XO/S3 or brigade/regiment XO/S3, followed by a Joint, branch/FA generalist or division/brigade staff officer
assignment.
11–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Key Armor Branch positions. The Armor Branch officer will serve in several key developmental positions as they
progress through their career in order to develop a Joint and expeditionary mindset, tactical and technical expertise in
combined arms warfare, and a firm grounding in Armor and Cavalry operations. There is no substitute in the Armor
Branch for service with troops in key leadership positions. The goal of the Armor officer professional development
model is to provide the Armor officer a series of operational staff and leadership positions, supplemented by
opportunities to round out their knowledge in key generating force positions, in order to achieve success in positions of
leadership at successively higher levels. The primary positions that develop this level of expertise, in sequence, are
platoon leader, company commander, S3/XO, battalion/squadron command and brigade/regimental command. The goal
is to ensure that every Armor officer is given the opportunity to serve in each of these key leadership assignments.
While operational realities and the limited number of positions will prevent the branch from providing every officer the
opportunity to command at the battalion and brigade level, the goal remains to prepare every Armor officer for
command. Those officers who do not command at the battalion level will continue to provide critical support to the
Army in key generating force positions. Their role will remain to ensure that generating force organizations continue to
maintain focus on their critical role in supporting the warfight. Armor officers, schooled in combined arms warfare will
serve as the critical link between the operational and generating force.
b. Armor Branch life cycle. Figure 11–1 shows how Armor Branch timelines, military and additional training, key
developmental assignments and self–development fit together to support the Armor Branch goal of growing future
combined arms warriors. The Armor Branch developmental goals directly support the goal of the Army transformation
to grow a campaign qualified Army with Joint and expeditionary capabilities.

Figure 11–1. Armor officer life cycle development and utilization

72

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

11–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for all Armor Branch officers. To do this the field
grade inventory must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support
branch/FA generalist positions, and to provide MAJs with the opportunity to serve in the critical developmental
assignment; S3/XO. The branch’s goal is to provide every MAJ 2 years S3/XO time while stabilized for 3 years.
b. Officer Personnel Management System implementation. The number of authorized Armor billets, by grade, will
vary as force structure decisions are made, and actions to implement them are taken. Officers who desire more
information on Armor Branch authorizations or inventory, by grade, are encouraged to contact their AHRC OPMD
assignment officer.
11–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Armor
a. Structure. Armor officers may serve in a variety of organizations during the Army’s transformation to include
tank battalions, division cavalry squadrons, armored cavalry squadrons, or reconnaissance squadrons. However, after
transformation is complete, the primary operational assignments for armor officers will be in brigade combat teams and
reconnaissance squadrons. Armor officers may also serve in critical developmental assignments in TDA organizations.
b. Acquire. Armor officers are accessed through USMA, ROTC and OCS. Officers are accessed into Armor based
on their branch preference and the needs of the Army. Armor is a recipient branch under the current system of branch
detailing. Armor receives officers from the combat support and service support arms to fill LT authorizations. Branch
detailed officers return to their commissioning branch upon their selection to CPT and assignment to their branch
transition course. It is imperative that branch detail officers not attend follow-on schools (such as Airborne or Ranger)
after the Armor CCC; they should report directly to their unit of assignment. This provides the officer with the required
time to develop as a platoon leader in combat arms before transitioning to his commissioning branch. The current
system is meeting the needs of the force.
c. Distribute. The goal of Armor Branch is to provide every Armor officer a variety of leadership, staff and
functional assignments at each grade to develop and utilize their craft as combined arms warriors. The priority is on
developing a depth of experience in Armor and Cavalry operations while concurrently developing a depth of experience in Joint and combine arms warfare. They will also be provided the opportunity to serve in key generating force
assignments in order to fully develop their knowledge of how the Army runs and to provide opportunities to support
the warfighting Army through key staff and functional assignments. Officers may also rotate between CONUS and
OCONUS assignments. Officers will have more time to gain the requisite skills in their branch and their branch/FA
generalist assignments. Armor officers are rotated between assignments to ensure they develop the full range of skills
necessary to perform as senior leaders.
d. Deploy. Armor branch officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA
organizations, all Armor officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict.
Armor officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests; or
as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping
missions. Armor Branch officers must prepare themselves and their families for this most challenging life cycle
function.
e. Sustain. Armor combat skills are maintained through institutional training and assignments in warfighting units.
(1) Promotion. Armor branch field grade officers designated to remain in Armor and the Operations career field will
compete for promotion only within the Operations career field. If an Armor officer is designated to one of the 3 other
career fields, he will no longer compete against Armor officers in the Operations career field.
(2) Command. Armor branch commanders will continue to be centrally selected for command at the battalion and
brigade level. All Armor officer command opportunities are in the Operations career field. These commands are
organized into 4 functional categories: tactical, training and strategic support, institutional and TRADOC System
Managers. Officers have the option of selecting the category or categories in which they desire to compete for
command, while declining competition in other categories. The results of the command selection process are announced in the CSL.
(3) Officer Evaluation Report. The DA Form 67–9 requires the rater and senior rater to recommend a career field
for all Army competitive CPTs through LTCs. When recommending career fields for rated officers, rating officials will
consider the whole person with factors such as: demonstrated performance, educational background, technical or
unique expertise, military experience or training and personal preference of the officer. career field recommendations of
raters and senior raters on the OER will be an important factor taken into consideration during the career field
designation process.
f. Develop. Armor officers are developed through a logical progression of TOE assignments, institutional training
and staff/TDA assignments. The focus of Armor officer professional development is on the attainment and utilization

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

73

of warfighting skills, and the utilization of those skills to support the critical doctrine, organization, training, material
systems, leader development, personnel and facility (DOTMLPF) development missions of the branch. The goal is to
professionally develop officers to employ firepower and maneuver skills in support of combined arms and Joint
operations. Development occurs through the Army school system; all officers selected for MAJ should complete some
form of MEL 4/ILE education, and all officers selected for COL should complete MEL 1 education.
g. Separate. Armor branch has no unique separation processes.
11–8. Armor Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. Reserve Component Armor officer development objectives and qualifications parallel those planned for their Active duty counterparts, with limited exceptions. The increase in advanced technology
weaponry and the lethality of modern weapon systems requires that RC officers train at the appropriate level. This is
necessary in order to acquire those skills required for commanding, training and managing RC organizations for
peacetime operation, as well as mobilization. The RC officer must realize that a large portion of his education and
training will be accomplished on his own time, in accordance with his unit duty assignments. A variety of correspondence courses are available as well as a full range of schools that he may attend as a resident student. Junior officers
must develop a strong foundation of Armor tactical and technical expertise through assignments in their branch before
specializing in a specific area/skill.
(1) Role. The RC Armor officer serves the same role and mission as his Active Army counterpart. The unique
nature of his role as a citizen–soldier will pose a challenge to his professional development program. However, RC
officer professional development is expected to mirror AC officer development patterns as closely as possible, except
as noted below. The 2 primary exceptions are: RC officers tend to spend more time in key leadership positions and RC
officers have increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. In order to meet professional
development objectives, the RC officer may need to rotate between ARNG and USAR TPU, the Individual Ready
Reserve, and Individual Mobilization Augmentee assignments to reach his professional development objectives (see
chap 7).
(2) Reserve Component lieutenant. Upon commissioning, each officer is assigned a career branch in which the
emphasis for training and development occurs during the officers first seven to eight years.
(a) Education. Mandatory military education during this phase is completion of the resident Armor Officer Basic
Course (MEL–7), which should be completed within 12 months (NLT 18 months) of commissioning and is a
prerequisite for promotion to 1LT. Officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university
to qualify for promotion to CPT.
(b) Initial assignments. Officers should seek and be assigned to leadership positions in troop units whenever
possible. This duty provides the officer an understanding of operations and military life that will build a solid
foundation for future service. Every attempt will be made to assign junior officers to troop units. While assigned at the
company level, officers should seek a variety of assignments, which will enhance their future performance as a
commander.
(3) Reserve Component captain.
(a) Formal training. Mandatory education during this phase is completion of the Armor Captain’s Career Course
(ACCC) (MEL–6) which is a prerequisite for promotion to MAJ. ACCC can be completed through attendance at the
resident course or the RC course (ACCC–DL) that has a distance learning phase and a 2–week resident phase. A
percentage of AR officers elect to attend the Infantry Captains Career Course (Resident or RC course) in lieu of
ACCC/ACCC–DL. Officers branch transferring are encouraged to see DA Pam 351–4 for military education requirements and procedures to apply for ACCC constructive credit.
(b) Assignments. Assignments in a company, battalion or brigade organization should follow a progressive order.
The command of a unit is the essence of leadership development at this stage of an officer’s career. Units fill company
command positions with officers who have demonstrated the potential for and the desire to command Soldiers. Most
command tours are 18–24 months long with the tour length set by the higher commander and are preceded by
attendance at the company level pre-command course. The number of company command positions may not afford
every officer to have the opportunity to command at the CPT level. Command can be of traditional modified tables of
organization and equipment (MTOE) line units or tables of distribution and allowances (TDA) units. Some officers
may receive more than one command opportunity, but those cases are rare. Battalion staff experience is also desired
during this period, but the focus should be to command a unit.
(c) Typical duty assignments. Officers should aggressively seek Armor or Mechanized Infantry company/troop
command. Following successful company/troop command, officers can be assigned to similar types of non–troop
assignments as Active Army officers. In addition, they may participate in the Individual Mobilization Augmentee and
AGR programs.
(d) Functional area training. Reserve Component officers are awarded an FA based upon the needs of the Army,
the officer’s geographic location, individual experience, education and training. Functional area assignments offer the
Armor officer flexibility and the opportunity for additional assignments in both the ARNG and USAR. Officers who
received an FA while on active duty may continue to serve in that FA or may request award of a different FA based

74

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

upon the availability of such assignments and the needs of the Army. Functional area designators are awarded at the
officer’s request once all prerequisites for award of the FA have been met.
(4) Reserve Component major. Promotion to MAJ normally occurs at the 10th year of commissioned service.
Promotion prior to consideration by the DA mandatory promotion board (position vacancy promotion) is possible.
Selection for MAJ is based on performance and potential for further service in positions of greater responsibility. These
qualities are measured by the officer’s assignment history, branch development achieved and the relative standing of
the officer to his peers as indicated in the officer evaluation report (OER).
(a) Formal training. Officers should complete the Command & General Staff College (CGSC) (MEL- 4). The RC
MAJ must complete 50 percent of CGSC as a prerequisite for promotion to LTC. Officers can complete the
requirements for MEL–4 in numerous ways: CGSC (resident or non–resident), Sister Service resident CGSC or
Associate Logistics Executive Development Course (ALEDC).
(b) Assignments. The critical assignment during this phase is service as an Armor or Mechanized Infantry battalion/
squadron S3 or XO, or brigade/regimental S3. Also, duty on brigade/division staff and Joint Forces Headquarters or
ARCOM, GOCOM, MUSARC is desired. Reserve Component Armor MAJs may typically serve in similar assignments as Active Army officers and should continue to gain staff experience at division level and higher. Successful
assignments in positions such as battalion executive officer (XO) and operations officers (S–3) best prepares officers
for the rigors of battalion command. Officers desiring to remain competitive for battalion command should endeavor to
serve in such positions. Duty in progressively challenging assignments is an essential ingredient in the career
development of officers prior to promotion to LTC. Officers may participate in the AGR Program. Armor positions in
RC units are actively sought and highly competitive. An officer should seek to remain in a unit if at all possible. An
officer may choose to become a member of the IRR or the IMA programs. The IRR and IMA programs for majors
offer many unique opportunities for training and development. The IMA program provides the Armor officer an
opportunity to train in the position he will occupy upon mobilization.
(5) Reserve Component lieutenant colonel. The promotion board considers the RC MAJ for promotion to LTC at the
16th year of commissioned service. Promotion prior to consideration by the DA mandatory promotion board
(below–the–zone promotion) is possible. Duty in progressively challenging assignments is an essential ingredient in the
career development of officers and subsequent promotion to LTC. Generally, these positions are in the MTOE or TDA
environment as staff officers in battalions, brigades or JFHQ. Highly qualified officers in this phase may be selected to
command a tank battalion or cavalry squadron. Other assignments include: brigade/regimental XO; division primary
staff; various Joint Forces Headquarters; Army Reserve Commands (ARCOM); General Officer Commands
(GOCOMS); or Major USAR Commands (MUSARC) staff positions. He may also participate in the AGR, IRR, or
IMA programs.
(a) Formal training. The RC LTC must complete the Command and General Staff Officer Course prior to
promotion to colonel. Selectees for battalion command attend the Armor Pre-Command Course. Qualified Armor LTCs
may apply for the U.S. Army War College or other senior Service colleges (resident or correspondence).
(b) Assignments. Highly qualified RC LTCs may be selected to command a tank battalion, cavalry squadron or
Armor TASS battalion. Other typical assignments include the following: brigade or regimental XO; division primary
staff, various Joint Forces Headquarters, US Army Reserve Regional Support Command (RSC), General Officer
Command (GOCOM), and Major US Army Reserve Command (MUSARC) staff positions; or HQDA level and Joint
staff assignments. Reserve Component LTCs may participate in the AGR, IRR or IMA programs
(6) Reserve Component colonel.
(a) Formal training. Although no mandatory education requirements (other than PCC for command selectees) exist
during this phase, officers are encouraged to complete a MEL 1 producing program of instruction (resident or
non–resident).
(b) Assignments. Highly qualified colonels may be selected to command an armor or mechanized infantry brigade or
cavalry regiment. Other typical assignments include AGR program participation and various senior duty positions at
the division, JFHQ, RSC, GOCOM, MUSARC levels, and HQDA and Joint staff assignments.
b. Branch development. Even though RC officer development is challenged by geographical considerations and time
constraints, each officer should strive for Armor assignments and educational opportunities that yield the same
developmental opportunities as their Active Army counterparts.
(1) Introduction. Reserve Component (ARNG and USAR) officers must also meet certain standards in terms of
schooling and operational assignments to be considered fully qualified in the Armor Branch at each grade. Due to
geographical, time and civilian employment constraints, RC Armor officers may find it difficult to serve in the required
operational assignments required at each grade in order to remain fully qualified as an Armor officer. Nevertheless, RC
Armor officers are expected to complete the educational requirements discussed below and to aggressively seek out the
operational assignments to remain proficient in the branch.
(2) Reserve Component captain. The desired experience for the Armor Branch CPT is—
(a) Completion of either Armor or Infantry CCC (MEL 6) (see DA Pam 351–4 for military education requirements
based on the type of BOLC completed and for constructive credit application procedures).

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

75

(b) Obtainment of a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university. Effective 1 Oct 95, RC officers
must obtain a baccalaureate degree to qualify for promotion to CPT.
(c) Successful command of an armor or mechanized infantry company or troop. The goal is for each RC CPT to
serve a minimum of 36 months company/troop command time (plus or minus 12 months). However, the key is quality
of the experience rather than time in command.
(3) Reserve Component major. The goal for RC Armor MAJ professional development is—
(a) Service as an armor or mechanized infantry TOE or TDA battalion or squadron S3 or XO, or as a brigade or
regiment S3. The goal is for each Armor MAJ to serve a minimum of 24 months. There is no substitute for time spent
as an S3/XO in preparing the Armor MAJ for battalion command and for expanding his knowledge of mounted
maneuver warfare.
(b) Supplement their S3/XO experience with assignments in key duty positions in armor or mechanized units. This
includes service in primary staff positions at the battalion, brigade, or regiment levels; and continue to gain staff
experience at the division and higher levels. Reserve Component MAJs may participate in the AGR or Individual
Mobilization Augmentee programs.
(c) Enrollment in CGSC prior to 18 years time in service.
(4) Reserve Component lieutenant colonel. The desired professional development experience for the Armor LTC
is—
(a) Completion of CGSC (MEL 4). This must be completed within 3 years of promotion to LTC.
(b) Command an armor or mechanized infantry TOE or TDA battalion or squadron for 36 months (plus or minus 12
months). While every Armor officer will not command at the battalion level, the goal of Armor officer professional
development is to provide every Armor officer the assignments, institutional training and experience to prepare him for
command at this level. The Armor officers selected for command will remain competitive for promotion to COL and
brigade command.
(c) Service in key duty positions such as an armor or mechanized infantry brigade or regiment XO or served in
division primary staff or JFHQ, RSC, GOCOM and MUSARC staff positions; or in HQDA and Joint staff assignments.
Reserve Component LTCs may participate in the AGR or Individual Mobilization Augmentee programs.
(d) May be selected to attend a Senior Service College or Army War College Corresponding Studies Course (MEL
1).
(5) Reserve Component colonel. The professional development goal for Armor COLs is:
(a) Command of an armor or mechanized Infantry brigade or cavalry regiment for 36 months (plus or minus 12
months).
(b) Service in various duty positions at the division, JFHQ, RSC, GOCOM and MUSARC levels; or in HQDA and
Joint staff assignments. COLs may participate in the AGR or Individual Mobilization Augmentee program.
(c) May be selected to attend a Senior Service College or Army War College Corresponding Studies Course (MEL
1).
c. Life cycle development model. The Reserve Component life cycle development model for Armor officers is shown
at figure 11–2.

Chapter 12
Field Artillery Branch
12–1. Unique features of Field Artillery Branch
The mission of the Field Artillery is to destroy, neutralize or suppress the enemy by cannon, rocket and missile fire
(lethal and non–lethal) and to synchronize (through trained and resourced effects coordination cells) the integration of
all fire support assets in Joint and combined arms operations. To accomplish this unique mission Field Artillery leaders
must fully understand maneuver operations to ensure synchronized, relevant and integrated effects that enable success
on the ever-changing battlefield. The foundation of the Field Artillery Branch is dedicated leaders at all levels
controlling and integrating timely, precise, effective firepower to support effects based operations. The future of the
Field Artillery is the mastery of the synchronization and integration of all sources of fires and effects, both lethal and
non–lethal, on the global battlefield. This mastery includes an in-depth understanding of combined arms operations,
Joint Force operations, multinational operations and interagency coordination across all spectrums of combat. To
accomplish this mission the Field Artillery requires bold, dynamic, intelligent and adaptive officers, capable of making
tough decisions under the stresses of combat. A dedicated, flexible and strong officer corps, imbued with the Warrior
Ethos, will ensure the Field Artillery remains the “King of Battle”.
a. Unique purpose of Field Artillery Branch. The Field Artillery synchronizes and integrates Army fire support
assets, multiple Joint assets (Air Force, Navy, Marine), interagency assets, and multinational assets at the designated
place and time to ensure the enemies are overwhelmed by lethal and/or non–lethal firepower. The Field Artillery
combines the devastating effects of its own cannon, rocket, missile, and acquisition systems with numerous fire support
assets across a variety of combat arms and Joint Services to maximize the fires and effects that are brought to bear on
adversaries of the United States.
(1) Unique functions performed by Field Artillery Branch.
(2) Field Artillery officers are the integrators and synchronizers of lethal and non–lethal indirect fires for the Army.
Field Artillery officers advise maneuver commanders on how to obtain the effects they desire with the systems
available. Field Artillery officers also command Field Artillery firing assets and systems and execute fires based on the
intent of maneuver commanders.
(a) Field Artillery officers are assigned directly to Army maneuver units (Infantry, Armor, Aviation, Ranger, Special
Forces) and to a variety of key positions in divisions and higher headquarters (to include Joint and multinational
elements) to perform their unique and critical fires integration mission. Field Artillery officers plan, coordinate,
integrate, synchronize, and employ lethal and non–lethal fires and effects systems in support of Joint and combined
arms operations. These fires and effects systems include air support, naval surface fires, attack aviation, mortars,
electronic warfare, information operations, space based systems and Field Artillery acquisition and weapon systems.
(b) Field Artillery officers plan and integrate Information Operations effects (non–lethal effects) providing multifaceted or alternative means to accomplish stated missions (sometimes eliminating the need to use lethal effects at all).
The integration of Information Operations is yet another unique mission Field Artillery officers engage in using a
variety of assets from organic systems to more complex national capabilities.
b. Unique capabilities. The Field Artillery WO provides the Army with the necessary technical and tactical expertise
to operate, maintain, and repair the Army’s Field Artillery target acquisition radars and to serve as targeting officers,
counterfire officers, and Field Artillery intelligence officers (FAIO) integrating lethal and non–lethal effects from
battalion levels through Joint Force headquarters levels.
c. Unique features of service in Field Artillery Branch. There are numerous unique differences in the nature of
service between Field Artillery officers (in the Operations career field) and officers in other branches or career fields.
Below are brief descriptions of the nature of service that sets Field Artillery officers in operational units apart from
officers in other branches or career fields. Field Artillery officers work at every level of command and staff and
perform the following functions/tasks:
(1) First and foremost, Field Artillery Officers are soldiers and combat arms leaders.
(2) Lead and command Field Artillery combat units and other type units at platoon, battery, battalion, and brigade
levels.
(3) Coordinate fire support at all levels of command in Joint and combined operations.
(4) Coordinate the fires and effects process in rapidly moving Joint, interagency, and multinational operations.
(5) Create and formulate doctrine, organizations, and equipment to support the fire support mission worldwide.
(6) Teach Field Artillery and fire support skills at service schools and Combat Training Centers.
(7) Lead in positions requiring general combat skills such as staff officers in military headquarters and activities
requiring combat arms expertise.
(8) Instruct at pre-commissioning programs, service schools, and service colleges.
(9) Train and advise the total Army Field Artillery force.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

d. Unique features of service in Field Artillery Warrant Officer Program. The Field Artillery WO provides
assistance and advice to the commander and staff on all matters relative to the employment of Field Artillery target
acquisition, fire support assets, and the Army’s targeting methodology. Field Artillery WOs provide many of the same
functions as the Field Artillery officers except command of tactical units. Field Artillery WOs perform the following
functions/tasks:
(1) Lead Field Artillery target acquisition radar sections.
(2) Assist in managing Field Artillery target acquisition and collection assets employment at the Field Artillery
battalion, brigade, and division level.
(3) Provide technical and tactical expertise in the coordination of the targeting process in rapidly moving, Joint,
interagency, and combined arms operations.
(4) Teach Field Artillery target acquisition asset employment and targeting skills at service schools and Combat
Training Centers.
12–2. Officer characteristics required
a. Competencies and actions common to all. Army officers must be premier warriors who can effectively apply the
4 core dimensions of leadership: values, attributes, skills and actions. The 4 core leadership dimensions provide the
basis for what a leader must be, know and do. The values and attributes set the basis for the character of the leader—
what a leader must be. The skills developed by leaders establish his or her competence— what a leader must know.
The actions that leaders conduct and execute constitute leadership— what a leader must do. The leadership framework
describes a leader of character and competence who acts to achieve excellence across the spectrum of operations from
total war, to stability and support operations, disaster relief, or realistic training operations.
(1) Values. Values are at the core of everything the Army is and does. The Army is an institution of people with
unique and enduring values. These values must be a part of the men and women officers, enlisted personnel, and
civilians who are the Army. These values provide the sense of purpose necessary to sustain our soldiers in combat and
help resolve ambiguities in operations other than war. Officers must establish and maintain an environment in the
Army where soldiers and civilians do what is right; where they treat others as they should be treated; and, where
everyone can reach their maximum potential. As a branch, the Field Artillery fully supports the 7 Army values
(acronym— LDRSHIP).
(a) Loyalty. Bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution, the Army, your unit and all soldiers.
(b) Duty. Fulfill your obligations.
(c) Respect. Treat people as they should be treated.
(d) Selfless Service. Put the welfare of the Nation, the Army and your subordinates before your own.
(e) Honor. Live up to all the Army Values.
(f) Integrity. Do what’s right, legally and morally.
(g) Personal Courage. Face fear, danger or adversity (physical or moral) with the spirit and determination of a
warrior.
(2) Soldier’s Creed and the Warrior Ethos. All soldiers (which includes all Field Artillery officers) live by the
Soldier’s Creed and the Warrior Ethos. The Soldier’s Creed and Warrior Ethos clearly display the importance placed
on the values, trust, patriotism and valor each soldier and officer has within him, as a member of the Army team and as
an American.
b. Unique skills of Field Artillery officers. Field Artillery officers must be team players and strong leaders, skilled in
fires and effects specific tactics, techniques and procedures. The goal of all Field Artillery officers is to gain an
in–depth understanding (as the officer’s experience base broadens) of how to best employ fires and effects in support
of combined arms, Joint Force, interagency and multinational operations.
(1) Leader competency. Field Artillery officers must first and foremost be competent leaders as well as professional
field artillerymen. A Field Artillery officer must possess the following skills:
(a) Combat Arms leadership
(b) Tactical skills referring to a clear understanding of warfighting tasks and missions.
(c) Technical skills reflecting competence with specific duty requirements and missions
(d) Interpersonal skills and confidence in communicating with people.
(e) Decisionmaking and execution skills enabling mission accomplishment through adaptive and flexible thought
processes and proactive and innovative actions.
(f) Conceptual skills enabling the understanding of new ideas and information.
(2) Leader attributes. Field Artillery officers have a dynamic and challenging mission. Successful Field Artillery
officers must be mentally, physically, and emotionally tough.
(a) Mental toughness is displayed by overcoming adversity. Self–discipline, initiative, judgment, confidence, intelligence, and fairness are key attributes a Field Artillery officer must possess.
(b) Physical readiness and perseverance are required of Field Artillery officers as they may be selected to serve in a
variety of physically demanding roles in Field Artillery units and in positions as fire support officers in Ranger, Special

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

79

Forces, Infantry or Armor units. All Field Artillery officers lead through example and physical fitness is an integral
part of overall health fitness, stamina, military bearing and professional bearing. Physical fitness is a decisive
advantage in combat. All Field Artillery officers will strive for optimum physical fitness levels.
(c) Emotional strength is necessary as all Field Artillery officers must be able to deal with rapidly changing,
stressful events without loosing self–control. Common sense and a true concern for the welfare of others are critically
important in building cohesive teams and units. A competitive spirit is a true asset when one knows the emotional point
at which it builds teams or breaks them down. Force of will must be balanced with emotional maturity and
understanding to achieve success in leading soldiers. Field Artillery officers must be team players with the acute ability
to work together with other branches, services and people of all nations.
c. Unique knowledge.
(1) Field Artillery officers must be subject matter experts in Field Artillery and in the integration of Joint fires to
support land/maneuver commanders. This knowledge includes practical experience in tactics, combined arms operations, Joint operations, target acquisition, and direct and indirect weapon systems. Officers gain this knowledge through
a logical sequence of continuous education, training and experience. Officers must possess and continually improve
basic computer literacy skills as Field Artillery system digitization and automation increases. Individual officers sustain
knowledge through institutional training and education, duty in operational assignments, and continuous
self–development.
(2) Field Artillery warrant officers must possess a high degree of technical and tactical knowledge of Field Artillery
target acquisition assets employment and the Army’s targeting process. They are accessed from all Field Artillery
enlisted MOSs and carry forward the competencies learned on the respective Field Artillery systems. Continuous
education, training, experience, and self-development enhance the Field Artillery WO’s technical expertise.
d. Unique attributes.
(1) The Field Artillery requires dynamic, competent, well-trained leaders at all levels that must understand how
other combat arms fight in order to effectively integrate Joint Fires. Field Artillery officers must possess the following
attributes:
(a) Terrain sense. The ability to quickly visualize terrain. This is more than viewing the terrain and knowing the
range capability of weapon systems. It is the ability to visualize the battlefield and know how to optimize weapon
systems and the application of effects on that terrain. This includes understanding the military ramifications of urban
environments and complex terrain in regards to fires and effects.
(b) A passion for precision. Field Artillery officers must be known for their attention to detail ensuring every fire
mission is on time and on target— nothing less is acceptable. Field Artillery officers control devastating firepower that
can and will annihilate anyone or anything at the point of impact. It is critically important that every call for fire a
Field Artillery officer requests impacts at the exact time and exact place designated. Field Artillery officers must
maintain a passion for precision to ensure every request for fire is executed to exacting standards from target location,
to firing data computation, to weapon system munitions delivery. This reputation for extremely high standards of
precision, demonstrated time and again by field artillerymen, is what gives our maneuver comrades in–arms the
confidence to request danger close artillery fires— the most important mission the Field Artillery has.
(c) Single minded tenacity. An imaginative, driving intensity to complete a mission with available or procured
assets. This intensity represents the warrior spirit with an attitude to continuously accomplish all missions, with the
highest priority of supporting the combined arms commander and his soldiers with relevant and responsive fires.
(d) Audacity. The willingness to take reasonable risks to achieve an objective or goal. Display self- confidence in
word and action inspiring others to perform at high levels.
(e) Physical confidence and health. A sense of physical well being that enhances self–image. The ability to
participate in regular, rigorous and demanding physical activity; not just athletic ability.
(f) Practiced, practical judgment. The ability to distinguish the vital from the unimportant, the immediate from
casual, and truth from deception.
(g) Discipline. Artillerymen must have strong self–discipline, unit discipline, and institutional discipline. This
discipline leads to precision in execution, sustaining a keen attention to detail, and sustaining the highest standards of
performance and accuracy with an end result of placing the right effects at the right place at the right time. This
discipline promotes trust and confidence in our ability to bring fires to bear in close combat— the single most
important mission of those we support in war.
(h) Unique attributes of a fire supporter. Fire supporters must possess a combination of delivery system skills and a
passion to impose their will on the enemy with the application of both lethal and non–lethal effects. Great Fire Support
Officers are a unique blend of the best attributes of a Field Artilleryman and an Infantryman. Fire Supporters must be
"street fighters" with a rugged determination to close with and kill the enemy with a bayonet if necessary, but also
carry the ability to bring out the "big stick" for the maneuver force— which is the capability to muster more firepower,
in any weather, any time, any place, than is available in any Infantry or Armor force - the devastating fires and effects
of the Field Artillery. The Fire Supporter must advise the maneuver force on what the Field Artillery can do - and then
do it with uncompromising exactness and determination.
(i) Possess a Joint and expeditionary mindset. All Field Artillery officers must possess an expeditionary mindset— a

80

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

willingness to take the fight to the Nation’s enemies at the time and place of our choosing. This means field
artillerymen must be ready to apply fires and effects anywhere in the world, in either long or short duration
requirements, and do so in a flexible and adaptive manner. This application of fires and effects will include Joint,
interagency, multinational, and Coalition assets that will have to be synchronized and synergized to win our Nation’s
wars. Field Artillery officers must gain in–depth knowledge in the discipline of fires and effects as well as learning the
nuances of Joint, interagency, multinational, and Coalition planning and warfare. This lifelong learning effort starts
prior to commissioning and continues throughout the officer’s entire career. The study of foreign cultures, language
skills learned in college, numerous professional development opportunities provided throughout an Army career, and
formal schooling (both military and civilian) are just a few of the opportunities that will assist an officer develop an
expeditionary mindset— and help us serve, protect, and defend this great Nation.
(2) Unique attributes of the Field Artillery warrant officer. Field Artillery WOs should have all the same attributes
as Field Artillery officers to include—
(a) A high degree of comprehension and technical competence in Field Artillery systems, intelligence collection
assets, and architecture specific functions.
(b) Acute systemic problem solving skills.
12–3. Critical Active Army officer developmental assignments
a. Branch officer professional development. Field Artillery officer assignment patterns will vary depending on the
needs of the Army, professional development requirements, the type of manning system used in the unit the officer is
assigned and individual officer preferences. To fully understand officer career development patterns an officer must
first understand the Army Stabilization Policy.
b. Army Stabilization Policy. Force Stabilization is a new Army manning initiative aimed at creating more agile,
lethal units with more experienced Soldiers while still developing its leaders and taking care of the needs of
individuals. Unit Focused Stability is the strategy which assigns individuals to their unit and stabilizes them at that
installation for an extended tour. A goal of Force Stabilization is creating a more Joint Expeditionary Force that is
generally CONUS based. With implementation of Force Stabilization, the Army will assign soldiers using the
following 3 criteria in order of importance— needs of the Army, soldier’s leader development needs, and soldier’s
preference.
c. Unit focused stability. Unit focused stability is a manning strategy that reduces turbulence within a unit by
synchronizing personnel assignments to the operational cycle of the unit. Soldiers assigned under UFS will serve in a
unit for the duration of the unit’s operational cycle (36 months). Arrivals and departures of personnel occur in specific
scheduled periods thereby allowing the unit to focus on integrating the new soldiers and building or sustaining combat
capability and readiness. Actions such as reassignments, schooling, and exercising reenlistment options will occur
during specified periods of time outside the unit’s life cycle period. The 2 manning methods under unit focused
stability are life cycle and cyclic management.
(1) Life cycle management. Life cycle manning synchronizes a soldier’s assignment to the unit’s operational cycle.
Goals of the life cycle model are to build better trained and cohesive units and to maximize a unit’s deployability
during its ready phase. Types of organizations earmarked for life cycle management are Modularized Brigade Combat
Teams (BCT) and units where consistent combat readiness and cohesion are paramount. There are 3 phases in a life
cycle; reset, train, and ready. The reset phase is the conclusion of the current life cycle and initiation of a subsequent
iteration. Based upon unit structure, soldier promotions and leader development needs, about 30 to 50 percent of the
unit could remain in the unit for an additional life cycle. During the reset phase incoming and outgoing personnel
simultaneously conduct transition activities (HHG, CIF, in/out process, property and equipment transfer, and so on).
The train phase is when life cycle units progress through focused training from individual through collective capability,
culminating with a certification exercise at a Combat Training Center (CTC) or a Major Readiness Exercise (MRE) in
a local training area. The ready phase marks the time period in which a unit is available for employment. During this
phase a unit can be deployed for operational missions, scheduled as a Deployment Ready Brigade (DRB), or
incorporated into their higher headquarter’s Training Management System, which outlines readiness levels in relation to
red, amber, and green cycles. If not deployed, individual and collective sustainment training continues throughout this
phase, building on the capabilities established in the train phase.
(2) Cyclic management. Cyclic management is focused on headquarters type command and control units, low
density/high impact units where continuity of operations is paramount, and other designated units based on Army
needs. A cyclic unit progresses or alternates between 2 phases; sustain and ready. During the sustain phase leader and
soldier assignments occur synchronized with a predetermined 1–2 month period (to include unprogrammed loss
replacement). The ready phase begins at the end of one sustain phase and continues to the beginning of the subsequent
sustain phase. New personnel are rapidly integrated into the team as this integration only occurs once per cycle.
Optimum minimal length of one sustain and ready phase is 12 months. The goal for a soldier’s assignment length is 36
months so most soldiers will go through 3 cycles and then be available for reassignment. Unit commanders will
determine exceptions.
d. Field Artillery officer career development.

(1) Lieutenant.
(a) After commissioning, Field Artillery LTs currently attend BOLC II and then BOLC III at Fort Sill, OK. The
BOLC III is a challenging, dynamic, and warrior focused course that is dedicated to high quality, relevant, and
professionally presented training and instruction. The course focuses on training Field Artillery officers to become
competent and professional field artillerymen with a focus on those skills required of a combat ready company fires
officer (or fire support officer), firing platoon leader, and fire direction officer. The BOLC II program is a 6–week
small–unit leadership experience focusing on platoon leader skills and troop leading procedures. This training will
occur at several designated Army installations. BOLC II training is required for all branch officers after commissioning
and occurs prior to attendance to BOLC III.
(b) While at Field Artillery BOLC III, all LTs are encouraged to participate in the Ranger Indoctrination Program.
This program prepares officers to attend Ranger School by providing additional physical training and skills training
related to Ranger School. Officers who successfully complete this program will normally attend Ranger and Airborne
School after BOLC III. Ranger School is particularly beneficial to those officers desiring Fire Support positions in light
infantry, air assault, airborne, Ranger or Special Forces units. However, all officers are encouraged to attend Ranger
School regardless of assignment, as it provides an excellent foundation in small unit tactics as well as being a
tremendous leadership experience improving the competence and confidence of all those awarded the coveted Ranger
Tab.
(c) After completing BOLC III, LTs can expect to be assigned to a tactical Field Artillery battalion at battery level
in a life cycle unit to gain leadership experience and to enhance technical and tactical competence and confidence.
Ideally, LTs will experience duty at the firing battery level as platoon leaders, executive officers, or fire direction
officers prior to serving in company fire support officer positions. Officers initially assigned to Generating Force units
(also known as TDA units) will have an opportunity for assignment to Operating Force units (tactical units) to gain
experience and further develop Field Artillery specific tactical skills later in their first assignment.
(d) Typical Field Artillery developmental assignments for LTs—
1. Professional development as an LT should focus on developing platoon level leadership skills, mastering basic
Field Artillery technical and tactical competencies, and developing combined arms fires and effects integration skills
and competencies.
2. The key branch developmental assignments as an LT are platoon leader, fire direction officer, and company fires
officer (or company fire support officer). LTs should seek one or more of these assignments as these are the toughest
assignments and provide valuable experiences in both leadership and fires and effects expertise. However, success in
any of the Field Artillery assignments listed below (or combination of assignments) will provide excellent opportunities
for career development and future consideration for promotion to the grade of CPT—
a. Company fires officer (fire support officer)
b. Firing platoon leader
c. Fire direction officer
d. Battery executive officer
e. Battery operations officer
f. Support platoon leader
g. Target acquisition platoon leader
h. Other equivalent assignments as platoon leaders or key staff officers.
(e) Before promotion to CPT an officer must obtain a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university.
The officer can go before the CPT’s promotion board and become promotable without a degree, however, he/she must
complete the degree before the actual CPT promotion pin–on date and before attending the CCC.
(2) Captain.
(a) Captains Career Course.
1. Field Artillery officers normally attend the Field Artillery CCC following selection for promotion to the grade of
CPT. Field commanders will determine the best time for school attendance based on the needs of the Army, the
continued professional development requirements of the officer, and the officer’s individual preferences.
2. Field Artillery officers in life cycle manned units (after approximately 36 months in LT positions) will attend the
CPTs career course and will, most likely, return back to their previous duty station for continued career development in
CPT level positions. Field Artillery officers in cyclic manned units (after approximately 36 months in LT positions)
will attend the CPTs career course and will, most likely, move to a new duty station for continued career development
in CPT level positions.
3. The CCC consists of approximately 18 weeks of branch specific technical and tactical training with integrated
common core instruction. This training prepares officers to command at battery level, perform fires and effects
integration as a battalion level fire support officer, or work as a key staff officer on a battalion or brigade level staff.
Selected CPTs may have an opportunity to attend 1 of the other combat arms career courses. A Field Artillery officer,
for example, may attend the Infantry or Armor CCC. This cross training option benefits officers of both branches.
Selection is competitive and these slots are generally reserved for officers with key developmental experiences.

82

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(b) Captain leader development. A wide variety of interesting and challenging assignments are available to Field
Artillery CPTs after the career course. The majority of CPTs will be assigned to Field Artillery cannon or rocket
battalions or to fire support positions within maneuver battalions (Ranger, Special Forces, Infantry, Armor, Aviation).
A small number of officers will be assigned to force generating units (the Field Artillery Training Center as an
example) to ensure the training base has quality officers to lead and command training units and new recruits. Either
assignment path offers a unique Field Artillery experience including battery command opportunities.
(c) Typical Field Artillery developmental assignments for CPTs—
1. Professional development as a CPT is focused on developing strong troop leading skills, mastering technical and
tactical Field Artillery competencies, learning skills in fires and effects management in support of Joint and combined
arms operations, and understanding Field Artillery specific operations, logistics, and support requirements. Professional
development experiences following the CCC are numerous. In many cases, officers will have an opportunity to serve in
multiple assignments to assist in their career development.
2. The key branch developmental assignments for a CPT include battery command and battalion level fires officer
(or battalion level fire support officer). Battery command provides the single most valuable experience a CPT can
obtain in troop leading and small–unit operations. The battalion fires officer assignment (or fire support officer
assignment) at the maneuver battalion provides the most challenging assignments available in the discipline of fires and
effects integration with maneuver forces. These assignments provide a very credible developmental experience in the
core skill sets required of fires and effects coordinators, future Field Artillery battalion level commanders, and key field
grade staff officers. CPTs should seek these tough assignments.
3. Overall, the developmental assignment experiences are designed to allow commanders wide latitude in tailoring
the type, number, and order of assignments based on the developmental needs of the officer, the operational needs of
the unit, the availability of developmental duty positions within the command, and the overall needs of the Army.
Success in the assignments listed below (or combination of assignments) will provide opportunities for career development and future consideration for promotion to the grade of MAJ (which will be primarily based on performance in
one or more of these positions)—
a. Battery command
b. Battalion fires officer (or battalion fire support officer)
c. Other fires or effects cell officer positions (BCT/FA Bde/Bn)
d. Field Artillery battalion assistant S3
e. Field Artillery battalion fire direction officer (FDO)
f. Field Artillery brigade operations
g. Primary staff officers at battalion and higher levels
h. Special Joint, interagency, and multinational assignments
i. Other career developing CPT equivalent assignments.
4. The goal of the Field Artillery Branch is to provide a battery command opportunity for all CPTs displaying the
competence required of a commander in this challenging experience. However, battery command selection will remain
competitive. Commanding is a privilege, not a right. Field commanders will determine and select Field Artillery
officers exhibiting the necessary skills and experience to lead soldiers as a battery commander. Officers that do not
have a command opportunity will be provided other branch developmental opportunities in other worthwhile and
challenging positions that will satisfy the professional development requirements to continue successfully within the
Field Artillery career field and potentially lead to promotion. Assignment as a battalion fires officer (or battalion fire
support officer), battalion fire direction officer, battalion assistant S3, or as a battalion primary staff officer are some
examples of superb career developmental assignments in addition to battery command.
5. Battery command length will vary based on mission requirements and can range between 12 and 36 months. Field
commanders will determine battery command length based on mission requirements. However, the goal for battery
command duration is 18 months (plus or minus 6 months).
6. A small percentage of CPTs may have a 2nd command opportunity. Second command opportunities are usually
reserved for commands that tend to present a unique and more diverse challenge (where the unit and soldiers would
benefit significantly by having a commander with previous command experience). Additionally, commanders of
generating force units (TDA/training units) that display future potential as a battalion commander will be given the
highest consideration for a second command opportunity in an operating force unit (tactical unit). Also, training center
units, due to the importance of their mission, may be offered as a second command to former tactical unit commanders.
For this reason, there is an active battery command exchange program, which promotes an exchange of training unit
commanders with tactical force commanders after 12–18 months in command. This exchange program is based on the
availability of officers, force training requirements and the needs of the Army. Second commands remain a viable,
although limited, option to provide a varied and relevant leadership experience that benefits the officer and the unit.
7. Most difficult and demanding, but highly rewarding are the battalion fires officer or fire support officer (FSO).
CPTs should aggressively prepare for and seek assignments as battalion fires officers or as battalion fire support
officers. Fires officers are assigned directly to maneuver organizations, which include Ranger, Special Forces, Infantry,
Armor, Aviation and other maneuver type forces. Battalion fires officers work directly for maneuver commanders in

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

83

maneuver organizations. The battlefield insights and perspectives gained while working directly in maneuver formations benefit these field artillerymen throughout their entire career. The experience of integrating fires and effects for
the maneuver force is so critically important that field commanders are encouraged to place their most experienced
officers in these critical positions. Former battery commanders make excellent choices to fill fires and effects
assignments, as their battery command experience provides a unique perspective and understanding of the fires delivery
process. Former battery commanders bring tremendous credibility to these critical fires positions by providing an
experienced and knowledgeable leader to advise and support our maneuver forces— the most important mission.
Officers assigned to units without fires and effects positions will be afforded the opportunity to request a move or short
tour in order to gain this valuable fire support experience. All Field Artillery officers should strive for fire support
experience during their LT and CPT years.
8. Although the focus of career development for CPTs is to become competent in fires and effects and Field
Artillery operations, it remains critically important to develop officers with a Joint and expeditionary mindset and
experience base. Therefore, as early in an officer’s career as possible, assignments that broaden the experience base and
perspective of officers, as they relate to Joint operations and Coalition warfare, will benefit both the Army and the
officer. CPTs who have gained the necessary branch specific experiences should seek assignments and/or schooling
that provide unique Joint, interagency, and multinational perspectives and experiences. A balance of breadth of
experience versus depth of understanding in a particular field must be considered and will vary based on the needs of
the Army.
9. All CPTs should aggressively seek challenging tactical assignments that provide the best professional opportunities and experiences to develop them as Field Artillery officers. In general terms, the more challenging and tougher the
assignment, the more rewarding and beneficial the experience. Seeking the tough jobs and succeeding at them will
provide the best opportunities for professional growth and development. Doing well in a tough assignment is personally
rewarding and will also open future career options as the officer progresses and has the opportunity to appear before
competitive promotion boards that look at the future potential of competing officers. In most cases, offices will be
assigned positions based on the needs of the unit commander. In all cases, the most important measure of an officer’s
success is how well he performs in the position he is assigned.
10. How well one does the job assigned remains the primary determination of success. There is room for a wide
variety of career paths and job assignments in the Field Artillery. Functional area designation and career field
designation opportunities are also avenues Field Artillery officers can pursue to provide an even broader variety of
additional unique career paths. Clearly, an officer’s overall career success is based on the goals and objectives
established by each individual officer and not by Field Artillery assignment policies. There is no one set prescriptive
career path that every officer must follow to be successful.
(d) Assignments. Branch developed CPTs can expect follow–on assignments consistent with the needs of the Army.
Additional developmental and career enhancing assignments include—
1. Small Group Leaders (SGL) and Observer/Controller Evaluators (O/CE). Training, mentoring and guiding our
future leaders, our most important asset, is of the utmost importance to the Field Artillery. Our most experienced and
best leaders must become the trainers and mentors of our next generation of officers and soldiers. Therefore, it is
important to highlight the SGL and O/CE assignments considered so critical to the overall success of the Field
Artillery. The SGL positions are important instructor assignments at Fort Sill (mainly for instruction related to the
FACCC) and in other key billets throughout the Army. The O/CE positions are challenging subject matter expert
(SME) assignments at the Combat Training Centers (NTC, JRTC, CMTC, BCTP). These superb assignments are
nominative (officer files are reviewed in a competitive selection process). Officers with the right credentials and
experience are nominated and offered this challenging assignment that will further improve their technical, tactical and
leadership skills. Therefore, these assignments are considered career enhancing because only the best officers are asked
to fill them. Additionally, the personal satisfaction of mentoring and developing young leaders provides these select
officers a very worthwhile and gratifying experience. The SGLs and O/CEs truly become subject matter experts and
their experience and opinions are shared across the Field Artillery. All officers should seek out these challenging and
rewarding assignments.
2. Other critical instructor positions (USMA faculty, ROTC, other branch and service school instructors.
3. Other branch/FA generalist positions (for example, USAREC staff, Active Army/RC) positions, or other RC
duty).
4. Other special assignments in Joint, Interagency, and/or Multinational positions.
5. Other nominative assignments (for example, aide-de-camp and internships).
6. Functional area positions.
7. Advanced Civil Schooling (based on FA and Army requirements).
(e) Building professional knowledge. CPTs should continue to gain an in–depth understanding of combined arms
operations and become proficient in Field Artillery and fire support tasks. These tasks provide the foundation of
knowledge required to effectively serve in the branch as a leader at the battery and battalion level. CPTs must gain a
working knowledge of command principles, battalion level staff operations, and combined arms and fire support
operations. As a CPT develops he should also seek to broaden his perspectives in Joint, interagency, and multinational

84

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

assignments due to the nature of our expeditionary forces and the likelihood of future coalition warfare. CPTs should
also dedicate time to professional reading to gain a historical perspective on tactical and leadership challenges.
(f) Functional area designation. All officers in the grade of CPT will have the opportunity to submit 3 FA
preferences as part of a new FAD Preference Process adopted by the Army. The formal designation of FAs is based
upon the needs of the Army, officer preference, military experience and civilian schooling and is competitive based on
each FA’s requirements. Some officers will attend Advanced Civil Schooling based on the needs of their FA. Only a
portion of each officer year group will be released to functional assignments.
(3) Major.
(a) Immediately following selection for MAJ, an officer’s record goes before a Career Field Designation Board.
This board, comprised of senior officers, will decide if the officer is best suited to serve in the Operations, the
Operational Support, the Information Operations, or the Institutional Support career field.
1. The majority of Field Artillery MAJs will be designated to remain in the Operations career field based on
requirements. Field Artillery Branch, HRC will manage assignments for Field Artillery MAJs in the Operations career
field. Field Artillery officers remaining in the Operations career field will be assigned to branch and branch/FA
generalist assignments. A stated goal of OPMS is to allow Operations career field officers to stabilize time served in
operational units for 36 months.
2. Field Artillery MAJs, based on skills and experience, may request other than the Operations career field.
Selection to assignment outside of the Operations career field is competitively based on the specific requirements for
the desired career field (number of officers required, education, experience, and so forth). The assignment officers for
those career fields will manage qualification standards and assignments for majors designated into one of the other
career fields.
3. Officers will compete for promotion to LTC and higher within their designated career field (Operations career
field for those staying within the Field Artillery).
(b) Leader development at the grade of MAJ is designed to prepare officers for command of Field Artillery
battalions and to enhance fires and effects knowledge and skills. MAJs will serve in a variety of positions in a
combination of developmental positions in Field Artillery battalions, brigade combat teams, and at other levels
throughout the Army.
1. Key Field Artillery developmental assignments for MAJs
a. S3, XO: To ensure future potential battalion commanders are given a strong experience base in the operation of a
Field Artillery battalion, key branch leader development includes serving as a S3 or Executive Officer in a Field
Artillery Battalion, Fires Brigade or in a comparable organization - tactical or training command).
b. Fires and Effects Coordinator (ECOORD or BDE FSO): To ensure continued mastery of critical fire support
expertise, majors also need to obtain experience in fires and effects assignments as well. Both Field Artillery
operational experience and critical fire support/operations developmental assignments are important to ensure potential
battalion commanders and future battlefield staff officers remain well versed across the spectrum of Field Artillery
operations and in Fires and Effects synchronization.
2. Key branch developmental assignments for MAJs include:
a. Battalion S3.
b. Brigade S3.
c. Division Artillery S3.
d. Battalion XO.
e. Brigade XO.
f. Division Artillery XO.
g. Brigade Combat Team Fires and Effects Coordinator (ECOORD/FSO). The positions of Brigade Fires and Effects
Coordinator (ECOORD at BCT /SBCT) or Brigade level Fire Support Officer are the premier Fire Support positions in
the Field Artillery. These brigade level positions are among a select few positions providing experience for future Field
Artillery Battalion Commanders in BCTs or for key staff officers or commanders in Fires Brigades (UEx) or at higher
echelon headquarters or commands (UEy/and so forth). Fire support skills are critical for future commanders who may
also be Fires and Effects Coordinators for their brigades or divisions (UEx). A strong performance as a Fires and
Effects Coordinator is a clear indicator of future potential for service as a battalion commander.
3. Other branch developmental assignments for Majors.
a. A competent, capable and knowledgeable Field Artillery officer must have a mix of career developmental
opportunities and experience. Some officers will require in-depth knowledge and expertise gained through repetitive
assignments in specific areas due to the complexities of their assignments and focused mission requirements. Other
officers will require a broader focus in assignments to be able to execute and synchronize efforts across a multitude of
organizations or agencies. In either case, it is clear that there can be no single standard career path for every officer.
Most Field Artillery officers will have a mix of developmental assignments that will be different from their peers.
Some officers may have multiple key developmental assignments (S3/XO/FSO) and some, possibly, may not have the
opportunity. In either case, a hard working and dedicated officer will find career success and make a significant

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

85

contribution to the success of the Field Artillery. Officers must have a diverse and flexible career path in order to
create the skill sets required to maintain a very professional, dynamic and successful branch and officer corps.
b. The need for expeditionary type experiences, to include Joint, interagency, and multinational assignments, is
essential to the experience base and career development of all field grade officers. Although the Field Artillery aspect
of career development for majors is focused on the development of expertise in fires and effects and Field Artillery
operations, it remains critically important to develop officers with a Joint and expeditionary mindset and experience
base as well. Assignments will be offered to either broaden the experience base and perspective of officers in the area
of Joint, interagency, multinational and/or Coalition operations or to develop more in-depth expertise required to ensure
success in specific operations or areas. In either case, these assignments will significantly enhance an officer’s
development as well as providing the Army with more effective subject matter experts. MAJs should seek assignments
and schooling providing unique Joint, interagency, and multinational perspectives and experiences. Joint billet positions, assignments on Joint, interagency and Coalition staffs or in assignments embedded with sister Services all
provide superb experience.
c. There may be limited instances where a MAJ does not have an opportunity for assignment in a key developmental position (S3/XO or BCT fires and effects coordinator). This could happen based on timing, the need for specific
subject matter expertise job availability, command decisions, or for numerous other legitimate reasons. In these
instances, several other branch developmental jobs and experiences will support an officer’s career advancement and
consideration for promotion, as long as the officer’s overall duty performance and his overall demonstrated potential
warrant it. The goal of the Field Artillery is to provide a key developmental assignment opportunity to all qualified
officers; however, selection to these positions will remain somewhat competitive. All MAJs should strive for assignment to at least one key branch developmental assignment. Additional branch developmental assignments for MAJs
(fire support/operations) - UEx assistant fires and effects coordinator - UEy or UEx assistant effects coordinator Operations officer fire and effects coordination cell or effects coordination cell - Operations officer of battlefield
coordination detachment - UEy assistant effects coordinator - UEy effects coordinator - fires brigade assistant S3 - UEy
or UEx Field Artillery Intelligence officer (FAIO) - Assistant ECOORD - specific Joint assignments and other special
assignments currently under review (which include a variety of Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, multinational
and/or Coalition experiences).
4. The goal of Field Artillery Branch is to provide MAJs the opportunity to serve for 24–36 months in key
developmental positions (XO, S3, BCT fires and effects coordinator) and/or branch developmental positions. Commanders are provided wide latitude in tailoring the order of these developmental assignments based on the developmental needs of the officer, the operational needs of the unit, and the availability of developmental jobs versus the number
of officers requiring experience.
5. The particular assignments a MAJ is selected for and his level of success in those assignments sets the conditions
for promotion opportunities to LTC and possible selection to battalion command. Field Artillery battalion commanders
are selected from a DA Command Selection List (CSL) by a board of senior officers. This board selects the bestqualified officers based on performance in tough and challenging assignments that provide the experience necessary for
successful command of a combat arms battalion. The board looks for demonstrated success in a very competitive
selection process.
6. In many cases, the branch developmental experience at the MAJ level does not necessarily equate to battalion
command selection. MAJs and newly promoted LTCs desiring to command a Field Artillery battalion must fight for
the tough jobs and seek additional assignments and experience in line with the type of battalion they desire to
command. Those officers desiring to command Field Artillery battalions in a Brigade Combat Team, for example, must
fully understand how to integrate and synchronize fires in Combined Arms Operations, and also possess a strong
knowledge of Field Artillery tactics and logistics. Assignments as a BCT FSO, Fire Support Observer/Controller at a
CTC, Field Artillery battalion or Fires Brigade S3 and/or XO, are some examples of the developmental experiences
critically important to gain the necessary expertise and leadership acumen to command successfully. The assignments
required for competitive selection as a battalion commander may go beyond those required for normal "branch officer
development". Command selection remains very competitive and the opportunity to command is a privilege, not a
right. However, success in today’s Army does not require selection as a battalion commander. Many consider
promotion to LTC success. In either case, each individual officer determines career success. Raters and senior raters
will discuss career progression, key assignments and professional developments goals that are realistic and obtainable
for all officers. All officers need to define what they consider success and work to meet the goals they establish. The
Field Artillery Branch will assist in supporting the career of any officer that emulates the Army values - there are many
paths to success.
7. Most Field Artillery MAJs will continue to serve in Field Artillery positions at UEx and UEy or in force
generating units (TDA organizations) after completing tactical level developmental assignments at the battalion,
brigade and higher levels. Other typical assignments include—
a. Small Group Leaders (SGL) and Observer/Controller Evaluators (O/CE). Training, mentoring and guiding our
future leaders, our most important asset, is of the utmost importance to the Field Artillery Branch. Our most
experienced and best leaders must become the trainers and mentors of our next generation of officers and soldiers.
Therefore, it is important to highlight the SGL and O/CE assignments considered so critical to the overall success of

86

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

the Field Artillery. The SGL positions are important instructor assignments at Fort Sill (mainly for instruction related to
FACCC) and in several other key billets throughout the Army. The O/CE positions are challenging subject matter
expert (SME) assignments at the Combat Training Centers (NTC, JRTC, CMTC). These superb assignments are
nominative (officer files are reviewed in a competitive selection process). Officers with the right credentials and
experience are nominated and offered this unique challenge that will further improve their technical, tactical and
leadership skills. Therefore, these assignments are considered career enhancing because only the best officers are asked
to fill them. Also, the personal satisfaction of mentoring and developing young leaders provides a very worthwhile and
gratifying experience. The SGLs and O/CEs truly become subject matter experts and their experience and opinions are
shared across the Field Artillery. All officers should seek out these challenging and rewarding assignments.
b. Joint/Interagency/Intergovernmental/Multinational/Coalition/DOD or Army Staff positions.
c. RC support.
d. Echelons above corps (EAC) staff.
e. MACOM staff.
f. Command and General Staff College faculty and staff.
g. Branch/FA generalist positions (such as Inspector General, ROTC instructor or as other faculty and staff).
(c) Some officers are selected for the School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) and will serve as UEx and UEy
planners during some portion of their next assignment.
(d) MAJs should continue self–development and lifelong learning efforts to become an expert in all aspects of fire
support coordination to include Joint and Multinational operations. Self-development should include correspondence
courses, civilian education and institutional training. Officers should also devote time to a professional reading program
to broaden their warfighting perspective.
(e) Current institutional training for MAJs includes completion of the Command and General Staff College Intermediate Level Education. Completing this course is considered essential for branch development and promotion to LTC.
(f) All officers in the Operations career field will have the opportunity to attend ILE.
(g) The ILE is designed to provide common core and operational instruction, and additional tailored education
opportunities tied to the requirements of the officer’s specific career field/branch/FA, based on OPMS guidelines. This
program will produce field grade officers with a Warrior Ethos grounded in warfighting doctrine. It will provide
officers the technical, tactical, leadership competencies and skills to be successful in their career field, branch, or FA.
(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Officers selected for LTC should seek assignments of greater responsibility in the branch and branch/FA
generalist positions.
(b) The objective of LTC assignments is to provide a greater contribution to the branch the Army and to other Joint,
Interagency, or Multinational efforts. Key assignments for LTCs include the following:
1. Command Selection List (CSL) battalion level command.
2. Deputy Fire Support Coordinators, Effects Coordination Cell (ECC) Chiefs, Fires Brigade Deputy Commanders
and Operations Officers, and a variety of other key staff officer positions.
3. Senior fire support OC.
4. BCT S–3/XO
5. UEy /UEx staff.
6. Joint/Interagency/Multinational/Coalition/DOD or Army Staff positions.
7. Service school staff.
8. Active Army/RC training support team chief/commander.
(c) Self-development objectives should continue to build upon warfighting expertise and gaining perspectives on
Joint/Interagency/multinational and Coalition operations.
(d) Institutional training for LTCs includes resident or non–resident Senior Service College education; with attendance dependent on centralized selection.
(5) Colonel.
(a) Field Artillery COLs contribute to the branch by serving in critical assignments to include the following:
1. Colonel level command (e.g., Command of a Fires Brigade, Training Brigade, Battlefield Coordination Detachment or other brigade level commands to include Operational or Generating Force units).
2. Deputy Commanders.
3. Chief of Staff (G3 or other key UEx, UEy, Division, or Center staff position)
4. Fire and Effects Coordinators at UEx/UEy or at other higher echelons.
5. Selected positions in the Field Artillery School (Directors of key departments/directorates).
6. Joint/Interagency/Multinational/Coalition/DOD or other Army Staff key positions.
(b) Institutional training for colonels includes senior post-MEL 1 fellowships.
(6) WO1 and CW2.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

87

(a) After completing Field Artillery–WOBC, warrant officers are normally assigned as a Radar Section Leader
within a target acquisition battery.
(b) Ideally, WO1/CW2s will also experience duty as a targeting officer prior to serving as an assistant counterfire
officer.
(c) While a WO1/CW2, the focus should be on acquiring and refining the technical knowledge and tactical
experience to effectively integrate Field Artillery target acquisition assets into the divisional battlespace. Before
promotion to CW3, warrant officers should possess a strong foundation of Field Artillery skills and an extensive
knowledge in the employment of target acquisition assets, radar maintenance and the targeting process. Completion of
an associate’s degree in a discipline related to MOS 131A is a recommended goal prior to becoming eligible for
promotion to CW3.
(7) Chief warrant officer three.
(a) Field Artillery–WOAC—not later than 1 year after promotion to the grade of CW3, warrant officers will attend
the FA–WOAC. The FA–WOAC has 2 phases. Phase one is a TRADOC common core prerequisite and must be
completed prior to attending the phase II residential course. The residential course consists of 9 weeks of advanced
technical and tactical training in the employment of target acquisition assets and targeting. This training prepares
warrant officers for duty as counterfire officers or as Field Artillery brigade or higher level targeting officers.
(b) Ideally, CW3s will serve as a UEx or Field Artillery Brigade Targeting Officer prior to serving as a UEy
Targeting Officer. Assignment Oriented Training will be focused towards future positions. Completion of a Baccalaureate degree in a discipline related to MOS 131A is a recommended goal prior to becoming eligible for promotion to
CW4.
(c) Select warrant officers in the grade of CW3 can also expect to receive assignments consistent with the needs of
the Army, such as the following:
1. Combat Training Center observer controller/evaluator (OC/E).
2. BCTP Observer Controller
3. Service school instructors.
4. Combat Developers
5. Training/Doctrine Developers
(8) Chief warrant officer 4 (CW4).
(a) Warrant Officer Staff Course. Not later than 1 year after promotion to the grade of CW4, warrant officers will
attend WOSC.
(b) CW4s will serve as Field Artillery Intelligence Officers (FAIO) and targeting officers in positions at UEx, UEy,
and higher echelons or in Generating Force organizations. Select CW4s can also expect to receive assignments
consistent with the needs of the Army, such as, the following:
1. Targeting Officer in the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.
2. Service school instructor.
3. Combat Developer.
4. Training/Doctrine Developer.
5. Test Officer (TEXCOM).
6. Assistant Product Manager
(c) CW4s should continue self-development efforts to enhance expertise in all aspects of target acquisition asset
employment and targeting to include Joint and combined operations utilizing Assignment Oriented Training.
Self–development should include correspondence courses, civilian education and institutional training. CW4s should
devote time to obtaining a graduate level degree.
(9) Chief warrant officer five.
(a) Warrant Officer Senior Staff Course—not later than 1 year after promotion to the grade of CW5, WOs will
attend WOSSC within the FY.
(b) CW5s will serve as targeting officers in positions at UEy and higher echelons or in force generating organizations. Select CW5s can also expect to receive assignments consistent with the needs of the Army, such as, the
following:
1. Senior Service School instructor.
2. U.S. Army Nuclear and Chemical Command instructor and doctrine developer.
3. Chief warrant officer of the Field Artillery/personnel proponent officer.
4. HQDA Systems Integrator.
5. Targeting Officer in the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.
(c) CW5s should continue self–development efforts to enhance expertise in all aspects of targeting to include Joint
and combined operations.
e. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Officers above the grade of LT can expect to serve in branch/FA

88

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

generalist assignments, such as ROTC or USMA faculty and staff that are not directly related to the branch but are
important to the Army.
f. Joint/Interagency/Multinational/Coalition/DOD or Army Staff assignments. Officers can expect consideration for a
variety of duty assignments worldwide. Expeditionary assignments increase an officer’s overall experience and are a
critical requirement for the Army to ensure development and understanding of expeditionary warfighting skills and for
advancement into senior leadership positions. The majority of Joint/Interagency/Multinational/Coalition/DOD or Army
Staff assignments will be in branch/FA generalist jobs or in assignments on Joint staffs or a variety of unified or
coalition type headquarters.
12–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences.
(1) The Field Artillery Branch is diverse enough to allow for numerous career development paths. Officers are
encouraged to seek assignments across the spectrum of systems employed by the Field Artillery (light cannons, heavy
cannons and rockets). Officers should also expect to serve in overseas duty assignments during their career. The
professional development goal of the Field Artillery is to produce and sustain highly qualified tactically and operationally oriented officers with both a breadth and depth of understanding of the branch that clearly have the professional
ability to lead Field Artillery organizations and elements in combat and other assigned missions. Developmental
leadership positions will remain the priority within assignments, but the branch will maintain flexibility on the
sequence of assignments. An officer’s preference is taken into consideration when assignments are made. Assignment
patterns are not tightly constrained to precedence; however, the branch will attempt to assign officers within generally
prescribed sequences to support the Army’s unit focused stabilization initiatives, and to maximize the development and
competency of every Field Artillery officer as much as possible.
(2) Field Artillery WOs should seek assignments across the spectrum of Field Artillery target acquisition systems
and organizations (light, mechanized, armor). The professional development goal is to produce and sustain highly
qualified technically, tactically and operationally oriented warrant officers.
b. Precedence.
(1) LTs should expect initial assignments of approximately 36 months in life cycle or cyclic manned units with a
second follow–on cycle of 36 months in stabilized life cycle installation assignments. LTs assigned to stabilized
installations can expect to attend the CCC at some point during their first 36 months at the assignment. The timing is
based on unit requirements. The officer will likely return to his unit or installation after the Captain Career Course
ready to assume command or continue career development in CPT level assignments. LTs assigned to life cycle or
cyclic manned units can expect to attend the Captain’s Career Course at the commander’s discretion to support the
unit’s life cycle. Officers initially assigned to generating force units (TDA assignments) will normally have a
follow–on assignment to an operating force (tactical) unit.
(2) CPTs will normally not be assigned to positions outside of an operational unit until they have had the
opportunity to obtain branch development goals that may include battery command and Fire Support Officer
experiences.
(3) Assignments for MAJs between operating and generating force assignments (branch/FA generalist, or echelons
above UEy positions) may vary in sequence; however, every MAJ will be afforded the opportunity to obtain
competency through branch developmental assignments.
(4) LTCs and COLs will serve to meet the requirements of the branch, with command positions as the priority.
(5) Junior Field Artillery WOs should be initially assigned for a minimum of 18 to 24 months as a Radar Section
Leader to develop operational and functional skills on Field Artillery target acquisition systems. The WO should
progress through a series of targeting officer jobs to gain experience in the targeting process. Senior Field Artillery
WOs should be assigned to Field Artillery brigades, or at the UEx, UEy or higher echelons in an ascending order if
possible. The intent is to gain experience at the lower echelons prior to moving to a position at the higher echelon.
12–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Field Artillery branch developmental positions. Field Artillery LTs should serve at least 24–36 months in Field
Artillery battalions as part of their branch development. Field Artillery CPTs should serve in branch developmental
positions for at least 24–36 months. The branch developmental goal for CPTs is to have a battery command
opportunity when possible. Normal duration of a battery command is 18 months (+/- 6 months) depending on unit
requirements and cycles. Majors will spend between 24–36 months in Field Artillery units in branch developmental
assignments. The branch developmental goal for majors is to provide an opportunity for majors in a key developmental
assignment when possible. The current HQDA policy of assigning LTCs and COLs to 2–3 year battalion and brigade
commands remains unchanged, although in certain units this time may flex based on Army requirements.
b. Field Artillery officer career developmental life cycle and utilization model. Figure 12–1 displays a Field Artillery
Branch developmental life cycle model displaying key developmental positions for Field Artillery officers that will
provide leadership opportunities and development of branch competency.

12–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for branch officers remaining in the Operations career
field. This requires developing an optimized field grade inventory in order to meet branch authorizations, to provide
sufficient flexibility to support branch/FA generalist positions, and to provide MAJs with a minimum of 2 years of key
branch developmental time.
b. OPMS. Officers wanting more information on branch authorizations or inventory, by grade, are encouraged to
contact the branch proponency office or their HRC assignment officer.
12–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Field Artillery
Branch life cycle function highlights associated with OPMS.
a. Structure. The structure of Field Artillery organizations is transforming to become more agile, lethal and relevant
based on new equipment capabilities and emerging global threats.
b. Acquire. Officers will continue to be accessed through USMA, ROTC, OCS and WOCS. Accessions are based on
officer preference and the needs of the Army. The branch will also remain a recipient of branch detail officers from
other branches.
c. Distribute. Officers will be assigned to stabilized installation assignments under Life Cycle, or cyclic manned
units.
(1) Stabilized Installation assignments. The majority of officers assigned to stabilized installations will be initial
entry from BOLC III. These officers will be initially assigned to an installation for approximately 36 months. During
this time, the officer will complete their platoon leader and LT years. They will then proceed to the CCC and in many
cases will return to the same installation to complete CPT career development and have an opportunity to command at
battery level. The officers will gain tactical and operational experience that will benefit them and the Army in future
positions.
(2) Life cycle units. Officers at all levels may be assigned to life cycle units (generally the Stryker Brigade and
Brigade Combat Teams) for a minimum of 3 years. Branch detailed officers will remain in their detail branch until
after completion of the assignment to a life cycle unit.
(3) Cyclic units. Units not assigned missions in support of BCT and SBCT will most likely be managed on a cyclic
manning system. Replacements will be sent to these units and installations periodically to maintain readiness. Tour
lengths and developmental position opportunities may vary. Branch detailed officers will remain on standard branch
detailed timelines. Officers continue to rotate between assignments to tactical operating force units and to generating
force units (TDA) in CONUS and OCONUS locations. The sequencing and timing of assignments permits officers to
gain the requisite skills to assume roles as senior leaders in the Army. OPMS distribution rules: officers in the
Operations career field will work either in branch or FA positions; majors can expect more branch developmental time
and increased unit stability.
d. Deploy. Field Artillery Branch officers are warriors who must remain personally and professionally prepared to
deploy worldwide at all times. All Field Artillery officers must remain fully deployable to accomplish missions across
the full spectrum of conflict whether assigned to operating force units with high levels of readiness or to a fixed site
generating force unit. The Global War on Terrorism makes it critically important that all Field Artillery officers are
ready, willing, and able to deploy on short notice to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests. This
also includes support to Joint and Multinational Operations such as humanitarian, peacekeeping missions, and Stability
Operations and Support Operations (SOSO). Field Artillery officers must fully prepare themselves and their families
for this important challenge.
e. Sustain. OPMS programs remain effective.
(1) Promotion. career field based promotion boards remain viable. MAJs and above will compete for promotion
within their career field.
(2) Command. LTC and COL level commanders will be listed on the Command Selection List (CSL). With the
exception of Army Acquisition Corps officers, all commanders will be selected from the Operations career field.
(3) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS. CPTs,
LTs, WO1s, and CW2 will no longer have a senior rater block check (ACOM/COM/BCOM) on their OERs. These
same officers will receive counseling from their raters using DA Form 67–9–1a. Current OER early masking remains
in effect.
f. Develop. Officer development will occur through a sequence of progressive assignments in operating force units
and in generating force units. The goal is to professionally develop officers across a broad spectrum of operations that
can expertly employ fire support skills in support of Joint and Combined Arms Operations that validate the doctrine,
training and material development missions of the branch.
g. Separate. The officer separation process remains unchanged.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

12–8. Field Artillery Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. Reserve Component units comprise a large portion of the Field Artillery units in
America’s Army. All tactical Field Artillery units in the RC are in the Army National Guard. The overwhelming
majority of positions in the RC correspond to those positions in the Operations career field under OPMS. Field
Artillery RC officer careers are spent predominantly in tactical units. Reserve Component officers should optimize their
time in developmental fire support and operational Field Artillery positions.
b. Branch developmental opportunities. Reserve Component Field Artillery officers should strive to adhere, as
nearly as possible, to the standards and professional development patterns in individual training, operational assignments, and self–development as their active duty counterparts. Reserve Component officers should build a solid
foundation in leadership, fire support skills, and field artillery unit operations to successfully serve in the branch.
Ideally this occurs through a variety of assignments as fire support officers at all levels, in artillery units, on staffs, and
in support units where Field Artillery expertise is needed. Because of geographical location or other considerations, RC
Field Artillery officers may not have the opportunity to serve in as many Field Artillery and fire support positions as
active duty officers. However, this is offset by longevity in positions that are available in tactical units in their
geographic area.
(1) Reserve Component career development. To meet career development requirements, an RC Field Artillery
officer must have—
(a) Completed at least 60 hours of college credit to receive a commission.
(b) Completed the BOLC III; National Guard officers must complete within 18 months and Army Reserve officers
should complete by the end of the first year of commissioned service, but not later than the third year.
(c) Completed FACCC, either the active or RC course (resident or non-resident). See DA Pam 351–20 for military
education requirements and constructive credit application procedures. Officer Basic Course and/or BOLC II graduates
of other branches transferring to the Field Artillery are encouraged to attend a pre–course or take advantage of home
station training prior to enrolling in the Field Artillery CCC.
(d) Successfully commanded a battery level unit for 24 months (plus or minus 12 months) or served as one or more
of the following for 24 months (plus or minus 12 months): battalion fire support officer, battalion fire control/direction
officer or assistant operations officer at battalion or brigade/division artillery. Ideally, an officer will serve in a position
through at least 2 annual training periods.
(2) Reserve Component field grade officer standards.
(a) Reserve Component major. MAJs must have completed 50 percent of CGSC to be competitive for promotion to
LTC. To be best qualified, MAJs should seek key developmental duty positions as battalion executive officer,
operations officer, brigade fire support officer, assistant fires and effects coordinator at various levels (division, UEx,
UEy, BCD, and so forth), or as assistant brigade level operations officer. Optimally, MAJs should spend 24 to 36
months in one of these positions.
(b) Reserve Component lieutenant colonel. LTCs must have completed 100 percent of CGSC to be competitive for
promotion to COL. To be best qualified, LTCs should seek duty positions as battalion commanders, as various fires
and effects coordinators at the LTC level, and as brigade level executive officers or operations officers. Optimally,
LTCs should spend 24 to 36 months in one of these positions.
(c) Reserve Component colonel. COLs serve as brigade level commanders, commanders of battlefield coordination
detachments and in a variety of important staff positions to include the deputy assistant commandant at the Field
Artillery School and in a variety of branch/FA generalist positions at brigade level and above, or staff positions at state
or national level.
(d) Reserve Component selection board. LTCs and COLs are selected for Senior Service College by aN RC
selection board.
(3) Battalion or brigade command. To be ready for Field Artillery battalion or brigade command, RC officers must
meet the appropriate educational requirements for the grade and position. Attendance at the Field Artillery Precommand Course is also recommended prior to assumption of command.
(4) Continuing development. Officers desiring consideration for key positions in RC artillery units should aggressively pursue positions that develop essential war fighting leader skills. Officers should continue self-development
efforts to become an expert in all aspects of fire support coordination to include Joint and multinational operations.
Self–development should include correspondence courses, civilian education and institutional training. Officers should
devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their warfighting perspective.
(5) Branch transfers. Reserve Component Field Artillery officers may have to branch transfer during the course of
their careers due to lack of positions in their geographic area. When an officer transfers into Field Artillery, completion
of either the OBC or the CCC and minimum time in a key position is required before branch qualification is complete.
Commanders will consider the officer’s experience level in recommending which qualification course is required.
Commanders should closely manage branch transfer officers and assign them to a qualifying position concurrent with
enrollment in the OBC or the CCC or after completion of the course. Officers should not normally be assigned to a
qualifying position prior to enrolling in or completing OBC or the CCC.

Air Defense Artillery Branch
13–1. Unique features of Air Defense Artillery Branch.
a. Unique purpose of Air Defense Artillery. Patriot and Maneuver Air and Missile Defense (MAMD) organizations
provide the Army with an organic capability to defend against a wide array of hostile aerial and missile threats while
ensuring a modular and expeditionary air defense force to meet future Army requirements. Combat–proven Air Defense
Artillery (ADA) weapon platforms (shooters) and early warning systems (sensors) provide the Army with a technologically-advanced, fully-digitized capability that enables air defenders to detect and engage air and missile threats much
earlier, at greater distances, and with increased lethality. Although ADA organizations are primarily designed to
support maneuver unit operations in all environments, new designs are currently in the works to better support the
Army transformation. They are also ideally suited for, and frequently support, Joint, interagency, intergovernmental,
and multinational organizations. Employment of ADA forces achieves a strategic, operational and/or a tactical advantage on the battlefield. In concert with the Army, ADA organizations will rapidly transform to remain "Relevant and
Ready". In addition to changes to ADA force structure and how we fight (battle command), the introduction of ADA
cells embedded in modular maneuver units, and the establishment of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD)
Brigade, not only provides growth, but adds challenging assignment opportunities. For example, national missile
defense and space operations are more closely aligned with ADA related functions. New (shooters) such as MEADS,
SLAMRAAM, THAAD and EEADS will likely enter the Army inventory in the near future as well as a host of early
warning/detection devices including JLENS, MEADS Sensors, Multi-Mission, Forward Based X- Band Radar
Transportable (FBXT) and THAAD Radars.
b. Unique functions performed by Air Defense Artillery today. Air Defense Artillery unit missions vary based on
system capabilities—
(1) Bradley Linebackers and Avengers are currently assigned to divisional maneuver elements and below to provide
a gun/missile capability to support combat operations. Integration with infantry, armor, artillery, aviation and logistics
elements are critical to success on the battlefield. The Linebacker will be phased-out of the active Army inventory in
the near future.
(2) Sentinel Radars and FAAD C4I digital communications architecture provide early warning, detection and
identification of enemy aircraft, helicopters, Un-manned Aerial Vehicles/Remotely Piloted Vehicles (UAV/RPV), and
cruise missiles.
(3) Patriot units are designed to defeat a wide variety of air and missile threats. Normally found at Corps and
Echelon Above Corps (EAC), Patriot units are highly sought after to counter the growing Tactical Ballistic Missile
(TBM) threat. Patriot units can, and frequently operate along Joint and multinational lines.
c. The Way Ahead. As the Army transforms, units formerly known as brigades, divisions, and corps will develop
into modular "Plug and Play" organizations. The new war fighting elements are referred to as Stryker Brigade Combat
Teams (SBCT), Brigade Combat Team (BCT) and Units of Action (UA), and Units of Employment (UEx)/ (UEy). In
synchronization with the Army’s transformation, robust Air Defense Artillery cells will form at each of these
organizations to coordinate and plan for the introduction of Air Defense forces onto the battlefield. Targeting, airspace
command and control, and early warning are common functions performed by officers assigned to these cells. MAMD
forces are generally referred to as composite ADA battalions consisting of Patriot, Avenger and Sentinel systems.
These systems are generally assigned to Corps units and are tasked as required to Army modular organizations. As
mentioned in the opening paragraph, future plans include the introduction of a host of new missile systems (shooters)
and early warning systems (sensors). The intent is to make future air defense systems more lethal, mobile, tailor-able
and deployable. Improvements in interoperability with Joint and coalition/multinational forces are continuous and will
serve the Army well in all expeditionary endeavors. In summary, the Army’s move forward on transformation has
expanded the role of air defenders on the battlefield and has led the way for increased participation in the planning and
execution of air defense operations in Army, Joint and coalition/multinational operations.
d. Unique features of work in Air Defense Artillery. The descriptions below provide a general overview of the nature
of work specific to ADA and warrant officers based on organizational design. The term ADA officer refers to both
commissioned and warrant officers assigned 14/140 series career field designators. Although the nature of some work
is similar at the lower grades, not all assignment functions/requirements are interchangeable. Specific career path
information is provided throughout the document—
(1) Assignments in Patriot and MAMD (MTOE) units provide opportunities to command, control and direct ADA
organizations at detachment, platoon, battery, battalion, and brigade. Staff assignments are also characteristic of MTOE
assignments. These skills are essential to professional development and expansion of experience in logistics (S4),
operations (S3) maintenance (BMO), intelligence (S2) and personnel (S1).

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

97

(2) Assignments in TDA organizations provide similar opportunities as stated above, but lend themselves more to
hands-on equipment training and platform instruction for new recruits and officers.
(3) Assignments to modular (MTOE) units (SBCT, BCT, UA, and UEx, UEy) provide opportunities for officers to
serve as staff planners and coordinators for a wide variety of missions at multiple-echelons. By design, these
organizations can/will operate along Joint lines and are expeditionary in nature. Additional schooling is provided by the
U.S. Army Air Defense Artillery School (USAADASCH) to prepare ADA officers to serve in these critical
assignments.
e. Air Defense Artillery officer tasks. The information below provides a broad outline of an ADA officer’s mission
essential task list:
(1) Serve as soldiers first and maintain the Warrior Ethos.
(2) Integrate (plan and employ) ADA forces into Army or JIM organizations to defeat 3–D threats.
(3) Understand and plan Army Airspace Command and Control (A2C2) and targeting as part of an Army or JIM
team.
(4) Provide early warning of air and missile threats to all Army and/or JIM forces.
(5) Serve as ADA advisors to U.S., allied, and coalition forces.
f. ADA assignment opportunities other than MTOE.
(1) Develop, review and evaluate doctrine and training for all ADA organizations.
(2) Train and develop ADA skills at Combat Training Centers (CTCs).
(3) Serve in positions requiring specific/general technical/tactical skills such as staff officers in organizations and
activities requiring ADA expertise (includes Joint and Army Staff).
(4) Serve as instructors at pre-commissioning programs and service schools.
(5) Serve as ADA advisors to Army National Guard (ARNG) and Reserve (USAR) component organizations.
13–2. Characteristics required of Air Defense Artillery officers
a. Competencies and actions common to Air Defense Artillery officers. The ADA officers are—
(1) Premier war fighters and maintain the Warrior Ethos at all times.
(2) Joint and expeditionary minded.
(3) Worldwide deployable, motivated, disciplined, and physically fit.
(4) Grounded in Army core values.
(5) Intellectually capable of understanding and operating the Army’s most technical and sophisticated digitized
equipment.
(6) Guided by the 4 dimensions of leadership: values, attributes, skills, and actions (for additional discussion of
these leadership dimensions, see FM 3–7, Army Leadership). Leaders who consistently display competencies that
enable them to adapt to today’s contemporary operating environment (COE) (peacetime, disaster relief, contingency
operations and war).
b. Unique attributes. All officers must be physically and mentally fit, maintain and display self–control, remain calm
under pressure and adhere to published standards and regulations.
c. Unique skills. Competence—
(1) Tactical and technical. The ADA officers must be technically and tactically proficient on a wide variety of
mission–unique equipment and systems. In the most generic sense, ADA officers must be capable of employing
systems in a tactical environment, training soldiers and units to perform their wartime mission, and developing plans as
part of a combined arms team. Repetitive operational assignments and lifelong learning are necessary to maintain the
professional knowledge, judgment and war fighting expertise to accomplish all tasks and functions required during
ADA operations.
(2) Conceptual. The ADA officers must possess the ability to perform critical/creative thinking and moral reasoning
while clearly communicating information across a wide spectrum of operations.
d. Unique actions. Leadership—
(1) Decisionmaking. The ADA officers must be capable of rapidly assessing complex situations and making split
second decisions while operating under stress and in austere field conditions. Sound judgment, logical reasoning and
wise use of resources are critical to mission success.
(2) Planning and executing. The ADA officers must be capable of conducting ADA operations with Army, Joint and
coalition/multinational forces. The ability to meet mission standards, take care of people and resources, develop
detailed and executable plans that are feasible, acceptable and suitable are necessary skills for ADA officers.
13–3. Critical Active Army Air Defense Artillery officer developmental assignments
a. Officer qualification and development.
(1) Lieutenant.
(a) After completing the ADA Basic Officer Leadership Course (BOLC), Phase III (proponent institutional training),
officers are assigned to platoon leader positions in either a Patriot or MAMD organization. As platoon leaders, officers

98

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

will gain invaluable experience and training which will be the "cornerstone" of their career development. Additional
developmental duty positions for seasoned platoon leaders include battery Tactical Control Officer (TCO), executive
officer (XO), battalion staff officer and liaison officer (LNO).
(b) The focus of effort during the LT years is to acquire, reinforce and hone troop leading, technical, tactical,
logistics, and administrative skills. Inculcation of the Warrior Ethos and Army core values is essential in the
development of young officers. Prior to promotion to CPT, officers must possess an in-depth knowledge of ADA and
combined arms operations gained through experience in MTOE warfighting units. By law, officers must obtain a
baccalaureate degree before promotion to CPT. Professional reading and lifelong learning begins at the grade of LT.
(2) Captain.
(a) Officers generally attend the CCC at their 4th year of service which currently corresponds with promotion to
CPT. Given the skills and experience, select ADA Officers may be afforded the opportunity to attend the resident
phase of another combat arms branch CCC or the United States Marine Corps Expeditionary Warfare School. These
schools are extremely competitive and provide increased benefits to the Army and the officer.
(b) CPTs must aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience that will prepare them for duties at the
grade of MAJ. The following are considered key developmental assignments for ADA CPTs:
1. ADAM Cell SBCT, AMD Cell BCT (UA), or Division/UE ADA Officer
2. ADA Battery Command (exceptions may include command of another combat arms battery/company)
(c) HHB Commander of an active component ADA organization
(d) Completion of the CCC and 12 months in one of the above positions prepares the officer for success as MAJ.
The optimal timeline will provide an 18–36 month experience. Officers who serve in Army modular units will not be
prejudiced as a result of not having commanded at the battery level. Battery Command is not required for promotion to
MAJ. Some CPTs may be assigned to either branch specific or immaterial assignments allowing them to develop a
wider perspective of the Army or other services. The following are examples of branch specific/immaterial assignments
for CPTs:
1. CTC Observer/Controller (O/C)
2. Small group instructor (SGI)
3. Ground-based Mid-course Defense (GMD) brigade staff officer
4. Tactical director (TD) at battalion or brigade.
5. Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC)/Army Space (ARSPACE) staff.
6. Branch/FA generalist positions (for example, AMD doctrine or combat developer in the DCD, DOTD–LD, or
ATEC (see para (e), below).
7. Army/MACOM staff.
8. USAREC staff/command positions.
9. Active Army/RC staff.
10. Functional area positions.
11. Advanced Civil Schooling (based on FA or Army requirements).
12. ROTC Instructor, USMA Instructor, USMA TAC Officer.
13. Foreign Service Exchange Officer or Foreign Service School Exchange Officer.
(e) Developmental assignments, both branch–specific and immaterial will provide ADA CPTs with exposure to the
Army, and in some cases, Joint organizations. CPTs must master troop leading skills and fully understand operations at
battery, battalion and brigade level. At this stage in career development, ADA CPTs must recognize how the Army
functions and fights. For example, how a recruit enters the training base and is inculcated with Army Values or how
training and certification programs are developed and what organizations are responsible for that training.
(f) Officers are eligible for FA designation between their 5th and 6th years of service. The formal designation of
FAs is based on the needs of the Army, officer preference, military experience, and civilian schooling. Several FAs
provide advanced civil schooling, which may be granted upon selection to the FA (subject to change). The Army
Acquisition Corps will assess a limited number of ADA officers between the 7th and 8th year of service.
(3) Major.
(a) Upon selection to MAJ, an HQDA level board will convene to determine what career field designation is best
suited for each officer. The board considers officer skills and experience, preference and Army requirements. ADA
MAJs not designated to the Operations career field will be nominated to serve in one of the other 3 career fields:
Operational Support, Information Operations, or Institutional Support. Selection into a career field other than operations
means that the officer will no longer be managed by ADA branch. Officers retained in the Operations career field will
attend the resident ILE course. Upon completion of ILE ADA MAJs must aggressively prepare for and seek the skills
and experience that will prepare them for duties as an LTC. The following are considered key developmental
assignments for ADA MAJs:
1. ADAM Cell Officer in SBCT, AMD Cell Officer in BCT(UA), UEx, UEy
2. Battalion/brigade S3 or XO of an Active Army ADA organization (the only exceptions are battalion or brigade
S3/XO of another combat arms unit).

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

99

(b) Completion of ILE and a minimum of 12 months in one of the above positions provide the foundation to serve
at LTC. The optimal timeline provides officers with the opportunity to serve in one of the above listed positions for at
least 18–36 months. Officers who serve in Army modular units will not be prejudiced as a result of not having served
as an XO/S3. ADA Battalion and Brigade S3/XO assignments are not required for promotion to LTC. Some ADA
MAJs may be assigned to either branch specific or immaterial assignments allowing them to develop a wider
perspective of the Army or other Services.
(c) The following are examples of branch specific/immaterial assignments for MAJs:
1. CTC senior observer/controller/evaluator.
2. U.S. Army Air Defense Artillery School (USAADASCH)/CGSC/ILE faculty and staff,
3. Brigade/division/Corps staff.
4. GMD Brigade/ARSPACE/SMDC staff.
5. Department of Defense/Joint/Army/MACOM staff.
6. Battle Command Training Program.
7. Service school instructor.
8. RC support.
9. Other branch/FA generalist positions.
10. Inspector General.
11. ROTC Instructor, USMA Instructor.
12. DCD, DOTD–LD, ATEC, TRADOC Futures, Army Staff G–8 (FDE) and HRC positions.
(d) MAJs must exercise continuous self–development to fully master all aspects of ADA operations including Joint
and multinational operations. Self–development may include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training. Officers must devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their war fighting perspective.
(e) As stated earlier, skills and experience will drive an officer’s career path and future assignments.
(4) Lieutenant colonel. Officers selected for LTC must seek assignments of greater responsibility in the branch and
branch/FA generalist positions. The objective in LTC assignments is to give ADA officers the opportunity to make a
greater contribution to the branch and the Army. Key developmental assignments for LTCs include the following:
(a) Command Selection List (CSL) battalion–level command.
(b) UEx/UEy ADA officer.
(c) Brigade deputy commander/XO.
(d) Corps Air Defense Element (CADE) OIC.
(e) GMD Brigade fire direction center (FDC) director— (new position within SMDC’s GMD brigade).

C4I systems; Patriot and THAAD Tactical Control Station (TCS) with the automated Battery Command Post (BCP);
Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control System (AMDPCS); SBCTs ADAM Cells; UAs; and Theater Missile
Warning Detachment(TMWD) (formerly JTAGS). They act as instructors for soldiers and officers, teaching the
necessary tasks of employing assets and adapting the software that best supports Army ADA C2 doctrine. They analyze
and interpret data employed in the communications architecture for a Joint theater to support immature or sustained
operations with the C2 assets on hand and could act as the sector interface control officer (SICO). When necessary,
they can serve as the detachment commander for the TWMD. Completion of at least an associate’s degree is strongly
recommended prior to promotion board eligibility to CW3. They should also complete the Multi–Tactical Digital
Information Link (TADIL) Joint Interoperability Course and Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS)
Course. If assigned to the SBCT ADAM Cell, in addition to the courses listed above, they should attend the Joint
Firepower course, the Link-16 Planners course, and the Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) Course. All CW2s must
complete the prerequisite first phase of ST–7000, Action Officer Development Course, and the first phase of the
support operations courses through distance/distributive learning prior to attending the ADA WOAC.
(b) CW3. Military occupational specialty 140A CW3s will attend and successfully complete ADA WOAC not later
than one year after promotion to CW3. They should also attend both the Force Integration and JICO Courses.
Recommend completion of these courses prior to promotion eligibility to CW4. Military occupational specialty 140A
CW3s are assigned to Air Defense brigades; ARSPACE company/battalion/brigade HQs; AAMDC; USAADASCH;
and can serve as the Army track data coordinators for the regional area air defense coordinator; and the regional
interface control officer (RICO). Daily duties include configuration management for the AMDPCS (including ancillary
equipment). These CW3 advise and coordinate the activities of enhanced operators for the maintenance of Commercial
off the Shelf (COTS) and Common Hardware Systems (CHS) (including ancillary equipment). These warrant officers
also estimate repair priorities based on fix or fight criteria and availability of required assets, as well as, provides
advice to the commander on system employment option capabilities for Army ADA C2 systems involved with a BCT,
UEx, or UEy. These CWOs also serve as data-link managers providing prioritization and standing operating procedures
(SOPs) for Joint interoperability. CW3s should complete directed self–development studies and prerequisite distance/
distributive learning modules prior to promotion and prior to attendance of the warrant officer senior course at the 12–
to 14–year mark. Completion of a baccalaureate degree is highly recommended prior to promotion board eligibility.
(c) CW4. Military occupational specialty 140A CW4s will attend and successfully complete the WOSC not later
than 1 year after promotion to CW4, and should also complete the Joint course on logistics. MOS 140A CW4s are
usually assigned to THAAD battalions, USAADASCH, Joint commands, Army/MACOM staffs, USARSPACE, or
Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) positions. These CW4s can serve as Army JICOs for the area air
defense coordinator or in other nominative positions Army–wide, with duties as instructors or career managers. The
CW4 should complete directed self–development studies prior to attendance to the WOSSC at the 17– to 20–year
mark. At this juncture, CW4s should begin, continue, or complete graduate level studies.
(d) CW5. Military occupational specialty 140A CW5s will attend and successfully complete the WOSSC not later
than one year after promotion to CW5, and should as well complete the Joint Officers Course. Usual assignments for
MOS 140A CW5s are to USAADASCH as chief warrant officer of the branch (CWOB), AAMDCs, or in nominative
positions Army–wide. These CW5s provide leadership to the branch and act as a subject matter expert on all matters
pertaining to air defense warrant officers. Recommend continuation/completion of a graduate degree.
(2) MOS 140E, Air and Missile Defense Systems Tactician/Technician. (ADA warrant officer life cycle development
and utilization model (Active Army) for Active Army warrants is at fig 13–3 and the ADA warrant officer life cycle
development and utilization model (RC) for RC warrants is at fig 13–4.)
(a) WO1 and CW2 MOS 140E. A WO is technically certified in MOS 140E upon successful completion of the
Patriot System WOBC. Warrant officers converting from other MOS/branches must successfully complete WOBC
prior to the awarding of the 140E MOS. These MOS 140E WOs are normally assigned to battery level positions such
as systems maintenance officers and TCOs, evolving into the continuity for tactical control operations training at the
unit level. They are also the senior maintenance trainers that plan, organize, implement, monitor, evaluate, and
supervise operations and unit maintenance of air defense weapons systems including TAMMS and PLL. An assignment
to these positions allows the warrant officers to gain leadership experience, and enhance their technical and tactical
competence. All CW2s must complete the prerequisite first phase of ST–7000 (Action Officer Development Course),
and the first phase of the Support Operations Courses through distance/distributive learning prior to attending the ADA
WOAC at the seven- to eight- year marks. Individual proponents administer their own WOAC. Completion of at least
an associate’s degree is highly recommended prior to promotion board eligibility for CW3.
(b) CW3. Military occupational specialty 140E CW3s will attend and successfully complete the ADA WOAC not

promotion eligibility and before attendance to WOSC at the 13 to 14-year mark. Completion of a baccalaureate degree
is highly recommended prior to promotion board eligibility for CW4.
(c) CW4. Military occupational specialty 140E CW4s will attend and successfully complete the WOSC not later
than one year after promotion to CW4. Usual assignments for MOS 140E CW4s are to brigade support operations
sections or FDC, as well as, within USAADASCH as an instructor/directorate action officer or as a career manager at
the USA HRC. These WOs provide leadership, guidance, technical input, and direction to subordinate elements, staff
agencies, and field commanders up to and including theater level. The CW4 should complete directed self-development
studies and prerequisite distance/distributive learning modules prior to promotion eligibility to CW5 and before
attendance to the WOSSC at the 17- to 20-year mark. At this juncture, CW4s should begin, continue, or complete
graduate level studies.
(d) CW5. Military occupational specialty 140E CW5s will attend and successfully complete the WOSSC not later
than one year after promotion to CW5. Usual assignments for MOS 140E CW5s are to air defense brigades,
USAADASCH as chief warrant officer of the branch (CWOB), DCD, DOTD–LD, or OCADA, AAMDCs, SMDC,
ARSPACE, Joint HQs, other MACOMs, and serving as directorate action officers or in other nominative positions
Army–wide. These CW5s provide leadership experience to the branch and are the subject matter expert on all matters
pertaining to air defense warrant officers. Recommend continuation/completion of a graduate degree.
c. Functional area and immaterial generalist assignments. These assignments normally apply to the grades of CPT
through COL and are offered to those who possess the skills and experience necessary to successfully enhance the
Army’s mission. Branch immaterial positions are available on a limited basis and are filled in accordance with Army
priorities. Assignments to organizations such as ROTC, USMA, and USAREC can provide extremely challenging and
rewarding work for those who desire service outside of the branch.
d. Joint assignments. Field grade officers are the target audience for service in Joint assignments. All officers must
fully understand how to operate in the Joint environment and seek experiences that will enhance learning. Since ADA
officers frequently work along Joint lines, migration to TMD/Joint command assignments is natural. Attendance to
sister service schools is highly encouraged and provides invaluable training for ADA officers. Although highly
competitive, ADA CPTs can apply for selection to the Joint intern program. The Joint experience at an early stage in
an officer’s career will yield long–term positive benefits.
e. Nominative assignments. ADA officers may be selected for assignments outside of branch specific duties based
on needs of the Army. These assignments encompass a wide variety of service and can be characterized as positions
requiring highly responsible mature, exceptionally skilled and well-grounded officers. Generally, these positions are
filled by handpicked officers and may require an extensive interview process. These positions include, but are not
limited to special fellowships, senior level aide and executive officer positions and highly visible staff positions
requiring officers with specific skills.
13–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. Air Defense Artillery Branch provides diverse assignment opportunities that allow for numerous
career developmental paths. The professional development goal for the branch is to produce and sustain highly
qualified tactically and operationally oriented officers to lead ADA forces in combat and accomplish a host of other
mission essential related tasks.
b. Precedence. Although there is flexibility on the sequence of assignments, most will occur in a logical sequence.
Training and education assignments are highly sought after to assist in ADA officer knowledge base.
(1) Typically, ADA officers pursuing the Operations Track for the purpose of troop leading throughout their career
may seek assignments provided in the following guideline: Platoon leader/TCO/battery XO, CCC, battalion staff (S–1/
S–4, or assistant S–3), battery command, ADADO, ADAM Cell OIC/TD battalion or brigade, ADA C2 Ops Officer/
BCT (UA)/UE air defense staff officer, normative assignment, Division/Corps staff, ILE, battalion/brigade XO or S–3,
ADADO, ADAM Cell OIC/UE staff officer, DOD/Joint/Army/MACOM staff or branch/FA generalist assignments,
brigade XO/S–3, Corps Air Defense Officer, Joint/Army/MACOM staff, LTC-level command, SSC, Joint/Army/
MACOM staff, brigade level command.
(2) Typically, ADA officers pursuing a career focused on Joint and space opportunities may seek assignments
provided in the following guidelines: Platoon leader/battery XO, CCC, Battalion staff (S–1/S–4, or assistant S–3),
Battery command, Advanced Civil Schooling, Space and Missile Defense Command positions, FDE, Internships, JCS
Internships, ADAM Cell OIC/TD Bn or Bde, ADA C2 Ops Officer/BCT (UA)/UE air defense staff officer, Training,
Doctrine and Combat Development Staff Officers, ILE, AAMDC Staff, GMD Brigade or 1st Space Brigade Operations
Chief/XO, JTAMDO, GAMDF Planner, DOD/Joint/Army/MACOM staff, Multinational or CSC Staff positions, Joint
TMD officer for a MACOM (JFCOM, CENTCOM, NORTHCOM, PACOM, EUCOM).
(3) Typically, ADA officers aspiring to serve in ADA staff assignments, such as force development, may seek
assignment provided in the following guidelines. To gain the skill set required to serve as the proponent’s Director for
Combat Developments (DCD) upon completion of company grade key developmental assignments, officers may be
assigned to one of the following organizations: DCD, DOTD- LD, or the Army Test and Evaluation Command
(ATEC). These assignments provide the basic foundation (skills and experience) required for future service at DCD.

102

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

Additional service as a FA 49 (ORSA) or FA 59 (Strategic Plans) strengthens the officer’s skill sets. Assignments with
DCD, TRADOC futures or Force Development (FDE) following key developmental assignments will further groom
officers for service as the DCD. The same logic applies to assignments to battalion command and service as a LTC in
the UEx.

13–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Key Air Defense Artillery positions. Air Defense Artillery CPTs serve as battery commanders and ADAM/AMD
Cell Officers based on branch policy. The policy regarding the duration of battery command and key developmental
assignments such as an ADAM Cell Officer in an SBCT or AMD Cell Officer in a UA is 12 months, but optimally,
18–36 months. Air Defense Artillery MAJs serve as battalion or brigade S3/XOs or as an ADAM/AMD Cell Officers
in an UA or UE. The policy regarding the duration of S3/XO and ADAM/AMD Cell Officers in an UA or UE, is a
minimum of 12 months, but optimally, 18 - 36 months. The current policy of assigning LTCs and COLs to 2 years in
battalion and brigade commands remains unchanged. Garrison commands are 3 years, but may be reduced by 1 year if
the documentation is forwarded and approved.
b. Air Defense Artillery Branch life cycle. Figure 13–1 displays the ADA life cycle with key developmental
positions. Additionally, it identified other branch developmental jobs for officers.

13–6. Key Active Army officer life cycle initiatives
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for ADA branch officers remaining in the Operations
career field. This requires optimizing the company and field grade inventory in order to meet branch authorizations,
provide sufficient flexibility to support branch/FA generalist positions and to provide optimal time in key developmental assignments while stabilizing the force.
b. Transformation. Army Transformation has led to an increase in Air Defense Authorizations at every grade plate
(CPT–COL) with the exception of LT. For more information contact ADA Branch, HRC.
c. Troop leadership. Typically, ADA officers pursuing the Operations Track for the purpose of "Troop Leading"
throughout their career may seek assignments provided in the following guideline: Platoon leader/battery XO, CCC,
Battalion staff (S–1/S–4, or assistant S–3), Battery command, ADADO, ADAM/AMD Cell OIC/ADA C2 Ops Officer

13–7. Key Active Army officer life cycle initiatives
The following section provides branch life cycle function and highlights changes associated with implementing Force
Stabilization Initiatives and Transformation.
a. Structure. Inactivation of select Divisional ADA Battalions has forced changes in the manner in which ADA will
fight and support maneuver elements. At the BCT, SBCT and Division, ADA will man robust ADA Cells better known
as "ADAM Cells" in SBCTs and AMD Cells in BCTs and UAs to plan and support maneuver unit operations.
Although ADA Divisional Battalions will no longer remain in the division structure, ADA Composite Battalions will
form at Corps and ADA Brigade organizations. The Army’s push for modularity will drive the future structure of
ADA. In addition, growth in the branch will occur with the introduction of multiple AAMDCs, RC to Active Army
conversion and the establishment of the GMD. Warrant officers will be provided new opportunities to serve in tactical
controller positions normally held by LTs and as tactical directors, positions normally held by CPTs. This is not a shift
in responsibilities, LT and CPT will continue in these positions also. This will enable LTs to focus on honing/
developing troop leading skills while adding continuity and experience to the TCO and TD positions.
b. Acquisition. Officers will continue to be accessed through USMA, ROTC, and the Officer Candidate School.
Warrants will continue to be recruited from the Noncommissioned Officer Corps. Both officer and WO accessions are
based on preference, qualifications and needs of the Army. The branch will also remain a recipient of branch detailed
officers from other combat support/combat service support branches.
c. Officer distribution. Officers will be provided assignment opportunities to develop the skills and experience base
necessary for service at the next higher grade. The sequencing and timing of assignments is driven by Army priorities.
The Global War on Terrorism and Army Transformation are currently the driving forces behind the distribution of
officers. Force Stabilization will also continue to influence officer distribution.
d. Deployment. The ADA officers are war fighters who must remain personally and professionally prepared to
deploy worldwide—at all times. Whether assigned to war fighter centric units or training organizations, readiness is
imperative to success of the mission. ADA officers must prepare themselves and their families for planned and no
notice deployments. In today’s fast–paced and uncertain operating environment, families must be ready for multiple
deployments of unknown duration.
e. Sustainment. OPMS:
(1) Promotion. Skills and experience, duty performance, and adherence to branch requirements are all factors that
influence promotion. Promotion rates will be determined by Army needs/DOPMA goals.
(2) Command. Commands at battalion and brigade level are organized into 4 functional categories: tactical, training,
and strategic support, institutional and TSM (brigade only). Officers do have the option to compete for selection to the
desired command category and can decline others without prejudice. Officers who are selected for command have
options to decline without prejudice 30 days after the publication of board results. Since the Command Select List
(CSL) process continues to change, officers should contact ADA branch to receive the latest information. The results of
the command selection process are announced in the CSL. (Note: This subparagraph is not applicable to WOs.)
(3) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the link between officer development and OPMS. At CPT the
immediate rater together and the senior rater will make a recommendation concerning the officer’s career field. The
warrant evaluation report remains unchanged.
(4) Development. Officer development will occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in
tactical, training and staff assignments. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly perform ADA METL

108

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

related function during Joint and combined arms operations. These tasks include, but are not limited to development
and validation of doctrine, training, and equipment.
(5) Separation. The officer separation process remains unchanged. The most current separation information can be
found on the HRC Web site at https://www.perscomonline.army.mil/tagd/retire/retire.htm.
13–8. Reserve Component air and missile defense officers and warrant officers
a. General career development. The RC career development model for ADA will essentially mirror that of Active
Army officers/WOs, except that assignments will not be limited to one component or control group within a
component. Figure 13–2 (Officers) and 13–4 (Warrant Officers) delineates the mandatory timeline for promotion to the
next higher grade. In certain cases, an RC officer can be promoted to the next higher grade after meeting minimum
time and grade requirements. The ADA officer should count on being dual branched in order to facilitate career
progression. In addition, an ADA officer will most likely be required to branch transfer to another basic branch due to
limited geographical and upward mobility positions; however, these officers should remain proficient.
b. Role. RC ADA officers/WOs serve in most of the same roles and missions as their AC counterparts. The unique
nature of the RC soldier’s role as a citizen–soldier poses a challenge for professional development; however, RC
officers/WOs are expected to follow AC development patterns as closely as possible. RC officers/WOs have increased
windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. To meet professional development objectives, RC officers/
WOs must be willing to rotate between ARNG and USAR Troop Program Units, Individual Ready Reserves, the
Individual Mobilization Augmentee Program, and other AC and RC programs. Geographical considerations necessitate
these transfers, as well as, the need to provide as many officers/warrants as possible the opportunity to serve with
troops in leadership and staff positions. Additionally, there may be occasions when RC officers/WOs will be transferred to the Individual Ready Reserves while they complete mandatory education requirements. Such transfers will be
temporary and should not be seen as impacting negatively on the officer/WO’s career. The success of an RC officer/
WO is not measured by the length of service in any one component or control group, but by the officers/WOs breadth
of experience, duty performance, and adherence to branch requirements. (Note: Figures 13–1, 13–2, 13–3 and 13–4
illustrate the typical AC and RC officer and WO career model from accession to separation.)
c. Warrant officer assignments. Warrants, as the branch technical experts, are considered certified upon successful
completion of the WOBC, and remain so throughout their WO career (140X Specialty Code denotes a position that can
be filled by either a 140A or 140E, currently only approved for GMD positions).
d. Reserve Component officer qualification and development. (Career development model is at fig 13–2.)
(1) Lieutenant (years 1 to 6). Reserve Component officers must complete a minimum of 90 hours of college/
university credits to receive a commission. ADA OBC or the future BOLC is the starting point for newly accessed RC
ADA officers. RC ADA officers should complete the resident initial leadership instruction by the 18th month for
ARNG officers (the second year for USAR officers), or prior to the end of the third year for Officer Candidate School
graduates (OCS) and direct appointees. Officers should seek to serve in more than one unit position during this phase
allowing for maximum exposure to the diversified functions within an ADA unit. Typical ADA LT assignments
include TCO, platoon leader, battery XO, battery maintenance officer, and battalion staff officer. Officers are encouraged to actively participate in professional reading programs, continue correspondence studies, and must earn a
baccalaureate degree from an accredited college/university to qualify for promotion to CPT.
(2) Captain (years 7 to 13). Air Defense Artillery officers must complete the resident CCC and CAS3 in the Active
Army or RC curriculum. The RC CCC includes non–resident instruction and one Active Duty for Training phase at
USAADASCH. During this phase, all officers are highly encouraged to pursue a specialty related undergraduate or
graduate degree. Reserve Component ADA officers should aggressively seek opportunities to command an ADA
battery for a minimum tour of 2 years (optimally, 3 years). Reserve Component ADA command opportunities are only
available in ARNG units. Typical assignments for CPTs include battery command; The Army School System (TASS)/
Regional Training Institute (RTI) tactical officer; battalion, brigade, division, STARC, or USAR Regional Support
Command (RSC) staff officer; battalion LNO; CTC OC; and, FA billets. Officers may select an FA designation
between the 7th and 10th year of service. The designation of FAs should be based upon the needs of the Army,
geographical considerations and officer preference. Functional area assignments are useful for by passing temporary
roadblocks to career progression in the ADA branch due to geographical constraints or position availability. However,
RC ADA officers should endeavor to return to an ADA assignment as soon as practicable. A limited number of
qualified officers will be accessed into the Army Acquisition Corps.
(3) Major (years 14 to 21). During this phase, officers should enroll in, complete CGSC or ILE (50 percent
completion required for promotion to LTC), and pursue a specialty related graduate degree. ADA officers should seek
further development in ADA assignments during this phase. Branch standard assignments include (but are not limited
to) battalion/brigade/division continental U.S Army (CONUSA) staff officer, battalion/brigade XO/S–3, ADAM Cell
OIC, ADADO, CTC OC, TASS/RTI battalion tactical officers, and ROTC instructor duty.
(4) Lieutenant colonel (years 21 to 26). During this phase, officers should seek professional military education at the
senior service college (SSC) level. Officers may seek assignment to senior command and staff positions. Additionally,
many assignments in both HQDA and Joint staffs are available in the Individual Mobilization Augmentee Program for
RC officers. LTCs with 3 years time in grade must complete CGSC or ILE to qualify for assignment to any principal
DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

109

staff position at brigade or higher levels of command. If transferring from another branch and designated to command
at the battalion level, RC officers must have attended a transition course and pre-command course under the auspices
of USAADASCH. (Note: Exceptional officers selected to command an ADA battalion (minimum 2 year, optimum 3
years tour) may also be selected for resident SSC or the Army War College Distance/Distributive Education Course.)
Branch standard assignments include (but are not limited to) battalion commander, TASS/RTI commanders, brigade
XO; brigade XO/S–3/operations officer, division staff officer; and CONUSA/Joint/HQDA level staff assignment. RC
ADA command opportunities are only available in ARNG units.
(5) Colonel (years 26 to 30). Assignments during this phase should provide for maximum utilization skills in ADA
or FA. Assignment standards include RTI/garrison commander, brigade deputy commander, division/corps staff officer,
and training support/combat division chiefs of staff. Senior staff assignments include (but are not limited to) positions
at HQs National Guard Bureau (NGB), Army Reserve Command (USARC), and on CONUSA/Joint/HQDA staffs. If
transferring from another branch and designated to a COL-level command, officers must have attended a transition
course and pre-command course under the auspices of USAADASCH. (Note: Exceptional officers selected to command an ADA brigade (minimum 2 years, optimum 3 years) may also be selected for resident SSC or the Army War
College Distance/Distributive Education Course.)

Chapter 14
Aviation Branch
14–1. Unique features of Aviation Branch
a. Unique purpose of Aviation Branch. Army Aviation is a Combat Arms Branch that operates at theater and below
echelons throughout the entire spectrum of conflict. The Mission of the Aviation Branch is to find, fix, and destroy the
enemy through fire and maneuver, and to provide combat support and combat service support in coordinated operations
as an integral member of the combined arms team. Aviation Officers lead missions characterized as combat, combat
support, and combat service support, with assignments to Attack, Cavalry, Air Assault, Special Operations, General
Support, Air Traffic Services, Maintenance, and Military Intelligence units. As military professionals, each aviation
officer must be tactically and technically proficient in the doctrinal and organizational foundations of the Aviation
Branch, as well as the other combat arms, in order to effectively plan, execute, command and control aviation forces as
a key member of the combined arms team.
b. The Way Ahead.
(1) Previous philosophies encouraged officers to secure the “right” jobs in order to achieve branch qualification
instead of attaining quality experience in each job. Every officer should focus to apply the Warrior Ethos to every job
and every facet of their development. Success does not depend on the number or type of positions held, but rather on
the skills attained and the quality of duty performance in every assignment. Previously accepted standards regarding
personnel management and branch qualification no longer apply. The officer’s breadth and depth of experience are the
metrics that accurately reflect an officer’s potential for promotion and opportunity to serve in positions of increasing
responsibility. In summary, officers should concentrate their efforts in attaining and honing a skill-set by holding key
developmental positions.
(2) Force Stabilization manning practices and policies are the cornerstone of a modular Future Force with a Joint
expeditionary mindset. The Force Stabilization approach to manning will provide increased levels of readiness and

112

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

combat effectiveness for Army units by implementing several personnel turbulence- reducing manning methods. It will
reduce moves therefore, providing predictability for soldiers and their families. It provides the basis for synchronizing
the soldier’s Life cycle to the unit’s operational cycle. The Force Stabilization process will be based on 2 primary
manning strategies: Unit Focused Stability (including life cycle and cyclic methods) and Stabilization (includes
individual replacement system).
(a) Unit focused stability. The UFS consists of 2 stabilization methods; life cycle and cyclic. Because of Aviation’s
unique combat support mission, only cyclic management will apply. The overall goal is to stabilize soldiers and their
families while maintaining unit readiness and cohesion.
(b) Cyclic management. Cyclic management is focused on headquarter elements above brigade level and low
density/high impact units where continuity of operations is paramount. The goal of cyclic management is to synchronize the soldier’s assignment to the operational cycle of the unit. This will result in an increase in unit readiness while
enhancing cohesion but retain flexibility in personnel management. Cyclic management consists of 2 phases, a sustain
phase and a ready phase. During the 1–2 month duration of the sustain phase, leader and soldier assignments are
organized into personnel replacement packages synchronized to arrive within this short phase. The ready phase begins
at the end of one sustain phase and continues approximately 10 months to the beginning of the subsequent sustain
phase. New personnel are rapidly integrated into the team as this integration only occurs once per cycle. Total cycle
optimum length is 12 months.
(c) Stabilization. Soldiers and families are stabilized for as long as possible, moving them to support requirements
based upon needs of the Army, leader development, and soldier preference. Junior officers initially assigned to a
CONUS installation are stabilized at their first installation for an extended period of time allowing for branch
development to the rank of CPT. This initial extended tour may include hardship tours or attendance at leader
development schools (TDY or PCS), but in each case the officer will return to their stabilization installation.
c. Unique features of work in Army Aviation. Aviation officers employ aviation and ground units in support of land,
sea, Joint, and coalition operations. Aviation officers fight in all conditions of weather and terrain, anywhere in the
world. They learn how to employ aviation through a rigorous series of schools and assignments. They must know the
doctrine and organization of aviation and other combat and combat support arms to effectively serve as part of the
Joint combined arms team.
d. Aviation officer tasks. The most unique feature of Aviation officers is the fact that they are all aviators and must
develop technical proficiency in their aviator skills. They must first master the weapons platform before they master the
organization. It is in the Army’s best interest to retain these officers in operational flying positions as long as possible
to gain experience and competency in technical and tactical skills. For this reason, Congress changed the Aviation
Career Incentive Act (ACIA) in 1989 to require that aviators serve their initial utilization tours in Aviation career
fields.
(1) Aviation Branch officer.
(a) Areas of concentration.
1. Aviation, General (15A). This code identifies positions for Aviation LTs who have not yet completed the CCC.
This AOC identifies aviation officers from accession through the BOLC, the Initial Entry Rotary Wing (IERW) Course,
up through graduation of CCC.
2. Aviation, Combined Arms Operations (15B). Officers in this area of concentration are graduates of a branch CCC.
They lead sections and platoons, command companies, battalions and brigades, and serve as staff officers in battalion
and higher echelon units. As staff officers, they plan, direct and control aviation units in concert with other members of
the combined arms team. Aviation Combined Arms Operations officers lead, command, serve as staff officers and
perform critical functions in generating force (TDA) units. The 15B officers also direct and control training, safety,
administration, communication, and force protection activities of aviation units.
3. Aviation, All–Source Intelligence (15C/35). All–Source Intelligence Aviators should be qualified both as Aviation
and Military Intelligence officers. Branch Code 35 (Military Intelligence) is assigned to Aviation officers upon
successful completion of the Military Intelligence CCC. Officers who did not attend the BOLC phase II must attend the
MI Officer Transition Course (MIOTC) before attendance at the Military Intelligence CCC. The designation of 15/35
constitutes a dual branching. These aviators are encouraged to alternate between Aviation and Military Intelligence
assignments. Officers in this area of concentration typically lead platoons and command companies within Aerial
Exploitation Battalions (AEB) engaged in the employment of Special Equipment Mission Aircraft (SEMA) in support
of tactical and strategic intelligence information collection. Officers that serve in AEBs must have successfully
completed the Fixed Wing Multi-Engine Qualification Course (FWMEQC) and SEMA course to attain the appropriate
SI (RC–12 Aircraft) for the unit of assignment or completed EO/RC–7 Aircraft Qualification Course. These officers
also serve as staff officers in battalion or higher echelon units. They serve as S–2s who plan, direct and control SEMA
units to accomplish assigned intelligence and electronic warfare missions. All-Source Intelligence officers oversee the
total intelligence cycle and intelligence and electronic warfare operations for the division, corps and echelons above
corps intelligence requirements. These officers also direct and control the training, safety, administration, communication, supply, maintenance, transportation and force protection activities of SEMA units. All-Source Intelligence
Aviators gain critical experience by performing any of a wide variety of critical and high-risk duties at each grade for a

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

113

total of at least 18 months (plus or minus 6 months). In addition to leading platoons, commanding companies and
battalions, employing Special Electronic Mission Aircraft (SEMA) in support of tactical, operational and strategic
intelligence missions, these aviators can perform duties as Staff Officers in aviation units as well as have the ability to
be assigned in any 35D position.
4. Aviation Logistics (15D). The area of concentration 15D is being processed for deletion (see para 14–3c(1)(c)).
(b) Skill identifiers. Skill identifiers (SI) help to further refine the assignment process by designation of aircraft
qualification or other specialty skill. When combined with an area of concentration, they become career management
fields (CMFs), which personnel managers use in the assignment process (see DA Pam 611–21, table 4–1 for a
complete list of identifiers).
(c) Other Aviation participation programs. Aviation officers may participate in the following voluntary programs, if
qualified:
1. Army Special Operations Aviation, ARSOA.
2. Army Astronaut Program (contact Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC–IC–T)).
3. Degree completion program (see AR 621–1, chap 5).
4. The Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP), also known as School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS)
(apply during ILE attendance).
5. Advanced Civil Schooling (ACS) (see AR 621–1, chap 3).
6. USMA Instructor Program (see AR 621–1, chap 3).
7. Training With Industry provides officers the opportunity to train with selected civilian companies to gain
knowledge of industrial procedures, policies and technologies (see AR 621–1, chap 6).
8. Experimental Test Pilot Training Program is an intense 11–month course at the Naval Test Pilot School, Patuxent
River, MD. Branch commissioned officers will transfer to the Army Acquisition Corps for the remainder of their
career. Applicants must be active component rated aviators in the grade of CPT and have an academic background that
includes the completion of college math and hard-science courses with above average grades (contact DA HRC
(AHRC–OPE–V)).
(2) Aviation warrant officer. The AWOs are managed by military occupation skill not AOC.
(a) Aviation Maintenance officers (151A) manage personnel, equipment, and facilities during the test, modification,
repair, inspection, and maintenance of Army aircraft and related systems, and facility assets to maintain and repair
Army rotary and fixed wing aircraft. Organizes maintenance elements to inspect service, test, disassemble, repair,
reassemble, adjust, replace parts, and retest aircraft or aircraft components. Prepares, implements, and maintains
standing operating procedures for management of maintenance activities. Interprets regulations, technical manuals, and
orders pertaining to maintenance of Army aircraft for commanders and subordinates. Supervises aviation equipment
maintenance and repair shop, section, or platoon. Directs maintenance and accountability of organizational test
equipment, supplies, and recovery equipment.
(b) Scout/Attack Helicopter Aviators (152B: OH–58A/C Scout Pilot, 152C: AH/OH–6 Special Operations Pilot,
152D: OH–58D Scout Pilot, 152F: AH–64A Pilot, or 152H: AH- 64D Pilot) plan, coordinate, brief, command, control,
and execute cavalry missions and attack helicopter missions. Functions as a direct combat participant with organic
armament systems while piloting and commanding scout and attack helicopters under tactical and non-tactical conditions. Operates aircraft during all types of meteorological conditions during day and night as a participant in anti-armor
operations, reconnaissance missions, security missions, and combat maneuver operations. Responsible for coordinating,
conducting, and directing combat scout/attack helicopter operations, Joint air attack team operations and indirect fire
missions. These officers must maintain aircrew training manual (ATM) requirements in appropriate aircraft.
(c) Assault/Utility Helicopter Aviators (153A: Rotary Wing Aviator, 153B: UH–1 Pilot, 153D: UH–60 Pilot or 153E
MH–60 Special Operations Pilot) plan, coordinate, brief, command, control, and execute assault, combat support, and
combat service support helicopter missions. Functions as a direct combat participant with organic armament systems
while piloting and commanding utility helicopters under tactical and non-tactical conditions. Performs military aircraft
operation in support of peacetime training, disaster relief and combat, combat support and combat service support
missions, while operating in all types of meteorological conditions during day and night. These officers must maintain
aircrew training manual (ATM) requirements in appropriate aircraft.
(d) Cargo/Medium Lift Helicopter Aviators (154C: CH–47D Pilot or 154E: Special Operations Pilot) plan, coordinate, brief, command, control, and execute assault, combat support, and combat service support helicopter missions.
Functions as a direct combat participant with organic armament systems while piloting and commanding cargo
helicopters under tactical and non-tactical conditions. Performs military aircraft operation in support of peacetime
training, disaster relief and combat, combat support and combat service support missions, while operating in all types
of meteorological conditions during day and night. These officers must maintain aircrew training manual (ATM)
requirements in appropriate aircraft.
(e) Fixed Wing Aviators (155A: Fixed Wing Pilot, 155E: C–12 Pilot, 155F: Jet Pilot or 155G: RC–7 Pilot) plan,
coordinate, brief, command, control, and execute tactical surveillance, combat service support, and administrative
transport missions. Pilots and commands fixed-wing aircraft under tactical and non-tactical conditions. Responsible for
transporting passengers, mail or cargo for military purposes while operating aircraft during all types of meteorological

114

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

conditions during day and night. When appropriately equipped, performs military intelligence and aerial radio relay
missions. These officers must maintain aircrew training manual (ATM) requirements in appropriate aircraft.
(3) Women in Army Aviation. All Aviation AOCs and most Aviation skills are open to women. Female aviators have
career opportunities equal to those of their male counterparts except for positions with a direct combat probability code
(DCPC) of 1. This restricts females from the following skill identifiers: K4, MH–6 General Special Operations
Aviation (SOA); K5, MH–6OK Pilot (SOA); and K6, MH–47E Pilot (SOA). This restriction is based on the mission
profile of these aircraft. Women aviators accessed into Aviation Branch before 28 April 1993 are not required to
transition into scout/attack aircraft but may volunteer to compete for scout/attack aircraft transition training and
assignments in attack units. Women accessed into Aviation Branch after 28 April 1993 are considered eligible to fill
aviation training and assignment needs. This includes scout/attack aircraft transition training and assignment to attack
units.
14–2. Characteristics required of Aviation officers
a. Unique attributes. The Warrior Ethos must be at the heart of every Army soldier. It is the Warrior Ethos that
transforms an aviator into an Air Warrior. Aviation officers must be proactive leaders who do not hesitate to tackle any
challenge and get into the fight. The Warrior Ethos embodies personal courage, commitment to duty, and loyalty to
unit. Army Values also form the very identity of the Army. They are non–negotiable and apply to every aviator at all
times in all situations. The seven values that guide all leaders and the rest of the Army are Loyalty, Duty, Respect,
Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage. Leaders must believe in them, model them in personal
actions, and teach others to accept them. Officers require a demonstrated mastery of branch, FA, or MOS–specific
skills, and grounding in these seven values to successfully lead soldiers in the 21st Century.
b. Unique skills. Army aviators are immersed in an increasingly complex battlefield environment. The network–centric C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) environment demands intellectually agile leaders, who can see, comprehend, make accurate decisions and
clearly communicate their intent while flying 120 knots toward the objective at tree–top level.
c. Unique actions. As defined by FM 22–100, "Leadership is influencing people— by providing purpose, direction,
and motivation— while operating to accomplish the mission and improving the organization. Leadership is crucially
important in Aviation organizations. Due to the small size of Aviation units and considerable lethality of its weapons
systems, poor leadership can quickly result in catastrophic loss of life and equipment. The Aviation leader must
provide positive leadership daily. Aviation Branch wants men and women who consider themselves a leader, and are
excited to continuously learn and hone their leadership skills.
14–3. Aviation Branch Active Army officer
a. Officer qualification and development. (Career development model is at fig 14–1). The 3 domains of leader
development—Professional Military Education (institutional training), operational assignments, and self–development—define and engage a continuous cycle of education, training, selection, experience, assessment, feedback,
reinforcement, and evaluation.
(1) Professional military education. The institutional Army (schools and training centers) is the foundation for
lifelong learning.
(2) Operational assignments. Upon completion of most institutional training, leaders are ideally assigned to operational assignments. This operational experience provides them the opportunity to use, hone and build on what they
learned through the formal education process. Experience gained through on-the-job training in a variety of challenging
assignments and additional duties prepares officers to lead and train Soldiers, both in garrison and ultimately in
combat. The officer’s breadth and depth of experience are the metrics that accurately reflect an officers potential for
promotion and opportunity to serve in positions of increasing responsibility.
(3) Self-development. Leaders must commit to a lifetime of professional and personal growth to stay at the cutting
edge of their profession. Every officer is responsible for his or her own self–development.

b. Lieutenant. LTs must meet the requirements outlined in AR 611–110 for entry into the Aviation Branch.
(1) Professional military education. All newly commissioned Aviation LTs attend BOLC III and IERW training at
the U.S. Army Aviation Center (USAAVNC), Fort Rucker, Alabama. Training is conducted in 3 phases. Phase I is the
aviation specific phase of BOLC. Phase II is Initial Entry Rotary Wing training, conducted under the Flight School
XXI model. Phase III is the completion of BOLC, which combines the student’s recently acquired skills with company
level tactics and combined arms training. Phases I and III include training on general military subjects such as
leadership, weapons, combined arms operations, physical training and fieldcraft training. Students will also complete
Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) and Dunker Training during phase I. IERW, or flight school,
consists of aeromedical factors, basic flight, aerodynamics, meteorology, instrument flight and combat skills training.
Training is conducted from the preflight through the primary and instrument qualification phases in the TH–67 aircraft.
Basic combat skills are then trained in an advanced aircraft, such as the AH–64D Longbow Apache, UH–60L
Blackhawk and CH–47D Chinook. When an officer completes all phases of BOLC and flight training, they are
awarded the Basic Army Aviator Badge. Due to the time intensive initial training requirements of Flight School XXI,
follow-on schooling enroute to their next assignment (e.g. Airborne, Air Assault, Ranger, Cavalry Leaders Course) will
only be approved by exception due to the compressed career timeline.
(2) Operational assignments. Junior officers initially assigned to a CONUS installation will be stabilized at their
first installation for an extended period of time that allows for branch advancement to the rank of Captain. This initial
extended tour may include hardship tours or attendance at leader development schools (TDY or PCS) but in each case
the officer should return to their stabilization installation (see para 1–9). LTs should serve at the platoon and company
level to gain troop leading and flight experience. The officer will concentrate on planning and executing the tactics,
techniques and procedures specific to their weapons platform and unit mission. The single most important assignment
consideration for personnel managers and commanders is ensuring that the new LT is assigned to a job which will
allow the officer adequate opportunity to develop flight experience and troop leading skills. LTs should serve 18–24
months in a platoon leader position. Due to the length of flight school, this may overlap into the officer’s 1st year as a
CPT. Promotions will not automatically alter positions. The promotion of a LT to CPT while still serving in an
operational assignment such as platoon leader will not be a negative consideration when determining the officer’s
future potential for promotion. The overall goal is for an officer to gain as much flight and leadership experience as
possible prior to moving to another operational assignment.
(3) Self–development. All officers should be afforded every opportunity to achieve a total of 500 flight hours and
qualification as a pilot in command prior to attendance at the Aviation CCC or CCC equivalent. An LT’s focus should
be to refine troop leading, aviator, tactical, logistic (maintenance and supply), force protection (risk management) and
administrative skills. The key milestone in a LT’s development should be attaining pilot in command status. In doing
so, LTs will acquire much needed technical and tactical experience, which will serve them well in future assignments.
For instance, company commanders are expected to set the example for other pilots within their company. Being a pilot
in command allows that commander to be in–the–fight and to direct critical assets where needed. LTs should also
strive to obtain key training experiences that enhance normal garrison training, to include— Combat Training Center
(CTC) rotations, Joint and combined exercise deployments, and worldwide contingency operations. To successfully
compete for promotion to CPT, an officer must possess a thorough knowledge of aviation tactics and principles and
have obtained a baccalaureate degree.
c. Captain. A CPT must successfully complete a branch CCC.
(1) Professional Military Education.
(a) Captains Career Course. CPTs must earn a baccalaureate degree prior to attending the CCC. Additionally, in
accordance with Vice Chief of Staff Army guidance, officers should have flown at least 500 hours and earned pilot in
command status for their particular airframe before they are allowed to attend a CCC. Officers will attend a branch
CCC between their 5th and 8th year of commissioned service. Aviation officers may attend other branch’s CCC. The
branch phase of the Aviation CCC is 18 weeks. It prepares officers to serve as combined arms experts, company
commanders, battalion/brigade staff officers, and Brigade Aviation Element (BAE) officers assigned and organic to the
ground Brigade Combat Team (BCT). Aviation CCC meets established prerequisites for Total Operational Flying Duty
Credit (TOFDC) assignments. Aviators earn 1 month of TOFDC for each month spent at Aviation CCC. Aviators
attending another branch CCC do not earn TOFDC.
(b) Military Intelligence Captains Career Course. Officers selected for area of concentration 15C/35 (all–source
Intelligence officer) attend the Military Intelligence Officer Transition Course (MIOTC) if they did not attend Military
Intelligence BOLC. Area of concentration 15C officers attend the 20–week Military Intelligence CCC and receive
training as a 35 (all–source Intelligence officer). They attend the FWMEQC before or after the Military Intelligence
CCC with appropriate follow–on aircraft specific training. Officers who do not attend the FWMEQC will be designated
as 15B35.
(c) Aviation maintenance. With a battalion and or brigade commander’s approval, officers may request attendance at
the Maintenance Manager Course (MMC). They can also request to continue their military education by attending the

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

117

Maintenance Test Pilot (MTP) course. Aviation Maintenance Officers will serve in Aviation Support Battalions (ASB)
and work as Battalion and Brigade S4/logistics officers, as well as command Aviation Support Companies (ASC) and
Aviation Intermediate Maintenance (AVIM) Companies. Additional opportunities exist for selected personnel at U.S.
Army Materiel Command (AMC) depots and in Aviation Classification and Repair Activity Depots (AVCRADs). An
Aviation maintenance officer can serve as a commander or staff officer at battalion or higher–level units, to include
Army Depots, Corps Support Groups, MACOM logistics offices, the Army Staff (ARSTAF) and Joint Staffs. As staff
officers, they must plan and direct aviation logistics operations in situations ranging from low to high intensity
conflicts. Aviation Maintenance Officers manage the maintenance, removal, installation, modification, overhaul and
repair of aircraft equipment systems and subsystems. These subsystems range from engines to airframes, instruments,
rotor systems, powertrain, armament, avionics, electrical and fuel systems. These officers develop procedures for
aircraft maintenance, and also direct the issuance and disposal of aircraft, the requisitioning, receipt, inspection,
storage, distribution and disposal of aircraft supplies, repair parts and equipment. They must understand both air and
ground logistics systems in order to be effective. Aviation Maintenance officers are excellent candidates for the
Experimental Test Pilot Training Program.
(2) Operational assignments. CPTs are utilized as the senior leader at the company level. Their primary goal is to
successfully command a TOE/TDA company/detachment unit for 18–24 months. CPTs can hold platoon leader
positions in units authorized CPTs as platoon leaders. These units include Aviation Intermediate level Maintenance
(AVIM) and ARSOA units. CPTs also fill key staff positions at the battalion and brigade level, in addition to positions
within the Brigade Aviation Element (BAE), UEx staffs, CTC/OC positions and SGI/Instructor positions at the
Proponent and USMA. Even when assigned to staff positions, CPTs should continue to hone their direct leadership
skills, build flight experience, and achieve/maintain pilot in command status.
(3) Self–development. CPTs should gain an in–depth understanding of aviation brigade operations, combined arms
operations, aircraft maintenance and Army Airspace Command and Control (A2C2). Aviation CPTs should dedicate
time to a professional reading program to gain a historical perspective on solutions to tactical and leader challenges.
CPTs should strive for the same qualitative leadership building experiences as during their LT years: Combat Training
Center rotations; Joint and combined exercises, and deployment on real–world contingency operations. Performing the
challenges at the CPT/commander level will greatly enhance the officer’s tactical and technical skills, as well as build
critical flight experience. CPTs should strive to meet the requirements for award of the Senior Aviator Badge by the
time they are promoted to MAJ. CPTs should broaden their understanding of warfighting through extension courses
and independent study. Commanders should maintain healthy officer professional development programs within their
units.
(a) Aviation CPTs can request to attend the Joint Air–Ground Operations School (AGOS) at Hurlbert Field, FL, or
the Cavalry Leaders Course at Fort Knox, KY. If attendance at AGOS is desired, the 3–week Joint Air Tasking Order
Process Course (JATOPS) is recommended for officers who are required to understand and apply airspace command
and control and the application of the Air Tasking Order. The 2–week Joint Firepower Control Course (JFCC) at Nellis
AFB, NV, is more suited to an understanding of the application of Joint fire support systems.
(b) Officers may receive Advanced Civil Schooling (ACS) if necessary for an FA or special assignment (for
example, Army Acquisition Corps, Foreign Area Officer or USMA instructor).
(4) Functional area designation. Aviation officers will have the option of serving in an FA between their 5th and
10th years of commissioned service, but will continue to serve primarily in Aviation Branch or branch/FA generalist
assignments (for example, ROTC, recruiting command, USMA faculty and staff, Active Army/RC, etc) through their
10th year of service. At which time, a FA designation will be applied to those individuals who requested a FA
assignment and who meet the established criteria. Starting with Cohort Year Group 1999, officers will no longer go
before a FAD Board or be designated a secondary career field. FA proponents will have an opportunity to canvas the
entire year group in order to identify, recruit, select and assess officers who meet their criteria and possess the required
skills and experience to serve an FA assignment. Officers may submit 3 FA preferences. Submissions allow officers to
inform HRC of the FAs which they are interested in working in. This information will be used by the FA proponents
for recruiting purposes, allowing both the FA and the officer greater flexibility by not restricting them to the results of
the FAD Board. Aviation Officers are encouraged to remain in Aviation however, if they do elect to serve in an FA
they should select one that is directly tied to Aviation. Examples are: FA 51 Army Acquisition Corps, FA 40 Space
Operations or FA 57 Simulation Operations. Aviation Officers may no longer request FA 90 (Multifunctional Logistician Program).
(5) Career field designation. At the 10th year of service, immediately following the Majors promotion board, a
career field Designation (CFD) Board will select some officers for management by a career field other than the
Operations career field (OPCF). CFD should not be confused with FAD. There are 4 career fields: Operations career
field (OPCF); Operational Support career field (OSCF); Information Operations career field (IOCF); and Institutional
Support career field. Aviation officers are highly encouraged to request a CFD that relates directly to aviation, such as
OPCF. In doing so, officers will continue to build on their aviation experiences and acquire key developmental
positions. Officers are required to submit their preferences in conjunction with the Majors promotion board. If an
officer requests to serve in an FA that they have not served in before, then that officer must demonstrate they have
sufficient knowledge and experience for that FA. The CFD board considers officer preferences, OER comments and

118

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

unique abilities, and balances them against Army requirements. Army requirements are the primary drivers in the
process. It is not guaranteed that an officer who is awarded a FA designation be awarded the corresponding CFD for
that FA. An aviator migrating out of the OPCF will serve in their new career field for the remainder of their career.
Migration out of OPCF (with the exception of FA 51, Acquisition) will result in termination of Aviation Incentive Pay,
as these officers will no longer be managed or assigned against aviation operational assignments. If accessed into a
career field other than OPCF, aviators will find their opportunity for operational flying assignments severely curtailed
or prohibited. Therefore, repetitive operational flying assignments through the grade of O3 are critical in order to make
their first ACIP gate. If an aviator has not met their first ACIP gate, they will lose ACIP beyond the 12th year of
aviation service. HQDA waivers are possible for this situation, but highly unlikely for those aviators who CFD out of
OPCF 15 or OSCF 51 (Army Acquisition Corps). Aviators who remain in OPCF will continue to serve in operational
aviation assignments. See additional sections in this pamphlet and AR 611–110 for a complete description of each FA
and associated skills.
(6) Army Acquisition Corps. At the 8th year of service select officers are accessed into the AAC by a HQDA
selection board. Aviators accessed into AAC do not compete for Aviation battalion or brigade commands. Instead, they
compete for LTC and COL level product, project and program manager positions. Officers accessed into the AAC are
re–designated with a new FA (FA 51). Accession into FA 51 is based on the same criteria as mentioned above (officer
preference, Army needs, training and background, and officer skills). Again, Aviation Branch will only assess enough
aviators into the AAC to meet Army Aviation Acquisition requirements.
(7) Army Special Operations Aviation. Officers who are interested in joining the Army Special Operations Aviation
(ARSOA), 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), should begin early in their LT years to accumulate as
much flight experience as possible. ARSOA recruiters focus their recruiting efforts on experienced CPTs with solid
leadership and flight experience. Interested CPTs should pursue company command as soon as possible following the
CCC.
d. Major. MAJs will complete the ILE course, a sister–service institution (Navy, Marine, or Air Force), the Joint
Army Warfighting School (JAWS) or Schools in Other Nations (SON) before they enter the primary zone of
consideration for promotion to LTC.
(1) Professional military education. Following ILE, some officers are selected to attend the School of Advanced
Military Studies (SAMS). Those officers selected for the SAMS must serve an initial utilization tour as a plans/
assistant G3 officer on Corps or Division staffs.
(2) Operational assignments. MAJs should serve in one of the following assignments for 18–24 months: Brigade
Aviation Element Officer (BAE), Battalion Staff (Active Army/RC and active duty) or Major level command of a
TOE/TDA aviation unit (such as in AVIM and ARSOA units). Individuals selected and assigned as a BAE officer will
serve in positions organic to the Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), as the aviation subject matter expert for the BCT
Commander. They will provide the critical linkage with the BCT’s supporting Aviation Brigade to facilitate the most
efficient tactical employment of aviation assets in the BCT’s maneuver battlespace. While working in the BAE, the
aviation MAJ will be rated by the BCT XO and senior rated by the BCT Commander. Serving in a similar position at a
higher level also satisfies this intent. Aviation majors serve in TOE and TDA units and other assignments to include
but not limited to: Observer Controller/ Evaluator (OC/E) at a Combat Training Center, RC advisor, USAREC staff,
USMA faculty and staff, service school instructors, ARSTAF, Joint staff, UEx staffs, and branch/FA generalist
positions. MAJs should seek key developmental assignments that assist them in promotion and create the qualities of a
fully multifunctional, expeditionary officer, either in the Aviation Branch or in a FA. MAJs should seek a field grade
Joint duty assignment once tactical and technical experiences have been attained.
(3) Self–development. MAJs should focus self–developmental efforts on acquiring expertise in organizational leadership techniques, operations at Corps level and above, and aviation logistical support operations. Their self–development
must focus on Joint and combined arms operations. This can be accomplished through correspondence courses or
institutional training. MAJs should devote time to a professional reading program. Officers may attend Advanced Civil
Schooling (ACS) if the follow–on assignment requires an advanced degree. Many Advanced Degree Programs are also
available in order for officers to obtain a graduate degree. Aviation majors will likely serve in operational flying
positions after being away from the cockpit for some time due to schooling and required staff positions. Therefore,
their self-development should also be focused on refreshing themselves with new aviation technologies in the cockpit.
They should set the example for the younger generation of officers by continuing to place a strong emphasis on their
technical and tactical aviation proficiency. Aviation majors in OPCF BR15 should strive to attain the Master Aviator
Badge by the time they are promoted to LTC.
e. Lieutenant colonel. LTCs should serve in an Aviation coded position for 12–24 months.
(1) Professional military education. No specific military education requirements exist for LTCs. A HQDA board
determines selection for resident SSC or the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course. Officers selected for
CSL battalion command will attend the Army’s Pre-Command Course (PCC) at Fort Leavenworth, KS, and the
Aviation PCC at Fort Rucker, AL. Select TDA battalion command designees may also be slated for attendance at the
TRADOC PCC at Fort Jackson, SC. Battalion command designees who have special courts martial convening authority
will attend the Senior Officers Legal Orientation Course (SOLO) at Charlottesville, VA. A master’s degree is strongly
recommended, but is not required for promotion.
DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

119

(2) Operational assignments. LTCs who successfully complete a CSL battalion level command may remain competitive for brigade command and enjoy a higher potential for promotion to COL and SSC selection. Under OPMS, only
officers in the OPCF will be eligible to command. Commands filled by OPCF officers on the CSL are organized into 4
functional categories: Tactical, Training and Strategic Support, Institutional (garrison and USAREC), and deputy
TRADOC System Managers (TSMs). Officers have the option of selecting the category or categories in which they
desire to compete for command, while declining competition in other categories. The following assignments are not
necessarily coded as Aviation, however they are considered key developmental assignments: LTC positions at the
Combat Training Centers (CTC), brigade/regiment/group XO, division primary staff, corps assistant G3/G4, deputy
assistant G3/G4, G3 operations, G3 assistant plans officer, ROTC or recruiting duty, MACOM staff, ARSTAF, Joint
staffs, UEx staffs and selected Active Army/RC assignments. Performance in demanding assignments is a prime
consideration for promotion and school selection boards. LTCs should also seek a Joint duty assignment. A field grade
Joint duty assignment is required for promotion to BG.
(3) Self–development. Officers should continue to build warfighting, Joint, expeditionary, and FA expertise.
f. Colonel. COLs should serve 12–18 months in Aviation assignment coded at the grade of COL.
(1) Professional military education. Although no specific mandatory military education requirement exists for
colonels, the primary professional development goal is completion of SSC. Resident or non–resident attendance at a
Senior Service College (SSC) also identifies those officers with exceptional promotion potential for service in positions
of increased responsibility. A HQDA board determines who attends the resident course and participates in the U.S.
Army War College Distance Education Course. Officers selected for CSL brigade command will attend the Army’s
Pre–Command Course (PCC) at Fort Leavenworth, KS; and the Aviation PCC at Fort Rucker, AL. Brigade command
selectees may also attend the Senior Officers Legal Orientation Course (SOLO) at Charlottesville, VA. Officers
selected as CSL TRADOC System Managers (TSM) will attend the Combat Developers Course at Fort Lee, VA and
the Project Manager’s ACAT III Course (commonly known as the PM’s Survival Course) at Fort Belvoir, VA. The
ACAT III Course has several prerequisites. Officers selected for TSM billets should contact their OPMD assignment
officer to discuss requirements. After PCS arrival at Fort Rucker, TSMs will also attend the Aviation PCC.
(2) Operational assignments. The following example assignments, some not necessarily coded as Aviation are also
developmentally key: Joint Duty, Division Chief of Staff or US Army Aviation Center (USAAVNC) Chief of Staff;
corps G3 or deputy Chief of Staff; deputy assistant commandant; Director of Training Development and Doctrine
(DOTD); Director of Combat Developments (DCD); Director of Evaluation and Standardization (DES); Director of
Simulations (DOS); Director of Aviation Proponency; COL positions at the Combat Training Centers (CTCs); Aviation
Center Logistics Command; USALLS; ARSTAF, MACOM staff, and Joint Staffs; and selected Active Army/RC
assignments. HQDA centralized selection boards for brigade level command or TRADOC System Managers (TSM)
select a small percentage of officers. Successful brigade level command marks officers as qualified for increased
responsibility at the highest levels in the Army and DOD. Under OPMS, only officers in the OPCF will be eligible to
command. Commands filled by OPCF officers on the CSL are organized into 4 functional categories: Tactical, Training
and Strategic Support, Institutional (garrison and USAREC), and TRADOC System Managers (TSMs).
(3) Self–development. Self–development goals should focus on perfecting organizational level leadership skills, Joint
and coalition operations, and theater level operations. An advanced degree is not required but is strongly recommended.
14–4. Aviation warrant officer Active Army
a. Military occupational specialty 151A, Aviation Maintenance (Non–rated).
(1) Aviation Maintenance officers manage personnel, supply, equipment, and facility assets to maintain and repair
Army rotary and fixed wing aircraft. They organize maintenance elements to inspect service, test, disassemble, repair,
reassemble, adjust, replace parts, and retest aircraft or aircraft components. They prepare, implement, and maintain
standing operating procedures for management of maintenance activities. They interpret regulations, technical manuals,
and orders pertaining to maintenance of Army aircraft for commanders and subordinates. They supervise aviation
equipment maintenance, direct maintenance and accountability of organizational test equipment, supplies, and recovery
equipment. They are assigned at the platoon level through DOD based on experience gained through service.
(2) Assignment Oriented Training (AOT) is the key element in development of a fully capable senior 151A. The
goal of AOT is for warrant officers to receive required specific training prior to reporting to the unit. Examples of AOT
are: The Safety Officer Course (SOC), Maintenance Test Pilot (MTP) courses (ground portion only), aircraft armament
and Army logistics courses (Retail Supply and Management Course, Logistics Management Development Course,
Support Operations Course, Logistics Assistance Representative (LAR) University at Corpus Christi Army Depot and
the Army Maintenance Manager’s Course). These courses should be scheduled to coincide with professional development courses and or PCS. WO1s should all attend the appropriate MTP course prior to their first assignment. Training
With Industry (TWI) may be an option for senior CW3s and CW4s selected for follow-on assignments at an aircraft
Program Manager Office.
(3) Aviation Maintenance WO1/CW2 are basic level, tactical and technical experts who should expect to serve in
platoon, company or battalion level positions. AOT will be used to prepare aviation WOs for each assignment. They
manage aircraft maintenance based on a thorough knowledge of aircraft maintenance requirements for power trains,
electrical systems, electronic systems, avionics, armament systems, mechanics and hydraulics. They manage and
120

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

supervise removal, disassembly, inspection, repair, assembly, installation, maintenance operational checks and adjustments of aircraft structures, components and subsystems. These officers manage the maintenance of technical publication libraries, ensure compliance with regulations governing forms, records and reports pertaining to aircraft
maintenance, manage aircraft repair parts stockage levels and supply procedures, direct and supervise fault isolation for

(4) Aviation maintenance CW3s serve as advanced level technical and tactical experts that should perform the
primary duties at ASB or higher level. AOT will continue with emphasis on logistical interfaces above the Brigade
level. They may be scheduled to attend the LAR University at Corpus Christi Army depot after their attendance at the
AWOAC. Career managers should assign these officers in support of a different modernized aircraft at each PCS. As a
senior CW3 every effort should be made to assign them to an ASB. CW3s provide direction, guidance, resources,
assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. They provide leader development,
mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs, and other officers. CW3s serve as senior technical advisors to the
commander. Typical assignments include; Production Control (PC), Quality Control (QC), Armament Officer and
Safety Officer positions in ASB, Component Repair Company Platoon Leader in the ASB, Aircraft Repair Company
Platoon Leader in the ASB, and Instructor/writer at the generating force.
(5) Aviation Maintenance chief warrant officer 4s (CW4) serve as senior level technical and tactical experts that
should perform the primary duties in the Sustainment Base (ASB) or Generating Force (TRADOC, AMC, DLA).
CW4s provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their
duties. They provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs, and other officers. CW4s serve as
senior technical advisors to the commander. As an ASB aviation maintenance logistician, a CW4 monitors and
evaluates aircraft maintenance operations, processes and procedures, and aviation materiel readiness status. Provides
guidance and technical input to subordinate aviation maintenance elements and other staff elements. Performs duties
pertaining to resource management and aircraft procurement activities. Typical assignments include; Aviation Multifunctional Logistician in Support Operations of an ASB, Aviation Multifunctional Logistician in the Sustainment Base,

b. Military occupational specialty 152–155, Army Aviator.
(1) Aviation warrant officers in these specialties pilot and command all Army aircraft in tactical and non-tactical
conditions. They operate both fixed and rotary wing aircraft in all meteorological conditions, both day and night, and
are responsible for coordinating, conducting, and directing all types of single service and Joint combat, combat support
and service support operations. These officers function as direct combat participants with organic armament systems,
and sustain combat proficiency for their designated aircraft as outlined in the appropriate Aircrew Training Manual
(ATM). Aviation Warrant Officers fill a unique role within Army Aviation as the branches technical and tactical
experts providing long–term continuity of service within our units. The focus of every officer should be on bringing the
Warrior Ethos to every job and every facet of their development.
(2) MOS 152–155 WO1— After completing the WOCS, WO1s attend the Initial Entry Rotary Wing (IERW) and
Aviation Warrant Officer Basic Course (AWOBC). The WO1 appointments are contingent upon successfully completing MOS certification courses and graduation from AWOBC. These are basic level, technically and tactically focused
officers who perform the primary duties of leader and operators. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. The WO1s have specific responsibility for
accomplishing the missions and tasks assigned to them. WO1s primarily support crew operations from team through
battalion, requiring interaction with all soldier cohorts and primary staff. These are basic level tactical and technical
experts who should expect to serve in platoon, or company level positions. Attaining Pilot in Command status and
annual completion of all Aircrew Training Program (ATP) requirements are expectations of these officers. AOT will be
used to prepare these officers for each assignment.
(3) MOSs 152–155 CW2— CW2s are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment
level and position. CW2s will complete the TRADOC mandated common core prerequisites for the Aviation Warrant

c. Aviation warrant officer functional roles.
(1) Aviation safety officer SQI B. The ASOs are the primary advisors and assistants to the commander on all matters
related to aviation and ground safety. They monitor unit FAs and operations to identify and eliminate systems defects
that may cause accidents, injuries or operational failures. They administer or monitor safety related programs in
accordance with AR 385–95. Active component officers desiring to become an aviation safety officer must complete a
6–week resident course. Reserve component officers may attend the 6–week course or a 2–week (phase II) resident
course combined with a prerequisite (phase I) correspondence course. Course information and prerequisites are
contained in DA PAM 351–4, U.S. Army Formal School Catalog. Upon successful completion of the ASO course
these safety officers are employed from the troop/company level to Army level. Senior ASOs may attend the CP12
safety course which is a graduate degree producing program leading to professional certifications.
(2) Instructor pilot/standardization officer SQIs C/F/H. The aviation standardization officer is the commander’s
technical and tactical advisor. He helps the commander and the operations officer develop, implement, and manage the
ATP. They train, evaluate, and provide technical supervision for the aviation standardization program as specified by
the commander. Training is based on the unit’s wartime mission, standardization officers maintain standards, evaluate
proficiency of the unit’s aviators, develop and execute training plans that result in proficient individuals, leaders, and
units. Instructor pilots and standardization officers assist the command in planning and preparing aviation training.
Individual training is the building block for crew training, which leads to team, platoon and collectively trained units.
Instructor Pilot Courses (IPC) for all Army aircraft are taught at Fort Rucker or National Guard Training Sites.
Successful completion of IPC leads to award of SQI C. The Instrument Flight Examiners Course is conducted at Fort
Rucker and leads to award of SQI F. After completion of the WOSC battalion level Standardization Officers are
awarded SQI H. Instructor Pilots are assigned to each platoon as CW2s, progressing to Company level positions as
CW3s. They work as Senior Instructor Pilots, Instrument Flight Examiners, and Battalion level Standardization Officers
as CW4s. CW5s Standardization Officers work at Brigade or higher levels.
(3) Maintenance test pilot (MTP) SQIs G/L. The MTPs perform maintenance test flights in all Army aircraft. They
advise the commander on aircraft maintenance management issues, schedule required aircraft maintenance and serve as
aviation logistics managers. These officers complete the Aviation Maintenance Managers Course and appropriate
aircraft Maintenance Test Flight phase of training at Fort Rucker, AL. Successful completion of both phases of training
results in the awarding of an SQI of G. Maintenance Test Pilots are assigned to each platoon as CW2s, progressing to
Aviation Unit Maintenance Company level positions as CW3s, Battalion level as CW4s and Brigade or higher-level
Maintenance Officer positions as CW5s. For award of SQI L these officers must undergo a Maintenance Test Flight
Evaluator (MTFE) evaluation. MTFEs are responsible for conducting evaluations of MTPs to maintain standardization
of maintenance flight procedures.
(4) Tactical operations officer SQI I. The Aviation Tactical Operations Officer is the commander’s tactical advisor
and a technical source. He assists the commander and the operations officer in the planning, coordination, briefing and
execution of tactical Army Aviation and warfare in a Joint/combined environment. Additionally, provides commanders
technical/tactical expertise of Army Airspace Command and Control (A2C2), personnel recovery, electronic warfare,
threat analysis, digital operations and Joint tactics, techniques and procedures. They develop, implement, and manage
the Personnel Recovery, Aviation Mission Planning Systems (AMPS), fratricide prevention, Threat Analysis, and
Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) programs. At the Brigade Aviation Element (BAE) level, Tactical Operations
Officers in conjunction with their primary tasks, recommend and assist in the integration of tactical Army Aviation war
fighting capabilities into the ground commander’s scheme of maneuver. Tactical operations officers develop threat
training, ASE, personnel recovery programs and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to integrate aviation
operations into the Joint/combined arms fight. An Aircraft Survivability Equipment/Electronic Warfare Officer, (ASE/
EWO) course for all mission design series aircraft is taught at Fort Rucker, AL. Successful completion of the ASE
EWO course leads to an award of ASI H3. Upon completion and the award of ASI H3, officers may attend the Tactical
Operations Officer Course at Ft Rucker, AL. that leads to the award of SQI I. ASE/EWOs are assigned to each platoon
as WO–1s/CW2s, progressing to the Company level Tactical Operations Officer position as CW3s. Battalion level
Tactical Operations Officers are assigned as CW4s and Brigade or higher level Tactical Operations Officers as CW5s.
(5) Aeromedical evacuation pilot (MEDEVAC) SQI D. The MEDEVAC Pilot must be an aviator qualified in aircraft
used for medical evacuation and successfully complete the Army Medical Service Aviator Course or have one year
documented experience. Aeromedical evacuation aviators may be assigned to multiple MEDEVAC assignments or may
revert to a non–MEDEVAC assignment dependent upon the utilization requirements of the Army.

14–5. Aviation Branch Reserve Component officer
a. General career development. Reserve Component Aviation officer development objectives and qualifications
parallel those planned for their Active Army counterparts.
b. Development opportunities. The nature of the RC soldier’s role as a citizen–soldier poses a unique challenge for
professional development. RC officers are expected to follow AC officer development patterns as closely as possible,
except that RC officers have increased time windows to complete mandatory professional educational requirements.
Civilian career opportunities, military promotions and educational opportunities may force RC officers to transfer
between Army National Guard (ARNG) M–Day Units, USAR TPU, Individual Ready Reserve (IRR), Individual
Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) Program, and the Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) Programs. These transfers are
often hindered by geographical considerations, as well as a limited number of positions to serve with troops in
leadership and staff positions. Additionally, there may be occasions when NG Officers will be transferred to the
Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) or Army Reserve Officers to the Trainee, Transient, Holdee, and Student (TTHS)
account while they complete mandatory educational requirements. Such transfers are usually temporary and should not
be seen as impacting negatively on the officer’s career. The success of the RC officer is not measured by length of
service in any one component or control group, but by the officer’s breadth and depth of experience which are the
metrics that accurately reflect an officers potential to serve in positions of increasing responsibility. Officers should
focus on job performance, as there are many paths that define a successful career within the Aviation Branch.
(1) Formal training. As RC Officers simultaneously advance both civilian and military careers, they have less
available time than their AC counterparts to achieve the same military professional education levels. To minimize this
problem, RC courses are specifically tailored to reduce the resident instruction time. This cannot be accomplished with
graduate flight training courses.
(2) Assignments. The Adjutants General of the 50 States, 3 U.S. Territories, and the District of Columbia (DC)
primarily manage officers in the Army National Guard (ARNG). The AHRC–St. Louis and the U.S. Army Reserve
Command manage officers in the Army Reserve.
(3) Professional development through the military schooling system. The Aviation RC Officer plays an important
role in the Aviation Branch mission. RC officers normally develop through one area of concentration and in one FA.
However, a lack of suitable positions in a geographic area may lead to some RC officers becoming qualified in
multiple AOCs or FAs. RC officers must attain educational levels commensurate with their grade and assignment,
using resident and non-resident instruction options. RC officers have increased windows to complete military education
requirements. (For further guidance on RC career progression, see chap 7.)
c. Reserve Component lieutenant. LTs must meet the requirements outlined in AR 611–110 for entry into the
Aviation Branch.
(1) Professional Military Education. Reserve Component officers commissioned into the Aviation Branch attend
BOLC and IERW with their Active Army counterparts. Reserve Component officers must have completed this training
by their 2nd year of commissioned service.
(2) Operational assignments. LTs should serve as a section/platoon leader in an Aviation assignment. An LT
normally serves at company level to gain troop leading and flight experience.
(3) Self–development. LTs focus on gaining and refining troop leading, aviator, Joint and combined arms tactics,
logistics and administrative skills. Effective 1 October 1995, a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution is
required for promotion to CPT or higher.
d. Reserve Component captain.
(1) Professional military education. CPTs must complete a CCC. Options are as follows: CCC Active Army (CCC
Active Army curriculum), CCC RC (RC curriculum), or the 4–phase CCC USAR.
(2) Operational assignments. The officer should serve in one of the following branch developmental positions for 18
to 36 months; successful company/detachment command of a TOE/TDA unit or successful tour as a platoon leader in
platoons that authorize CPTs as platoon leaders. These include intermediate and higher level maintenance (AVIM)
units. As a CPT, RC Aviation officers should aggressively seek a company command. They also serve as staff officers
at the battalion and group/brigade levels.
(3) Self–development. CPTs should broaden their understanding of war fighting through extension courses and
independent study. CPTs should gain an in–depth understanding of Joint and combined arms operations.
e. Reserve Component major. To achieve branch leadership developmental standards at this level, MAJs must have
enrolled in the ILE course prior to 18 years time in service.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

127

(1) Professional Military Education. Most RC officers will complete the ILE common core via The Army School
System (TASS) or an upgraded Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) program. Some RC Officers will continue to
attend the ILE in residence at Fort Leavenworth, some will depart upon completion of the Core Course and others will
remain for the Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course (AWOC).
(2) Operational assignments. RC Aviation MAJs serve as company commanders, and in staff assignments. These
staff positions are at the Battalion, Group, Brigade, HQDA or Joint Staff levels. Some MAJs also serve as instructors
or Staff at Reserve Forces Service Schools. Officers should serve in one of the following Branch Developmental
positions for 18 to 36 months; Battalion Executive Officer or S3, Battalion Support Operations Officer, Brigade S3,
Successful MAJ level (04) command of a TOE/TDA aviation unit, Branch Chief at an Army National Guard Aviation
Training Site (AATS), Aviation Branch coded (15) or branch/FA generalist positions at the HQDA or Joint Staff
levels, Group or Brigade primary staff (S1, S2 or S4), Aviation Branch coded (15) or branch/function in a generalist
position at Joint, ARCOM or GOCOM staff levels, Reserve Forces service school instructor or staff, Aviation staff
officer at the MACOM level, and Brigade Aviation Element (BAE).
(3) Self–development. Self–development efforts should focus on becoming an expert in all aspects of aviation
support operations, including Joint and combined arms operations. These objectives can be accomplished through
correspondence courses or institutional training. MAJs should also devote time to a professional reading program to
broaden their Joint and combined arms operations perspectives.
f. Reserve Component lieutenant colonel. In order to qualify for promotion to COL, RC officers must have
completed ILE.
(1) Operational assignments. Reserve Component LTCs should seek a battalion level command. Upon successful
completion of a command, RC Aviation LTCs serve in staff positions at group/brigade, Major Subordinate Commands,
U.S. Army Reserve General Officer Command (GOCOM), or Joint Staff levels. Some RC officers may also serve as
Reserve Forces Service School instructors or staff. Officers should serve in one of the following branch developmental
positions for 18 to 36 months; Successful command of a TOE/TDA aviation battalion or equivalent sized aviation unit,
completion of a resident or non-resident ILE, Aviation Branch coded (15) or branch/FA generalist positions at the
MACOM, GOCOM or Joint Staff levels, Group or Brigade Staff, Division or Branch Chief, USAAVNC, USARC,
NGB, or USAALS, AGR Title 10/Title 32 position at USAAVNC or USAALS (in a LTC level position), Deputy
Commander of an Army National Guard Aviation Training Site (AATS),
(2) Self–development. Self–development goals should be to continue building Joint warfighting expertise. An
advanced degree is preferred but optional unless required for a specific assignment.
g. Reserve Component colonel.
(1) Professional military education. Completion of SSC by resident or correspondence course is a primary professional development goal.
(2) Operational assignments. Some, but not all, RC officers serve as group or brigade commanders. Most serve in
staff positions requiring their Aviation experience at the GOCOM or Joint Staff levels. Aviation RC Colonels should
serve in one of the following Branch Developmental positions for 18 to 36 months: Successful command of a TOE/
TDA Aviation Group or Brigade; Completion of a resident or non-resident SSC; USAAVNC; Army or Joint Level
Staff; Aviation Branch coded (15) or branch/FA generalist positions at the Major Subordinate Commands; GOCOM or
Joint Staff levels, AGR Title 10/Title 32 positions at USAAVNC or USAALS (in a Colonel level position); Command
of an Army National Guard Aviation Training Site (AATS); Division Chief of Aviation and Safety Division; National
Guard Bureau (NGB); and State Army Aviation Officer (SAAO).
(3) Self–development. Self–development goals should continue to build on war fighting expertise. An advanced
degree is preferred but optional unless required for a specific assignment.
h. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model is shown at figure 14–16.
14–6. Aviation Reserve Component warrant officer
a. Preferences. Reserve Component Aviation warrant officer (AWO) development objectives and qualifications
basically parallel those planned for their AC counterparts.
b. Precedence. As with the RC commissioned officer, the RC warrant officer’s role as a citizen–soldier also poses a
unique challenge for professional development. Reserve Component WOs are expected to follow Active Army WO
development patterns as closely as possible. Reserve Component WOs also have increased windows to complete
mandatory educational requirements.
(1) Formal training. As citizen–soldiers, RC WOs simultaneously advance civilian and military careers. To minimize this impact, the USAAVNC and the WOCC have developed RC courses specifically tailored to reduce the
resident instructional time.
(2) Critical life cycle assignments. Reserve Components WOs are managed in the same manner as the RC
commissioned officers.
c. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory. Reserve Component Aviation WOs must attain educational levels
commensurate with their grade and assignment, using resident and non–resident instruction options. Reserve Component WOs also have increased windows to complete military education requirements. As Aviation Branch aircraft

128

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

systems increase in complexity and capability, a corresponding increase occurs in tactical employment capabilities. The
need for Aviation WOs who are highly competent in operations, maintenance, safety, training and tactical employment
of complex aircraft systems is critical to the success of the Aviation Branch.
(1) Military occupational specialty qualification and development
(a) WO1. After completing the WOCS, WO1s attend their Initial Entry Rotary Wing (IERW) and WOBC. WO1
appointments are contingent upon successfully completing WOBC. These officers are basic level, technically and
tactically focused officers who perform the primary duties of leaders and operators. They provide direction, guidance,
resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. WO1s primarily support levels
of operations from team through battalion, requiring interaction with all soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide
leader development, mentorship, and counsel to enlisted soldiers and NCOs.
(b) CW2. CW2s are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position.
CW2s will complete the TRADOC mandated common core prerequisites for the AWOAC prior to becoming eligible
for promotion to CW3. CW2s serve as intermediate level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties
of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, and advisor. CW2s provide direction, guidance,
resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. They primarily support levels
of operations from team through battalion, requiring interaction with all soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide
leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs, and other officers. RC AWOs have the option of
resident or Distance Learning (DL) training. The purpose of the AWOAC is to refresh and enhance common skills and
leadership, update technical and tactical training, and provide doctrinal changes and additional training as prescribed by
the branch proponent. All training is based on future needs and requirements.
(c) CW3. CW3s serve as advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical
leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, and advisor. CW3s provide direction, guidance, resources,

Chapter 15
Special Forces Branch
15–1. Unique features of Special Forces Branch
a. Unique purpose of Special Forces Branch. Special Forces (SF) are multipurpose forces capable of rapid response
to contingencies throughout the world. Their mission is to conduct special operations across the full range of military
operations in any operational environment in war, peace, or contingencies. Special Forces teams expand the range of
available options in a variety of scenarios where the commitment of conventional military forces is not feasible or
appropriate. They provide military capabilities not available elsewhere in the armed forces. Special Forces operations
are inherently Joint, often multinational or interagency in nature and are focused at the operational and strategic levels.
Special Forces operations are frequently conducted through, with, or by indigenous forces.
b. Unique functions performed by Special Forces branch. Special Forces branch is a combat arms branch, consisting
of officers in the grade of WO1 through COL. As representatives of the United States in a foreign country, Special
Forces serve as teachers as well as warriors. In war, SF provides unique combined and unilateral capabilities to the
combatant commander. They interact closely with and live under the same conditions as the indigenous people. They
conduct peacetime operations and promote regional stability in areas where conventional forces normally do not
operate. Their continuous forward presence assists in creating the conditions for stable development, thereby reducing
the risk of armed conflict.
c. Unique features of work in Special Forces Branch. Special Forces perform 5 core tasks:
(1) Unconventional Warfare (UW). Unconventional warfare covers a broad spectrum of military and paramilitary
operations, normally of long duration, predominantly conducted by, with, and through indigenous or surrogate forces. It
includes guerrilla warfare, subversion, sabotage, intelligence collection and unconventional assisted recovery. The
primary Special Forces mission in this interagency activity is to organize, train, equip, advise, assist and direct
indigenous insurgents or other armed resistance movements.
(2) Foreign Internal Defense (FID). FID constitutes participation in the action programs of a foreign government to
free and protect its society from a wide range of internal, external and transnational threats. The primary Special Forces
mission in this interagency activity includes but is not limited to organizing, training, advising and assisting host nation
military and paramilitary forces.
(3) Direct action. Direct action is defined as short duration strikes and other small scale offensive actions to seize,
destroy or inflict damage on a specified target or to destroy, capture or recover designated personnel or materiel.
(4) Special Reconnaissance (SR). SR activities involve reconnaissance and surveillance actions to obtain or verify
information concerning the capabilities, intentions and activities of an actual or potential enemy, or the hydrographic or
geographic characteristics of a particular area. It includes target acquisition, area assessment and post strike
reconnaissance.
(5) Counterterrorism (CT). CT can be defined as actions taken to prevent, deter and respond to terrorism. The
primary Special Forces mission in this interagency activity is to preclude, preempt and resolve terrorist incidents
abroad.
d. Officer roles.
(1) Special Forces officers ( career field 18A) plan, coordinate, direct and participate in Special Forces units
performing the above core tasks in all operational environments. A Special Forces CPT commands a Special Forces
Operational Detachment-A (SFOD–A). The SFOD–A is a flexible and highly trained unit, which includes (in addition
to the commander) one Special Forces WO and ten Special Forces noncommissioned officers (NCOs). The NCOs hold
one or more of the following specialties: operations, intelligence, weapons, communications, engineering or medical.
The successful SFOD–A must be adept at accomplishing a wide range of requirements including training management,
logistical planning, resource management, training plan development for foreign forces, and negotiating and working
with foreign and U.S. government agencies and country teams. Special Forces officers who successfully command an
SFOD–A later may command larger Special Forces units, at company level as a MAJ, battalion as an LTC, and group
as a COL. They serve on upper echelon Special Forces, Army and Joint Special Operations Forces (SOF) staffs, in
Special Mission Units (SMUs), and in interagency assignments. They also serve as special operations staff officers on
Joint Task Forces.
(2) Special Forces warrant officers ( career field 180A) are combat leaders and Staff Officers who manage all
aspects of Special Forces Operations in all operational environments. Specialized officers in Joint, strategic, operational, and tactical requirements at all levels of planning and execution of special operations worldwide. They are
responsible for the conduct of unconventional warfare and Joint integration of Special Forces tactics and techniques.
They advise commanders on strategic reconnaissance, intelligence collection, strike and security operations. They lead
specialized teams in Advanced Special Operations; counter terrorism, psychological, civil affairs and other missions,
relative to special operations capabilities, as directed.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

133

e. Assignment Opportunities other than MTOE. In addition to operational positions, Special Force officers and
warrant officers may serve as SOF observer-controllers at combat training centers, on Joint, interagency, and the DA
staffs, as staff and faculty of the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS),
and in a wide variety of other combat arms or branch immaterial positions worldwide. Due to the wide-ranging
demands and opportunities resident in the special operations community, the Special Forces branch remains a flexible,
diverse force, with many individual paths to professional success and promotion.
15–2. Characteristics required of Special Forces officers.
a. Unique attributes. Special Forces officers and warrant officers must:
(1) Be extremely physically fit.
(2) Possess unquestioned integrity.
(3) Be self-reliant team players that can function as leaders in tightly knit small groups.
(4) Possess the cognitive resilience and mental dexterity to act autonomously while under great stress.
(5) Thrive in complex and ambiguous situations.
(6) Be mentally flexible and willing to experiment and innovate in a decentralized and unstructured environment.
(7) Have the ability to solve complex political-military problems and develop and employ conventional or unconventional solutions. Develop and employ non-doctrinal methods and techniques when applicable. Be capable of
decisive action for missions in which no current doctrine exists.
(8) Be able to inspire others to perform effectively under stress.
(9) Possess good interpersonal skills and display political acumen and cultural sensitivity. Mission success will often
depend on an ability to establish rapport and influence the attitudes and behaviors of people from foreign cultures.
b. Unique skills .
(1) Special Forces officers must:
(a) Be proficient infantry commanders and experts in unconventional warfare and Special Forces operations.
(b) Be tactically and technically proficient in skills required of an SFOD–A.
(c) Have an aptitude for learning a foreign language and must sustain foreign language proficiency throughout their
careers. This is one of the most important and difficult skills to gain and sustain, and is critical for all Special Forces
officers. Immediately after completing the 18A Special Forces Qualification Course (SFQC), officers who do not
already meet language requirements receive extensive foreign language and cultural training taught at the
USAJFKSWCS and elsewhere, and must successfully meet all language course requirements before joining an SF
Group.
(d) Be qualified military parachutists.
(2) Special Forces warrant officers must:
(a) Be subject matter experts and recognized authority in unconventional warfare, Joint and interagency operations,
planning, operations and intelligence as well as technical and tactical skills.
(b) Be tactically and technically expert in all capabilities required of an SFOD–A.
(c) Be familiar with all the technical skills represented on an SFOD–A.
(d) Be capable of planning and conducting special operations at the tactical, operational, and strategic level
interchangeably.
(e) Have an aptitude for learning a foreign language and must sustain foreign language proficiency throughout their
careers. This is one of the most important and difficult skills to gain and sustain, and is a critical skill for all SF
officers.
(f) Be qualified military parachutists.
c. Unique knowledge.
(1) Completion of the SFQC provides officers with entry- level knowledge of Special Forces operations. As they
develop, officers gain a broader understanding of Special Forces tactics, techniques and procedures, the special
operations targeting and mission planning process, the special operations support and sustainment process, and the
Joint, multinational, and interagency aspects of special operations.
(2) Special Forces officers and warrant officers have unique knowledge of specialized infiltration and exfiltration
techniques, for many of which the Special Forces branch is the proponent.
(3) Special Forces officers and warrant officers continuously undergo intensive preparation for assignment in their
unit’s designated geographic area. Whether the mission profile calls for clandestine employment in a denied area or a
low visibility Foreign Internal Defense mission in a developing nation, the overall requirement for regional orientation,
language proficiency and cross-cultural interpersonal skills remains the same. Special Forces officers and warrant
officers gain and maintain area orientation through military and civilian schooling, language study, area study, mission
preparation and repetitive operational experience during their careers. While initial language qualification is most often
achieved through formalized instruction, it must be maintained through practice and self-study. Defense Language

134

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

Proficiency Test scores reflect language proficiency and must be updated through formalized testing annually. Although the Special Forces groups are organized by area of concentration, the management of regional expertise is
subject to modification as the needs of the Army change.
15–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. Officer Qualification and Development. (Career development model is at figure 15–1.)
(1) Lieutenant. Special Forces branch is a volunteer non–accession branch that draws its officers from other
branches of the Army. The USAREC recruits SF volunteers. Special Forces officers are expected to have served a
successful initial tour as an LT in a small unit leadership position in one of the Army’s other basic branches. As a
result they are expected to have knowledge of conventional Army operations and be experienced in Army leadership.
LTs who volunteer in the targeted year group are selected by a DA centralized accession board and then undergo a
rigorous and demanding assessment and selection program to qualify for continued Special Forces officer training.
(2) Captain. Special Forces career development is similar to other combat arms branches. Initial training is extensive, and all Special Forces officers are airborne qualified and maintain that proficiency throughout their careers. SF
branch does not offer its own CCC. To meet Army military education level (MEL) requirements, every SF officer must
complete a branch CCC. Typically, this will be the Infantry or Armor branch course. Officers will attend CCC upon
successful completion of the assessment and selection program, followed by the Special Forces Qualification Course
(SFQC) and operational assignment.
(a) Special Forces CPTs must successfully command an SFOD–A.
1. CPTs will normally serve for a minimum of 18 months in A–detachment command, with 2 years preferred. This
duty equates to company, battery, or troop command in the other combat arms branches, and is considered critical
branch experience for a CPT. Assignment as an SFOD–A commander will normally be an officer’s initial assignment
following completion of his SF qualification training.
2. The branch objective at the SFOD–A (detachment) command level is to provide the operational force with the
highest possible quality leadership in order to execute tactical missions in support of combatant command operational
objectives and requirements. Detachment command also provides a common base of experience, professional development, and opportunities by which to develop and evaluate SF CPTs.
3. The goal for a CPT is 36 months assigned to career field (CF) 18 coded positions within a Special Forces Group.
Ideally, a CPT serves 2 years as an SFOD–A commander followed by a 3rd year as commander of a commanddesignated specialty SFOD–A, as a company executive officer, a headquarters company commander at battalion, group,
or flag-level HQs, or staff officer at battalion or group level. Selection to a second command is appropriate for an
officer with high potential. This command time is in addition to the officer’s initial tenure as an SFOD–A commander.
(b) Other preferred developmental assignments include:
1. Service as an instructor at the Special Forces Qualification Course (SFQC).
2. Service as a Joint staff officer or DOD staff intern.
3. Completion of the Naval Post Graduate School Special Operations/ Low Intensity Conflict (SO/LIC) program.
This program entails 21 months of graduate study to include authorship of a thesis on a topic of current interest to the
SOF community. It provides a broad, deep education in the art and science of unconventional warfare at the tactical,
operational, and strategic levels, and the curriculum is accredited as a MEL4 (ILE) course. Attendance entails a
utilization tour as an operational planner at USSOCOM, USASOC, a Theater Special Operations Command (TSOC) or
in designated JSOTFs in contingency operations.
(c) In addition to professional development through operational assignments, SF CPTs should begin an intensive
self-development program. Their efforts should focus on gaining an in-depth understanding of combined arms operations, gaining and maintaining regional and linguistic expertise and becoming proficient in Special Forces and Infantry
officer common core and branch tasks.
(d) Although not required, advanced special operations skill courses such as Combat Diver, Combat Diving
Supervisor, Military Free Fall, Military Free Fall Jumpmaster, Advanced Special Operations (ASO), and Special Forces
Advanced Reconnaissance, Target Analysis, & Exploitation Course (SFARTAETC) provide valuable professional
development. SF CPTs should seek these courses prior to or during A–Detachment command. If not already Ranger
qualified, they should attend Ranger training en-route to their initial Special Forces group assignment.
(e) SF officers, as commanders of airborne units, are expected to successfully complete static line jumpmaster
training early in their careers.
(f) Due to the extensive training involved in SF officer accessions, officers volunteering for Special Forces who do
not already have a baccalaureate degree will be required to complete their degree before attending the SFQC.
(g) Officers may select an FA preference (FAP) during their 5th and 6th years of service. Actual FA training and
utilization follows detachment command. Officers may request SF Branch to allow them an FA utilization assignment
immediately following detachment command, especially if the officer desires to transfer to that FA at the career field
Designation Board (CFDB). SF officers may also serve in key branch/FA generalist assignments as USMA or ROTC
faculty and staff.
(3) Major.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

135

(a) Immediately following selection for MAJ, the records of those selected will go before the DA CFDB. This board
of senior officers decides in which career field an officer is best suited to serve. Officer preference is an important
criterion in career field designation, as are the officer’s special skills, FA training, and needs of the Army. The goal is
to maintain a healthy, viable career path for SF branch officers who remain in the Operations career field. To
accomplish this, the field grade inventory must be structured to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient
flexibility in supporting branch/FA generalist participation, and to allow all SF officers to serve in branch critical
developmental assignments for the period needed to achieve requisite professional development. SF majors not retained
in the Operations career field will be assigned into one of the other career fields: Operational Support, Information
Operations, or Institutional Support. Once designated, officers will compete for future promotions within their designated career field. The FA assignment managers for those career fields will manage key leader development positions
and assignments for officers designated into one of the other career fields. The Special Forces branch will manage
assignments for SF officers in the Operations career field. SF officers who remain in the Operations career field will be
assigned to SF branch or FA generalist positions (such as USMA faculty and staff, IG and ROTC). Regardless of the
career field into which the officer is designated, he will remain a member of the First Special Forces Regiment, wear
the branch and regimental insignia, and be a contributor to the broad requirements of Army Special Operations. Major
requirements are validated in an annual career field Board Guidance request from CG, USAJFKSWCS to DA G1.
(b) Special Forces majors must successfully serve for approximately 24 months in any of the positions listed below
or a combination of these positions in order to meet critical branch experience requirements. The branch objective at
the MAJ level is to provide the Special Operations Forces (SOF) community with the highest possible quality
leadership and mid- level management in support of accessing, training, employing, and commanding SOF world-wide.
Additionally, individual officers will be provided with demanding experiential and professional development opportunities focused toward the individual’s abilities, attributes, skills, and desires, vice the commonality of experience at the
CPT SFOD–A level.
1. SF Company Commander. Majors command SF line companies. Each commander is responsible for his company
headquarters (SFOD–B) and six subordinate SFOD–As.
2. SF Battalion S3. The SF battalion S3 performs duties as the battalion operations, training and plans officer,
similar to other combat arms S3s.
3. SF Battalion/Group XO. The SF XO performs duties similar to other combat arms battalion/brigade XOs.
4. SF Group S3. The SF group S3 performs duties as the group operations, training and plans officer.
5. SF Group Support Company (GSC) Commander. The SF GSC commander is responsible for logistics, medical,
intelligence and communications support to the SF Groups.
6. Positions corresponding to 1 through 5 above in the 1st Special Warfare Training Group (1st SWTG), or a
Special Mission Unit (SMU).
7. Designated positions corresponding to 1 through 5 above in a Joint Special Operations Task Force in contingency
operations.
8. Commander, SF Operational Detachment-K in Korea.
9. Designated Operations/Plans staff officer positions in USSOCOM, a Theater Special Operations Command
(TSOC), or equivalent Joint Special Operations unit.
10. Other critical designated SF-coded positions.
(c) Preferred developmental assignments for SF MAJs include duty as a staff officer in an SF position at DA, major
Army command (MACOM) or MACOM major subordinate command (MSC) level.
(d) Other developmental assignments for SF majors include:
1. Service as an observer-controller at a combat training center.
2. Service as a Joint or combined staff officer. Special operations are inherently Joint operations and SF majors
should seek Joint or combined duty after their branch qualifying assignment.
3. Attendance at the highly competitive Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP) at the School of Advanced
Military Studies (SAMS). The AMSP is a year of advanced study for selected officers completing ILE, MEL4 at the
Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth. It provides a broad, deep education in the art and science of
war at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels, followed by a tour (after basic branch qualification) as an
operational planner at USSOCOM, USASOC, a Theater Special Operations Command (TSOC) or in designated
JSOTFs in contingency operations. When not in command, SF officers who have completed AMSP will serve
repetitively in operational and strategic planning positions on the Joint/OSD staff, interagency staff, USSOCOM,
USASOC, and the TSOCs and can be expected to serve as J5s on JSOTFs during contingency operations.
4. Attendance at the Naval Post Graduate School Special Operations/ Low Intensity Conflict (SO/LIC) program.
This program entails 21 months of graduate study to include authorship of a thesis on a topic of current interest to the
SOF community. It provides a broad, deep education in the art and science of unconventional warfare at the tactical,
operational, and strategic levels, and the curriculum is accredited as a MEL4 (ILE) course. Attendance entails a
utilization tour as an operational planner at USSOCOM, USASOC, a Theater Special Operations Command (TSOC) or
in designated JSOTFs in contingency at the highly competitive Special Operations/ Low Intensity Conflict (SO/LIC)
Program at the Naval Postgraduate School.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(e) There is much greater emphasis on self-development at the field grade levels, with the focus on more general
areas of knowledge rather than specific tasks. Officers without a master’s degree are encouraged to enroll in a civilian
college or university to earn an advanced degree either off-duty or, if applicable, through a fully funded program in
conjunction with ILE. However, completion of a master’s degree should not take precedence over completion of ILE or
successful execution of any assignment. Special Forces MAJs should also maintain and enhance their foreign language
and cultural proficiency and continue their self–development program aimed at the mastery of Unconventional Warfare
doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures.
(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Developmental requirements for a Special Forces LTC involve successful service in any Special Forces-coded
LTC position or combination of positions. The most critical of these assignments is service as a Special Forces TOE or
TDA battalion commander (Command Selection List billet), which develops the LTC for future responsibilities as a
senior commander or staff officer. The main criterion for SF command selection is outstanding performance of duty.
To remain competitive for command selection in both SMUs and Special Forces groups, officers should balance key
assignments in both types of units. Special Forces officers are strongly encouraged to volunteer for recruiting and
garrison command consideration, as well as critical command and staff billets in Joint and Joint Special Operations
Task Forces (JTFs/JSOTFs).
(b) The branch objective at the LTC level is to provide the Special Operations Forces (SOF) community with the
highest possible quality leadership and senior management in support of accessing, training, employing, and commanding SOF world- wide. For the majority of LTCs, promotion to LTC constitutes success and assignments will be aimed
at developing the officer for broader contributions to the branch, the U.S. Army, and special operations in general.
However, since the Special Forces structure provides relatively fewer LTC command positions than other combat arms
branches, CSL-designated command is not the sole route to COL. Officers should be promoted based on their pattern
of service to the Army and potential for service at the next higher grade.
(c) LTC developmental assignments include—
1. Service in a USSOCOM or Theater Special Operations Command designated JSOTF in a contingency operation.
2. Service as DCO or XO of a Special Forces group.
3. Service as a DA, DOD or JCS staff officer or in interagency positions requiring Special Forces experience and
expertise.
4. Service as a staff officer or commander in a Joint or combined headquarters and earning a Joint service skill
identifier.
5. Service as Chief, Special Operations Training Detachment at the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC).
6. Service as a SOF representative to the Battle Command Training Program (BCTP).
7. Service as G3, U.S. Army Special Forces Command or G3, USAJFKSWCS.
8. Service on the staff and faculty of the Command and General Staff College (CGSC).
(d) For self–development, Special Forces LTCs focus on general areas of knowledge. They should enhance their
regional knowledge and improve their language proficiency as well as continue their mastery of Unconventional
Warfare.
(5) Colonel.
(a) Special Forces colonels continue to serve the branch, special operations, and the Army through senior executive
service in any Special Forces-coded COL position or combination of positions within USSOCOM, USASOC,
USAJFKSWCS, US Army SF Command, HQDA, Joint staffs, service schools, and other key organizations.
(b) Critical assignments include command of a Special Forces TOE or TDA Group, command of a USSOCOM or
Theater Special Operations Command designated JSOTF in a contingency operation, or command of a Special Mission
Unit (SMU). The main criterion for SF command selection is outstanding performance of duty in command at the LTC
level. To remain competitive for command selection in both SMUs and Special Forces groups, officers should balance
key assignments in both types of units. Special Forces officers are strongly encouraged to volunteer for recruiting and
garrison command consideration, as well as critical command and staff billets in Joint and Joint Special Operations
Task Forces (JTFs/JSOTFs).
(c) Primary developmental assignments include:
1. Deputy command of a SMU.
2. TSOC command, deputy command, chief of staff or J–3.
3. Service as a MACOM or Joint staff officer or commander in a Joint critical position requiring Special Forces
expertise.
4. Service as chief of staff or G3, USASOC.
5. Service as deputy commander or chief of staff, USASFC.
6. Service as assistant commandant, chief of staff , or directorate chief, USAJFKSWCS.
7. Service with the Army Staff or with another government agency.
8. Service on the staff and faculty of the CGSC or U.S. Army War College.
9. Service on a combined staff.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(d) For self–development Special Forces COLs focus on general areas of knowledge. Colonels should further
enhance their regional orientation and language proficiency and continue to follow an extensive professional selfdevelopment regimen.
b. Warrant officer qualification and development. The Special Forces WO is a volunteer accessed from Career
Management Field (CMF) 18. All candidates attend the WOCS and after completion, the Special Forces WOBC. Based
on operational requirements, some Special Forces warrant officers undergo training in advanced special operations
skills such as military free-fall parachuting, combat diving, close-quarter battle, and military mountaineering. All
Special Forces Warrant Officers are expected to serve a minimum of 3 years, with a goal of 5, on an SFOD–A in one
of the Special Forces groups. Special Forces Warrant Officers, as advisors, staff planners and operators provide
continuity and experience in Special Operations capabilities integration with conventional forces in the battle space.
Academic and military schooling is a must to ensure that the WO maintains his knowledge and ability to provide
competent, professional service and guidance. As the WO matures in his profession he will be expected to improve his
abilities and knowledge across the entire spectrum of conflict in multiple theaters.
(1) WO1 Special Forces Warrant Officers:
(a) Must successfully complete the Special Forces WOBC.
(b) Should successfully serve on an Operational Detachment as the Assistant Detachment Commander. Development
is focused toward regional/theater expertise.
(c) Should progress toward a linguistic proficiency career goal of 2 in listening, 2 in reading, and 1+ in speaking a
language that corresponds to his regional affiliation.
(d) SF warrant officers, as commanders or assistant detachment commanders of airborne units, are expected to
acquire static line jumpmaster qualification.
(2) CW2 Special Forces warrant officer:
(a) Should complete the Special Forces WOAC between his 4th and 5th year of WO service.
(b) Must serve as Assistant Detachment Commander of a Special Forces Operational Detachment "A" for a
cumulative period of 3 years, with a goal of 5. Development is focused toward regional/theater expertise.
(c) As a goal complete an associate’s degree prior to eligibility for selection to CW3.
(d) Should continue progress towards a linguistic proficiency career goal of 2 in listening, 2 in reading, and 1+ in
speaking a language that corresponds to his regional affiliation.
(e) Select CW2s may serve as Company Operations warrant officer in a Special Forces Company; instructor or
doctrine developer in the Special Warfare Center and School; staff member at the USASFC(A), USASOC, USSOCOM,
or any of the Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs).
(3) CW3 Special Forces warrant officer:
(a) Should complete the WOAC not later than 1 year after promotion to CW3.
(b) Should serve in any of the following assignments: Assistant Detachment Commander of an SFOD–A; Company
Operations warrant officer in a Special Forces Company; instructor or doctrine developer in the Special Warfare Center
and School; staff member at the USASFC(A), USASOC, USSOCOM, or any of the Theater Special Operations
Commands (TSOCs).
(c) As a goal complete a baccalaureate degree prior to eligibility for selection to CW4.
(d) Should continue progress towards a linguistic proficiency career goal of 2 in listening, 2 in reading, and 1+ in
speaking a language that corresponds to his regional affiliation.
(e) Select CW3s who possess a bachelor’s degree and demonstrate the capability to serve at the operational and
strategic levels may attend the SO/LIC course at the Naval Post–Graduate School to pursue a master’s degree in
Defense Analysis. Graduates of the program will incur a 3 year Active Duty Service Obligation (ADSO) as a special
operations planner in a Special Forces battalion, group, or TSOC.
(4) CW4 Special Forces warrant officers—
(a) Should complete the WOSC not later than 1 year after promotion to CW4.
(b) Should serve in any of the following assignments: Battalion Operations warrant officer in a Special Forces
Battalion; instructor or doctrine developer in the Special Warfare Center and School; or staff officer at the
USASFC(A), USASOC, USSOCOM, or a TSOC.
(c) Should continue progress towards a linguistic proficiency career goal of 2 in listening, 2 in reading, and 1+ in
speaking a language that corresponds to his regional affiliation.
(d) Service as a Joint staff officer or DOD staff intern, or as a strategic or operational planner at USSOCOM,
USASOC, a Theater Special Operations Command (TSOC), or a Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF). Select
CW4s may complete the Naval Post Graduate School Special Operations/ Low Intensity Conflict (SO/LIC) program.
This program entails . This program entails 18 months of graduate study to include authorship of a thesis on a topic of
current interest to the SOF community. It provides a broad, deep education in the art and science of unconventional
warfare at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels.
(5) CW5 Special Forces Warrant Officers:
(a) Should complete the WOSSC not later than one year after promotion to CW5.

138

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(b) Should serve in any of the following assignments: Group Operations or Group Intelligence warrant officer and
senior warrant officer advisor in a Special Forces Group; chief warrant officer of the branch in the Directorate of
Special Operations Proponency; Strength Manager at the U.S. Army Special Operations Command; or the Command
Chief Warrant Officer for the U.S. Army Special Forces Command. Instructor or doctrine developer in the Special
Warfare Center and School; operations, targeting or plans staff officer at the USASFC(A), USASOC, USSOCOM,
TSOC, and other Army and Joint assignments as required.
c. Functional area and immaterial "generalist" assignments. Special Forces branch officers who remain in the
Operations career field above the grade of CPT will have increasing opportunities to serve in branch/FA generalist
assignments, such as IGs and instructors. Officers are provided opportunities to work in FAs while remaining in the
Operations career field, in the same manner as do other Operations career field basic branches.
d. Joint assignments. Special Forces officers and warrant officers should expect to be considered for Joint duty
assignments, and should strive to serve in these critical positions. Due to the inherent Joint nature of Special Forces
operations, SF branch has the highest density of Joint Duty Assignment List positions of any of the combat arms. SF
officers are utilized in Joint organizations worldwide. Joint experience is important to the Army and essential to
individual officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions.
e. Combined assignments. Special Forces officers/warrant officers can expect to be considered for duty as commanders or staff officers of combined commands at a rate that equals or exceeds that of the other combat arms.
Experience in combined commands provides serious professional development to individual officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions.
15–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. Regional expertise results from language training and the initial Special Forces group assignment.
The goal of SF officer professional development is to produce and sustain highly qualified, regionally oriented officers
to lead our forces in combat, and HRC will assign officers to further this goal.
b. Precedence.
(1) Special Forces officers’ assignments to developmental leadership positions have precedence. Typically, Special
Forces branch officers should seek assignments in the following order:
(a) Command of an SFOD–A. This command will be the officer’s first assignment after completion of Special
Forces training.
(b) Battalion staff (as an S1, S4 or assistant S3 at battalion or group level) or company command in a CPT company
command billet, SFOD–B XO, or designated specialty ODA.
(c) Service at the USAJFKSWCS, USASOC, USASFC, a combat training center, or in a generalist/branch immaterial or FA billet.
(d) The Advanced Military Studies Program (preceded by ILE) or the Special Operations/ Low Intensity Conflict
Course.
(e) Command and General Staff Officer Course ILE or equivalent MEL4 program.
(f) Command of a Special Forces company, battalion S3 or executive officer, group S3 or GSC commander, and/or
other designated branch critical assignment.
(g) Joint assignment.
(h) Battalion level (CSL) command or senior level SOF developmental position.
(i) Senior Service College.
(j) Group level (CSL) command or senior executive level SOF position.
(2) Special Forces WO assignments to SFOD–A positions have precedence. This assignment will be the officer’s
first assignment after completion of the Special Forces Warrant Officer Basic Course. Special Forces Warrant Officers
should serve as either the Commander or the Assistant Detachment Commander of a SFOD–A/B for a cumulative
period of 5 years. The branch objective at the SFOD–A level is to provide the operational force with the highest
possible quality leadership in order to provide valuable advice and execute tactical missions in support of combatant
command operational objectives and requirements. Initial assignment at the detachment provides the fundamental
experience needed to establish subject matter expertise in SOF skills and missions in the unilateral, Joint, combined
and interagency environments. It also provides a common base of experience, professional development, and opportunities by which to develop and evaluate SF warrant officers for future requirements. Other assignments Special Forces
warrant officers should seek as they are promoted through the ranks:
(a) Company (SFOD–B) operations WO.
(b) Special Operations/ Low Intensity Conflict Course.
(c) Service at USAJFKSWCS, USASFC(A), USASOC, Joint assignment, or a combat training center.
(d) Battalion operations WO.
(e) Group operations or intelligence WO.
(f) Group through strategic level Joint Plans Officer
(g) Joint Operations Officer

(h) Special Activities Officer
(i) Theater Desk Officer
(j) Special Operations Liaison Officer
(k) Training Officer
(l) Instructor/Writer
(m) TAC Officer
15–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Special Forces desired branch experience. The goal is for all SF CPTs and majors to serve for 24 months in
critical branch positions, with an absolute minimum of 18 months for purposes of establishing branch qualification. All
CPTs will serve in an Operational Group. Majors will serve in an operational group, training group, or other
specifically designated position.
b. Special Forces branch life cycle. Figure 15–1 displays an Active Army SF branch life cycle.
c. Special Forces WO life cycle. Special Forces warrant officers should serve a minimum of 5 years on a SFOD–A.
Figure 15–2 displays the SF WO life cycle.

15–6. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Special Forces
a. Structure. Special Forces structure is somewhat different from that of the other combat arms because of its high
officer content and absence of LTs. Its structure will continue to reflect those characteristics for the foreseeable future.
b. Acquisition. Special Forces is a non–accession branch. The USAREC recruits SF volunteers. Officers are
accessed upon selection for promotion to CPT and normally complete all training and reach their 1st operational
assignment 2 years later. Over 300 officers typically apply each year, of these approximately 105 successfully graduate
SFQC and branch transfer into Special Forces. The accessions window for applicants is the SF Officer Accessions
Board, which is conducted following completion of the Captain’s promotion board. The goal for all CPTs is to
graduate SFQC between 5 to 7 years in service in order to serve in SF assignments and obtain professional
development in CF18 prior to consideration for promotion to MAJ. Captain requirements are validated in an annual
mission requirement letter from CG, USAJFKSWCS to DA G1.
(1) Special Forces training prerequisites. Officers applying for selection for Special Forces training must meet the
following prerequisites:
(a) Be a male volunteer for Special Forces training in accordance with DA Pam 351–4, U.S. Army Formal Schools
Catalog.
(b) Be in their third year of active federal commissioned service (AFCS) when the Special Forces accession board
meets (Active Army only).
(c) Be selected for promotion to CPT (Active Army only).
(d) Have enough time remaining as a CPT to complete Special Forces training and serve 3 years in a special forces
unit before DA centralized selection board consideration in the primary zone for promotion to MAJ. This is in order to
permit completion of the key leader development assignments prior to selection for MAJ.
(e) Be airborne qualified or volunteer for airborne training.
(f) Have passed the Army Physical Fitness Test, in the 17 to 21 year old age category, with a minimum of 229
points overall and passing in each event.
(g) Be able to swim 50 meters unassisted while wearing combat boots and the battle dress uniform (BDU).
(h) Have scored at least 85 on the Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) or met USAJFKSWCS language
school graduation standards on the Defense Language Proficiency Test in a Special Forces required language (other
than English).
(i) Have met the medical standards for Special Forces training per AR 40–501.
(j) Be eligible for a Top Secret security clearance.
(k) Be a CCC graduate by the time of enrollment in the SFQC. (Reserve Component officers should also attend the
CCC prior to SFQC, but individual waivers may be granted.) Normally, officers will attend the Special Forces
Assessment and Selection (SFAS) course prior to CCC attendance.
(2) Branch transfer policies.
(a) Although Special Forces Branch controls volunteers throughout their SF training, they remain members of their
basic branches of assignment during training. The training pipeline begins with TDY attendance of SFAS, which is the
first phase of Special Forces qualification, and must be successfully completed in order to continue on to subsequent
phases. The training pipeline ends with the assignment of an officer to his first operational unit. HRC branch transfers
officers to Special Forces upon successful completion of the SFQC (which includes language and SERE training). SF
officer training is a single entity comprising Special Forces Assessment and Selection (SFAS) and SFQC with a single
active duty service obligation. Officers failing to achieve SFAS and SFQC course standards will not be SF qualified
and will be returned to their initial branches of assignment.
(b) Officers who completed Special Forces training as enlisted soldiers must still successfully complete SFQC prior
to branch transfer to Special Forces, but will normally not attend SFAS.
(c) Active Army and RC Special Forces qualification training requirements are identical. Officers who successfully
complete the active component 18A SFQC as reservists do not have to repeat SFQC training if accessed into the
Active Army.
(d) The CG, USAJFKSWCS, is the final waiver authority for course prerequisites as well as SF qualification and
branch transfer requirements. All requests for waivers should be addressed to the CG, USAJFKSWCS, ATTN:
AOJK–SP, Fort Bragg, NC 28310–5200.
(3) Special Forces WOs are accessed from within Special Forces. The chief WO of the 180A branch will publish
recruitment guidance each FY. The MOS requires a minimum of 52 new candidates a year. The primary recruiters for
new accessions are warrant officers; accessions are routed through the commanders in their Special Forces Group. The
Special Forces WO candidate must:
(a) Be serving as a SSG (E–6) or above and possess a CMF 18 MOS.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

143

(b) Be a graduate of the Special Forces Intelligence Sergeants Course (18F).
(c) Have a minimum of 3 years experience at the SFOD–A level.
(d) Present a current DA Form 330 (Language Proficiency Questionnaire) with at least a 1+/1+ language proficiency
score or possess a minimum score of 85 on the Defense Language Aptitude Battery.
(e) Meet the medical fitness standards for SF duty, the SERE level "C" course according to AR 15–7 and include a
SF WO candidate medical screening memorandum to be completed by the applicant’s surgeon.
(f) Have passed the Army Physical Fitness Test with at least 80% in each event for the individual’s age group.
(g) Possess at least a secret security clearance and be eligible for a Top Secret security clearance.
(h) Receive letters of recommendation from the group senior WO, company, battalion, and group commanders.
(i) Be less than 36 years of age.
c. Distribution. Careful management is required to ensure the optimum numbers of SF officers are designated into
the other than operations career fields. This number must balance the need to retain sufficient experienced officers in
the branch with the need to keep the inventory of majors at the appropriate level to provide them adequate opportunity
for requisite professional development. Every effort will be made to provide opportunities for SF officers to compete
for designation into desired other–than–operations FAs career fields.
d. Deployment. Special Forces officers must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at
all times. Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA organizations, all
Special Forces officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. Special Forces
officers may deploy on short notice with their units to conduct combat operations, deter potential adversaries, and to
protect national interests, or as individuals to support Joint and multinational combat operations or operations other
than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping missions. Special Forces officers must prepare themselves and their
families for this most challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustainment. OPMS III changes the manner of execution of 3 major areas affecting officer career development.
(1) Promotion. Following career field designation, SF branch officers will compete for promotion only within the
Operations career field. This eliminates the double counting which occurred previously when officers competed in both
their branch and their FA.
(2) Command. The SF branch LTC and COL commanders will continue to be centrally selected for command. All
SF officer command opportunities are in the Operations career field. Army–wide these commands are organized into 4
functional categories: tactical, training and strategic support, institutional, and TRADOC System Managers. Officers
are selected for TDA command based upon an overall manner of performance comparable to that of officers selected
for TOE command. Officers have the option of selecting the category or categories in which they desire to compete for
command, while declining competition in other categories. The results of the command selection process are announced in the Command Selection List (CSL). The SF personnel proponent at the USAJFKSWCS closely monitors
the number of commands available to SF officers in order to achieve branch professional development on par with that
of the other combat arms branches. A special DA board fills selected SMU commands. Officers are selected to
command SMUs generally in lieu of CSL commands, not as a second command. Selected SMU positions are
designated as second commands.
(3) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS 3.
Starting with CPT, the rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the career field which best suits his
abilities and interests. SF raters and senior raters thus perform a critical function that helps ensure quality officers are
designated into both the Operations and other-than-Operations career fields.
(4) Development. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in TOE units with troops, staff/TDA billets, Joint and coalition assignments, and institutional training positions.
Self-development continues to be an essential component of officer development. The goal is to professionally develop
officers to expertly conduct Special Forces operations in support of the Combatant Commanders. Development occurs
through the Army school system as well, with all officers selected for MAJ completing some form of resident Military
Education Level (MEL) 4 training, in accordance with OPMS 3 and Operations career field guidelines.
(5) Separation. The branch separation process remains the same as for the rest of the Army.
15–7. Special Forces Reserve Component officers and warrant officers
a. General career development. Reserve Component CPT, MAJ, LTC, and COL branch transfer and developmental
requirements are the same as for AC officers. Due to geographical and recruiting realities of the Army National Guard
system, LTs may be assigned to SF companies, volunteer for SFAS and, if selected, attend 18A SFQC, language
training and SERE training. However, they will not be branch transferred to SF until they meet all branch transfer
requirements, such as the Captain’s Career Course.
b. Developmental opportunities. Reserve Component CPT, MAJ, LTC, and COL branch critical and developmental
assignments as well as branch transfer requirements are the same as for AC officers. RC officers may not find a
Special Forces unit with openings at their grade or may be ineligible for promotion until finding a troop unit position at
the proper grade. Reserve Component officers’ civilian careers and other considerations may limit them to serving in
geographically available units. Other options for such officers include duty in the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) with

144

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

possible Individual Mobilization Augmentation (IMA) Program positions or short- tour positions, Active Guard
Reserve (AGR) Program positions, or positions in non-SF units. Some officers may have to branch transfer. An RC
officer may branch transfer several times during his career and may not be able to follow the normal Special Forces
career model.
c. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for Special Forces officers is shown at
Figure 15–3.

Chapter 16
Engineer Branch
16–1. Unique features of the Engineer branch
a. Unique purpose of Engineer branch. The Corps of Engineers provides the Army and the Nation with officers
trained and experienced in providing essential engineer support in many different forms. Engineer officers perform
missions that span the entire military and civil engineering spectrum while serving our Army and Nation in war and
peace. Engineer officers should strive to obtain and excel in the tough assignments; this is the fundamental tenet of
successful career progression in the transforming engineer regiment of the 21st century.
b. Unique functions performed by Engineer Branch. Engineers provide support to maneuver commanders, MACOM
staffs, installations, and the Nation. As Combat Engineers, they execute mobility, countermobility, survivability,
general engineering and topographic missions, Joint duty, Combatant Command staff positions, and possibly the
Emergency Management role in support of FEMA under the Civil Works Program. As construction Engineers, they
manage and control military construction programs for the Army and other DOD agencies as well as directing complex
water, flood control and natural resource development and restoration civil works programs throughout the Nation. As
a WO they provide the Army the necessary technical and tactical expertise to plan organize and supervise the
maintenance and repair of utilities equipment, maintenance support to medical hospitals, and the installation of fixed or
mobile power plants. They also supervise the interior and exterior repair of facilities to include carpentry, masonry,
plumbing, electrical equipment, interface between the engineering and intelligence communities for geospatial engineering issues. They manage geospatial operations and provide geospatial data production/generation, data management, analysis and geospatial services (topographic survey, hardcopy replication and printing, electronic media storage/
replication) support to combat and combat support elements at all echelons.
c. Unique features of work in Engineer Branch.
(1) The area of concentration of the Corps of Engineers is 21Z which encompasses;
(a) Staff positions that do not require another specific area of concentration;
(b) Providing engineer support on the battlefield as a member of the combined arms team;

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

147

(c) Planning, executing and managing construction projects on installations and in the civil works program.
(2) Engineer officers perform many functions that are common throughout the branches, especially as LTs and
junior CPTs. Examples include Engineer troop leading and staff positions, for example, platoon leader, company
commander, battalion staff officer, and so forth. Additionally, Engineers serve as the Engineer advisor/staff officer to
the supported command. As officers gain experience and are promoted, they may serve in senior Engineer positions as
the primary staff officer for all engineer functions. In addition to the combat engineer command and staff positions, the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) districts include Engineer positions, which require a unique blend of tactical
and technical proficiency.
(3) Unique features of work in Engineer WO program.
(a) Utilities Operation and Maintenance Technician (210A). The Engineer Utilities Operation and Maintenance
Technician provides assistance and advice to the commander and staff on matters relative to the following functions/
tasks:
1. Provide technical, administrative, and budgetary recommendations to the commander regarding the repair and
maintenance of power generation equipment.
2. Coordinate and supervise the organizational maintenance of wheeled vehicles, mobile medical equipment, and
Deployable Medical System (DEPMEDS) equipped hospitals.
3. Coordinate and supervise the operation, repair and maintenance of station hospital facilities and utilities.
4. Repair, modify, and rehabilitate utility systems and subsystems, facilities, structures, and power plants in station

11. Instruct engineer skills at service schools.
12. Develop doctrine, organizations and equipment for engineer unique missions.
(b) Geospatial Information Technician (215D) The Engineer Geospatial Information Technician provides assistance
and advice to the commander and staff on matters relative to the following functions/tasks:
1. Acquire, coordinate, interpret, and analyze geospatial information, to include the effects of weather on terrain
related capabilities and limitations of both enemy and friendly forces.
2. Supervise the preparation of Tactical Decision Aids (TDAs) and special purpose graphics.
3. Provide geospatial analysis, a synthesis of geospatial information and recommendations pertinent to the Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB) to theater, corps, division, and brigade commanders.
4. Integrate geospatial information into the military decisionmaking process (MDMP) in support of Army and Joint
operations.
5. Determine mobility (on–road/off–road) based on intelligence information of the capabilities or limitations of
friendly and enemy ground forces and ascertain how this mobility is affected by weather factors.
6. Serve as the technical advisor to the commander and staff providing guidance and management of Geospatial
Engineering activities.
7. Manages the Geospatial data for the Common Topographic Operational Environment (CTOE) for Command,
Control, Communication, Computers, and Information (C4I) systems.
16–2. Officer characteristics
All officers must be physically and mentally fit, maintain and display self-control, remain calm under pressure and
adhere to published standards and regulations. The Engineer branch requires officers who are well grounded in
engineer doctrine; who possess strong Army Values, leader attributes and leader skills. Additionally, there are branch
unique skills, knowledge and attributes that require professional development.
a. Competencies and actions common to all. Army officers must be premier warfighters and possess the Warrior
Ethos and must effectively apply the 4 core dimensions of leadership: values, attributes, skills and actions. (For
additional discussion of these leadership dimensions, see FM 22–100.) The 4 core leadership dimensions provide the
basis for what a leader must be, know and do. The Army Values and attributes set the basis for the character of the
leader - what a leader must be. The Soldiers Creed and skills developed by leaders establish his or her competence what a leader must know. The actions that leaders conduct and execute constitute leadership - what a leader must do.
The leadership framework describes a leader of character and competence who acts to achieve excellence across the
spectrum of operations from total war, to operations other than war, to disaster relief and in times of peace.
(1) Values. Values are at the core of everything the Army is and does. The Army is an institution of people with

148

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

unique and enduring values. These values must be a part of the men and women—officers, enlisted personnel and
civilians—who are the Army. These values provide engineer officers the guiding principles required to lead our
soldiers in combat and help resolve ambiguities in operations other than war. Officers must establish and maintain an
environment in the Army where soldiers and civilians do what is right; where we treat each other as they should be
treated; and, where everyone can be all they can be. There are seven Army Values (LDRSHIP).
(a) Loyalty. Bear true faith and allegiance to the U.S. Constitution, the Army, your unit, and other soldiers.
(b) Duty. Fulfill your obligations.
(c) Respect. Treat people as they should be treated.
(d) Selfless–service. Put the welfare of the Nation, the Army and your subordinates before your own.
(e) Honor. Live up to all the Army Values.
(f) Integrity. Do what’s right, legally and morally.
(g) Personal Courage. Face fear, danger or adversity (physical or moral) with the spirit and determination of a
warfighter.
(2) Leader attributes. Attributes are fundamental qualities and characteristics. Attributes assist in defining what an
officer should be and contribute to leader actions. Army leader attributes are described in 3 categories - mental,
physical and emotional.
(a) Mental attributes describe aptitudes and capacities for learning that leaders should possess and develop. Included
in this category are will, self-discipline, initiative, judgment, confidence, intelligence and cultural awareness.
(b) Physical attributes specify physical dispositions or aptitudes that can be nurtured and developed. Included in this
category are health fitness, physical fitness, stamina, military bearing and professional bearing.
(c) Emotional attributes are those affective aptitudes or capacities that contribute to how one feels and substantially
contribute to leadership. Included in this category are self-control, balance and stability.
(3) Leader skills. Skills are synonymous with competencies. They are abilities or competencies that one develops
and uses with people, with ideas and with things. Competence is of primary importance for all Army officers. The
Army recognizes that officers must develop 4 types of skills.
(a) Interpersonal skills reflect competence in communicating with people.
(b) Conceptual skills refer to competence in handling ideas.
(c) Technical skills reflect competence with things.
(d) Tactical skills refer to the ability to put together technical, interpersonal, and conceptual skills and apply them to
warfighting tasks.
(4) Leader actions. Engineer Officers provide purpose, direction and motivation as they influence their subordinates,
operate to accomplish their mission and strive to improve their unit or organization. Leader actions are how Engineer
Officers act to achieve excellence and get the job done. These actions are applicable across all levels of leadership.
(a) Influencing refers to the use of appropriate people skills to guide subordinates or teams toward mission
accomplishment. Influencing subdivides into communicating, decisionmaking and motivating.
(b) Operating or accomplishing the mission refers to the relative short-term actions of getting the job done.
Operating divides into planning, executing and assessing.
(c) Improving refers to the long–term investment–type actions essential to improving everything the leader influences. Improving subdivides into developing (people), building (teams) and learning.
b. Unique skills. Engineer officers are able to:
(1) Visualize the battlefield and know how to optimize the resources at the commander’s disposal.
(2) Plan and execute engineer missions, both combat and construction, in support of the maneuver commander at all
levels.
c. Unique knowledge. As a branch that is both tactically and technically oriented, Corps of Engineers officers gain
knowledge through a continuous cycle of education, training and experience. In general, Engineer officers:
(1) Understand tactical decisionmaking and the Engineer’s role as a platoon leader, commander and staff officer in a
combined arms or Joint environment.
(2) Understand terrain analysis and how it can increase the effectiveness of the combined arms team.
(3) Understand the design of and are able to manage large construction projects and facilities in support of the Army
and the Nation.
(4) Engineer warrant officers possess a high degree of technical knowledge of Engineer missions, maintenance and
construction operations, prime power operations, and geospatial information support to missions and operations. They
are assessed from specific Engineer enlisted MOSs and bring with them proven learned systems and significant
management attributes. Engineer warrant officers technical expertise is enhanced through continuous education, training, experience and self-development.
d. Unique attributes. Engineer officers display the following personal attributes:
(1) Interpersonal competence. Engineer officers must be skilled in building teamwork within their organization and
recognize they often simultaneously belong to many teams. They must possess the ability to express themselves to their
team members clearly, concisely and accurately, both orally and in writing.
DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

149

(2) Tactical competence. Engineers are part of a combined arms team. Engineer officers must show proficiency in
required professional knowledge, judgment and warfighting. They must apply their doctrinal knowledge and understanding to the solution of tactical problems, and formulate and defend solutions to tactical problems using current
Army and Joint doctrine.
(3) Technical competence. Engineer officers and warrant officers must understand the capabilities of engineer
organizations, equipment and systems. Engineer officers must prepare and present clear and informative briefings
relating to their technical areas of expertise to peers, subordinates and superiors. Additionally, Engineer officers are
accountable stewards of people, time and, in many instances, financial resources and the environment. These skills are
gained and developed through repetitive operational assignments, continuous professional study, self-development and
mentoring.
16–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. Engineer branch officer development assignments.
(1) General. This paragraph represents a career guide by defining those professional development opportunities
available at each grade, which prepare the Engineer officer for further service at the next higher rank. Engineer officers
possess the skills, knowledge, experience and attributes required to perform the basic duties at their current grade and
have the potential for further service at the next higher rank. (Career development model is at figure 16–1)

150

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

Figure 16–1. Engineer officer life cycle development and utilization

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

151

(2) Leader development and command preparation. Professional and leader development prepares the Engineer
officer to lead complex organizations and/or command an engineer platoon, company, battalion or USACE district, and
ultimately a COL-level engineer group, brigade or USACE district command. Command opportunities for the Engineer
officer cover a wide variety of units: heavy mechanized and light divisional combat engineer units; corps combat
engineer and special engineer units such as bridge, port construction and airborne combat engineer organizations;
combat heavy and topographic engineer units; brigade troops battalions; and Engineer Training Center units. Leaders of
these organizations must be well-versed in basic Engineer branch and combat engineer skills.
(3) Assignments. At the completion of a company grade officer’s assignment, Engineer officers will serve in a wide
variety of positions throughout the military, to include branch/combat arms generalist (01A/02A) and FA positions.
Engineer CPTs are encouraged to seek assignments in their preferred area of concentration to prepare for assignments
as field grade officers. Assignment considerations (in priority) are the needs of the Army, required professional
development, and officer preference.
(4) Lieutenant.
(a) Education. All Engineer LTs must successfully complete the Basic Officer Leadership Course (BOLC), Phase III
(proponent institutional training). Special training, for example, Sapper Leader, Airborne, Ranger, and so forth, to
support an officer’s initial assignment may follow this course. All Engineer LTs should have a minimum of 90 credit
hours towards a bachelor’s degree from an accredited university and be able to complete a bachelor’s degree in a year
or less. Officers should devote time to a career long professional reading program to broaden their professional
perspective.
(b) Leader development and command preparation. The focus of effort during the LT years is to acquire, reinforce
and hone troop leading, technical, tactical, logistics, and administrative skills. Inculcation of the Warrior Ethos and
Army core values is essential in the development of young officers. Prior to promotion to CPT, officers must possess
an in–depth knowledge of and combined arms operations gained through on the job training. By law, officers must
obtain a baccalaureate degree before promotion to CPT. The goal of service beginning as a LT is to lead and train
soldiers to be able to win in combat. To properly prepare for future assignments, LTs should seek positions where they
are responsible for leading soldiers and should focus on acquiring and refining troop leading and Engineer branch
specific skills. LTs should gain a thorough knowledge of platoon level operations and a basic knowledge of combined
arms principles, coordination, logistical operations and company administration
(c) Assignments. Engineer LTs will serve in company level positions to gain leadership experience, enhance
technical and tactical competence and, when appropriate, complement this service with staff experience at the battalion
level. Typical duty positions include— Engineer platoon leader, company executive officer, or training officer in
training center units, and battalion staff officer.
(5) Captain.
(a) Military education. Engineer CPTs will attend the Engineer CCC, at about the 4th year of service, which
currently corresponds with promotion to CPT. Attendance at the CCC will be TDY and return, TCS or PCS as fits the
needs of the Army and follow–on assignment. This will prepare the officer for company–level command and duties at
battalion or higher levels. Some Engineer officers may attend another branch’s CCC. The credit earned from attendance
at another branch’s course is the same as having attended the Engineer course. Special training, for example, Sapper
Leader Course, Airborne, Ranger, and so forth, to support an officer’s next assignment, may follow the completion of
the CCC. CPTs must aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience that will qualify them for promotion
to MAJ. The following are considered desired branch experience for Engineer CPTs:
1. Company command.
2. Commander of a CPT–coded detachment command.
(b) Civil education. All officers are required to obtain a baccalaureate degree from an accredited educational
institution prior to being promoted above the grade of 1LT and attending the CCC, in accordance with 10 USC 12205.
The Army has many programs that provide officers the opportunity to earn baccalaureate and advanced degrees fully
funded, full–time or off duty. The Advanced Civil Schooling (ACS) is a fully funded program that supports advanced
degree requirements for certain branches and FAs. Many universities award constructive credits for military courses,
which can facilitate earning an advance degree at an accelerated pace. Additionally, an officer can obtain an advanced
degree at his/her own expense off duty. A full explanation and eligibility requirements for these programs are contained
in AR 621–1.
(c) Leader development and command preparation. CPTs should prepare for and seek company level or certain
types of detachment command. Engineer officers who successfully serve with troops as LTs and have completed the
CCC are basically considered ready for assignments as company or certain types of detachment commanders. The goal
is to allow Engineer officers to serve in company command 18 plus or minus 6 months for continued professional
development and to enhance unit cohesion. Typically, Engineer officers will have the opportunity to serve in an
Engineer position on a battalion or brigade staff to further prepare for command. Officers should possess a thorough

152

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

knowledge of company level operations and knowledge of combined arms principles, coordination, logistical operations, and battalion administrative requirements.
1. Following company command, CPTs can expect to serve in a wide variety of assignments, consistent with the
needs of the Army. These include— observer/controller at one of the Combat Training Centers; small group instructor
at one of the TRADOC schools; Active Army/RC positions; project officer in a USACE district; FA positions; branch/
FA generalist assignments, for example, ROTC instructor, USAREC, and so forth; other nominative assignments, for
example, Allied service school exchange officer, and so forth; or Advanced Civil Schooling (based on FA or overall
Army requirements). CPTs are encouraged to seek those assignments which best meet their personal and professional
desires for future service as field grade officers. Specific training tailored to many of these assignments is available via
distance learning and resident experiential training at the Engineer school.
2. Developmental assignments, both branch–specific and immaterial will provide CPTs with exposure to the Army,
and in some cases, Joint organizations.
3. There is no FA designation point but an officer can submit, via the AHRC Web site, preference for FA. However,
the Army Acquisition Corps will assess a limited number of Engineer Officers between their 7th and 8th years of
service. The formal designation of FAs is based upon the needs of the Army, officer preference, military experience
and, in some cases, Advanced Civil Schooling. Some FAs have extensive educational requirements. Engineer officers
can also be accessed into the Army Acquisition Corps.
(6) Major.
(a) Upon selection to MAJ, an HQDA level board will convene to determine what career field designation is best
suited for each officer. The board considers officer skills and experience, preference and Army requirements. MAJs not
designated to the Operations career field will be nominated to serve in one of the other 3 career fields: Operational
Support, Information Operations, or Institutional Support. Selection into a career field other than operations means that
Engineer Branch will no longer manage the officer. Officers retained in the Operations career field will attend the
resident ILE course. Upon completion of ILE, MAJs must aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience
that will prepare them for duties as a LTC.
(b) Officers will undergo a career field Designation Board (CFDB) upon selection for promotion to MAJ. Officers
will be designated into one of the 4 career fields: Operations, Operational Support, Information Operations or
Institutional Support. After career field designation, officers will serve and compete for promotion only in their
designated career field and will be managed by their branch or FA assignment officers at OPMD.
(c) Engineer MAJs who are designated into the Operations career field should seek assignments in the Engineer
regiment to increase diversity and gain a greater understanding of the entire spectrum of the Engineer branch.
(d) All MAJs must complete ILE schooling (MEL 4/ILE) prior to promotion to LTC. All Engineer MAJs should
continue self-development efforts to become experts in all aspects of Engineering to include Joint and multinational
operations. Self–development should include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training.
1. Completion of ILE and serving successfully in positions of responsibility in branch positions will prepare officers
for LTC. The optimum time for an engineer officer to attend is their last year in the grade of CPT or the 1st year as a
MAJ. This will facilitate their follow–on assignment to a professional developing job as well as a possible appointment
to a 3–year life–cycle unit (which maximizes their developmental potential).
2. Officers who graduate ILE and are not promotable CPTs will not be assigned to engineer–MAJ professional
development assignment. MAJs who attend ILE after their first 2 years in the grade of MAJ, truncate their timeline for
available professional development positions, and, in turn, place themselves at risk for promotion to LTC.
(e) Assignments.
1. Engineer MAJs in the Operations career field can expect to serve in Engineer and/or branch/FA generalist
positions. Engineer positions include assignment to Army/MACOM/Joint Staff, Observer/Controller or Active Army/
RC. Branch/FA generalist assignments can include Army or Joint Staff, Active Army/RC, ROTC, USMA faculty and
staff, USAREC or Inspector General billets. The officer must maximize his skills and experience in order to be placed
in the right assignment and could be returned to the same duty location to enhance cohesion and stability.
2. Professional Developmental Positions. Positions identified as essential for engineer majors to ensure required
professional development in the Operations career field is attained prior to consideration for promotion include the
following:
a. Positions coded for engineer majors in a Brigade Combat Teams or Unit of Employment (UE), which include:
Brigade Engineer (UA/BCT or SUA); Brigade Engineer Planner; TAC CP Engineer; and UE Engineer Plans.
b. Positions in Engineer Battalions and Brigades coded for engineer majors. Brigade S3; Battalion XO; and
Battalion S3
c. Positions in separate Brigades or units coded for engineer majors such as Special Forces Group Engineer; Ranger
Regiment Engineer; Cavalry Regimental Engineer; and Stryker Brigade Engineer.
d. Battalion S3 or Battalion XO in units coded branch immaterial (such as the BTB or STB)
3. The number of positions available for officers to serve in a MTOE unit enables a greater number of engineer
officers to serve in positions with operational experience. While the 7–deputy district engineer positions in USACE are

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

153

challenging, rewarding, and excellent developmental positions for future USACE commanders, these TDA positions
should be filled by officers who have successfully served in one of the positions listed above.
4. Self–development. MAJs must exercise continuous self-development to fully master all aspects of operations
including Joint and multinational operations. Self-development may include correspondence courses, civilian education,
and institutional training. Officers must devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their warfighting
perspective.
(f) As stated earlier, skills and experience will drive an officer’s career path and future assignments (see fig 16–1).
(7) LTC
(a) Education. Officers should continue their self–development in all facets of combat, construction and facilities
engineering particularly in Joint and Multinational Operations. If selected by a HQDA board, Engineer LTCs should
complete resident Senior Service College (SSC) instruction or the non-resident U.S. Army War College Distance
Education Course.
(b) Leader development and command preparation. Leader development for LTCs is accomplished through the
assignment process and self-development. Engineer LTCs should continue to pursue opportunities for self-development
through professional, technical leadership programs. Selection for LTC level command is extremely competitive. All
Engineer promotable MAJs and LTCs are eligible to compete for LTC level command during the Combat Arms
Command Selection Board. Selection is based primarily on the officer’s experience, qualifications, and overall
performance. A centralized selection board will select officers in a given category based on HQDA guidance. The
AHRC will slate officers to specific units within the categories. Officers being considered for command are allowed to
select the categories in which they desire to compete. The HQDA Command Selection List (CSL) designates
commands into 3 functional categories:
1. Tactical. This includes TOE engineer battalions throughout the Army as well as brigade troops battalions within
transformed brigade combat teams. The majority of Engineer LTC commands are in this category.
2. Training and Strategic Support. The TRADOC engineer battalions and LTC USACE engineer districts are in this
category.
3. Institutional. Garrison command and USAREC battalion commands are in this category. Engineer officers
compete with all combat arms officers considered in this category.
(c) Assignments. Officers selected for LTC must seek assignments of greater responsibility in the branch and serve
in Engineer Branch immaterial positions throughout the Army. The objective in LTC assignments is to give officers the
opportunity to make a greater contribution to the branch and the Army. The objective of LTC assignments is for
officers to continue to provide a valuable contribution to the branch, Army, and our Nation based on their unique
experiences and qualifications. Officers desiring to contribute in the tactical arena should focus on positions such as
brigade executive officers, Combat Training Center (CTC) trainers, Brigade Troops Battalions in the Transformed
Brigade Combat Teams and staff officers at Corps/Division/MACOM level and on the Army/DOD/Joint staffs.
Likewise, those officers desiring to contribute in the facilities/construction management arena should focus on positions
as deputy district commander, deputy director of civil works or military programs at HQ USACE, or as a primary staff
Engineer on the MACOM/HQDA/Joint staff. Additionally, officers will have the opportunity to continue to contribute
by serving in any of a myriad of key branch immaterial/FA positions at service schools, as ROTC Professors of
Military Science, in Active Army/RC support positions, and at senior level staff Engineer positions throughout the
Army and DOD. Completion of a 2-year assignment in a specific assignment is preferred.
(8) Colonel
(a) Education. Officers should complete SSC (MEL1), either resident or non-resident.
(b) Leader development and command preparation. Selection for COL level command is extremely competitive.
Engineer promotable LTCs and COLs with less than 27 years of active federal commissioned service are eligible to
compete for COL-level command during the Combat Support Arms Command Selection Board. The HQDA CSL
designates commands into 4 functional categories: Tactical, Training and Strategic Support, Institutional, and
TRADOC System Manager. Selection is based primarily on the officer’s experience, qualifications, overall performance. Officers being considered for command are allowed to select to compete or decline consideration in each
category. Officers should continue to pursue self-development through professional, technical, managerial and leadership programs and assignment opportunities.
(c) Assignments. The Engineer COL is the architect of the future. Engineer COLs contribute to the branch by
serving in critical assignments to include the following: Directors at the Engineer School or USACE, and executive
level positions on corps, division, MACOM, Joint, DOD and Army staffs. Engineer colonels can also expect to serve in
key Engineer Branch or immaterial positions throughout the Army. The range of possible assignments is vast.
(9) Branch Immaterial/FA generalist assignments. Engineer colonels can expect to serve in branch/FA generalist
assignments, such as IGs and instructors that may or may not be directly related to the Engineer branch, but are
important to the Army.
(10) Joint assignments. Engineer officers are considered for Joint duty assignments worldwide. Joint experience is
important to the Army and is essential to officers for advancement to senior leadership positions.
(11) Other assignments. Engineer officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those discussed

154

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

previously. These assignments include the White House Fellow program and duty with the National Security Council
or the United Nations, as well as Engineer branch representatives at Allied service schools. The spectrum of possible
assignments is broad and is characterized as highly responsible, important and requiring mature, skilled and well–rounded officers.
b. Warrant officer military occupational specialty qualifications, professional development and assignments.
(1) Military occupational specialty qualifications and development MOS qualifications. Engineer warrant officers are
considered certified upon completion of their technical certification course, WOBC, and their developmental assignments. Warrant officers will spend the majority of their junior WO career, serving in TOE operational assignments.
Senior warrant officers can expect to alternate assignments between TOE and TDA based on the needs of the Army.
(a) A Utilities Operation and Maintenance Technician junior WO’s first assignments will likely be in key development positions at TOE, (DEPMEDS) hospital, construction units, and Directorate of Public Works (DPW). Developing
a strong technical understanding of the engineer’s capabilities in support of the force is essential in becoming a subject
matter expert. The expectation is that these junior warrant officers will occasionally serve as leaders and continually
develop their skills prior to assignments at MACOMs. Senior warrant officers should be utilized as Prime Power
Systems Technicians, maintenance team technicians, training developers, combat developers for systems and instructors. Figure 16–3 provides a chart of the TOE/TDA positions.
(b) A Geospatial Information Technician junior WO’s first assignment will likely be in key development positions at
division/corps (including IBCTs) level terrain teams and topographic Engineer companies. Developing a solid technical
understanding of engineer capabilities and military decisionmaking process (MDMP) to provide Geospatial Information
and accurate analysis of the terrain in support of the force is essential in becoming a subject matter expert. The
expectation again is that these junior warrants will serve as leaders and continually develop their skills prior to
assignments at higher echelons and MACOMs. Senior warrant officers should be utilized at Corps topographic
companies, battalions, Echelons Above Corps (EAC) units, and proponent service schools. Figure 16–4 provides a
chart of the TOE/TDA positions.

16–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Engineer branch officer
(1) Preference. Engineer branch has diverse assignment opportunities. Officers should submit preferences that enable
them to achieve their career goals. Officer assignments will be influenced by Army requirements, professional
development and officer preference, for example, Exceptional Family Member Program, Joint domicile, and so forth.
(2) Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, but there is flexibility on

156

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

the sequence of assignments. Typically, Engineer officers should seek assignments in the following order: Engineer
Officer Basic Course, platoon leader, company executive officer or training officer in training units, battalion staff,
CCC, company command, nominative assignment/USACE, (ILE), brigade or division staff, battalion level command,
SSC, and brigade level command.
b. Engineer branch WO
(1) Preference. Engineer warrant officers should seek progressive assignments at all echelons of command within
their respective career field. The professional development goal is to produce and sustain highly qualified technically
and functionally proficient WOs.
(2) Precedence. Junior Engineer warrant officers should be initially assigned to a minimum of 24 to 36 months in
junior positions as annotated in Figure 16–3 and 16–4. The WO should progress through a series of engineering
support missions to gain experience at those levels. Senior warrant officers should be assigned at higher levels (Bn,
Bde, division and EAC) to mentor the junior warrants below them. The intent is for all warrant officers to gain
experience at the lower level prior to assuming the higher position.

16–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
Key Engineer positions. Engineer CPTs serve as company commanders for a minimum of 12 months, while the goal is
to allow them to serve 18 plus or minus 6 months for continued professional development and to enhance unit
cohesion. The OPMS goal is for MAJs to spend 3 years in a unit or district with 2 years spent in a critical job. LTCs
and COLs will serve 2 years in battalion, brigade and COL level district commands have a 36–month length tour
unless DOD directive limit the duration as on the Korean Peninsula. Officers selected for garrison command may have
command tours extended up to 3 years.
a. Engineer branch life cycle. Figure 16–1 depicts the Engineer branch timeline with positions and developmental
assignments.
b. Engineer WO life cycle. Figure 16–2 and 16–3, displays the Engineer WO life cycle model with key developmental positions that will provide leadership opportunities and development of technical competency of each MOS.
16–6. Key Active Army officer life cycle initiatives
The following section provides branch life cycle function and highlights changes associated with implementing Force
Stabilization Initiatives and Transformation.
a. Structure. There will be changes to the authorizations of engineer units based on the restructuring and recoding
initiatives associated with the implementation of OPMS and Force Stabilization. Other minor changes are possible due
to the iterative nature of the restructuring and recoding process.
b. Acquire. Officers will continue to be accessed through USMA, ROTC, and the Officer Candidate School.
Warrants will continue to be recruited from the Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) Corps. Both officer and WO
accessions are based on preference, qualifications and needs of the Army. Because of the lack of branch specific civil
schooling and opportunities for relevant experience, there will be few opportunities for direct commissioning into the
Engineer branch.
c. Distribute. Officers will be provided assignment opportunities to develop the skills and experience base necessary
for service at the next higher grade. The sequencing and timing of assignments is driven by Army priorities. The
Global War on Terrorism and Army Transformation are currently the driving forces behind the distribution of officers.
Force Stabilization will also continue to influence officer distribution. Under Force Stabilization, tour lengths of
assignments will be longer, and officers will have more time to gain the requisite skills in their branch and their
branch/FA generalist assignments. Engineer branch officers designated in another career field will no longer serve in
Engineer branch billets.
(1) Stabilized installation assignments. Officers assigned to stabilized installations will be initial entry officers from
OBC. These officers will be assigned to an installation for approximately 7 years. During this time, the officer will
complete their platoon leader and LT years. They will then proceed to the CPT’s career course and return to the same
installation to complete company command. The officers will gain tactical and operational experience that will benefit
them and the Army in their development in future positions.
(2) Life cycle units. Officers at all levels may be assigned to life cycle units (generally the Stryker Brigade and
Brigade Combat Teams) and will remain in the unit for a minimum of 3 years.
(3) Cyclic units. The majority of the installations and EAD combat and combat support engineer units will be
managed on a cyclic manning system. Replacements will be sent to these units and installations periodically to
maintain readiness of the units. Tour lengths and developmental positions opportunities can vary. Branch detail officers
will remain on standard branch detail timelines.
d. Deploy. Officers are warfighters who must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at
all times. Whether assigned to warfighter centric units or training organizations, readiness is imperative to success of
the mission. Officers must prepare themselves and their families for planned and no notice deployments. In today’s
fast- paced and uncertain operating environment, families must be ready for multiple deployments of unknown
duration. Engineer branch officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA
organizations, all Engineer officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict.
Engineer officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests;
or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping
missions. Engineer branch officers must prepare themselves and their families for this most challenging life cycle
function.
e. Sustain. OPMS changes the manner of execution of 4 major actions that affect officer career development.
(1) Career field designation. Officers will be designated into career fields after selection for promotion to MAJ.
Officers will be designated into one of 4 career fields: Operations, Operational Support, Information Operations and
Institutional Support.

160

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(2) Promotion. Skills and experience, duty performance, and adherence to branch requirements are all factors that
influence promotion. Promotion rates will be determined by Army needs/DOPMA goals.
(3) Command. Commands at battalion and brigade level are organized into 4 functional categories: tactical, training
and strategic support, institutional and TSM (Brigade only). Officers do have the option to compete for selection to the
desired command category and can decline others without prejudice. Officers who are selected for command no longer
have the option to decline without prejudice 30 days after the publication of board results. Since the Command Select
List (CSL) process continues to change, officers should contact branch to receive the latest information. The results of
the command selection process are announced in the CSL. (Note: This subparagraph is not applicable to WOs.)
Engineer branch commanders will continue to be centrally selected for command. All Engineer officer command
opportunities are in the Operations career field. These commands are organized into 3 functional categories for LTCs—
tactical, training and strategic support, and institutional. There are 4 functional categories for COL level command with
the addition of TRADOC System Managers. Officers have the option of selecting the category or categories in which
they desire to compete for command, while declining competition in other categories. The results of the command
selection process are published in the Command Selection List (CSL).
(4) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the link between officer development and OPMS. At CPT,
the immediate rater and senior rater will make a recommendation concerning the officer’s career field. The warrant
evaluation report remains unchanged.
(5) Development. Officer development will occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in
tactical, training and staff assignments. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly perform METL related
function during Joint and combined arms operations. These tasks include, but are not limited to development and
validation of doctrine, training and equipment.
(6) Separation. The officer separation process for Engineer officers remains unchanged. The most current separation
information can be found on the HRC webpage at: https://www.perscomonline.army.mil/tagd/retire/retire.htm.
16–7. Engineer Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. The Engineer RC officer plays an important role in the Corps of Engineers and the
Engineer Regiment at large. The wartime effectiveness of the Engineer is dependent upon the quality of the Engineer
officers in USAR and ARNG units, as well as the IRR. Additionally, the quantity and quality of training that RC
Engineer officers receive prior to mobilization dictates to a large extent their wartime effectiveness. Reserve Component Engineer officer development objectives and qualifications basically parallel those planned for their Active Army
counterparts. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation through assignments in their branch before specialization
begins. Reserve Component life cycle development model for Engineer officers is shown at figure 16–4.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

161

Figure 16–4. Engineer officer life cycle development and utilization (RC)

162

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(1) Even though RC Engineer officers and WOs are limited by geographical considerations, they should strive for
Engineer assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as their Active Army counterparts. Reserve
Component career progression is often constrained by the geographic dispersion of units. There may not be sufficient
positions in a geographic area to continue in Engineer assignments. Therefore, planned rotation into progressively
challenging engineer positions by RC commands is essential to producing the best qualified Engineer officer. To meet
professional development objectives in the USAR, Engineer officers must be willing to rotate between TPU, the IRR
and the individual mobilization augmentee, Joint Reserve Unit (JRU), IRR–Augmentee (IRR–A), and AGR programs.
The ARNG Engineer officers should contact their State personnel officer to ensure they can meet their professional
development objectives. These transfers are necessitated by geographical considerations, as well as the need to provide
as many officers as possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions, or to complete
Professional Military Education (PME) requirements. Transfers within a component will normally be temporary, and
should not be seen as impacting negatively on an officer’s career. The success of an RC Engineer officer is not
measured by length of service in any one component or control group, but by the officer’s breadth of experience, duty
performance and adherence to branch requirements. Officers may elect to apply for an FA beginning at the grade of
CPT. For additional guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7.
(2) Engineer officers and WOs in the IRR may find assignments in reinforcement units (RTU); individual mobilization augmentee positions in Active Army organizations, installations or HQDA agencies; and tours of active duty for
Special Work (ADSW), annual training or Temporary Tour on Active Duty (TTAD). Assignment in the IRR can also
be used for completing PME requirements.
(3) Typical assignments could include—
(a) Engineer TPU or Engineer positions in other than engineer units.
(b) Individual mobilization augmentee program which provides officers the opportunity to train in the positions they
will occupy upon mobilization.
(c) Counterpart training program.
(d) Positions in JRUs.
(e) IRR–A program.
(f) AGR tours where officers serve full-time in support of either the USAR or ARNG. They receive the same
benefits as AC officers, including the opportunity for retirement after 20 years of active federal service.
b. Life cycle development model. Professional development requirements are normally satisfied by attendance at
military schools combined with planned, progressive assignments in engineer units or positions. To be considered a
branch qualified Engineer officer at each grade, the length of service in a given position is not the focus; the key is
assignment diversity and sufficient time served during each assignment to develop branch competence. The following
standards should be met:
(1) Reserve Component development.
(a) Lieutenant.
1. Successfully complete Engineer Officer Basic Course by the end of the 2nd year (USAR) or 18 months (ARNG)
of commissioned service.
2. Obtain a baccalaureate’s degree from an accredited college or university. This is required for promotion to CPT.
3. Serve in leadership and other Engineer assignments, such as staff positions at company and battalion level, for a
minimum of 18–24 months.
4. Actively participate in professional reading programs and continued corresponding studies.
(b) Captain.
1. Successfully complete CCC.
2. Serve in at least 1 Engineer staff position for a minimum of 24 months.
3. Successfully command a company (highly desirable, but not mandatory).
4. CPTs should continue to broaden their understanding of warfighting through CONUS and OCONUS exercises,
enrollment in correspondence courses and other independent study.
5. Currently, RC officers also attend the Combined Armed Services Staff School through a combination of
Advanced Distributed Learning and a 2–week residency piece at Fort Leavenworth, KS. The transformation of
Combined Arms Staff School (CAS3) is now implemented in TASS Battalions as the Combined Arms Exercise
(CAX). CAX is now the educational requirement before entering into the ILE or CGSOC.
(c) Major.
1. Serve a minimum of 24 months in at least 1 Engineer staff position.
2. Even though not a requirement for promotion to LTC, officers are encouraged to obtain a master’s degree from
an accredited college or university.
(d) Lieutenant colonel.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

163

1. Successfully complete ILE within 3 years after promotion to LTC.
2. Serve a minimum of 24 months in at least 1 Engineer staff position.
3. Be selected to attend resident or non–resident Senior Service College (highly desirable, but not mandatory).
4. Successfully command a battalion (highly desirable, but not mandatory).
(e) Colonel. Serve in at least 1 Engineer staff officer position for a minimum of 12 months.
(2) Reserve Component warrant officer military occupational specialty qualification and development.
(a) Military occupational specialty qualification.
1. Basic level qualifications. Warrants, as the branch technical experts, are considered certified upon completion of
the WOBC, and remain so throughout their WO career.
2. Professional development. Focus on acquiring and refining the technical knowledge and experience in effective
management principles in support of the Corps of Engineers. Completion of an associate’s degree in a discipline related
to the Engineer warrant officer’s MOS is a recommended goal.
(b) Qualification and assignment. Qualifications and assignments are similar to the active duty WO (see life cycle
chart for timelines of progression for the RC WO).
c. Education. For further guidance on training participation and credit, see chapter 7.

Chapter 17
Signal Corps Branch
17–1. Unique features of Signal Corps Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Signal Corps Branch. The primary mission of the Signal Corps (Branch 25) is to provide
seamless, secure, continuous, and robust communication and information systems support at all levels of command
from sustaining military bases to forward–deployed fighting forces in support of Army, Joint, combined, and coalition
operations worldwide. The Signal Corps provides an inventory of branch and WOs in the Operations career field with
the aptitude, training, and experience necessary to plan, install, operate, administer, manage, maintain, integrate, and
secure the Army’s strategic, operational and tactical communications infrastructure and voice and data information
systems, services and resources during wartime and peace. Signal Corps officers lead and manage Signal organizations,
forces, and operations that enable globally dispersed, network–centric warfare. Signal WOs provide technical leadership and advice in planning and directing Signal operations. The chief of Signal is the personnel proponent for 2
interrelated officer FAs in the Information Operations career field— Telecommunications Systems Engineering (FA 24)
and Information Systems Management (FA 53). Both are affiliated with the Signal Regiment. The Signal Regiment led
by this team of branch and WOs is the linchpin for the Army’s ability to achieve knowledge dominance in the 21st
century.
b. The Way Ahead. Modern warfare is immensely complex and requires interoperability, synchronization, and
synergy of all systems to achieve national political–military objectives across the full spectrum of operations. To
accomplish these goals, the Signal Regiment is leading the Army in transformation to better support the force in Joint
and expeditionary operations. The regiment is undergoing major transformations in personnel, doctrine, and equipment.
The modularization of Signal elements and changes in doctrine and equipment will create a force that can be tailored to
a Regional combat commander’s needs and fight in an autonomous, nonlinear, noncontiguous battle space that is no
longer tied to a divisional base.
c. Unique features of work in the Signal Corps Branch. Signal Branch and WOs are responsible for the Army’s
communication and information systems and serve as Joint command, control, communications and computers (C4)
systems integrators. From tactical to operational to strategic levels, the ability to process and rapidly exchange
information securely is one of the most critical elements in the effectiveness of today’s modern military force. Every
weapon, command and control, and service support system is increasingly dependent on communications and information systems to function properly and securely. It is the Signal Corps’ responsibility to provide and manage the
communications and information systems support that network the force across a multitude of battlefield platforms and
mission areas. Signal support encompasses all aspects of planning, designing, installing, maintaining and managing
information networks to include communications links, computers, and other components of local and wide area
networks, and it includes the integration of user owned and operated systems into the networks. Signal forces plan,
install, operate and maintain voice and data communications networks that employ single and multichannel satellite
(space–based), tropospheric scatter, terrestrial microwave, switching, messaging, video-teleconferencing, visual information, and other related systems. Signal officers integrate tactical, strategic and sustaining base communications,
information processing and management systems into a seamless global information network that supports Leader
Centric warfare for Army, Joint and coalition operations. In support of tactical operations, the Signal Corps provides a
myriad of state–of–the–art, real time voice and data tactical information systems to provide information services to all
elements on the battlefield and reach–back to the sustaining military base. At the strategic level, the Signal Corps is
responsible for the Army’s portion of the Defense Information System Network and its interface with tactical Signal

164

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

elements at theater and Corps. Together with its Air Force and Navy counterparts, the Signal Corps manages and
directs the Joint operation of the Global Information Grid serving DOD and the National Command Authority. At all
levels, the Signal Corps provides communications and information systems and networks to support the Nation’s forces
across the entire operational spectrum.
d. Officer tasks within the Signal Corps Branch. Signal Corps Branch and WOs encounter unprecedented challenges
that test their tactical and technical abilities. Commensurate with these challenges are tremendous opportunities for
advancement and personal satisfaction. Roles inherent within the Signal Corps at the MTOE level are command,
supervisory, managerial, and technical leadership for the planning, installation, administration, management, maintenance, operation, integration, and securing of communications and information systems. To support the aforementioned
task, the Signal Corps Branch officer works at all levels of command and staff to perform the following functions:
(1) Commands, directs, and controls Signal units.
(2) Within Signal units, serves as platoon leaders, company commanders, supply and maintenance officers, operations officers, executive officers, other staff officers, and battalion/brigade commanders.
(3) Within maneuver units, such as brigade combat teams, serves with their combat arms counterparts as Signal
platoon leaders, Signal company commanders, and as principle coordinating staff (S6) and technical advisors to the
commander.
(4) Plans, coordinates, and supervises the training, administration, management, operation, supply, maintenance,
transportation, information assurance activities, and allocation of resources for units and facilities in support of Army,
Joint, combined, and coalition operations worldwide.
(5) Provides detailed technical direction and advice to commanders, staffs and other command, control, communications and computer users (C4) at all echelons.
e. Assignment opportunities other than MTOE within the Signal Corps Branch. To support the aforementioned tasks,
the Signal Corps officer works at all levels of command and staff to perform the following functions.
(1) Commands, directs, and controls Signal units.
(2) At MACOM, DA), and DOD levels, serve as staff and as Joint duty officers in support of Army, Joint, and
combined, and coalition tactical, theater, strategic or sustaining base operations.
(3) Develops doctrine, organizations and equipment for the signal mission area. Serve as instructors, combat
developers, and training developers at the Signal Center, other branch schools, and combat training centers.
(4) Serves as instructors at precommissioning programs, military academies, service Signal schools and service
colleges.
(5) Performs duties as Signal Corps advisors to both the USAR and ARNG organizations.
(6) Plans, coordinates, and supervises the training, administration, management, operation, supply, maintenance,
transportation, information assurance activities and allocation of resources for units and facilities in support of Army,
Joint, combined, and coalition operations worldwide.
17–2. Officer characteristics required
a. Unique skills.
(1) Decisionmaking skills. Signal officers must be well–grounded in troop leading skills as well as managerial and
technical skills.
(2) Tactical, technical, and systems integration skills. Signal officers must also have an understanding of Army,
Joint, combined, and coalition information system networks and how to provide connectivity between different
information systems (other services) securely. To help in this understanding, many Signal officers obtain additional
degrees in some type of information related discipline. Signal officers must be technically proficient with branch and
mission unique equipment, tools and systems. Signal mission success requires the proper balance between technical
skills and the ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactical skills. These skills must be gained and developed
through repetitive operational assignments and continuous professional study and self-development.
b. Unique knowledge.
(1) Signal officers must aggressively pursue knowledge about existing and future information systems and technology. Additionally, all Signal officers should strive both on and off duty to learn as much as possible about technology
management, telecommunications, automation and the Global Information Infrastructure.
(2) Signal officers must possess expert knowledge of Army, Joint, combined, and coalition signal support and
coordination principles. This knowledge includes practical experience in tactics, combined arms operations and the
employment of direct and indirect fire weapon systems.
(3) Signal officers gain this knowledge through a logical sequence of continuous education, training, and experience,
sustained by mentoring.
(4) Individual officers sustain knowledge through institutional training and education, duty in operational assignments, training with industry and continuous self–development.
17–3. Signal Branch officer developmental assignments.
a. Branch development. Signal Corps LTs will be considered to have fully developed Signal Corps skills and
DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

165

experience as a LT after serving 24 months as a platoon leader, company executive officer, or battalion primary staff
officer.
(1) Lieutenant.
(a) After completing BOLC II and III, LTs are normally assigned to signal companies to gain troop leading
experience and to enhance technical and tactical competence. The focus of effort during the LT years is to acquire,
reinforce and hone troop leading, technical, tactical, logistics, and administrative skills. Inculcation of the Warrior
Ethos and Army core values is essential in the development of young officers. Prior to promotion to CPT, officers must
possess an in–depth knowledge of combined arms operations gained through on the job training. By law, officers must
obtain a baccalaureate degree before promotion to CPT. 2LTs entering life cycle units will stay for the unit’s life cycle
and may be CPTs in LT positions for a short period at the end of unit life cycle. Assignments will be based on needs
of the Army, professional development requirements, and officer’s preferences.
(b) LTs should expect to serve in company level positions to develop leadership, signal skills and, when appropriate,
to complement this with staff experience at battalion level. Typical duty positions include platoon leader, company
executive officer, and signal battalion staff officer.
(c) The focus during this phase should be on acquiring and refining troop leading, coordination, logistics, technical
and administrative skills, as well as the branch unique technical skills required to plan, install, operate, and maintain
signal equipment and systems. In addition to branch unique tasks, Signal LTs should also become proficient in
common core tasks. Before promotion to CPT, officers should possess knowledge of the Signal Branch combined arms
principles. This includes practical experience in signal activities and missions, and in tactics and combined arms
operations.
(d) The Signal Corps Branch detail program is an important part of Signal Corps officer accession. This critical
program brings officers, detailed from the Signal Corps to branches with large LT requirements, back to the Signal
Corps at various stages of the LT years and as late as promotion to CPT. Upon return to the Signal Corps, branch
detailed officers must attend the Signal Branch Qualification (SBQ) Course and should obtain one year of experience
in an operational signal assignment before being considered to have developed sufficient skills and experience as a
Signal officer. After completing SBQ, detailed officers are developed in the same manner as their non-detailed
counterparts. Typical developmental assignments may include—
1. Platoon leader.
2. Company executive officer.
3. Signal battalion staff.
4. S6, non–signal battalion.
(2) Captain.
(a) Officers generally attend the CCC at their 4th year of service that currently corresponds with promotion to CPT.
The CCC will be TDY and return, TCS or PCS as fits the needs of the Army and follow–on assignment. CPTs must
aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience that will qualify them for promotion to MAJ.
(b) At the grade of CPT, there are 2 key developmental assignments— company/detachment command and battalion
S6 within a brigade combat team, a supporting brigade, a functional supporting brigade or an equivalent unit. CPTs
should aggressively prepare for and seek company/detachment level command or service in a battalion S6 position to
further their understanding of tactics and Signal operations. Other developmental positions include principle staff
officer within a Signal battalion or brigade, and Signal staff officer within a UEx and UEy G6.
(c) CPTs can also expect assignments consistent with the needs of the Army. These include—
1. Branch/FA generalist positions (for example, USAREC staff, ROTC instructor, USMA faculty and staff or Active
Army/RC duty), Signal school instructors, and combat training center (CTC) observer controller/evaluators (OC/Es).
Selected officers may participate in the Project Warrior Program; 2 years as an OC/E followed by 2 years as Signal
school instructor.
2. Functional area positions.
3. Advanced civil schooling (based on branch, FA or overall Army requirements).
4. Training With Industry
(d) CPTs should continue to gain an in–depth understanding of combined arms operations and become proficient in
both the Signal Branch and common core tasks. These tasks provide the foundation of knowledge required to
effectively serve in the branch as a leader at the company and battalion level in all aspects of Signal operations and in
leading Signal soldiers. CPTs gain a working knowledge of command principles, battalion level staff operations, and
combined arms and signal operations at the battalion to brigade levels.
(e) CPTs may request to serve in an FA at any time between their 5th and 10th year of service. Officers may submit
such a preference online via the HRC Web site, or contact the FA assignments officer at HRC about training and
utilization as a FA. The formal designation of FA is based upon the needs of the Army, officer preference, military
experience and civilian schooling. The chief of Signal is the personnel proponent for FA 24 (Telecommunications
Systems Engineering) and FA 53 (Information Systems Management) (see chaps 38 and 43, respectively).
(f) Typical CPT developmental assignments include—

(3) Major.
(a) Upon selection to MAJ, an HQDA level board will convene to determine what career field designation is best
suited for each officer. The board considers officer skills and experience, preference and Army requirements. MAJs not
designated to the Operations career field will be nominated to serve in 1 of the other 3 career fields— Operational
Support, Information Operations, or Institutional Support. Selection into a career field other than operations means that
the officer will no longer be managed by branch. Officers retained in the Operations career field will attend the resident
ILE course. Upon completion of ILE, MAJs must aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience that will
prepare them for duties as an LTC.
(b) To be competitive for LTC and battalion command or G6, all MAJs must complete Command and Staff College
(CSC)/ILE and successfully serve in 1 or more of the following critical positions.
1. Brigade/group/regimental/DIVARTY/DISCOM Signal officer (S6).
2. Assistant theater Signal officer.
3. Battalion or brigade executive officer.
4. Battalion or brigade operations officer (S3).
5. MAJ (O–4) level command.

(4) Typical assignments include—
(a) Personal Proponent Manager
(b) Regimental Chief Warrant Officer
(c) Tactical Operations Network Technician
(d) Theater Operations Network Advisor
(e) Theater Information Systems Advisor
17–5. Signal Branch officer preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. Signal MAJs should strive to serve in both Army and Joint assignments such as the Joint Staff,
Unified Command staff, Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
Selected MAJs may be required to serve in a Joint position or branch/FA generalist assignment. To enhance competitiveness for battalion and brigade command selection, Signal Majors should seek battalion XO and S3 or Major level
company command experience. To enhance competitiveness for UEx and UEy G6 selection, Majors should seek
brigade combat team/supporting brigade/functional supporting brigade or equivalent G6 experience. LTCs and COLs
should expect to alternate between command and MACOM/Joint/DOD/multinational staff assignments. Under OPMS
III, some technically qualified LTCs not selected for command may be allowed to crossover to another career field if
the transfer fills a valid Army need. Crossovers to other career fields will be minimal.
b. Precedence. It is crucial that officers receive an opportunity for company grade development with troops.
Typically, this will be platoon leader time followed by battalion staff and/or battalion Signal officer (S6) for a tactical
combat/combat support/combat service support battalion, or company/detachment command. At the field grade level,
these positions are command, battalion/brigade S3, executive officer, brigade S6, deputy G6, before battalion command
and G6 before brigade command.
17–6. Signal warrant officer preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. Preferably, a Signal WO1 should serve a minimum of 24 months in a basic level MOS assignment.
Under ATLDP–WO, warrant officers will be assigned by grade. Warrant officers assigned to senior positions should
receive training commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of that position prior to arriving at the assignment.
b. Precedence. It is crucial WO Assignment Oriented Training (AOT) requirements are evaluated once they have
been selected for assignment. The rapidly increasing complexity of networks, communications and data systems
coupled with the dynamic changes to the Army as we continue to transform to the Objective Force present a unique
challenge to Signal Corps warrant officers. Providing Signal Corps warrant officers the ability to update their network,
communications and information systems skills knowledge’s and abilities through timely AOT opportunities based on
the requirements of their next assignment is crucial in this environment.

172

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

17–7. Signal Branch officer critical life cycle assignments
a. Key Signal Corps positions. Company level command, battalion and brigade XO and S3, special operations
forces/regimental Signal officer, separate and maneuver brigade Signal officer (S6), field grade command, and deputy
division Signal officer (deputy G6) are the preferred positions. What is new under OPMS is the greater amount of time
officers will spend in these jobs. It is expected that these officers will remain on station for 3 years.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

17–9. Signal officer requirements, authorizations, and inventory.
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for Signal officers.
(1) Signal Branch officers. To do this the field grade inventory must be optimized in order to meet branch
authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support branch/FA generalist positions, and to provide MAJs with
stabilization for 3 years.
(2) Signal warrant officer. To do this the field must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations to provide
sufficient flexibility to support warrant positions and provide AOT opportunities with each new assignment.
b. OPMS/WOPMS implementation. The numbers of authorized Signal billets, by grade, will vary as force structure
decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more information on the Signal Corps
branch authorizations or inventory are encouraged to contact the personnel proponent office at Fort Gordon (Office
Chief of Signal) or their assignment officer at AHRC.
17–10. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Signal Corps
a. Structure. The regiment is undergoing major transformations in personnel, doctrine and equipment. The
modularization of signal elements and changes in doctrine and equipment will create a force that can be tailored to a
Regional Combat Commander’s (RCC) needs and fight in an autonomous, nonlinear, noncontiguous battle space that is
no longer tied to a divisional base.
b. Acquire.
(1) Signal Branch officers are acquired as accessions from the U.S. Military Academy, ROTC or Officer Candidate
School. ROTC is the primary commissioning source for Signal officers. While the Signal Corps remains open to all
disciplines, the increasing demand of information technology requires more officers with technical degrees. Additionally, the Signal Corps is a donor branch to the branch detail program. This results in some Signal LTs working in another
branch (primarily combat arms) for a 2–3 year detail, depending on duty location, before returning to Signal branch for
training and assignment.
(2) Signal warrant officers are accessed from the Enlisted Corps. Outstanding NCOs who meet the minimum
prerequisites are prime candidates for accession into Signal WO specialties.
c. Distribute.
(1) Stabilized installation assignments.
(a) Officers assigned to stabilized installations will be initial entry officers from OBC/WOBC. These officers will be
assigned to an installation for approximately 3–7 years.
1. The branch officers will complete their platoon leader and LT years during this time. They will then proceed to
the CCC and return to the same installation to complete company command. The officers will gain tactical and
operational experience that will benefit them and the Army in their development in future positions.
2. The WO will complete their basic level MOS qualification during this time. They will be eligible to attend the
WOAC upon promotion to CW2 and will proceed to WOAC and return to the same unit in the 4th or 5th year of WO
service.
(b) Officers at all levels may be assigned to life cycle units (generally the Stryker Brigade and Brigade Combat
Teams) and will remain in the unit for a minimum of 3 years. Branch detail officers will remain in their detail branch
until after completion of the assignment to the BCT.
(c) The majority of the installations and EAD CS and CSS units will be managed on a cyclic manning system.
Replacements will be sent to these units and installations periodically to maintain readiness of the units. Tour lengths
and developmental positions opportunities can vary. Branch detail officers will remain on standard branch detail
timelines.
(2) Warrant officers assignments are by grade as follows: WO1/CW2 warrant officers will be assigned to positions
coded W2; CW3 warrant officers will be assigned to positions coded W3; CW4 warrant Officers will be assigned to
positions coded W4 and CW5 warrant officers will be assigned to positions coded CW5. Warrant officers who are
assigned to assignments at a higher grade band will attend the appropriate assignment oriented training en route to the
assignment, that is, a CW2 assigned to a position coded CW3 will attend the appropriate WOAC.
d. Deploy. Signal officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at
all times. Whether assigned to TOE units or TDA organizations, all Signal Corps officers must be deployable to
accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. Signal officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter
potential adversaries and to protect national interests; or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations
other than war such as humanitarian and peacekeeping missions. Signal officers must prepare themselves and their
families for this most challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustain.
(1) OPMS changes the manner of execution of 3 major actions that affect branch officer career development.
(a) The institution of career field based promotion boards is a significant and fundamental change. Signal branch

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

177

officers will compete for promotion only within the Operations career field, eliminating the double counting which
occurred previously when officers competed in both their branch and their FA. Additionally, the percentage of
below–the–zone promotions will decrease and officers will be eligible for below–the–zone promotion 1 time for each
grade.
(b) Signal Corps commanders (battalion and higher) and G6s will be centrally selected. All field grade command
and G6 opportunities are in the Operations career field; therefore, officers in any of the other career fields are not
eligible to compete for these positions. Commands are organized into 5 functional categories. Tactical, G6 division/
UEx staff, Training and Strategic Support, Institutional, and TRADOC System Manager. Officers have the option of
selecting the category or categories in which they desire to compete for command, while declining competition in other
categories.
(c) The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS. Starting with CPT, the rater and
senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the career field which best suits his or her abilities and interests.
(2) WO1s will be promoted to CW2 after 2 years in grade on the recommendation of the first LTC (O–5) in the
chain of command. All other WOs (CW2 through CW5), will normally be considered for promotion to the next higher
grade by a DA promotion board, first below–the–zone after 3 years in grade and then in–the–zone after 4 years in
grade. DA publishes zones of consideration prior to each promotion board.
f. Develop.
(1) The development of Signal Corps officers is a combination of training, education, and experiential assignments
of increasing importance. The development through the company grade years will evolve as the Army transforms.
Functional area requests may take on added significance, especially for those considering leaving the operational track.
For those CPTs who are selected to serve in an FA, their performance becomes increasingly important because it could
be a key factor in their later career field designation into that FA. Under OPMS, an officer may be selected as a junior
CPT, a mid–level CPT or upon selection for promotion to MAJ for career field designation.
(2) Prior to assignment warrant officers assigned to CW3 positions will attend their MOS WOAC; warrant officers
assigned to CW4 positions will attend their MOS WOSC; and warrant officers assigned to CW5 positions will attend
their MOS WOSSC. Warrant officers must complete their formal military education upon selection for promotion, but
not later than 1 year after promotion, to the next higher grade at CW2(P)/CW3 (WOAC, MEL 6), CW3(P)/CW4
(WOSC, MEL 4) and CW4(P)/CW5 (WOSSC, MEL 1).
g. Separate. The officer separation process remains unchanged under OPMS III and WOPMS.
17–11. Signal Corps Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. The ARNG and USAR Signal Corps officers serve the same role and mission as
their Active Army counterparts. The unique nature of the RC soldier’s role as a citizen–soldier poses a significant
challenge for professional development. To fulfill its wartime mission of planning, installing, administering, managing,
maintaining, operating, integrating and securing the Army’s strategic, operational and tactical communications infrastructure and voice and data information systems, services and resources in support of wartime and peacetime
operations, the Signal Corps is dependent upon extensive interaction between the Active Army and the RC. The quality
of the Signal Corps officers in the ARNG and USAR Signal Corps units, as well as the Individual Ready Reserve, is
crucial in supporting this mission (see chap 7 for guidance on RC officer development).
b. Reserve Component officer qualification and development.
(1) The Signal Corps officers in the RC have a challenging and complex mission. Inherent with the Signal Corps
mission is command, supervisory, managerial, and technical leadership for the planning, installation, administration,
management, maintenance, operation, integration and securing of communications and information systems in both
fixed and mobile configurations. Reserve Component Signal Corps officers must be tactically and technically proficient
and capable of understanding the scope of a Signal officer’s duties. A requirement for proficiency in both peacetime
and wartime skills is a wide variety of educational opportunities and challenging assignments. Planned rotation into
progressively challenging Signal Corps related positions is essential to producing the best qualified Signal Corps
officers.
(2) Geographic dispersion of units constrains RC career progression. To meet professional development objectives,
RC Signal officers should be willing to rotate between assignments with TPU, ARNG organizations, the IRR, and
individual mobilization augmentee positions. Often there are insufficient numbers of positions in a geographic area to
continue in Signal assignments. If geographic constraints are such that the assignment to a Signal position is not
possible, officers should seek qualification and assignment in another MOS, branch or FA required in the geographic
region.
(3) Both TOE and TDA organizations host RC Signal officer assignments, with the vast majority of positions in
TOE organizations. Their duties and responsibilities are fundamentally the same as their Active Army counterparts
except for those personnel management, administrative and operational requirements unique to the ARNG and USAR.
All RC Signal assignments are open to male and female officers.
(4) Officers may be assigned to IRR when unable to accept a TPU or ARNG unit assignment. Officers in the IRR
may request assignments in Reinforcement Training Units (RTU), IMA positions in Active Army organizations,

178

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

installations or DA agencies, as well as tours of Active Duty for Special Work (ADSW), Annual Training (AT) or
Active Duty for Training (ADT). They may also request ADT assignment to complete their professional military
education (PME) requirements. All RC officers, MAJ and below and CW4 and below with less than 13 years of Active
Federal Service (AFS), may request Active Guard Reserve assignment.
c. Life cycle development model. There are 5 phases of professional development for RC Signal officers (see fig
17–2 for WOs and fig 17–3 for branch officers). The phases relate to military grade and depict broadly based goals and
career opportunities at each grade so that an officer may expand capabilities and optimize performance. The Signal
Corps life cycle development objectives, RC requirements and an officer’s own strengths, priorities, civilian experience, private and Service provided educational attainment and performance influence their professional development
and MOS or branch qualifications.

(1) Reserve Component Branch officer development.
(a) Lieutenant. Newly accessed officers will attend the Signal Officer Basic Course (SOBC) by their 3rd year USAR
or ARNG point of service. Upon graduation, selected officers will proceed to functional training as required by their
1st assignment. Assignments of the majority of Signal officers are made to divisional, and echelons above Corps
(EAC) level signal positions. All officers are encouraged to actively participate in professional reading programs and
continued corresponding studies.
(b) Captain. For promotion consideration to MAJ, a Signal CPT must successfully complete both the branch training
and staff process phases of the Signal CCC. Officers must complete Signal CCC to be competitive for career
progression (see chap 7). Officers are encouraged to pursue a specialty related graduate degree or specialty related
industry certification program. CPTs should serve 24 months in a Signal operations position.
(c) Major. The primary professional development objective of a Signal Corps MAJ in the RC is to continue to
strengthen Signal skills. During this phase, officers must enroll in and complete ILE. Officers are highly encouraged to
pursue a specialty related graduate degree or specialty related industry certification program during these years. MAJs
should serve 24 months in a Signal operations or operational support MAJ position.
(d) Lieutenant colonel. LTCs can expect assignments to senior staff positions in a variety of both branch related and
branch/FA generalist positions in units, training centers, and headquarters elements. State Area Command (STARC) or
Regional Readiness Command (RRC) Designated Position lists identify selected officers for battalion command or their
equivalents during this phase. Due to the limited number of command positions available, STARC and RRC commands
select very few eligible officers. Officers should seek professional military education at the Senior Service College
level. LTCs are eligible for selection to the grade of COL upon completion of the requisite service requirements listed
in chapter 7 of this pamphlet. Officers remain eligible for promotion as long as they continue to serve in an active
status and meet selection criteria. LTCs should serve 24 months in a Signal operations or operations support position.
(e) Colonel. The primary objective for officers during this phase is maximum use of the officer’s technical and
tactical capabilities, managerial skills, and executive skills in positions of higher responsibility. COLs should serve 24
months in a Signal operations or operational support position.
(2) Reserve Component warrant officer qualification and development.
(a) Military occupational specialty qualification.
1. Basic level military occupational specialty qualification.
a. Newly accessed WOs who have not successfully completed a precommissioning course will attend the WOCS,
RA WOCS or Officer Candidate Course (OCS). Reserve Component WO candidates must complete the resident
portion of WOCS, RC WOCS or OCS by their 2nd year point of service. Upon course completion, the candidate is
eligible for appointment to the grade of WO1 but is not yet MOS qualified.
b. Upon completion of WOCS, RC WOCS or OCS newly appointed WOs must complete the proponent MOS
WOBC or RC WOBC to continue serving in the Army as a WO, as WO1 appointments are contingent upon
successfully completing WOBC. WOBC must be completed within 2 years of appointment or an exception to policy
must be requested and approved, otherwise, the WO will be discharged from the service. This course is a requirement
for promotion to CW2. Upon successful completion of WOBC; the WO is awarded a Signal MOS and given an initial
operational assignment.
2. Advanced level military occupational specialty qualification. Warrant officers must attend and complete the
WOAC or RC WOAC at their proponent MOS school. For USAR WOs, successful completion is a requirement for
promotion to CW4.
3. Senior level military occupational specialty qualification. Warrant officers must attend and complete the WOSC
or RC WOSC at their proponent MOS school.
4. Master–level military occupational specialty qualification. Following selection for promotion to CW5, WOs must
attend and complete the WOSSC. Warrant officers must successfully complete WOSSC to be promoted to CW5.

requirements and must spend a certain number of years in the component to be eligible to retire. Soldier must be aware
of regulations pertaining to transfers and their retirement requirements.

Chapter 18
Military Police Branch
18–1. Functions of the Military Police Branch
a. Functions of the Military Police Branch. Military Police Corps officers contribute to battlefield success by
performing combat and combat support operations. Combat operations consist of direct and indirect engagement
against threat forces in contiguous and non–contiguous areas of operation. The Military Police Corps has 5 main
functions— maneuver and mobility support operations, internment and resettlement operations, area security, law
enforcement, and police intelligence operations. Maneuver and mobility support operations assist in expediting the
battlefield movement of combat resources. Internment and resettlement operations involve the evacuation and internment of enemy prisoners of war, detainees, U.S. military prisoners and/or dislocated civilians. Area security operations
protect the force by providing security for critical sites, assets, high–risk personnel, and aggressive anti–terrorism
measures. Law enforcement operations provide for the stability and order within a given area of operation through the
conduct of law enforcement, criminal investigations, customs support, and assisting with dislocated civilian operations.
Police intelligence operations (PIO) supports, enhances, and contributes to the common operational picture and
situational understanding. Police intelligence operations ensures that intelligence developed during the conduct of the
other Military Police functions is provided to the overall intelligence effort. During peacetime, Military Police provide
security to critical Army facilities and resources, provide customs oversight and provide law enforcement and
confinement services.
b. Unique functions performed by the Military Police Branch. Military Police perform 5 functions, which support
the full spectrum of military operations in all environments. These functions and supporting actions performed during
Joint, intergovernmental, and multinational operations are—
(1) Maneuver and mobility support operations (MMSO). The MMSO function involves numerous measures and
actions necessary to support the commander’s freedom of movement in their area of responsibility (AOR). Military
Police expedite the forward and lateral movement of combat resources and ensure commanders get forces, supplies,
and equipment when and where they are needed. Military Police forces maintain the security and viability of the
strategic and tactical Lines of Communication (LOC) to ensure the commander can deploy and employ his forces to
ensure mission success. Military Police also support the commander and help expedite tactical movements by operating
Traffic Control Posts (TCP), defiles, or mobile patrols; erecting temporary route signs on Main Supply Routes (MSRs)
or Alternate Supply Routes (ASRs); or conducting reconnaissance for bypassed or additional routes. As part of the
MMSO function, the Military Police support river-crossing operations, breaching operations, and passage of lines. They
provide straggler control, dislocated civilian operations, MSR regulation and enforcement.
(2) Area security operations. Military Police perform the area security operations (AS) function to protect the force
and enhance the freedom of units to conduct their assigned missions. Providing critical area security, Military Police
play a key role in supporting forces in contiguous and non- contiguous operations. Military Police also are a vital
response force that delays and defeats enemy attempts to disrupt or demoralize military operations throughout the
battlespace. The Military Police mobility makes it possible to detect the threats with aggressive patrolling in the AO,
MSRs, key terrain, and amongst critical assets. Organic communications enables Military Police to advise the
appropriate headquarters, bases, base clusters, and moving units of impending enemy activity. With organic firepower,
Military Police are capable of engaging in decisive combat operations against a Level II threat. Augmented by combat
forces, Military Police are capable of delaying a Level III threat until the commitment of the Tactical Combat Force
(TCF). Military Police countermeasures may include implementing vulnerability assessments, developing procedures to
detect terrorist actions before they occur, hardening likely targets, and conducting offensive operations to destroy the
enemy. Military Police use checkpoints and roadblocks to control the movement of vehicles, personnel, and materiel
and to prevent actions that may aid the enemy. Military Police provide combat power to protect the Command and
Control headquarters, equipment, and services essential for mission success. They provide the maneuver commander
with a light, mobile fighting force that can shoot, move, and communicate against any threat. Major sub-tasks
associated with AS are Air-Base Defense, Response Force Operations, critical site and asset security. The Criminal
Investigation Command (CID) conducts Personal Vulnerability Assessments on designated high-risk personnel (HRP)
and, as required by regulations, provides personal security for designated Department of Defense executives and other

182

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

key officials. Further, in conjunction with AS operations, CID performs logistical security analyses and vulnerability
assessments on key areas. The analysis is provided to the commander to assist in minimizing and reducing exposure to
criminal threat entities.
(3) Law and order operations. Law and order operations consist of those measures necessary to enforce laws,
directives and punitive regulations. Law and order operations include criminal investigations as well as those measures
used to control populations and resources. A criminal threat impacts military operations and requires the commander to
minimize that threat to forces, resources and operations. The activities of law and order operations provide a lawful and
orderly environment for the commander. The Military Police Corps has created specialized skill sets such as CID
Special Agents, Military Police Investigators, Military Police Internment/Resettlement and other specialists that enhance the success of military law and order operations. Because of the broad scope of capabilities, jurisdiction and
authority, uniformed enforcement of military and federal laws and regulations can be applied in both tactical and nontactical environments. Military Police and CID law and order functional capabilities are force multipliers that enhance
protection of the force across the full range of military operations through timely, thorough and unbiased investigations.
(4) Internment and resettlement operations. Military Police guard, protect and account for detainees, U.S. military
prisoners, and dislocated civilians (DC). Military Police provide trained and equipped forces to support detainee
operations during internment and resettlement missions for Army, Joint, intergovernmental and multinational operations. Working in conjunction with host nation assets, if available, Military Police assist and direct civilians away from
ongoing military operations and ensure the rapid and safe evacuation of detainees to designated holding areas.
(5) Police intelligence operations. Police intelligence operations (PIO) provide situational understanding and
visualization across the operating environment and greatly enhance the success of Army protection programs. PIO
provides relevant intelligence to deter, detect, detain, or defeat threats against US or protected persons, materials, and
information. The PIO occurs in both tactical and non-tactical environments through a network of law enforcement,
security, and intelligence organizations. Military Police collect, analyze, fuse, and report criminal intelligence regarding
threat/criminal groups for evaluation, assessment, targeting, and interdiction. The PIO involves the evaluation of all
available elements of intelligence including HUMINT, IMINT, SIGINT, MASINT, OSINT, CRIMINT, and so forth.
The PIO can act as a stand–alone function for the direct purpose of developing intelligence to meet specific
requirements or it can be conducted in conjunction with other Military Police functions.
c. Unique features of work in the Military Police Branch. Military Police officers work at all levels of command and
staff, participating in a broad spectrum of force protection and contingency operations ranging from security assistance
missions to combat operations. Military Police deploy as the contingency force of choice in support of U.S. policy
objectives. Military Police units are recognized for their unique mission capabilities. These capabilities include, but are
not limited to, expertise in dealing with the demands of cross-cultural operations; universal acceptability as a force
focused on security and safety; and conflict resolution using minimum force techniques. These traits make Military
Police units invaluable in supporting contingency and nation assistance operations. Additionally, Military Police will—
(1) Command and control Military Police and CID units and organizations.
(2) Provide Military Police coordination and liaison at all Army, Joint, intergovernmental, and multinational levels
as appropriate.
(3) Develop doctrine, organizations, and equipment for future Military Police missions.
(4) Serve as instructors at various pre-commissioning programs, service schools and service colleges.
(5) Serve as Military Police advisors to USAR and ARNG organizations.
18–2. Officer characteristics required
The Military Police Branch requires all officers (commissioned and warrant) who are skilled in leadership at all levels;
who are knowledgeable in Military Police tactics, techniques and procedures; who emulate Warrior Ethos and possess
strong Army Values, leader attributes and leader skills; and fully understand key leadership actions that must be taken
to ensure success. Additionally, there are branch unique skills, knowledge and attributes that require professional
development.
a. Unique skills. Military Police officers must possess skill proficiency related to the individual and associated
collective tasks that are part of the 5 Military Police functions. This includes not only knowledge of the tasks, but the
ability to execute them under a variety of conditions and at progressive levels of command responsibility. Additionally,
Military Police officers must possess:
(1) Warrior Ethos. Military Police officers must possess a strong Warrior Ethos. Military Police must be warriors
first, while maintaining a high level of proficiency of Military Police functions. Military Police must exhibit the
Warrior Ethos through out every level of responsibility.
(2) Decisionmaking skills. Military Police officers often work in an environment where time available for problem
analysis is seriously constrained and where sound, timely decisions are urgent. Available information in this environment will vary in its completeness and ambiguity. An ability to operate under stress, develop viable courses of action,
make decisions and accomplish a mission regardless of constraints is critical to a Military Police officer’s success.
(3) Human dimension skills. Military Police officers must develop skills that allow them to deal effectively with
various cross-cultural, ethnic and human dimensional attitudes encountered in the majority of Military Police related

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

183

activities. A thorough understanding of these attitudes and emotions is critical to Military Police success. Military
Police officers deal with a broad range of domestic and international issues that require application of the core human
values of fairness, patience, compassion and caring. Therefore, an effective grasp of the human dimension is pivotal in
effectively managing situations of stress or conflict, and in the proper use of conflict resolution or deterrence.
(4) Leadership skills. Leadership is the overarching competency required of all Military Police officers. It summarizes the Army’s seven core values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity and personal courage.
Leaders inspire Soldiers with the will to win and provide purpose, direction and motivation in all operational
environments. Military Police officers are expected to study the profession, becoming both tactically and technically
proficient. Equally important, however, they must continually demonstrate strong character and high ethical standards
in order to infuse these traits into their units and Soldiers. Lastly, Military Police leadership must focus on taking
responsibility for decisions, being loyal to superiors and subordinates, inspiring and directing assigned resources toward
a purposeful end, and providing the vision that focuses and anticipates the future. The Military Police officer, while
inherent in all leaders to some degree, must constantly refine these skills, if he or she is to successfully lead the
outstanding Soldiers in our Corps.
b. Unique knowledge. Army and Military Police professional development programs produce versatile, competent
Soldiers and leaders. The unique aspects of Military Police knowledge include the development of special qualifications needed to perform such duties as provost marshal, security officer, physical security officer, internment/resettlement and criminal investigations. To be successful, Military Police officers must possess a high degree of knowledge
about how the Army, as well as the Military Police Corps functions. This knowledge about the Army should include
general knowledge of combined arms, Joint, intergovernmental, and multinational operations and how the Military
Police Corps supports each of them. Branch officers must maintain a proper balance between technical skills and the
ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactics, techniques and procedures at the right time and place. These
abilities can only be gained and developed through repetitive operational assignments and continuous professional
study and self-development. Military Police officers must have the ability to operate independently and articulate the
capabilities of Military Police Soldiers to others across the full-spectrum of military operations.
c. Unique attributes. The skills and knowledge needed to function as a Military Police officer must supplement
certain core attributes required of all Army officers. Army officers are expected to maintain the necessary technical
proficiency and flexibility necessary to perform any branch related mission. All officers must be physically and
mentally fit, maintain and display self-control, remain calm under pressure and adhere to published standards and
regulations. However, the nature of the 5 Military Police functions often demands that Military Police officers possess
certain attributes unique to the Military Police Corps. The most critical of these unique requirements are:
(1) Personal attributes. Military Police officers must possess exceptionally high moral and ethical values. The
Military Police mission is to enforce laws and adhere to directives and punitive regulations that demand that the
standards of the Military Police officer be beyond reproach. The diversity of Military Police functions, particularly
those associated with collecting, analyzing and disseminating information; also require Military Police officers to
continually seek self-improvement across a wide range of skills, from computer applications to interpersonal communications. Finally, Military Police officers must also recognize the critical importance of physical fitness and personal
bearing as they lead Military Police Soldiers effectively across the full range of Military Police functions.
(2) Professional attributes. Military Police officers must demonstrate Warrior Ethos and professional attributes that
reinforce Military Police Corps values and traditions. Warfighting, competency, skill proficiency, dedication, teamwork
and flexibility, coupled with fairness and respect for others, highlight the essential traits demanded of every Military
Police soldier, regardless of rank. These professional attributes form the basis for the trusts that the Army has placed in
the Corps and is reflected in the mission to impartially enforce the law upon fellow Soldiers.
(3) Multifunctionality. As Military Police officers progress in their careers, they can expect their assignments to
become increasingly multifunctional. Military Police officers must become experts in all Military Police Functions by
serving in multiple tactical, law enforcement, Internment/Resettlement and CID jobs throughout their careers. Initially,
officers will perform duties related to their branch. Eventually, as the officer becomes more familiar with his or her
specialty and the Army, he or she can expect to be called upon to perform a wide range of military duties. This may
include serving in various leadership positions in modified Table of Organization and Equipment (TOE) and fixed site
Table of Distribution and Allowance (TDA) positions as well as serving in branch/FA generalist assignments.
18–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. Military Police Branch officer developmental assignments. Military Police officers develop in the Operations
career field. This is a command-centric environment, which places great emphasis on leading Soldiers. For company
grade officers, the focus is on the platoon leader, company and detachment command and tactical Provost Marshall
assigned within brigade combat teams (BCT), experience preparing them for duties in the following ranks. In the field
grade ranks, prime focus concentrates on critical troop related duty positions such as battalion or brigade S–3 or XO,
unit of employment (UEx) or equivalent provost marshal, tactical provost marshal and battalion and brigade command.
Other professional development assignments include instructor duty at the Military Police School or one of the senior

184

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

leadership institutions, for example, CGSC, USMA, and so forth, and service on Joint/DOD/Army/MACOM staffs.
Regardless of the duty position, individual success is ultimately and inseparably tied to performance.
(1) Company grade officer development.
(a) Lieutenant.
1. The Military Police LT’s first objective is to complete BOLC II and III. Upon commissioning, all newly
commissioned officer’s, regardless of their branch, will begin BOLC Phase II at a pre–designated site. Phase II is a
6–week course which emphasizes common Army small leadership standard ethos; increases self–awareness and selfconfidence; and fosters bonding, rapid team building, cohesion, and trust in a combined arms environment. Upon
completion of BOLC phase II, newly commissioned Military Police LTs will go to Fort Leonard Wood, MO for BOLC
phase III training. BOLC phase III emphasizes platoon level, branch specific tactical and technical skills as outlined in
the current MPOBC. Additional areas of concentration include Military Police law enforcement operations, communicative skills, personnel administration, drivers training and weapons training. Graduates of BOLC possess the Warrior
Ethos and technical and tactical skills, physical fitness and leadership qualities required to successfully lead a platoon.
They are familiar with the 5 functions of the Military Police Corps and are trained on the most critical tasks required of
a platoon leader. These officers demonstrate a thorough understanding of and willingness to live by the Army Values,
Warrior Ethos and a firm grasp of the attributes, skills and actions that form the foundation of a competent and
confident leader. Following the basic course, selected officers may attend specialized courses, such as Airborne or Air
Assault School, to support follow-on assignment requirements and to complement professional development. The focus
of effort during the LT years is to acquire, reinforce and hone troop leading, technical, tactical, logistics and
administrative skills. Inculcation of the Warrior Ethos and Army core values is essential in the development of young
officers. Prior to promotion of CPT, officers must possess an in depth knowledge of and combined arms operations
gained through on the job training. By law, officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree before promotion to CPT.
Officers who are assigned to life cycle brigade combat teams will be assigned for 36 months with other force structure
type assignments. 2LTs entering life cycle units will stay for the unit’s life cycle and be CPTs in LT positions upon
end of the unit life cycle.
2. The 2nd objective is a branch assignment with troops. Consistent with Army requirements, LTs can expect an
initial assignment as a platoon leader in a Military Police company. While serving as a platoon leader, LTs should
develop a comprehensive understanding of Army and Military Police operations that will provide a solid Warrior Ethos
and values, technical and tactical proficiency necessary foundation for company command. After completing their
platoon leader assignment, LTs should take advantage of opportunities to broaden their technical, tactical and leadership skills as an Initial Entry Training (IET) XO or staff officer positions at the battalion or brigade level or law
enforcement position. Experiences on a contingency deployment or other real-world operational mission are especially
valuable in preparing LTs for company or detachment command. LTs who are assigned to units that are under life
cycle management will seek opportunities to expand their experience to those positions that provide experience and
knowledge in Military Police functions that lead to further career development.
3. Additionally, officers who have not completed an undergraduate degree must do so during this point in their
careers. The Degree Completion Program (DCP) allows selected officers to complete baccalaureate degrees at their
own expense while still drawing full pay and allowances at their current rank as a full-time student at an accredited
college or university. Officers are required to have a baccalaureate degree from an accredited university prior to
attending the Military Police CCC. Time allotted for degree completion is normally limited to 12 months. Officers
interested in the DCP must submit applications through their chain of command to the Combat Service Support
Directorate, ATTN: AHRC–OPB–P, 200 Stovall St., Alexandria, VA, 22332–0414 not later than 5 months prior to the
requested DCP start date.
(b) Captain.
1. Officers are eligible to attend the Military Police CCC between the 3rd and 10th year of commissioned service.
Military Police CCC will be either TDY and return or PCS as fits the needs of the Army and follow–on assignment.
CPTs must aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience that will prepare them for duties at the
following grades. This course prepares officers to command at the company or detachment level and to serve in
Military Police staff positions. The branch phase CCC consists of branch specific technical and tactical training with
integrated common core instruction. Graduates will have a firm grasp of the attributes, skills, and actions that form the
foundation of a competent and confident leader. Officers attending CCC are strongly encouraged to participate in the
master’s degree program offering enrollment while in the CCC and a short follow–on course work.
2. The most critical leadership position for a Military Police CPT to hold is commander of a Military Police unit
(company or detachment). CPTs who have not commanded a Military Police unit will be assigned, if possible, to
locations that provide an opportunity for command. Command of a TOE or selected TDA unit is equivalent assignment
for experience in performing in the following grade. Some CPTs may be offered a second command at the Military
Police school, U.S. Army Disciplinary Barracks, CID Protective Services Unit or USAREC.
3. Military Police CPTs should continue developing their technical and tactical skills. Maximum hands–on experience in a variety of Military Police leadership positions should be sought during this phase. Attendance at branch
specific functional training courses is recommended, depending on timing and opportunity.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

185

4. Military Police officers should strive to become experts in all functions of the Military Police Corps. Officers
should seek assignments in areas where they have not previously served such as tactical, law enforcement, internment/
resettlement or CID. Following company command, CPTs are eligible for nominative, FA or branch/FA generalist
(branch immaterial) jobs. Assignment to one of these career opportunities is discussed between the soldier and the USA
HRC branch assignment manager, and will be confirmed based on the professional development needs of the officer
and Army requirements. Officers may submit their request for FAs through the Functional Area Process (FAP) system.
This is an online system at HRC that provides the officer the opportunity to work in the FA of his/her interest. The
FAP is normally designated between an officer’s 5th and 10th years of service. They should also solicit counseling
from their raters as well as their branch assignment managers on the career field designation process. Career field
designation is completed 6 months prior to CPTs’ consideration for promotion to MAJ. CPTs should submit their
branch or FA designation preference statements. Following selection to MAJ, officers are designated into their career
field or FA specialty. Part of the officer evaluation report includes rater recommendations indicating a potential career
field designation for the rated officer. CPTs should be aware of the rater’s responsibility, and this important part of the
OER should be discussed during support form counseling. Other key branch/FA generalist assignments for a Military
Police officer include staff officer positions at the battalion or brigade level, small group leader (SGL) or staff officer
at the Military Police School, Provost Marshal (PM) operations at the installation, tactical, or MACOM level, USMA
faculty and staff, Cadet Command, USAREC or RC.
5. A small number of CPTs may participate in the Project Warrior Program, a program designed to spread the
expertise developed by combat training center (CTC) observer/controllers (O/C) to the rest of the Military Police
Corps. After 2 years at a CTC, project warrior officers are assigned to the Military Police school as small group leaders
to add current combined arms tactical experience to Military Police instruction and allow CTC lessons-learned to be
incorporated into the training base
6. Even though not a requirement for promotion to MAJ; officers are encouraged to obtain a master’s degree from
an accredited college or university. Furthermore, a limited number of opportunities exist for highly qualified Military
Police officers to participate in fully funded advanced civilian schooling in disciplines such as corrections. Officers
selected to participate in a fully funded civilian training or education program will be assigned to a follow–on
utilization tour. The enrollment in the master’s degree program offered to CCC is an excellent time to do advanced
degree completion.
(2) Field grade officer development.
(a) Major.
1. Following selection for promotion to MAJ, an officer’s record is sent before the Career Field Designation Board,
a HQDA central selection board. The board membership assigns officers to a career field. Consideration for assignment
includes the officer’s preference statement, rater recommendations, branch manner of performance, civilian education,
FA experience, and the needs of the Army. For officers designated in the Operations career field, the primary
professional development objective is to continue to strengthen Military Police tactical skills and leadership. Selection
into a career field other than operations means that Military Police Branch will no longer manage the officer. Officers
retained in the Operations career field will attend the resident ILE course. On completion of ILE, MAJs must
aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience that will prepare them for duties as an LTC with tactical
units.
2. Critical assignments include Military Police battalion S–3 or XO, brigade S–3, deputy provost marshal, staff
planning positions, Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) Military Police Planner or Regional Corrections Facility
(RCF) commander (when authorized a MAJ). Other typical assignments include UEx/UEy or equivalent staff,
MACOM/Joint/DOD/Army staff, Command and General Staff College (CGSC) faculty and staff, USMA faculty and
staff, CID, Inspector General, service school instructor, or Reserve Component (RC) support. Majors can also serve in
other branch/generalist positions. A very small number of officers are selected for the School of Advanced Military
Studies (SAMS) and must serve an initial utilization tour as a plans officer on UEx/UEy or equivalent staff.
3. Military education level 4 and/or intermediate level education for MAJs is essential for their professional
development. Therefore, all Military Police MAJs must complete resident or non–resident Command and Staff College
to remain competitive for promotion. In addition, officers should continue to pursue other professional development
goals to include completing a graduate level degree if their job requirements permit. Once the transformation of the
Officer Education System is fully implemented, the 3–month ILE common core course will be delivered in residence at
Fort Leavenworth for operations career field officers, RC officers and the traditional complement of sister service and
international officers. The other than operations career field and special branch officers will receive their common core
at several other course location sites where qualified Command and General Staff College (CGSC) instructors will
teach them. RC officers will still attend The Army School System (TASS) classrooms located in CONUS and overseas,
or can take the common core via an Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) course. Officers completing the ILE
Common Core Course will be Intermediate Staff College (ISC) qualified. To complement the common core and obtain
career field credentialing, officers in the Information Operations, Operational Support, and Institutional Support career
fields will participate in FA qualification courses. For a small number of proponents this tailored educational
experience will also include Advanced Civil Schooling (ACS). The 7–month Advanced Operations and Warfighting
Course (AOWC) at Fort Leavenworth for Operations career field officers will focus on planning and executing full

186

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

spectrum operations at the tactical and operational levels. History, leadership, and Joint instruction will continue to
receive heavy emphasis throughout the curriculum. Simulations will be used extensively to drive the learning, and
multiple opportunities will be provided for officers to practice their warfighting competencies and skills. Completion of
the common core and AOWC in residence at Fort Leavenworth provides the award of ILE. This learning model will
send field grade officers back to the Army better prepared to run staffs, support commanders, mentor junior officers,
and eventually command battalions and brigades. The result will be a significant improvement in the tactical and
operational warfighting capability of Army and Joint staffs.
4. Assignments after promotion to MAJ will be managed at HRC by the Military Police Branch for Operations
career field officers. Military Police officers who remain in the Operations career field will receive both branch
assignments and generalist assignments (see para 18–3(a)(1)(a)2 from Military Police Officer Branch.
(b) Lieutenant colonel.
1. Military Police LTCs can expect assignment to senior staff positions where they will be employed in a wide
variety of operational or key branch/generalist positions. Critical assignments include tactical provost marshal, installation provost marshal (when authorized an LTC), brigade S–3 or XO, deputy brigade commander or Military Police
School staff. Military Police LTCs can also be assigned to Joint/DOD/Army/MACOM staff assignments, ROTC, or RC
support.
2. An HQDA central selection board will select a limited number of officers for battalion command or its
equivalent. Selection rates for command vary because of the number of commands available and the size of the
officer’s year group.
3. LTCs are encouraged to continue their individual professional development by completing the senior Service
college program. Selection for the resident phase and the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course continue
to be done by an HQDA central selection board.
(c) Colonel.
1. The primary objective during this phase of an officer’s career is to maximize technical and tactical capabilities,
leader and management skills and other executive skills in positions of high responsibility. A wide variety of critical
positions are available, to include MACOM provost marshal, service school director, and Joint/DOD/Army staff
assignments.
2. An HQDA centralized board will select a limited number of officers for brigade command or its equivalent.
Selection rates for command vary because of the number of commands available and year group size.
3. Officers above the grade of LT can expect to serve in generalist assignments, such as ROTC, RC, Recruiting,
USMA faculty and staff and Inspector General, which may or may not be directly related to the Military Police branch
but are important to the Army.
4. Military Police officers can expect to be considered for Joint duty assignments worldwide. MAJs and LTCs
should aggressively seek opportunities for Joint qualification. Joint experience is important to the Army and is essential
to individual officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions. An officer on the ADL may not be
appointed to the grade of O–7 unless the officer has completed a full tour of duty (36 months) in a Joint duty
assignment (JDA). Although the Assistant Secretary of Defense (FMP) may waive that JDA requirement on a case-bycase basis for scientific and technical qualifications for Military Police officers, officers receiving scientific and
technical waivers must serve continuously in the specialized field or serve in a JDA before reassignment to a
nonscientific and technical position.
5. Military Police Branch officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated above. These
other assignments may include White House Fellowships, duty with the National Security Council or the United
Nations, as well as Military Police branch representatives at Allied service schools. The spectrum of possible
assignments is large and these assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and important, requiring mature,
skilled officers.
b. Warrant officer military occupational specialty qualification, professional development, and assignments. The
only WO MOS in the Military Police Corps is MOS 311A, CID Special Agent. The U.S. Army Criminal Investigation
Command (USACIDC) is a MACOM, commanded by the Provost Marshal General. USACIDC provides a full range
of criminal investigative services and support to commanders and directors at all levels, in tactical and garrison
environments, worldwide. USACIDC plans, coordinates, and directs criminal investigations, crime prevention surveys,
and personal security operations, as well as, collects, analyzes and disseminates criminal intelligence in support of
criminal investigation, crime prevention and force protection.
(1) Criminal Investigation Division special agents—
(a) Investigate felony and other significant crimes of interest to the Army as defined by military regulations and
Federal law.
(b) Plan, organize, conduct, and supervise overt and covert investigations.
(c) Examine and process crime scenes.
(d) Collect, preserve, and evaluate physical evidence for scientific examination by laboratories and use in judicial
proceedings.
(e) Obtain and execute arrest warrants, search warrants, and Department of Defense Inspector General subpoenas.

(k) Write, review, and approve technical investigative reports.
(l) Recommend crime prevention measures to commanders.
(m) Conduct personal security vulnerability assessments for designated senior Army officials.
(n) Provide personal security for designated Department of Defense executives, visiting foreign officials, and other
key officials.
(o) Conduct hostage negotiations as members of crisis management teams.
(p) Supervise investigative case management and overall investigative operations.
(q) Provide technical guidance and direction to subordinate investigative units.
(r) Collect, analyze, and disseminate criminal intelligence to commanders in support of their force protection efforts.
(s) Develop, conduct, and supervise student instruction in criminal investigative methods and techniques.
(2) Military occupational specialty qualification and development (Active Army and Reserve Component)—
(a) Military occupational specialty qualification. At all WO grades, CID special agents must be U.S. citizens and
qualify for a Top Secret security clearance. The qualifications outlined in AR 195–3, paragraph 2–2b, must be met and
the commander, CID must accredit CID special agents.
1. Basic level military occupational specialty qualification. In addition to the general MOS qualifications, CID
special agents must complete the warrant officer candidate course and the Military Police Warrant Officer Basic
Course. This course emphasizes the necessary skills to become a CID team chief, including leadership, technical
investigative skills, and physical training.
2. Advanced level military occupational specialty qualification. Continuation of the CID special agent career path
provides for completion of the Military Police Warrant Officer Advance Course on selection for promotion to CW3.
This course emphasizes the necessary skills to be a detachment commander, special agent in charge, battalion or
brigade staff officer or USAMPS branch chief. This course provides leader attributes and leader skills, tactics,
techniques, and procedures.
3. Senior level military occupational specialty qualification. Selection for promotion to CW4 provides for additional
training requirements. Criminal Investigation Division special agents are required to complete the WOSC. This course
emphasizes the necessary skills to be a CID battalion operations officer, brigade or MACOM investigative staff officer
and USAMPS chief of warrant officer professional development or advanced investigative skills. This course provides
specific leadership training that focuses on the ability to perform work in senior WO positions.
4. Master–level military occupational specialty qualification. Criminal Investigation Division special agents, who
acquire the master–level for WOs, CW5, must complete the WOSSC. This course emphasizes the necessary skills to be
a brigade operations officer, chief warrant officer of the Military Police Branch, WO advisor to the CG, USACIDC, IG
senior special agency, or chief current investigative operations and policy HQs, USACIDC. Warrant officers at this
skill level receive specific training that focuses on senior–level leadership, mentorship, and organizational operations.
(b) Professional development.
1. Warrant officer one.
a. The primary performance objective for the new Military Police WO1 special agent (SA) is a leadership role
within a CID unit. Consistent with Army requirements, WO1 special agents can expect an initial assignment as an
assistant CID team chief at a large installation or as a team chief at a small installation. Each WO can also expect to be
the senior member of a 2–person tactical, deployable investigative team. Each WO1 should continue to develop a
comprehensive understanding of investigative techniques, tactics, and procedures. WO1 should develop an understanding of CID and Army operations that will provide a solid foundation for assuming duties as a Detachment Commander/
Special Agent in Charge.
b. The WO1 will have experience as an enlisted CID Special Agent (MOS 31D) and have graduated from the
WOCS. The new WO’s first objective is to complete the Military Police Warrant Officer Basic Course. Following the
WOBC, selected WO may attend specialized courses, such as Airborne or Air Assault School, Hostage Negotiation
School, or Protective Services Training to support follow-on assignment requirements and to complement professional
development.
c. Warrant officers who have not completed an undergraduate degree should continue to work toward that goal.
Qualification for selection as a WO candidate in MOS 311A requires a waiver for any applicant who has not already
earned a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university.
2. Chief warrant officer two
a. CW2 special agents will continue to fill leadership roles within a CID unit. The primary performance objective as

188

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

a CW2 will be a successful tour as a team chief or section leader, although current USACIDC operational constraints
require selected CW2 be assigned as detachment commanders/special agents in charge. CW2 special agents can expect
to continue to be the senior member of a 2–person tactical, deployable investigative team.
b. The CW2s should continue developing as leaders and investigators. They should seek functional training and
operational assignments that enhance specific leadership and investigative skills. Examples of training opportunities
include the FBI National Academy, Canadian Police Academy, and advanced training in specific investigative skills
that focus on advanced investigative techniques, such as advanced crime scene investigative techniques, drug suppression, economic crime, protective services, and criminal intelligence management. Limited CW2 assignments such as
Personal Security Officer (PSO) and Investigative Operations Staff Officer at a CID Battalion or Brigade are also
available. A limited number of opportunities exist for highly qualified CW2 special agent to participate in fully funded
advanced civilian schooling such as Forensic Science Officers (FSO), Polygraph Examiner or, Computer Crimes
Investigator. Staff and specialty training and assignments should normally only be considered after a successful tour as
a Team Chief. CW2 SA must complete the Action Officer’s Development Course prior to attending the WOAC. Every
CW2 eligible for promotion CW3 is expected to have completed undergraduate studies and have earned a baccalaureate
degree.
c. Chief warrant officer three.
d. The primary performance objective for the CW3 is a successful tour as a detachment commander/special agent in
charge (SAC). Operations officer of a large CID detachment is another critical assignment for the CW3 after they have
successfully performed as a detachment commander/SAC. Any CW3 who has not served as a detachment commander/
SAC should be selected for a detachment commander/SAC position, based on the availability of that position and the
needs of the Army. Other duties include staff and specialty positions, such as personal security officer, battalion,
brigade, or MACOM staff officer, USAMPS branch chief, computer crime investigator and polygraph examiner.
e. Following selection for promotion to CW3, the WO special agent will be scheduled to attend the WOAC.
Successful completion of the WOAC is essential for professional development. CW3 special agents should continue to
seek functional training and operational assignments that enhance specific leadership and investigative skills. They
remain eligible for training opportunities such as FBI National Academy, Canadian Police Academy, and advanced
training in specific investigative skills, such as FSO. A limited number of opportunities remain for highly qualified
CW3 SA to participate in fully funded advanced civilian schooling such as Forensic Science Officers, Polygraph
Examiner or Computer Crimes Investigators. In addition, CW3 SA should continue to pursue other professional
development goals to include work towards a graduate level degree. Regardless of the duty position, individual success
is ultimately and inseparably tied to performance.
3. Chief warrant officer four.
a. The primary performance objective for the CW4 is a successful tour as a Battalion Operations Officer, Protective
Service Unit Operations Officer, Brigade or MACOM Staff Officer and USAMPS Chief of Warrant Officer Professional Development (WOPD) or Advanced Investigative Training Branches (AITB) are additional critical CW4
assignments. CW4 SA can expect assignment to senior staff positions where they will be employed in a variety of
operational positions.
b. Following selection for promotion to CW4, MP warrant officers will be scheduled for the WOSC. Successful
completion of this course is considered essential for professional development. In addition, CW4 SA should continue to
pursue other professional development goals to include completing a graduate level degree.
4. Chief warrant officer five.
a. The primary performance objective for the CW5 is to maximize technical and tactical capabilities, leadership and
management skills, and other executive skills in positions of high responsibility. Critical positions include Brigade
Operations Officer, Senior Special Agent on the Inspector General Team, Chief of Current Operations and Policy/WO
Advisor to the CG USACIDC and, Chief Warrant Officer of the Military Police Branch /Chief, Military Police
Investigations Division, USAMPS.
b. The CID special agent selected for promotion to CW5 will be scheduled to attend the WOSSC, and the Army
Force Management Course. The CW5 special agents should complete a graduate level degree if they have not already
done so.
18–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Military Police Corps Branch officer preferences and precedence.
(1) Preferences. The Military Police Branch has diverse assignment opportunities that allow for numerous career
development paths. The goal of the professional development of Military Police Branch officers is to produce and
sustain highly qualified, tactically and operationally oriented officers to lead Military Police soldiers during wartime
and on other assigned missions. Assignments in the Military Police Corps will develop the officer’s ability to achieve
that goal. Requests from officers for assignments that do not contribute to achieving that goal will likely be rejected.
(2) Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility
on the sequence of assignments. Typically, Military Police branch officers should seek assignments in the following
order: Military Police Officer Basic Course, platoon leader, company XO or battalion staff, CCC, company or

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

189

detachment command, battalion or brigade or UEx or equivalent tactical PM positions, nominative assignment,
Command and Staff College, battalion S–3 or XO or brigade S–3 (as a MAJ), battalion command, Senior Service
College, and brigade command.
b. Military Police warrant officer Criminal Investigation Division special agent preferences and precedence.
(1) Preferences. The Military Police WO has diverse assignment opportunities, which allow for numerous career
development paths. The goal of the professional development of Military Police WO is to produce and sustain highly
qualified, tactically and operationally oriented WOs to lead military police soldiers and special agents during wartime
and on other assigned investigative missions. Assignment within the Military Police Corps and the U.S. Army Criminal
Investigation Command will develop the WO’s ability to achieve that goal. Requests from WOs for assignments, which
do not contribute to achieving that goal, will likely be rejected.
(2) Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility
on the sequence of assignments. Typically, Military Police WOs should seek assignments and training in the following
order: warrant officer candidate course, Military Police Warrant Officer Basic Course, CID team chief, special agent in
charge of a small CID office, Military Police Warrant Officer Advanced Course, detachment commander/special agent
in charge of a large CID office, battalion/brigade investigative staff officer, USAMPS branch chief, WOSC, battalion/

d. Requirements. Officers should meet certain standards in terms of schooling, operational assignments, and manner
of performance in the Military Police Branch at each grade. Meeting these standards ensures that the officer has
acquired the skills, knowledge and attributes to remain proficient in the Military Police Branch at that grade. Military
Police Branch requirements are detailed below, and an officer should consider these requirements as they progress
forward in their career for ensuring the technical and tactical aspects are considered to obtain successful and
professional career goals. These standards for schooling and operational assignments best prepare an officer for
command or positions of greater responsibility in the branch. All Military Police Branch officers should have the
opportunity for success at each rank.
(1) Company grade requirements. Because of the wide variety of Military Police missions and units, no one
quantitative standard will define success. The most important objective for the Military Police Corps officer is to
become versatile and proficient in the Military Police functions at company grade level. The requirement for a
successful company command is important in that it ensures the Military Police officer is able to lead, train and care
for soldiers. The Military Police officer must also be well rounded in the basic techniques needed to execute wartime
missions. Company grade officers should meet the following requirements in the Military Police Corps.
(a) Lieutenant. To be successful as a Military Police LT, the officer must complete the MPOBC/BOLC and one
assignment as a platoon leader. LTs should serve as platoon leaders and in other operational assignments (life cycle
unit) that would equate to at least 18–24 months of overall experience.
(b) Captain. To be successful as a Military Police Corps CPT, the officer must meet the following requirements:
1. Complete the CCC. Officers who are branch transferred after successful completion of any branch CCC will be
considered to have met this educational prerequisite.
2. CPTs should serve as a company or detachment commander or in other operational assignments for a minimum
of 12 months with a goal of 18–24 months.
(2) Field grade branch opportunities. Military Police Branch field grade standards are—
(a) Major. To be successful as a Military Police Corps MAJ, the officer must meet the following requirements—
1. Complete ILE.
2. Serve a minimum of 12 months, with a goal of 18–24 months, as a battalion or brigade S–3 or XO, tactical
provost marshal, SBCT Provost Marshal, Regional Correctional Facility (RCF) commander (when authorized a MAJ),
branch related position on Joint/DOD/Army/MACOM or multinational staffs, instructor at a branch service school, or
in any Military Police branch position that is coded at the grade of MAJ or above.
(b) Lieutenant colonel. To be successful as a Military Police Corps LTC, the officer should successfully complete
assignment as a battalion commander, UEx/UEy or equivalent provost marshal, installation provost marshal (when
authorized an LTC), brigade S–3 or XO, deputy brigade commander, branch related position on Joint/DOD/Army/
MACOM or multinational staffs, or in any Military Police Branch position which is coded at the grade of LTC or
above. If selected by an HQDA board, Military Police officers should complete resident or non-resident senior Service
college.
(c) Colonel. To be successful as a Military Police Corps COL, the officer should successfully complement assignment in any one of the positions listed below that is coded at the grade of COL.
1. Military Police coded positions such as brigade commander; branch related position on Joint/DOD/Army/
MACOM or multinational staffs; MACOM or UEy or equivalent provost marshal; or senior director at USAMPS or
other service schools.
2. Staff or faculty position at a MEL 1/MEL 4-producing service school or USMA.
3. Division chief or higher position on Joint/DOD/Army/MACOM staff.
4. Garrison commander or installation chief of staff.
5. Nominative or specialized position outside DOD.
e. Military Police warrant officer Criminal Investigation Division special agent critical life cycle assignments.

18–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal of the Military Police Corps is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for Military Police
officers. To do this, the field grade inventory must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, to provide
sufficient flexibility to support branch/FA generalist positions.
b. Officer Personnel Management System implementation. The numbers of authorized Military Police billets, by
grade, will vary as force structure decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more
information on Military Police branch authorizations or inventory, by grade, are encouraged to contact the Military
Police Corps Personnel Proponency Office or Military Police Branch assignment officer.
18–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Military Police Corps
a. Structure. Any changes to the authorizations of Military Police units will be based on the restructuring and
recoding. Additional changes may result due to the iterative nature of the restructuring and recoding process.
b. Acquire. The majority of commissioned officers in the Military Police Corps are accessed directly from ROTC
and USMA and, to a lesser extent, OCS. All officers should meet the physical and aptitude requirements specified in
AR 40–501. Designation of the Military Police Corps as an initial branch is regulated by HQDA through the various
commissioning sources. The remainder of commissioned officers in the Military Police Corps is acquired through
in–service branch transfers. Accession via branch transfer is directed by HQDA and may be voluntary or involuntary
based upon the needs of the Army. Officers of other branches who desire a transfer to the Military Police Corps may
submit a written request for branch transfer in accordance with AR 614–100.
c. Distribute. Military Police Branch officers will continue to rotate between TOE and TDA units in CONUS and
OCONUS. Officers should have more time to gain the requisite skills in their branch and their branch/FA generalist
assignments. Operations career field Military Police officers will work either in branch or branch/FA generalist
positions. Officers will be provided assignment opportunities to develop the skills and experience base necessary for
service at the next higher grade. The sequencing and timing of assignments is driven by Army priorities. The GWOT
and the Army’s The Way Ahead are currently the driving force behind the distribution of officers. Force Stabilization
will also continue to influence officer distribution.
(1) Officers assigned to installations with ample professional opportunities may be stabilized at that installation for
extended periods. Additionally, some company grade officer may be offered the opportunity to attend the CCC and
return to their initial unit of assignment. Individual timelines are affected by Army and Military Police requirements.
(2) Officers at all levels assigned to life cycle units (generally the Stryker Brigade and Brigade Combat Teams) will
remain in the unit for a minimum of 3 years.
(3) The majority of installations will be managed on a cyclic manning system. Replacements will be sent to these
units and installations periodically to maintain readiness of the units. Tour lengths and developmental position
opportunities can vary.
d. Develop. Today’s Military Police officer is confronted by 2 diverse and complex challenges. First, the officer
should lead and train Soldiers who can achieve tactical success; protect and expedite the movement of critical
resources; evacuate, process and intern enemy prisoners of war; and support law enforcement operations. Second, in
the garrison environment the officer manages technical planning and supervision in the areas of law enforcement, crime
prevention, criminal investigations, anti–terrorism, physical security and internment/resettlement. Officer development
will occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in tactical, training and staff assignments. The
goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly perform METL related functions during Joint and combined arms
operations. Professional development can also occur through The Army School System (TASS). Military Police
officers selected for MAJ should complete MEL 4/ILE training (resident or non-resident) and officers selected for COL
should complete MEL 1 training if selected by a HQDA board.
e. Deploy. Military Police Branch officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to
deploy worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to MTOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA
organizations, all Military Police officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of
conflict. Military Police officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect
national interests; or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian
and peace keeping missions. Whether assigned to warfighter centric units or training organizations, readiness is
imperative to success of the mission. Officers must prepare themselves and their families for planned and no notice
deployments. Military Police Branch officers must prepare themselves and their families for this most challenging life
cycle function.
f. Sustain.
(1) Promotion. Military Police Branch officers will compete for promotion only within the Operations career field.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

195

Skills and experience, duty performance and adherence to branch requirements are all factors that influence promotion.
Promotion rates will be determined by Army needs/DOPMA goals.
(2) Command. Senior Military Police Branch commanders will continue to be centrally selected for command. All
Military Police officer command opportunities are in the Operations career field. These commands are organized into 4
functional categories— tactical, training and strategic support, institutional, and TRADOC System Manager. Officers
have the option of selecting the category or categories in which they desire to compete for command, while declining
competition in other categories. The results of the command selection process are announced in the Command
Selection List (CSL). Since the Command Select List process continues to change, officers should contact branch to
receive the latest information.
(3) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS. Starting
with CPT, the rater will recommend the rated officer for the career field which best suits his or her abilities and
interests.
g. Separate. The separation process for Military Police officers remains unchanged.
18–8. Military Police Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. Military Police officers in the Reserve Components (RC) play a vital role in the
total force structure during peace as well as mobilization. Over 47 percent of requirements in the Military Police Corps
are in the RC, and certain specialized organizations such as internment/resettlement units exist almost entirely within
the Army Reserve (AR) and ARNG. To fulfill its wartime mission, the Military Police Corps must rely on extensive
interaction with the RC. Wartime effectiveness will depend to a large extent on the quality and level of training RC
Military Police officers receive. RC Military Police officers serve the same roles and missions as their AC counterparts.
The limited time the reserve officer has available for military duty often poses a challenge to the officer’s professional
development.
b. Reserve Component officer development. To meet professional development objectives, RC officers must be
willing to rotate among Troop Program Units (TPUs), Individual Ready Reserve (IRR), and Individual Mobilization
Augmentee (IMA) assignments. Those interested in serving the National Guard or AR on a full-time basis may apply
for entry into the Active Guard Reserve (AGR) program. Officers selected for the AGR program may elect to complete
a 20-year active duty career in support of either the National Guard or Army Reserve. RC officers are assigned to
positions in TOE and TDA organizations; however, the vast majority of positions are in TOE units. Their duties and
responsibilities will be fundamentally the same as their AC counterparts, with the exception of those personnel
management, administrative and operational requirements unique to the National Guard and Army Reserve. All RC
Military Police assignments are open to both males and females.
(1) The RC Military Police officer has a challenging and complex mission. The officer should lead and train
Soldiers who can achieve tactical success. He or she must be tactically and technically proficient and capable of
executing the 5 Military Police functions of area security, maneuver and mobility support, law enforcement, internment
and resettlement operations, and police intelligence operations. Additionally, the ARNG Military Police officer plays a
major role in preparing for and providing assistance to their state during civil emergencies, sensitive public activities
and civil disturbances. A requirement for proficiency in both battlefield operations and peacetime Military Police skills
usually means a wide variety of educational opportunities and challenging assignments for the Military Police officer.
(2) The majority of RC officers appointed for assignment in the Military Police Corps come from ROTC, federal
and state OCS programs. All officers should meet the prerequisites specified in AR 135–100 for appointment in the RC
of the Army. HQDA and area commanders regulate appointment to the Military Police Corps as an initial branch.
Additional requirements for appointment of ARNG officers are listed in NGR 600–100.
(3) Positions in all Military Police skills are available to RC officers.
(4) National Guard warrant officers federal recognition and related personnel actions are found in NGR 600–101
and NGR 600–102. The professional development for RC CID Special Agents is in paragraph 18–3.
c. Life cycle development model. There are 5 phases of professional development for RC Military Police Corps
officers. (See fig 18–3, RC Military Police Corps life cycle development model.). These phases are related to military
rank and depict broadly based goals and career opportunities at each rank so that an officer may expand capabilities
and optimize performance. These objectives are flexible since the actual course of an officer’s professional development and utilization will be influenced by RC requirements and the officer’s strengths, experiences, performance and
desires.

d. The professional development objectives for RC officers by grade are as follows:
(1) Lieutenant.
(a) The Military Police LT’s first objective is to complete the MPOBC. LTs appointed without concurrent active
duty should complete the MPOBC within 24 months of the date of appointment. This course emphasizes leadership,
tactics, training operations, maintenance, supply and physical training. Additional areas of study include Military Police
operations, law, communicative skills, personnel administration, drivers training and weapons training. Graduates of the
MPOBC possess the technical and tactical skills, physical fitness, and leadership qualities of the Military Police Corps
and are trained on the most critical tasks required of a platoon leader. These officers demonstrate a thorough
understanding of and willingness to live by the Army Values and a firm grasp of the attributes, skills, and actions that
form the foundation of a competent and confident leader. Following the basic course, selected officers may attend such
specialized courses as Airborne and Air Assault, to support their follow-on assignment. Once the transformation of the
OES is fully implemented, the current officer basic course will be replaced with the BOLC phase I, II, and III. Phase I
is the pre–commissioning phase (Army ROTC/OCS/USMA). Upon commissioning, all newly commissioned officers,
regardless of their branch, will begin BOLC phase II at a pre–designated site. Phase II is a 6–week course which
emphasizes common Army small leadership standard ethos; increases self-awareness and self–confidence; and fosters
bonding, rapid team building, cohesion, and trust in a combined arms environment. Upon completion of BOLC phase
II, newly commissioned Military Police LTs will go to Fort Leonard Wood, MO for BOLC phase III training. BOLC
phase III emphasizes platoon level, branch specific tactical and technical skills as outlined in the current MPOBC.
(b) The second objective is a branch material assignment with troops. Consistent with Army requirements, RC
Military Police LTs can expect an initial assignment as a platoon leader for a minimum of 12 months with a minimum
of 18–24 months with a goal of 36 months. This will ensure LTs develop a comprehensive understanding of Army
operations and military life that will provide a solid foundation for assuming the challenge of company or detachment
command. LTs should seek leadership positions and every opportunity to broaden technical, tactical and leadership
skills in support of the Military Police combat and peacetime missions. Some assignments may also be with a battalion
or brigade headquarters staff. Nearly all are with TOE organizations.
(c) Reserve Component Military Police LTs are eligible for promotion to CPT when they meet the service and
educational requirements contained in chapter 7.
(2) Captain.
(a) Reserve Component officers of the Military Police Corps in the grade of 1LT or higher who have completed an
officer basic course are eligible to attend the Military Police Officer Advanced Reserve Course (MPOA–RC). The
MPOA–RC may be taken in residence (MPCCC) at the Military Police School or an RC officer may complete the
MPOA–RC, which consists of a combination of correspondence or distance learning and 2 weeks of resident training.
The MPOA–RC prepares officers to command at the company or detachment level and to serve in Military Police staff
positions. Currently, RC officers also attend the Combined Armed Services Staff School through a combination of
Advanced Distributed Learning and a 2–week residency piece at Fort Leavenworth, KS. The 2–week residency course
on full implementation of OES will be a 2–week residency school of combined arms exercise. If they attend the
20–week resident CCC, then the staff process phase is included as the 2nd phase of the CCC. The residency piece of
MPOA–RC trains officers to successfully function as a staff officer and ensure that the officers possess the technical,
tactical, leadership, and physical fitness skills required to successfully lead a company or detachment.
(b) The most critical leadership position for a Military Police CPT to hold is commander of a company or
detachment. Maximum hands-on experience in a variety of Military Police leadership positions should be sought during
this phase. RC CPTs should actively pursue assignments in both TPUs and as IMAs to broaden their professional
experience and enhance opportunities for training and education. Captains can expect to serve in a broad range of
command and staff assignments, including a variety of branch/FA generalist (branch immaterial) opportunities. Military
Police CPTs should continuously strive at developing their technical and tactical skills in preparation of a field grade
assignment.
(c) RC CPTs are required to complete an officer advanced course to be considered for promotion to MAJ. RC CPTs
who are serving in an active status and meet educational, performance and service requirements may be selected for
promotion by a centralized mandatory board or by a unit board convened to fill TPU vacancies.
(3) Major.
(a) The primary professional development objective of an RC Military Police Corps MAJ is to continue to
strengthen Military Police skills. Key assignments at this phase are battalion or brigade S–3 or XO, or deputy division
provost marshal for a minimum of 18–24 months with a goal of 36 months.
(b) A necessary part of professional development during this phase should be the realization that the needs of the
service increasingly dictate that an officer serve in positions away from troops. Key developmental positions at this
rank include controller in an exercise division in support of unit training and readiness; instructor/staff officer in an

198

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

institutional training division in support of the The Army School System (TASS); and staff officer at a Continental US
Army (CONUSA) or Regional Readiness Command (RRC) headquarters.
(c) Regardless of their career track, Military Police majors should ensure they attend CGSC or equivalent. RC
officers not on active duty should apply to attend a Command and Staff College level course. Since Reserve
Component officers are required to complete 50 percent of CGSC to be considered for promotion to LTC, timely
completion is key to remaining competitive. When ILE is fully implemented in the RC through the TASS Bns, then
ILE will become the staff college for field grade majors.
(d) Reserve Component MAJs who are serving in an active status and meet educational and service requirements
may be selected for promotion by a centralized mandatory board, or by a unit board convened to fill position
vacancies. MAJs not selected for promotion after consideration by 2 consecutive mandatory boards shall be considered
as not retainable beyond 20 years of commissioned service unless deemed so for the good of the Service.
(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) LTCs can expect assignments to senior staff positions where they will be employed in a variety of branch and
branch/generalist (branch immaterial) positions in units, training centers and headquarters elements. Brigade S–3 or
XO, or deputy brigade commander are key assignments during this phase.
(b) At this phase, officers may be selected for battalion command or its equivalent, as identified by their STARC or
RRC–Designated Positions List. Only a very small percentage of eligible officers will actually have an opportunity for
battalion command because of the limited number of command positions available.
(c) LTCs are required to complete CGSC to be considered for promotion to the grade of COL. Reserve Component
LTCs are encouraged to complete a senior Service college (SSC), if selected by the ARNG and the AR boards.
Standards for the selection process can be found in AR 350–1, paragraph 3–8c.
(d) Reserve Component LTCs are eligible for selection to COL upon completion of the requisite service requirements listed in chapter 7. LTCs remain eligible for promotion to COL as long as they continue to serve in an active
status and meet the selection criteria.
(5) Colonel.
(a) The primary objective for this phase is maximum use of the officer’s technical and tactical capabilities and his or
her managerial and executive skills in positions of senior responsibility.
(b) COLs are encouraged to complete SSC. Both the ARNG and AR conduct SSC selection boards, and standards
for the process can be found in AR 350–1, paragraph 3–8c.

Chapter 19
Military Intelligence Branch
19–1. Unique features of Military Intelligence branch.
a. I.
(1) The principal focus of Military Intelligence (MI) is to provide timely, relevant and accurate intelligence and
electronic warfare (IEW) support to commanders. Military Intelligence reduces uncertainty and risk to U.S. and Allied
forces and permits effective application of combat power. Military Intelligence officers lead, manage and direct
intelligence planning and operations across the entire operational spectrum. Military Intelligence Warrant Officers
provide the technical leadership and advice to assist in directing intelligence planning and operations. The intelligence
requirements of a predominantly CONUS-based, force projection Army dictate that all echelons be focused on the
needs of contingency forces during any crisis, deployment or actual military operation. This eliminates the traditional
distinction between tactical, operational and strategic intelligence. The entire Army intelligence effort must focus to
support the warfighter.
(2) At the tactical level of war, the MI officer commands, directs, supervises and employs organic collection,
analytical, production and dissemination assets. The MI officer plans for the optimum use of non-organic intelligence
to reduce the commander’s uncertainty concerning the enemy, terrain and weather. The MI officer assesses risks
associated with friendly and enemy courses of action and acts to counter or neutralize the multidiscipline hostile
intelligence threat. Military Intelligence officers use Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (IPB) at the tactical
level to focus their intelligence efforts to produce the key information requirements commanders need to execute their
concept of the operation. At the tactical level, the MI warrant officer directs, supervises and employs organic
collection, analysis, production and dissemination assets. MI warrant officers use Intelligence Preparation of the
Battlespace (IPB) to focus their intelligence gathering and analysis efforts on the needs of the commander.
(3) At the operational level, MI officers perform intelligence preparation of the theater. They support development
and execution of campaign plans and major operations within the theater of operations. They direct, supervise and
employ theater level intelligence collection and analytical assets to assess the capabilities and vulnerabilities of
potential and actual adversaries. They collect current information on the enemy, weather and terrain; and other
pertinent factors in the theater of operations. They use that information to develop intelligence, predict and forecast the

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

199

actions and intentions of the enemy, and the effects of terrain and weather on friendly and enemy operations in the
theater. They identify risks associated with enemy and friendly courses of action.
(4) At the strategic level, the MI officer assesses the capabilities and limitations of actual or potential adversaries for
national and Army level decisionmakers who develop national plans and strategy. Other MI officers may perform
scientific and technical intelligence functions in support of force modernization. All must be able to focus downward
on specific operational and tactical commanders’ requirements in crisis and military operations. This includes developing the intelligence preparation of the theater of operations. At the strategic level and in Joint operations, the MI
warrant officer provides the commander with assessments regarding the capabilities and limitations of actual or
potential adversaries.
(5) At all levels, MI officers plan for, supervise and perform collection and analysis of raw information and produce
and disseminate finished all-source intelligence products for commanders and intelligence consumers.
b. The Way Ahead. The complexity of international events, rapidly increasing technological sophistication of
intelligence collections and analysis systems, and constraints of a smaller, force projection Army are among the
challenges facing the MI officer and WO.
c. Unique features performed by Military Intelligence branch. All MI Corps officers must know, understand, and be
able to function in all intelligence disciplines imagery intelligence (IMINT), human intelligence (HUMINT), signals
intelligence (SIGINT) /electronic warfare (EW) and counterintelligence (CI) at all levels of warfare. The primary focus
is on warfighting and intelligence support to warfighters. Officers within the MI branch are assigned throughout the
force from combat arms battalion level to Joint, unified and specified commands. They perform a myriad of tasks
ranging from Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (IPB) in a tactical battlefield situation, to worldwide communications architectures planning, to strategic intelligence collection management and analysis. The processes involved are
refined through continuous improvement, often in a high volume production environment. Intelligence work requires
the ability to interpret patterns associated with complex situations, as well as the ability to synthesize and interpret such
activities. Intelligence production requires the transformation of data into applicable and usable information. Analytical
proficiency at the tactical level requires an understanding of the tactical concepts of both friendly and threat operations.
Some other unique features performed by MI officers and warrant officers include:
(1) Command, direct and control military intelligence units.
(2) Provide military intelligence coordination at all levels of command.
(3) Synchronize the military intelligence collection management process with targeting in Joint and multinational
operations.
(4) Develop doctrine, organization and equipment for the Military Intelligence mission.
(5) Instruct and evaluate Military Intelligence skills at service schools and combat training centers.
(6) Serve in positions requiring general combat skills such as staff officers in military headquarters and activities
requiring combat expertise.
(7) Serve in MACOM, HQDA, Joint and multinational levels of command.
d. Military Intelligence branch areas of concentration (AOC).
(1) Imagery Intelligence officer (35C). Duties include performance and supervision of the exploitation and analysis
of optical, infrared and radar imagery using techniques of photogrammetry and terrain analysis. Duties also include
using electronic, mechanical and optical devices to support tactical and strategic reconnaissance and surveillance

19–3. Critical Active Army MI officer developmental assignments.
a. Officer qualification and development. Military Intelligence officers should successfully perform in a wide variety
of critical and high–risk duties at each grade (2LT and 1LT combined) (see career development model fig 19–1). These
jobs are critical to the warfighting effort and are linked to ensure the commander receives the intelligence needed.
Success revolves around performance. Professional development assignments are listed below—
(1) Lieutenant.
(a) Directly accessed into Military Intelligence Branch. After completing the Military Intelligence Officer Basic
Course (MIOBC), to be replaced in the near future by the Basic Officer Leadership Course (BOLC), phase III
(proponent institutional training), Military Intelligence LTs are usually assigned to serve with troops in leadership
developmental positions, for example, platoon leader, or in other assignments such as assistant S2, combat support
battalion S2, assistant brigade S2 or staff officer in a Military Intelliegece battalion.
(b) Branch detail lieutenant. After completing the branch Officer Basic Course (OBC) or the BOLC, officers should
serve initially with troops in leadership positions, for example, platoon leader or executive officer.
(c) The focus of effort during the LT years is to acquire, reinforce, and hone troop leading, technical, tactical,
logistics and administrative skills. Inculcation of the Warrior Ethos and Army core values is essential in the development of young officers. Prior to promotion to CPT, officers must possess an in–depth knowledge of combined arms
and intelligence operations gained through on the job training. By law, officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree
before promotion to CPT.
(2) Captain.
(a) Officers generally attend the Military Intelligence CCC at their 4th year of service, which currently corresponds
with promotion to CPT. Military Intelligence CCC will be either TDY and return, TCS or PCS as fits the needs of the
Army and the follow–on assignment. Officers transitioning into Military Intelligence through the branch detail
program, will first attend the Military Intelligence Officer Transition Course prior to the CCC. CPTs must aggressively
prepare for and seek the skills and experience that will qualify them for promotion. The following are considered key
developmental assignments for Military Intelligence CPTs:
1. Company or detachment command.
2. Battalion S–2.
3. Collection manager.
4. BCT A/S2.
5. "Dirt" CTC observer/Controller.
(b) Developmental assignments, both branch specific and immaterial will provide CPTs with exposure to the Army
and in some cases, Joint organizations. There is no longer a formal FA designation point, but officers can submit via
AHRC Web site, their preference for FA and be recruited by that FA for possible change of career field.
(3) Major.
(a) Upon selection to MAJ, an HQDA–level board will convene to determine what career field designation is best
suited for each officer. The board considers officer skills and experience, preference, and Army requirements. MAJs
not designated to the operations career field will be nominated to serve in 1 of the other 3 career fields: Operational
Support, Information Operations or Institutional Support. Selection into a career field other than Operations means that
Military Intelligence Branch will no longer manage the officer. Officers retained in the Operations career field will
attend the resident ILE course. Upon completion of ILE, MAJs must aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and
experience that will prepare them for duties as an LTC. The following are considered key desired developmental
assignments for Military Intelligence MAJs:
1. Army Corps of Engineers chief.
2. S2 of a BCT/Rgt/Grp.
3. XO or S3 of any Bn/Bde/Grp.
4. G2 planner.
5. Deputy G2.
6. Joint Staff (35 coded position).
7. Army Staff (35 coded position).
(b) MAJs must experience continuous self–development to fully master all aspects of Operations, including Joint
and multinational operations. Self–development may include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training. Officers must devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their warfighting perspective.
(c) As stated earlier, skills and experience will drive an officer’s career path and future assignments (see fig 19–1).

(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Officers selected for LTC must seek assignments of greater responsibility in the branch and generalist positions.
The objective in LTC assignments is to give officers the opportunity to make a greater contribution to the branch and
the Army. The following are considered key desired developmental assignments for LTCs:
1. Command Selection List battalion–level command.
2. Command Selection List division G2.
3. Deputy brigade commander.
4. Deputy Corps G2.
5. Army Corps of Engineers chief (Corps and above).
6. Joint Staff (CH, Intel Plans/Ops, JIC/JAC intelligence officer).
7. Army Staff (CH, Intel OPS/Plans).
(b) Completion of a 2 year assignment in a specific position is preferred.
(5) Colonel. COLs contribute to the branch by serving in critical assignments to include the following:
(a) Corps G2.
(b) Army G2.
(c) J2 (JSOC, JTFs, and so on).
(d) Military Intelligence brigade commander.
(e) TRADOC system manager.
(f) Joint Staff (CH, Intel Plans/OPS).
(g) Army Staff (35–coded COL intel position).
b. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Military Intelligence officers (CPT and above) can expect to serve
in branch/FA generalist (branch immaterial) assignments. These assignments may consist of instructor or Inspector
General positions allowing officers to develop wider perspectives of the Army or other Services.
c. Joint assignments. Military Intelligence officers can expect to be assigned to Joint duty. Joint experience is
important to the Army and is essential to individual officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions.
d. Critical warrant officer developmental assignments.
(1) Career development model. In subsequent areas, career development models are detailed by career fields and
MOS. A generic career development model, depicted in figure 19–2, consists of the 4 primary levels of WO utilization:

204

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

Figure 19–2. Military Intelligence warrant officer life cycle development and utilization

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

205

(2) Entry–level warrant officers. Entry–level WOs are accessed according to the needs of the Army. Once accepted,
the applicant must attend WOCS, conducted by the WOCC at Fort Rucker, AL. This is a high stress course, which
tests the mental, emotional, and physical stamina of candidates to determine their acceptability into the WO corps. The
focus of the course is common material that provides the skills, knowledge, and behaviors required of all WOs,
regardless of specialty. Upon course completion, the candidate is eligible for appointment to the grade of WO1, but is
not yet MOS–qualified.
(3) Basic–level warrant officer 1/chief warrant officer 2). After graduating from WOCS, the new WO1 must attend
the Military Intelligence Warrant Officer Basic Course (MIWOBC) conducted by the U.S. Army Military Intelligence
Center at Fort Huachuca, AZ. The MIWOBC provides functional training in the applicable Military Intelligence MOS
and reinforces the leadership training provided in WOCS. Upon successful completion of MIWOBC, the WO is
awarded a Military Intelligence MOS and given an initial operational assignment. Operational assignments continue for
the next several years. Throughout this period, WOs should continue their self–development, to include the pursuit of
civil education goals. The civil education goal at this career point is an associate’s degree or equivalent prior to
eligibility for selection to CW3. At approximately the 6th year of WO service, WOs can expect to be mandatorily
enrolled in prerequisite studies for the Warrant Officer Advanced Course, an MOS immaterial course administered by
the Distributive Education Section of the WOCC. Completion of this course renders the officer eligible to attend the
resident MIWOAC upon selection to the grade of CW3.
(4) Advance–level chief warrant officer 3/chief warrant officer 4). Warrant officers will attend the resident portion
of the MIWOAC not later than 1 year after promotion to CW3. Upon completion, WOs are normally assigned to
positions established for the grade of CW3. At this point, WOs should actively pursue the next civil education goal, a
baccalaureate degree or equivalent, prior to eligibility for selection to CW4. Warrant officers will attend the WOSC
conducted at the WOCC not later than 1 year after promotion to CW4. Upon graduation from WOSC, the WO will
serve in positions designated for the grade of CW4.
(5) Master–level chief warrant officer 5). Warrant officers will attend the WOSSC at the WOCC not later than 1
year after promotion to CW5. Upon promotion to CW5 and completion of the WOSSC, the WO will serve the
remainder of their career in positions designated for the grade of CW5.
(6) Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Warrant officers can expect to serve in Military Intelligence
MOS immaterial or staff assignments, such as instructors, that may or may not relate directly to their MOS, but which
are important to the Army.
e. Joint assignments. Given the Congressional mandate to increase Joint duty experience, WOs can expect consideration for assignment to Joint organizations. Joint experience is important to the Army and is essential in the
professional development of individual officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions.
f. Other assignments. Military Intelligence WOs may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated
above. Such assignments may include the White House, United Nations, and Reserve Component. The spectrum of
possible assignments is large, and these assignments are highly important, requiring mature, skilled, and well–grounded
officers.
19–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Officer preferences.
(1) Military Intelligence officers follow multiple career patterns to meet the needs of the Army. There is no single
ideal career pattern for Military Intelligence officers. Military Intelligence requirements and resulting officer career
patterns reflect a wide range of training and duty assignment responsibilities. Branch qualification as soon as possible
after promotion facilitates meeting Army requirements.
(2) Military Intelligence officers may apply for a number of skill producing programs. As a rule, selected Military
Intelligence officers may participate in only one of the following programs:
(a) Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (SI 3E). The Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities
Program emphasizes the need to provide warfighting commanders timely intelligence from national overhead systems
through national intelligence organizations. Military Intelligence officers who understand the limitation and capabilities
of the Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities Program systems effectively maximize available resources to
execute the collection management process at any level.
(b) National Systems Development Program (SI 3F) The National Systems Development Program is a 1–year
intensive academic program comprising various courses offered throughout the intelligence community. This program
is designed to develop a cadre of space smart collection managers who understand and have the ability to harness
national intelligence systems and capabilities and incorporate national level support into tactical intelligence collection
plans.
(c) Department of Defense Strategic Debriefing Course (SI 3Q). The Department of Defense Strategic Debriefing

206

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

Course is a 4–week, 3–day course that teaches methodology and techniques to conduct overt strategic debriefings and
intelligence report preparation.
(d) Junior Officer Cryptologic Career Program (SI 3W). The Junior Officer Cryptologic Career Program is a 3–year
program conducted at the National Security Agency at Fort Meade, MD. This program is designed to develop the
cryptologic skills and management practices of selected junior officers for future leadership roles in cryptologic
assignments.
(e) Advanced Civil Schooling Programs. Some Military Intelligence officers may receive the opportunity to participate in fully funded Advanced Civil Schooling programs that support Military Intelligence requirements. Officers
obtaining Army funded graduate degrees must serve in a 3–year Army Education Requirements System (AERS)
utilization tour.
(f) Postgraduate Intelligence Program. The Postgraduate Intelligence Program is a yearlong course of study at the
Joint Military Intelligence College conducted at Bolling Air Force Base, Washington, DC.
(3) Branch detail officers comprise a significant portion of total accessions. The Army details Military Intelligence
officers to Infantry, Armor, Field Artillery, Air Defense Artillery, and Chemical branches. Officers selected for branch
detail will attend the basic course of their detailed branch and serve a tour of up to 3 years with that branch. Branch
detail officers should lead troops at every opportunity. Following completion of their branch detail, MIOTC and the
MICCC, branch detail officers will follow the same career progression patterns as other Military Intelligence officers.
b. Warrant officer preferences. Military Intelligence has diverse assignment opportunities. The goal of the professional development of Military Intelligence WOs is to produce and sustain highly qualified tactically and operationally
oriented officers to lead Military Intelligence Branch in combat and on other assignment missions. Assignments in
Military Intelligence will develop the WO’s ability to achieve that goal.
19–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Key Military Intelligence Branch officer qualification positions. Officers should strive for a vast array of
experience gained through varied assignments at all echelons. This ensures the officer has acquired the skills to remain
proficient in Military Intelligence Branch at each grade and is qualified for promotion and retention in the branch. The
preferred amount of time spent in individual critical positions is 12–24 months.
b. Key Military Intelligence warrant officer qualification positions. Military Intelligence WOs are required to serve
in their primary or additional specialty. Once they have completed MIWOBC, Military Intelligence WOs normally
begin their career serving in tactical positions at division or below as WO1s or CW2s. Not later than 1 year after
promotion to CW3, WOs attend the advanced warrant officer course. Upon completion, CW3s spend about 5–6 years
serving in positions at Corps and echelons above Corps. Not later than 1 year after promotion to CW4, WOs attend the
WOSC, and upon completion, CW4s are often assigned to echelons above Corps or instructor positions. Not later than
1 year after promotion to CW5, WOs attend the WOSSC and spend the rest of their career in key staff, national or
Joint positions.
c. Military Intelligence Branch officer life cycle. Figure 19–1 depicts the Active Army Military Intelligence career
life cycle with key positions.
d. Military Intelligence warrant officer life cycle. Figure 19–2 displays Military Intelligence WO life cycle with key
operational assignments as well as institutional and self–development training.
19–6. Key Active Army officer life cycle assignments
a. Officer goal. Aligning authorizations with current inventory in Military Intelligence Branch while facilitating a
healthy and viable career path for Military Intelligence Branch officers. To effectively do this, the field inventory must
be optimized to meet branch authorizations.
b. Transformation. The number of Military Intelligence billets, by grade, will fluctuate as force structure decisions
are made. During this time of force realignment, Military Intelligence officers should focus on gaining experience at all
levels.
c. Troop leadership. Leadership experience continues to be a valuable experience for all officers. Military Intelligence officers should continue to serve with troops at all grades (from platoon leader to military intelligence brigade
commander).
d. Warrant officer goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy and viable career path for Military Intelligence WOs. This
involves optimizing the inventory to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support all
authorized WO positions, and to provide WOs with the optimum career pattern to develop their technical and
leadership skills.
e. Officer Personnel Management System implementation. The number of authorized Military Intelligence billets, by
grade, will fluctuate as force structure decisions are made. Officers desiring more information on branch authorizations
or inventory are encouraged to contact the Military Intelligence proponency office or the AHRC OPMD Military
Intelligence Branch assignment office.
f. Warrant Officer Personnel Management Study implementation. The numbers of authorized WOs, by grade, will
vary as force structure decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Warrant officers wanting more

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

207

information on Military Intelligence authorizations or inventory, by grade, should contact the Military Intelligence
career manager at AHRC WOD.
g. Requisition system. Since the Military Intelligence WO force structure exceeds the number of officers in the
Army, HRM OPMD uses the officer requisition and assignment process to meet Army requirements and manage WO
shortages across the force. Requisitions identify a need for an officer to fill a valid position at a designated location
during a specific reporting period. To accomplish that mission, the OPMD Distribution Division conducts a requisition
validation meeting covering each cycle. This meeting is preceded by HRC coordination with each requisition activity
(that is, DA G1, personnel manager or adjutant) and its MACOM headquarters. Decisions made during the validation
process are related directly to the generation and fill of requisitions. The period of time required to identify and
prioritize requirements, fill requisitions and move officers to a new assignment location is based on the Officer
Requisition Cycle System (7–9 months projection window).
h. Assignments process. Warrant officers should contact WOD early about assignment preferences. Assignment
considerations for WOs include—
(1) Education, skills, and experience.
(2) Professional development needs of the officer.
(3) Availability.
(4) Policy considerations, such as PCS costs, stabilization, and tour equity.
(5) Warrant officer’s potential for advancement.
(6) Personal preferences of the WO, including family and medical considerations. The marital status of a WO or the
employment, educational or volunteer activities of an officer’s spouse will not be considered in selecting an officer for
PCS or duty assignment. Exceptions are as follows— to resolve compassionate situations according to current policies,
to keep married Army couples together according to current policies, and to prevent a conflict of interest between an
officer’s duties and his spouse’s employment.
19–7. Key Active Army officer life cycle initiatives
a. Structure.
(1) Officer. Military Intelligence Corps structure is the classic case of an inverted pyramid. If all field grade
requirements were to be filled, far more Military Intelligence officers would have to be accessed at the grade of LT
than there are billets. This dilemma has led Military Intelligence to become the largest participant in the branch detail
program.
(2) Warrant officer. The Army has no plans to make significant changes to the structure of WOs through FY 2006.
There will be changes to the authorizations of those units based on the restructuring and recoding initiatives associated
with new missions. Other minor changes are possible due to the iterative nature of the restructuring and recoding
process.
b. Acquisition.
(1) Officers will continue to be accessed into the Military Intelligence Branch through the U.S. Military Academy
(USMA), Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC), and Officer Candidate School (OCS). Military Intelligence officer
accessions are based on preferences, qualifications, and needs of the Army. Military Intelligence Branch will also
continue to donate LTs to the branch detail program.
(2) Warrant officers will continue to enter into the Military Intelligence through NCO accessions. Accessions are
based on the needs of the Army. Because of the lack of specific civil school and opportunities for relevant experience,
there will be no opportunities for direct appointment as Military Intelligence WO.
c. Officer distribution.
(1) Officers will be provided assignment opportunities to develop the skills and experience necessary for service at
the next higher grade. The sequencing and timing of assignments is driven by Army priorities. The Global War on
Terrorism and Army Transformation are currently the driving forces behind the distribution of officers. Officers must
be ready to go on any contingency as it arises. Force Stabilization will also continue to influence officer distribution.
(2) The distribution pattern for Military Intelligence WOs continues to be a combination of assignments between
TOE and TDA units in CONUS and OCONUS. This will ensure that Military Intelligence WOs gain the requisite
technical skills across a broad spectrum of assignments.
d. Deployment.
(1) Military Intelligence Branch officers are warfighters who must remain personally and professionally prepared to
deploy worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to warfighter centric units or training organizations, readiness is
imperative to success of the mission. Officers must prepare themselves and their families for planned and no notice
deployments. In todays fast paced and uncertain operating environment, families must be ready for multiple deployments of unknown duration.
(2) Military Intelligence WOs are leaders and technicians who remain personally and professionally prepared to
deploy worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA
organizations, all Military Intelligence WOs must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of

208

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

conflict. Military Intelligence WOs may deploy with their units or as individuals to support Joint and multinational
operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace–keeping missions.
e. Sustainment Officer Personnel Management System.
(1) Officer.
(a) Promotion. Skills and experience, duty performance and adherence to branch requirements are all factors that
influence promotion. Promotion rates will be determined by Army needs and DOPMA goals.
(b) Commands. Commands at battalion– and brigade–level are organized into 4 functional categories— tactical,
training and strategic support, institutional, and TRADOC system manager (brigade–level only). Military Intelligence
officers are also centrally selected for division G2. Officers do have the option to compete for selection for command
and division G2 and have options to decline others without prejudice. Officers who are selected for command/G2 have
options to decline without prejudice 30 days after publication of board results. Since Command Select List process
continues to change, officers should contact Military Intelligence Branch to receive the latest information. The results
of the command selection process are announced in the Command Select List.
(c) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the link between officer development and OPMS III. At the
CPT–level the immediate rater together with the senior rater will make a recommendation concerning the officer’s
career field. The WO evaluation report remains unchanged.
(2) Warrant officer. There are 3 major actions which affect officer career development—
(a) Promotion. Warrant officers will compete for promotion based on the needs of the Army, branch requirements,
and the fully and best–qualified methods. Active Army and RC WOs will maintain their respective systems.
(b) Assignments. Military Intelligence WOs should strive to develop a career pattern to maximize their technical
expertise and leadership growth. This would include assignments at the tactical, operational and strategic level as well
as Joint, national, and in the training base. Solid performance at various levels of assignment is highly desirable
strategic level as well as Joint, national, and in the training base. Solid performance at various levels of assignment is
highly desirable.
(c) Warrant officer evaluation report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and
personnel management. Starting with WO1, the rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the career
development which best suits the Army’s needs and the WO’s abilities and interests.
f. Development.
(1) Officer development will occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in tactical, training,
and staff assignments. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly perform mission essential task
list–related function during Joint and combined arms operations. These tasks include, but are not limited to, development and validation of doctrine, training, and equipment.
(2) Warrant officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive Military
Intelligence–coded positions at all levels from tactical to national. Self–development continues to be an essential
component of WO development as well as resident training in the Army school system.
g. Separation.
(1) The officer separation process remains unchanged. The most current separation information can be found on the
HRC Web site— https://perscomonline.army.mil/tagd/retire/retire.htm.
(2) The WO separation process remains unchanged.
19–8. Military Intelligence Reserve Component officers
a. The Military Intelligence total force includes officers within the ARNG and the USAR. There are significant
opportunities for RC officers in troop units and as Selected Reserve in the Individual Mobilization Augmentee
Program. The opportunities range from LT to general officer positions.
b. All RC LTs branched Military Intelligence will serve in Intelligence positions within an RC troop unit or
Individual Mobilization Augmentee position. They must have favorable special background investigations prior to
attendance at MIOBC. Military Intelligence officers should follow the life cycle assignment pattern of upward mobile,
professionally challenging Intelligence assignments culminating in senior officer status. Such positions include—
battalion and brigade S2; Military Intelligence battalion and brigade commander; division G2; State Intelligence
officer; or strategic Military Intelligence detachment commander. Key intelligence positions with the RC are generally
the same as for Active Army (see fig 19–3).

Figure 19–3. Military Intelligence officer life cycle development and utilization

210

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

c. Required training and recommended branch developmental assignments by grade are as follows—
(1) Lieutenant.
(a) Complete resident MIOBC (within 24 months for USAR; 18 months for ARNG).
(b) Complete a tour in a Military Intelligence officer position.
(2) Captain.
(a) Complete the Military Intelligence Officer Transition Course (officers branch transferring into Military Intelligence only).
(b) Complete the Military Intelligence CCC.
(c) Complete a tour in a Military Intelligence officer position graded for CPT or higher.
(3) Major.
(a) Complete at least 50 percent of the non–resident Command and General Staff College. (Army National Guard
officers refer to NGR 600–100.)
(b) Complete tour in a Military Intelligence officer position graded for MAJ or higher.
(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Complete Command and Staff College. (Army National Guard officers refer to NGR 600–100.)
(b) Complete a tour in a Military Intelligence officer position graded for LTC or higher.
(5) Colonel. Complete a tour in a Military Intelligence officer position graded for COL or higher.
d. Emphasis is on serving in Military Intelligence positions regardless of unit. Reserve Component commands are
encouraged to assign Military Intelligence company grade officers to S2 positions in artillery, engineer or similar RC
troop units.
e. Reserve Component officers who are not Military Intelligence, but are selected to hold Military Intelligence
positions because there are no Military Intelligence officers available, must commit to branch transfer and must attend
MIOTC and MICCC. Reserve Component officers who branch transfer to Military Intelligence must be cleared for
special intelligence. All Military Intelligence RC officers must maintain their special intelligence clearance status
throughout their careers.
f. There are RC configured versions of MIOTC and MICCC that permit RC officers to complete the courses while
maintaining their civilian jobs. All Active Guard Reserve Military Intelligence officers will attend resident MICCC,
while all Active Guard Reserve branch transfers will attend both resident MIOTC and MICCC.
g. Military Intelligence RC troop unit and individual mobilization augmentee positions generally require the 35D
area of concentration. The basic All–Source Intelligence officer, 35D, satisfies most Military Intelligence RC requirements. However, the other Military Intelligence area of concentration is available on an as needed basis.
h. Military Intelligence RC WO development objectives and qualifications basically parallel those planned for their
Active Army counterparts. Junior WOs must develop a strong foundation through assignments in their branch. Even
though geographical considerations limit some RC WOs, all should strive for Military Intelligence assignments that
yield the same developmental opportunities as their Active Army counterparts (see fig 19–2).

Chapter 20
Civil Affairs Branch
20–1. Unique features of Civil Affairs Branch
a. Unique purpose of Civil Affairs Branch. Civil Affairs (38A) is a non–accession combat support branch (arm) in
the USAR. The branch identifies soldiers and units organized, trained, and equipped to command and conduct Civil
Affairs operations, activities, and support of civil–military operations. The Civil Affairs mission is to conduct operations that are planned, executed, and transitioned by functional specialists to mitigate or defeat threats to civil society
and assist in establishing the capability for deterring or defeating future civil threats. Civil Affairs operations are
inherently Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational in nature. These operations are conducted through,
with or by indigenous populations and institutions, international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, or other
governmental agencies applying all instruments of national power. Civil Affairs forms the nucleus of the Army’s
civil–military operations expertise for U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Army Special Operations
forces, and conventional forces. Civil Affairs forces provide military capabilities not available elsewhere in the armed
forces such as regional orientation, language, cross–cultural communication, and civilian acquired skills. Civil Affairs
soldiers and units operate independently or in support of assigned forces. They interact closely with indigenous
populations and institutions, international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, or other governmental agencies Functional area 38C is the Civil Affairs counterpart for Active Army officers.
b. Unique functions performed by Civil Affairs Branch. Civil Affairs is one of the 5 Army Special Operations forces

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

211

within the U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC). The focus of Civil Affairs is the civil component of
the operational environment. Civil Affairs forces enhance a commander’s ability to plan and conduct civil–military
operations. The Civil Affairs officer is an expert in the command and employment of Civil Affairs individuals, teams,
and units in support of these missions. Application of civilian core competencies, found exclusively in the USAR Civil
Affairs force, enables the force to assess, monitor, protect, reinforce, establish, and transition political, economic,
social, and cultural institutions and capabilities to achieve U.S. national goals and objectives at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of operation. Application of civilian core competencies found within the USAR Civil Affairs
functional specialties make the Civil Affairs Branch unique. These functional specialties fall in the systems or
organizations of: public health and welfare, public safety/rule of law, public administration/governance, public works/
infrastructure, business administration/economic stability, and public education and information. Knowledge of these
areas, coupled with detailed study of a country’s people, culture, history, politics, economy, language, institutions and
international organization are developed in military and civilian education programs, regularly scheduled unit training,
and in the civilian workplace. Civil Affairs forces support missions across the full range of military operations. Civil
Affairs units are oriented toward a specific region of the world and assigned areas of responsibility to regional
combatant commanders, but retain the capability of worldwide deployment and operations. They provide support to
conventional forces, other SOF units, and interagency organizations. Civil Affairs officers integrate the diplomatic,
information, military and economic principles into the operations of the combatant commander they are supporting and
units they command.
c. Unique features of work in Civil Affairs Branch.
(1) Civil Affairs core tasks. Civil Affairs core tasks include— Populace and Resources Control, Foreign Humanitarian Assistance (FHA), Civil Information Management, Support to Civil Administration and Nation Assistance/Civic
Action.
(2) Civil Affairs officer roles. The Civil Affairs officer develops, plans, coordinates, commands, controls, evaluates,
and transitions strategic, operational, and tactical Civil Affairs operations/civil–military operations policies, procedures,
doctrine, and activities for Army and Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational commands. The Civil
Affairs officer serves in Civil Affairs units or as the civil–military operations staff officer on a commander’s staff.
These positions require—
(a) General military expertise and knowledge to interface with other special, general, combined arms Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational staffs.
(b) Ability to plan, direct, execute, and transition Civil Affairs activities and synchronize the Civil Affairs activities
with the Information Operations Campaign Plan.
(c) Integration with the supported staff to facilitate maneuver operations, provide humanitarian assistance and/or
promote legitimacy of U.S. objectives.
(d) Preparing a civil–military operations estimate, Civil Affairs annex and conducting Civil Affairs assessments.
(e) Planning, establishing, and operating a Civil–Military Operations Center.
(f) Establishing and evaluating civil–military measures of effectiveness.
(g) Identifying, conducting, and transferring civil–military transition tasks to nongovernmental organizations, international organizations, indigenous populations and institutions or interagency organizations.
(3) Regional expertise. Regional expertise is a distinguishing characteristic of Civil Affairs officers. Civil Affairs
officers maintain individual and unit readiness to conduct Civil Affairs operations/civil–military operations, and Civil
Affairs activities in their assigned region of orientation. This is accomplished through continuing education, country
studies, and numerous operational and training deployments. This regional focus, coupled with specific cultural
awareness, ensures relevant Civil Affairs support to theater operational plans, contingency plans, functional plans,
combatant commanders, and ambassadorial initiatives.
(4) Opportunities to lead and command. The Civil Affairs officer may be selected to lead a variety of traditional and
non–traditional formations. On deployment operations, forces routinely include individuals and teams from other
branches, Services, and other countries supporting the full spectrum of Civil Affairs activities and operations and
civil–military operations.
20–2. Officer characteristics required
a. Unique skills. The core competencies for all Army Special Operations forces officers are— cross–cultural
communications, regional expertise, language ability, interpersonal skills, personal lethality (Warrior Ethos), adaptive
thinking and/or leadership and technical proficiency. The Civil Affairs officer is an expert in the command and
employment of Civil Affairs individuals, teams, and units in execution of these missions. Civil Affairs officers are
unique within Army Special Operations forces because they provide special or unique civilian core competency skills
listed in paragraph 20–1b. Foreign language skills are acquired through institutional training, self–development or unit
training. The Civil Affairs officer should strive to achieve a Defense Language Proficiency Test score of 1/1 in their
target language.
b. Unique knowledge. The Civil Affairs officer applies his/her civilian knowledge and cultural expertise to support
or enhance the military operation. The Civil Affairs officer understands how to interact effectively with civilian

212

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

representatives of foreign and indigenous populace and institutions located in the operational area. He/she is trained to
assess how civil areas, structures, capabilities, organizations, people, and events will help, hinder, or affect U.S. and
Coalition Military Operations.
c. Unique attributes.
(1) The human dimension is the differentiating factor that separates Army Special Operations forces from all other
military organizations. Army Special Operations forces are people–centric. Though fully comfortable and capable in
high technology oriented operations, their unique strength is their ability to accomplish the goals and objectives of the
Nation by operating through, with or by indigenous or surrogate populations and institutions. Army Special Operations
forces do not operate in an environment of black and white with clearly delineated boundaries. Their operational ethos
is not defined by mathematical equations, force ratios, platforms, or equipment. The Army Special Operations
forces–unique operational area is people— the human dimension, the human sensor, force multiplication, and ground
truth. The Army Special Operations forces Joint battlefield framework is space, air, land, sea, and the mind.
(2) Civil Affairs officers must have capacity for independent action. Civil Affairs officers must be warfighters able
to work in remote, austere, and often hostile environments. They must be able to make important decisions with little
or no immediate supervision. They must be self–reliant team players that can function as leaders in tightly knit small
groups.
(3) Due to the nature of work, Civil Affairs officers must be extremely mature professionals. Even at junior grades,
they are required to work at the highest levels of command organizations on sensitive issues, often briefing and
advising general officers, media representatives, senior U.S. and foreign government officials.
(4) Civil Affairs officers must be tolerant. They must demonstrate a spirit of cooperation and consideration for their
soldiers and others, and work well in the international, multicultural and Joint communities.
(5) Civil Affairs officers must be adaptable, flexible, and capable of independent operations in unstructured environments. They must be able to thrive in complex and ambiguous situations.
(6) Civil Affairs officers must be diplomatic in their approach and be able to influence and persuade persons from
other cultures. They must possess good interpersonal skills and display political awareness and cultural sensitivity.
(7) Civil Affairs officers must possess unquestioned integrity.
(8) Civil Affairs officers must be physically fit.
20–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. Development overview. Civil Affairs officer development will continue throughout their career life cycle with
progressive assignments in troop units, staff and institutional training assignments. In addition, officers complete their
professional military education requirements in order to remain competitive for HQDA selection boards and professional growth. All officers selected for MAJ must complete some form of MEL 4 training and all officers selected for
COL should complete MEL 1 training. In addition, self–development is key to all Civil Affairs officers. The
uniqueness of the branch requires officers to develop regional expertise and a foreign language capability through
self–development. The development goal is to access Civil Affairs officers at the tactical level and grow them to be
Civil Affairs campaign planners at the strategic level in support of combatant commanders.
b. Career life cycle development. The Civil Affairs Branch is a non–accession branch that draws its officers from all
other U.S. Army branches. Civil Affairs officers are expected to serve a successful initial tour as a small unit leader in
one of the other U.S. Army branches as an LT. As a result, they are expected to be an experienced U.S. Army leader
with a working knowledge of conventional Army operations and tactics. The majority of officers are accessed into
Civil Affairs as senior 1LTs, CPTs, and MAJs. Occasionally, LTCs with specific civilian skills in 1 of the special FAs
are accessed into the CA branch. They are accessed into the branch on a case–by–case basis. LTCs must receive a
waiver to attend the branch training and will receive the skill identifier 6K or one appropriate to their functional
specialty and can subsequently be awarded the branch after they have completed all branch requirements. The waiver
must be endorsed by their chain of command through CG USACAPOC for: CG, U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special
Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS), ATTN: AOJK–SP, Fort Bragg, NC 28310–9610. Civil Affairs officers
have already attended the CCC or Officer Advanced Course of their basic branch and continue to follow the U.S.
Army Officer Education System (OES) in accordance with OPMS III. The Civil Affairs Qualification Course is the
branch–producing course for USAR Civil Affairs officers. Those officers graduating from the Civil Affairs Officer
Advance Course (CAOAC) or the Mobilization Civil Affairs Course (MCAC) prior to the conversion to the Civil
Affairs Qualification Course are grandfathered and meet the course qualification for the Civil Affairs Branch. Civil
Affairs officers command Civil Affairs units at levels of increasing responsibility beginning with company as a MAJ,
battalion as an LTC, brigade as a COL, and command as a BG.
c. Accession. The Civil Affairs Branch is a non–accession branch. Officers selected for branch transfer must meet
the following criteria (requirements 20–3c(1) through (6) will not be waived):
(1) Completion of a resident branch officer basic course.
(2) Completion of a Basic Branch Officer Advanced Course, CCC or equivalent.
(3) Completion of Civil Affairs Qualification Course, CAOAC, or MCAC.
(4) Be assigned to a valid Civil Affairs, 38A or FA 38 or 39 position.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

213

(5) Possession of a bachelor’s degree.
(6) Possession of a valid security clearance of SECRET.
(7) A physical profile of 222221.
(8) In the grade of O–2 through O–4 (exception to policy outlined in paragraph 20–3b).
d. Desired qualifications. Due to the regional orientation of U.S. Army Reserve Civil Affairs units, a foreign
language skill and regional/cultural expertise is highly desirable. In addition, advanced civilian education and a strong
background in one of the Civil Affairs FAs are essential.
e. Opportunities for female soldiers. All branch 38 coded positions are open to women. This includes all positions in
Civil Affairs units and command positions.
f. Application procedures. Commissioned officers who meet the minimum criteria outlined above and desire a
branch transfer to the Civil Affairs Branch may apply as applicable—
(1) U.S. Army Reserve troop program unit (TPU) members not assigned to U.S. Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command (USACAPOC) may apply through their chain of command to Headquarters, U.S. Army John
F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS), ATTN: AOJK–SP, Fort Bragg, NC 28310–9610.
Troop program units members who fall under the control of USACAPOC may apply through their chain of command
to Headquarters, USASOC, ATTN: AOPE–RP, Fort Bragg, NC 28310–9610.
(2) Individual Mobilization Augmentee members may apply through their respective Personnel Management Officer
(PMO), USA HRC–St. Louis, 1 Reserve Way, St. Louis MO 63132–9610.
(3) Soldiers not assigned to USACAPOC units are authorized by exception to attend CA qualification training, but
will be ineligible to branch transfer until assignment to a CA unit and fulfillment of all qualification requirements.
Soldiers attending the MCAC or an abbreviated CA Qualification Course will be awarded the skill identifier 6K that
will serve as a pre-requisite for future branch/ career field designation. All requests for the 6K skill identifier must be
submitted to the Director of Special Operations Proponency, U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and
School (USAJFKSWCS), ATTN: AOJK–SP, Fort Bragg, NC 28310–9610 with substantiating documentation.
g. Waiver authority. The CG, USAJFKSWCS, is the proponent for all Army Special Operations forces and the final
authority for course prerequisites as well as CA qualification and branch transfer requirements. All requests for
exception to policy should be routed through the chain of command and addressed to the CG, USAJFKSWCS, ATTN:
AOJK–SP, Fort Bragg, NC 28310–9610.
h. Officer management. Upon acceptance for branch transfer, officers are managed as CA officers by HRC–St.Louis.
i. Assignment and schooling requirements. Civil Affairs officers must complete their operational assignments and
schooling to be considered best qualified in the branch at each grade. By meeting these requirements the officer has
acquired the skills and knowledge to remain proficient in the Civil Affairs Branch at that grade and is best qualified for
promotion in the branch. Officers are strongly encouraged, however, to attain exceptional qualification requirements in
the Civil Affairs Branch at each grade. Meeting exceptionally qualified requirements will increase the officer’s
probability of being selected for promotion, and increase the officer’s probability of retaining a TPU position. Meeting
exceptionally qualified requirements will also improve the possibility of command selection for LTC and COL grades.
Officers at all grades must recognize, however, the importance of performance in all assignments.
j. Key developmental assignments. The Civil Affairs Branch does not have assigned positions in the grade of LT. Its
officer development cycle is unique from the Active Army. Because of limited geographic location of Civil Affairs
units, the USAR definition of “key developmental” assignments is broader than Active Army officers. The following
list of assignments for CPTs and MAJs are recommendations to make the Civil Affairs officer the best qualified in the
Civil Affairs Branch at each grade and exceptionally qualified for future promotion within the USAR. Civil Affairs
officers can expect to execute these duties during scheduled TPU training events, or when participating in a wide
spectrum of missions and deployments in support of combatant commanders, Special Operations Commands (SOCs),
and participation in various CTC exercises (including BCTPs, Warfighters).
(1) First lieutenant and/or captain.
(a) Professional military education— completion of CCC, Officer Advanced Course, and Civil Affairs Qualification
Course.
(b) Assignments— Civil Affairs CPTs should successfully serve 24 months in any of the positions listed below or a
combination of these positions.
1. Civil Affairs Team–Alpha (CAT–A) team leader. The Civil Affairs Team–Alpha teams are lead by CPTs. These
teams are the basic maneuver element of Civil Affairs forces. During assignment as a Civil Affairs Team–Alpha team
leader, the CA CPT can expect to successfully accomplish many of these tasks: lead and train CA NCOs and soldiers
assigned to the team; employ civil–military operations staff augmentation and CA planning and assessment support to
maneuver commanders; provide trained linguistic, regional, and cultural expertise to supported commanders; plan,
execute, and transition CA operations and civil–military operations tasks in support of both conventional and SOF
forces in a JIM environment; and employ a Civil Affairs Team–Alpha to conduct CA operations and civil–military
operations.
2. Civil Affairs Company Headquarters (Civil Affairs Team–Bravo (CAT–B)). CPTs are company–level operations
officers within a Civil Affairs Team–Bravo. During assignment in a Civil Affairs Team–Bravo, CA CPTs can expect to

214

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

successfully accomplish many of these tasks— provide civil–military operations staff support to brigade level organizations and assist the command and control of Civil Affairs Team–Alpha; plan, coordinate, and conduct CA activities in
support of CA operations and/or civil–military operations; provide a supported command with advice, coordination,
and staff assistance on the employment of CA capabilities and issues relating to the civil populace; update CA
operations and/or civil–military operations estimates, CA, CA operations and civil–military operations annexes and area
assessments; assist in establishing and operating a CMOC.
3. Functional specialty company team member (tactical CA battalion). CPTs are detachment–level operational
officers on one of the 4 functional specialty teams. During assignment on a functional specialty company team, CA
CPTs can expect to successfully accomplish many of the tasks in one of the CA functional specialties— provide
technical expertise, advice; determine capabilities and effectiveness of systems and their impact on CA operations and/
or civil–military operations; develop plans and provide operational oversight and supervision for rehabilitating or
establishing systems, agencies, and resources; advise and assist in restoring, establishing, organizing, and operating
public systems and agencies; advise and assist in developing technical requirements, policies, and procedures for
providing government services to the local population; assist in planning, organizing, and coordinating international
organizations, nongovernmental organizations, U.S. Government assistance and resources to support local government
care; coordinate the use of government and commercial supplies, equipment, and other resources for military use, CA
operations and/or civil–military operations, and government support.
4. Staff officer. Primary developmental assignment for CA CPTs is duty as a primary staff officer (S1, S4) or
assistant S3 in a CA battalion. Civil Affairs staff officer responsibilities are similar to other U.S. Army branches, a
detailed listing of duties and responsibilities are listed in FM 101–5, chapter 4.
(c) Self–development goals— In addition to professional development through operational assignments, CA CPTs
should begin an intensive military self–development program. Their efforts should focus on gaining an in–depth
understanding of combined arms Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational operations; gaining and
maintaining regional and linguistic expertise; and becoming proficient in CA common core and branch tasks and in
their civilian acquired expertise. Officers must be physically fit and meet the special operations forces validation
requirements. Suggested officer development courses: Regional Studies Course, SOF courses at Joint Special Operations University, CIMIC NATO courses and FEMA courses.
(2) Major.
(a) Professional military education. However, under ROMPA and best–qualified promotion selection officers should
complete 100 percent of CGSC/ILE and Army MEL 4 OES requirements to remain competitive with other RC
branches.
(b) Assignments. Civil Affairs MAJ assignments include planning, executing, and transitioning CA and
civil–military tasks, employing CA and other soldiers and leading and developing subordinates. MAJs should successfully serve 24 months in any of the positions listed below or a combination of these positions.
1. Civil Affairs company commander. MAJs command CA companies. During assignment as a CA company
commander, MAJs can expect to successfully accomplish many of these tasks— command and lead CA officers, NCOs
and soldiers assigned to a CA company; direct collective training of a CA company; direct the planning, coordination,
and conduct of CA activities in support of CA operations and/or civil–military operations; provide a supported
command with advice, coordination, and staff assistance on the employment of CA capabilities and issues relating to
international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and other governmental agencies; employ Civil Affairs
Team–Bravos, Civil Affairs Team–Alphas, and functional teams to conduct CA operations and/or civil–military
operations; establish and operate a CMOC.
2. Staff officer. Primary developmental assignment for a CA MAJ is duty as a primary staff officer (S3, XO) in a
CA battalion (tactical CA and/or Special Operations battalion). Civil Affairs staff officer responsibilities are similar to

3. Functional specialty team. MAJs lead one of the functional specialty teams on a tactical CA battalion and serve
on one of the specialty teams at brigade and CA command. During assignment on a functional specialty team, CA
MAJs can expect to employ the team to provide technical expertise, advice, and assistance in identifying and assessing
the CA functional specialties.
4. General staff officer. Provides professional development at one of the staff sections at the command, MSC, and
MACOM level.
5. Senior staff. Service as an HQDA, DOD, JCS, SOC and Joint or combined headquarters staff officer or in
interagency positions requiring CA experience and expertise. Active Guard Reserve officers generally hold these
positions. However, USAR TPU officers may serve in these positions during TTAD and ADSW tours.
(c) Self–development goals. There is much greater emphasis on self–development at the field grade level, with the
focus on more general areas of knowledge rather than on specific tasks. Officers without a master’s degree should
consider enrolling in a civil college or university and earning an advanced degree. Civil Affairs MAJs should maintain
and enhance their regional and cultural expertise, develop their civilian acquired expertise and continue their military
self–development reading program. Officers should consider membership in professional organizations within 1 of the
6 functional specialties. Officers must remain physically fit and meet special operations forces validation requirements.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

skill identifiers described in AR 600–3; and meet special operations forces validation requirements.
20–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. The assignment of TPU CA officers is based upon authorized vacancies within the units of the
USACAPOC. These units are located throughout CONUS and Hawaii. The majority of officers will elect assignment to
CA units in close proximity to their residence. Assignment opportunities allow CA officers to become regional experts
and remain proficient in one of the CA specialty areas. The goal of CA officer development is to produce officers that
can assimilate into Army and JIM staffs and immediately integrate CA plans and principles into the deliberate planning
process.
b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions has precedence, although there is flexibility on the
sequence of assignments. Ideally, CA branch officers should seek assignments in the following order: CA Team-A, CA
Team-B and/or functional specialty team leader; staff officer at the battalion, brigade, command, MSC, MACOM level;
executive officer, and command at the company, battalion, brigade, command level. In addition, assignments at the
Joint, SOCs, Joint theater staffs, HQDA and OSD are important to Army and essential to individuals officers for their
advancement into senior leadership positions.
c. Active Guard and Reserve officers.
(1) General. The Civil Affairs branch has AGR officers who are controlled by the Army Reserve Active Duty
Management Directorate (ARADMD), HRC- ST. Louis, MO. AGR soldiers must be able to perform as Subject Matter
Experts in a variety of skills, and at lower organizational levels must gain and maintain 2 sets of skills: Army Reserve
Unit Readiness (largely administrative in nature-orders, budgets, training programs, Unit Status Reports, and so forth)
and SOF tactical and technical proficiency. As these soldiers progress in their careers, the required skill set grows to

216

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

encompass management of resources (people structure, dollars), and a comprehensive knowledge of Joint operational
concepts.
(2) Education. Civil Affairs AGR officers should attend Active Army "Long Courses" when possible. These courses
allow AGR officers to interact and share diverse experiences with their active component counterparts. Officers attend
the Professional Development Education (PDE) at their appropriate grade and as early in their tour as possible. The
goal for every CA AGR officer is selection to a resident ILE and Senior Service College (SSC). In addition, every
effort should be made to attend Joint education to prepare officers for a number of Joint assignments available to SOF
AGR officers.
(3) Duty assignments. The CA AGR officers’ career development cycle should seek progressive duty positions
beginning with CA Battalions. However, there are restrictions on duty assignments because of MTOE and TDA
coding. AGR duty assignments are managed through the Slating Panel to identify SOF AGR officers for reassignment
approximately 12–18 months out. Civil Affairs officers entering the AGR program should conduct an initial tour of
assignment at a TPU, followed by assignment at Major Subordinate Command (MSC) or Major Army Command
(MACOM). These assignments develop CA officers Army Special Operations forces core competencies in preparation
for assignment on a Joint, SOC or HQDA staff.
20–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Civil Affairs key developmental assignments. Officers in the CA branch should serve ideally for a minimum of 24
months in the following types of assignments:
(1) Commanders of CA commands, brigades, battalions and companies.
(2) Civil–military operations officers and staff officers, at all levels, in CA units.
(3) CA functional team and section leaders, at all levels, in CA units.
(4) CA instructors in service schools, including Joint service schools.
(5) Unified and specified command staff positions that plan civil-military operations and civil affairs operations.
(6) Members of CA support teams, for example, theater, operational, tactical in a theater of operations.
b. Civil Affairs branch life cycle. Figure 20–1 displays the CA branch life cycle with key developmental positions.

218

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

20–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for CA branch officers. The numbers of CA authorized billets
allow adequate career progression for CA officers.
20–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Civil Affairs
a. Structure. Structure changes to CA battalions MTOE will be implemented in FY 2005.
b. Acquire. Officers recruited into the branch should be in the grade of O–3 and O–4, have troop leading experience,
and as a minimum be an advance course graduate from other U.S. Army basic branches.
c. Distribute. The vast majority of CA branch authorizations exist within the TPU of the US Army Civil Affairs and
Psychological Operation Command (USACAPOC). These units are supported by Civil Affairs AGR officers at the
grade of O3 through O6. A limited number of IMA and IRR authorizations in both TDA and TOE units exist for
officers who may be constrained by the geographic locations of CA units.
d. Development. The Civil Affairs Qualification Course has replaced the CAOAC as the branch-producing course
for all Civil Affairs officers. The prerequisites for enrollment in the Civil Affairs Qualification Course are— advance
course graduate or equivalent in the grade of O–3 and O–4 and assigned to a valid 38A/CA position.
e. Deployment. Civil Affairs officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide on short notice. Whether assigned IRR, IMA, TPU or AGR programs, all CA officers must be deployable to
accomplish missions across the full spectrum of operations. CA officers may activate and deploy with their units to
deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests. CA officers and enlisted soldiers may be deployed as
individuals to support JIM operations. CA branch officers must prepare themselves and their families for this most
challenging career development function.
f. Transition. CA officers may transfer between CA units as civilian jobs or promotion opportunities arise. They are
separated from the USAR in accordance with AR 135–175.

c. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. All Adjutants General’s Corps officers will serve branch/FA
generalist positions, such as instructors and IGs, during various stages in their career. Moreover, officer branch/FA
generalist assignments allow the Army the flexibility to fill important positions from any one of the 4 career fields.
Whenever possible, Adjutant General’s Corps officers should seek branch/FA generalist positions which fill an Army
requirement while professionally developing the officer.
d. Joint assignments. Adjutant General’s Corps officers can expect to be considered for Joint duty assignments.
There are Joint authorizations and Joint branch/FA generalist positions for AG branch officers to fill worldwide. Joint
experience is important to the Army and is essential to individual officers for their ability to train and equip Soldiers
and grow leaders and to provide relevant and ready land power to Combatant Commanders and the Joint Team. .
e. Nominative assignments. Adjutant General’s Corps officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond
those indicated above. Those assignments may include; duty with Special Operations Forces, White House Fellows,
duty with the National Security Council, the United Nations, and other international staffs, as well as Adjutant
General’s Corps representatives at Allied service schools. The spectrum of possible assignments is large and these
assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and important, and requiring mature, skilled, and wellgrounded officers.
21–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. The Adjutant General’s Corps has diverse assignment opportunities that allow for different career
development paths. The goal of the professional development of the Adjutant General’s Corps officers is to produce
and sustain highly qualified, tactically and operationally oriented officers to lead the branch in combat and other
assigned missions. Assignments in AG branch will be made to develop the officer’s ability to achieve that goal.
Requests from officers for assignments that do not contribute to achieving that goal will likely be disapproved.
b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility
on the sequence of assignments. Typically, Adjutant General’s Corps officers (except 42C) should seek assignments in
the following order: Officer Basic Course, company XO, battalion S1/adjutant, postal platoon leader, band executive
officer (42C), Captains Career Course, company/detachment command, UA, UEx or UEy staff, associate bandmaster
(42C), nominative assignment, Command and Staff College, battalion S3 or XO, command of a MACOM band (42C)
(as a MAJ), battalion level command or UEx G1, Senior Service College, and unit of action level command or
command of a special band (42C).
21–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Key Adjutant General’s Corps positions. At each grade, the amount of time spent in key or critical assignments
must be monitored to ensure that officer professional development is optimized. At the rank of Captain, AG Corps
officers should serve at least 24 months in any AG branch assignment. The OPMS goal for Majors is to spend 3 years
in an operational unit with 2 years spent in either a traditional or technical AG branch position. LTCs and COLs

228

selected for command will serve 2 years in battalion and brigade commands. Officers selected for garrison command
may have command tours up to 3 years in length.
b. Adjutant General’s Corps branch life cycle. Figure 21–1 displays the Adjutant General’s Corps branch life cycle.
Additionally, it identifies branch standards and developmental assignments that increase promotion potential.
c. Adjutant General’s Corps WO life cycle. Figure 21–2 displays an Adjutant General’s Corps WO life cycle model
with key developmental positions that will provide leadership opportunities and development of technical competency.
21–6. Key Active Army officer life cycle initiatives
The following section provides branch life cycle function and highlights changes associated with implementing Force
Stabilization Initiatives and Transformation.
a. Structure. AG positions are found at all echelons in TOE, MTOE, and TDA. The Total Army Analysis 09
resourced Corps Personnel Management Centers and began the Personnel Transformation, phase I. Phase I resulted in
the approval of personnel platoons, personnel companies at division and theater and personnel battalions at corps and
theater.
b. Acquisition. Officers will continue to be accessed through USMA, ROTC and Officer Candidate School. Warrants
will continue to be recruited form the Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) Corps. Both officer and WO accessions are
based on preference, qualifications and needs of the Army. The branch will also remain a recipient of branch detailed
officers from other combat support/combat service support branches.
c. Officer distribution. Officers will be provided assignment opportunities to develop the skills and experience base
necessary for service at the next higher grade. The sequencing and timing of assignments are driven by Army priorities.
The Global War on Terrorism, imminent contingency operations and Army Transformation are currently driving forces
behind the distribution of officers. Force Stabilization will also continue to influence officer distribution. Generally,
officers assigned to stabilized installations will be initial entry officers from OBC. These officers will be assigned to an
installation for approximately 7 years. During this time, the officer will complete their platoon leader and LT years.
Many of these officers will then proceed to the CPTs’ career course and return to the same installation to complete
company command. The remaining officers will be reassigned to other installations for command and positions in
accordance with the needs of the Army. Field grade officers will be assigned to Stabilized Installations for a period of
time to complete a minimum of 2 years time on station with a goal of 3 years. The officers will gain tactical and
operational experience that will benefit them and the Army in their development in future positions.
(1) Life cycle units. Officers at all levels may be assigned to life cycle units (generally the Stryker Brigade and Units
of Action (Brigade Combat Teams) will remain in the unit for a minimum of 3 years. The officer will complete LT
development, company command, or MAJ development during this time. Officers in these units have the possibility of
greater than average time in platoon leader, command, or MAJ positions. Branch detail officers will remain in their
detail branch until after completion of the assignment to the BCT.
(2) Cyclic units. The majority of the installations and EAD CSS units will be managed on a cyclic manning system.
Replacements will be sent to these units and installations periodically to maintain readiness of the units. Tour lengths
and developmental positions opportunities can vary. Branch detail officers will remain on standard branch detail
timelines.
d. Deployment. Officers are war fighters who must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide - at all times. Whether assigned to war fighter centric units or training organizations, readiness is imperative
to success of the mission. Officers must prepare themselves and their families for planned and no notice deployments.
In today’s fast- paced and uncertain operating environment, families must be ready for multiple deployments of
unknown duration.
e. Sustainment.
(1) Promotion. Skills and experience, duty performance, and adherence to branch requirements are all factors that
influence promotion. Promotion rates will be determined by Army needs/DOPMA goals.
(2) Command. Commands at battalion and brigade level are organized into 4 functional categories: tactical, training
and strategic support, institutional and TSM (Brigade only). Officers do have the option to compete for selection to the
desired command category and can decline others without prejudice. Officers who are selected for command have
options to decline without prejudice 30 days after the publication of board results. Since the Command Select List
(CSL) process continues to change, officers should contact branch to receive the latest information. The results of the
command selection process are announced in the CSL.
(3) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the link between officer development and OPMS. At CPT the
immediate rater together and the senior rater will make a recommendation concerning the officer’s career field. The
warrant evaluation report remains unchanged.
(4) Development. Officer development will occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in
tactical, training and staff assignments. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly perform METL related
function during Joint and combined arms operations. These tasks include, but are not limited to development and
validation of doctrine, training and equipment.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

229

f. Separation. The officer separation process for remains unchanged. The most current separation information can be
found on the HRC webpage at: https://www.perscomonline.army.mil/tagd/retire/retire.htm.
21–7. Adjutant General’s Corps Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. The Reserve Component (Army National Guard (ARNG) and U.S. Army Reserve
(USAR) officers play an important role in the mission of the Adjutant General’s (AG) Corps. The wartime effectiveness of the AG Corps is highly dependent upon the quality of AG officers in ARNG and USAR units, as well as the
Individual Ready Reserve (IRR). For guidance on Reserve Component (RC) officer development see chapter 7.
(1) RC AG Corps officers are assigned to AG branch positions in TOE units or TDA organizations at ARNG or
USAR commands where they perform the same functions as Active Army AG Corps officers. Their peacetime duties
will be similar to their wartime duties. However, they will also include those separate RC personnel management,
administrative, and operational reporting requirements unique to the ARNG and the USAR.
(2) RC career progression is often constrained by the geographic dispersion of units. Often there are not sufficient
positions in a geographic area to continue in AG branch assignments. Planned rotation into progressively challenging
branch related positions by RC commands is essential to producing the best-qualified AG officers. This includes
assignments between TPU organizations, IRR, and individual mobilization augmentee positions. If geographic constraints are such that assignments to AG branch positions is not possible, officers are encouraged to seek qualification
and assignments in another branch or FA required in the geographic region.
(3) Officers in the IRR may find assignments in Reinforcement Training Units (RTU), Individual Mobilization
Augmentee (IMA) positions in active Army organizations, installations or HQDA agencies, as well as tours of Active
Duty for Special Work (ADSW) or annual training. Assignment in the IRR can also be used for completing
professional military education.
(4) Job opportunities and assignments are the same for both male and female officers.
b. Branch development opportunities.
(1) Reserve Component (RC) branch development standards for commissioned officers are as follows: (Figure 21–3
Reserve Component (RC) Adjutant General’s Corps Officer Development and Utilization)
(a) LT phase (years 1 to 6). The Adjutant General (AG) Officer Basic Course (AGOBC) is the starting point for
newly accessioned Adjutant General’s Corps officers. RC officers should complete the resident AGOBC by the second
year of service. Officers should seek to serve in more than one unit position during this phase allowing for maximum
exposure to the diversified functions within an AG unit. Officers are encouraged to actively participate in professional
reading programs and continued corresponding studies.
(b) Captain phase (years 7 to 13). AG officers must complete either the resident Captains Career Course (AGCCC)
or the Adjutant General Officers Advanced Course (AGOAC) - Reserve Component (RC). AGOAC - RC includes nonresident instruction and an Active Duty for Training (ADT) phase at the U.S. Army Adjutant General School. Officers
who have completed an OAC in a different branch may complete the AGOAC - RC to satisfy branch requirements.
During this phase, all officers are highly encouraged to pursue a specialty related undergraduate or graduate degree.
(c) Major phase (years 14 to 21). During this phase, officers should enroll in and complete ILE education and
pursue a specialty related graduate degree. Adjutant General’s Corps officers should seek further development in AG
branch assignments during this phase.
(d) Lieutenant colonel phase (years 21 to 26). During this phase, officers should seek professional military
education at the Senior Service College level. Officers may seek assignment to senior command and staff positions.
(e) Colonel phase (years 26 to 30). Assignments during this phase should provide for maximum utilization skills in
the Adjutant General Corps or a FA.

Chapter 22
Finance Corps Branch
The Army is building capability for both current and future forces, reorganizing Army forces into modular,
brigade–based unit designs in order to enable rapid packaging and responsive, sustained employment. The emerging
designs of the Units of Employment (UE) and Units of Action (UA) have precipitated the requirement to adjust the
approved Financial Management Redesign (FMR) Force Design Update (FDU) 03–1 concept and design to support the
Army’s evolving modular brigade–based Army. Therefore, the intent of this chapter is to address both current and
future units, positions and job titles.
22–1. Unique features of Finance Corps Branch
a. Unique purpose of Finance Corps Branch. The Finance Corps is a combat service support branch in the
Operations career field. Finance Corps officers have the critical mission of sustaining Army, Joint, coalition, and
multinational operations. The Financial Corps mission is to analyze the commander’s tasks and priorities to ensure that
proper financial resources are available to accomplish the mission; provide recommendations for the commander on the
best allocation of scarce resources; fund Army, Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational operations;
provide commercial vendor and contracting support; provide disbursing, banking, and currency services; provide
non–U.S. pay support (Enemy Prisoner of War (EPW) or civilian internee); capture cost and provide accounting for
local procurement, host nation support, contracted payments; and provide limited in–theater U.S. pay support and travel
payments. Finance officers are the Army’s financial managers and are usually among the 1st to establish a new
operating area by laying the critical groundwork for banking, procurement, and contracting support for host nation
assistance for the commander.
b. Unique functions performed by Finance Corps Branch. Finance Corps officers organize, train, and lead soldiers in
providing disbursement, commercial vendor service and forward pay support in the contemporary operating environment (COE). They command finance detachments, financial management companies, battalions, groups, and commands, and perform staff functions at the sustainment brigade, Theater sustainment command, UEy G–8, Financial
Management Center, as well as several duties in the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) operational
base. Additionally, they disburse and account for U.S. Treasury funds; provide pay support to soldiers, non–combatants/family members, and enemy prisoners of war/detainees; manage financial information systems; provide professional analysis of financial data necessary for the efficient use of funds, materiel and personnel; and provide force
protection. Finance Corps officers have opportunities to command and serve in other leadership positions where they
develop the necessary command and staff expertise, financial management expertise, and professional competence
required for senior Army staff and leadership positions.
c. Unique features of work in the Finance Corps Branch. Finance Corps officers perform in a number of financial
management areas at the tactical, operational, strategic, and Joint levels.
(1) Disbursement of public funds.
(2) Commercial vendor support.
(3) Banking.
(4) Travel and transportation allowances.
(5) Financial management information systems.
(6) Accounting.
(7) Auditing.
(8) Military pay support.
(9) Reporting and analysis
22–2. Officer characteristics required
a. General. For entry into the Finance Corps, an officer should have a baccalaureate degree with a minimum of 6
academic (semester) hours of accounting or finance. Degrees specializing in finance, accounting, business, economics,
mathematics, computer sciences or information systems are most beneficial in supporting the Finance Corps mission.
b. Unique skills.
(1) Attitude. Finance officers possess strong Army Values and embody the Warrior Ethos, leader attributes and
leader skills, understanding the key leadership actions that must be taken to assure success.
(2) Accountability. Finance officers are accountable for the security of U.S. government funds, property, and
personnel.

(2) Officers gain financial technical knowledge through mentoring and a logical sequence of continuous education,
training, and experience.
d. Unique attributes.
(1) Diverse. Finance officers must be leader–oriented and analytical. They are warfighters first; and are proficient at
mastering branch technical requirements.
(2) Responsible. Finance officers have pecuniary liability for all transactions processed in their unit.
(3) Flexible. Finance officer responsibilities at field grade levels become increasingly multi–functional. Officers
must develop and use a diverse set of skills as they move between branch leadership positions in MTOE and TDA
positions, and as they serve in branch/staff generalist assignments (branch immaterial), for example, USAREC staff,
ROTC, or USMA instructor, Active Army/RC duty, and so forth.
22–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. Branch enhancing skills, knowledge, attributes, experience, and development.
(1) Lieutenant.
(a) After completing the Finance Basic Officer Leader Course (FBOLC), officers can expect an assignment at the
detachment, financial management company, or battalion/brigade staff to develop leadership experience and to enhance
technical competence in various financial management capacities. Typical duty assignments include detachment financial management company, or battalion disbursing officer.
(b) During the LT phase, officers should acquire and expand troop leading, staffing, logistics, and administrative
skills while becoming proficient in finance specific tasks.
(c) Finance officers who participate in the branch detail program should complete the Finance Officer Branch
Qualification (FOBQ) course at the end of the detail assignment in preparation of a Finance Corps Branch enhancing
assignment.
(d) Typical duty assignments for Finance LTs are—
1. Detachment Disbursing Officer.
2. Battalion/FM Company Disbursing Officer.
3. Company Executive Officer.
4. Training Company Executive Officer
(2) Captain.
(a) Officers will attend the Finance Captains Career Course (FCCC) after their initial branch experience assignments. The FCCC prepares the officer for detachment command, FM company executive officer, generalist company
command, and staff duties at battalion, sustainment brigade, FMC/USAFINCOM, or higher levels. CPTs are encouraged to aggressively prepare for and seek detachment command and financial management company executive officer
assignments. Other assignments include— battalion operations officer, training/combat developer, Finance School
instructor or staff, service school instructor, and various staff assignments. Completion of the FCCC and Finance coded
positions such as detachment command for 18 to 24 months should provide the officer the skills, knowledge, attributes,

leader at the detachment and financial management company level in all aspects of financial management operations
and in leading soldiers. CPTs gain a working knowledge of command principles, staff operations, combined arms
operations, and Finance operations from company to brigade levels.
(d) Active duty CPTs who have successfully acquired finance skills, knowledge, attributes, and experience can
expect other assignments consistent with the needs of the Army. These assignments may or may not be directly related
to the Finance Corps Branch, but they are important to the Army. These include—
1. Branch/FA generalist (branch immaterial) positions, for example, USAREC, ROTC or USMA faculty and staff,
Active Army/RC duty, and so forth.
2. Other nominative assignments, for example, Training With Industry, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) intern or Office
of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Fellow, aide–de–camp, and so forth.
3. Advanced Civil Schooling (ACS) is based on overall Army requirements. Officers may compete for these limited
allocations as a CPT during years 7 through 10 in the Finance branch career life cycle (fig 22–1).

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

235

(e) Finance officers will submit FA preference statements between their 5th and 6th years of service. Functional area
preferences are accepted based on the needs of the Army, officer preference, military experience and, in some cases,
civil schooling. Officers should understand that FA assignments might cause them to become pre–accessed into that
FA. Officers that accept FA ACS assignments are automatically pre–designated into that FA and will not return to the
operations career field.
(3) Major.
(a) Officers that have not been pre–accessed or pre–designated to an FA will undergo a career field designation
board immediately following selection for MAJ. This board of senior officers will decide in which career field each
officer is best suited to serve. MAJs will have an opportunity to seek designation in one of the other 3 career fields:
Operational Support, Information Operations, and Institutional Support. After career field designation, officers will
compete for promotion only within their designated career field. Finance officers who remain in the Operations career
field will receive assignments to both branch operational and generalist assignments. The ILE is essential to a MAJ’s
professional development. Completion of ILE and a TOE assignment for 18 to 24 months fulfills the minimum skills,
knowledge, attributes, and experience required for future branch assignments.
(b) Branch positions that enhance an officer’s experience, skills, knowledge, and attributes are—
1. Financial management company commander.
2. Brigade Support, Plans, and Operations Officer (SPO).

Active Army/RC support, White House Fellow; ROTC/USMA faculty and staff; USAREC; and Army Service
Component Command staff.
(d) To be competitive for key developmental positions as an LTC, MAJs in the Operations career field should
aggressively seek various brigade (FINCOM, sustainment brigade, Theater sustainment command), UEy, FMC level
assignments, as well as Battalion XO, FMC, or FINCOM operations officer.
(e) MAJs should continue self–development efforts to expand expertise in all aspects of finance management to
include Joint and multinational operations. Self–development should include distance–learning courses, civilian education leading to a graduate or higher degree, and institutional training. Obtaining the Certified Defense Financial
Manager accreditation is encouraged and is a significant indicator of mastering finance skills, knowledge, and
attributes, but not required for promotion.
(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Officers selected for LTC should seek assignments of greater responsibility in branch and branch generalist
positions. The objective for LTC assignments is greater contributions to the branch and the Army. Critical branch
enhancing assignments for LTCs include Command Selection List (CSL) battalion level command and TOE staff
positions. Completion of a TOE assignment for 24 months fulfills the minimum skills, knowledge, attributes, and
experience required for future branch assignments.
(b) Branch positions that enhance an officer’s experience, skills, knowledge, and attributes are—
1. Battalion Command.
2. Theater Sustainment Command SPO.
3. Financial management company/USAFINCOM Staff Officer.

RC duty, and so on.
(d) LTCs should complete resident Senior Service College, or apply for the U.S. Army War College Distance
Education Course non–resident training. Obtaining the Certified Defense Financial Manager accreditation is highly
encouraged and is a significant indicator of mastering finance skills, knowledge, and attributes at the senior officer
level.
(5) Colonel.
(a) Finance COLs contribute to the branch by serving in critical assignments at the operational, Joint, and strategic

236

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

levels. Completion of a TOE assignment for 24 months fulfills the minimum skills, knowledge, attributes, and
experience required for future branch assignments.
(b) Branch positions that enhance an officer’s experience, skills, knowledge, and attributes are—
1. Chief, Financial Management Company.
2. Commandant, Finance School.
3. Brigade or Group Command.
4. Commander, USAFINCOM.
5. Director/commander, DFAS Field Site.
(c) Other assignments include selected positions in the U.S. Army Soldier Support Institute; Joint/HQDA/MACOM
staff; UEy/installation staff, and garrison/USAREC commands.
(d) COLs should attend Senior Service College or complete it by correspondence. Obtaining the Certified Defense
Financial Manager accreditation is highly encouraged and is a significant indicator of mastering finance skills,
knowledge, and attributes at the senior officer level.
b. Other assignments. Finance Corps Branch officers may experience assignments to organizations and duties
beyond those indicated above. Finance officers can expect consideration for Joint duty assignments. This experience is
essential to individual officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions. Other assignments may include
White House Fellows, Army Staff, United Nations and other international staffs, as well as Finance Corps Branch
representatives at Allied and other Service schools. The spectrum of possible assignments is large and these assignments are characterized as highly responsible and important, requiring mature, skilled and well–grounded officers.
22–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. The Finance Corps Branch has diverse assignment opportunities that allow numerous career development paths. The goal of professional development is to produce and sustain highly qualified tactically and technically
proficient officers who can lead, think, and leverage existing and future technology. Along with stabilization, 36–month
assignments in the Finance Corps will develop the officer’s ability to achieve that goal.
b. Precedence. Assignments to developmental leadership positions and unit stabilization stages take precedence,
although there is flexibility on the sequence of assignments.
22–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Key Finance Corps positions. Under the stabilization concept, Finance CPTs may serve as detachment commanders for 18 to 36 months. MAJs, LTCs, and COLs serving in command positions may spend 36 to 48 months based on
stabilization stages/deployments. Those LTCs and COLs not in command, yet serving in key career enhancing
positions at the FMC, UEy, and sustainment brigade may serve 24 to 36 months. Officers selected for garrison
command may have command tours up to 3 years in length.
b. Finance Corps Branch life cycle. Figure 22–1 displays the Finance Corps life cycle with branch enhancing
positions. Additionally, it identifies developmental assignments.

22–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to meet the Army’s needs by providing the required number of trained, competent, and
experienced Finance officers with the right skills, knowledge, and attributes. To do this, the Finance Corps optimizes
the field grade inventory to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support branch/FA generalist
positions, and to provide MAJs with 2 years of branch enhancing experience.
b. Officer Personnel Management System, stabilization, modularity implementation. As force structure decisions
emerge and actions to implement them proceed, the number of authorized Finance Corps billets, by grade, will vary.
Officers who desire more information on Finance authorizations or inventory should contact the Finance Proponency
office or their HRC assignment officer.
22–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Finance Corps
Human resource transformation will bring change to traditional processes and procedures within the officer life cycle
management functions.
a. Structure. Finance officers will serve at all echelons worldwide. The Finance Corps Branch billets (BC44)
positions exist at detachment, battalion, and brigade units, HQDA, Joint, and DOD agencies. The pending implementation of modular Army construct, unit authorizations and position grades will adjust to the needs and capabilities
required to support the Future Force. Other changes are possible due to the iterative nature of the force structure and
resourcing processes as well as ongoing guidance defining our transforming Army.
b. Acquire. The Finance Corps will continue to access officers from the U.S. Military Academy, Reserve Officers’
Training Corps, and Officer Candidate School. Both the Army’s needs and branch requirements determine the amount
of accessions. There are few opportunities for direct commissioning.
c. Distribute. Finance officers will continue to rotate between TOE and TDA units in CONUS and OCONUS based
on stabilization guidelines and cyclic rotations: tour lengths of 36 months CONUS are standard. Branch officers who
serve in the Operations career field will work either in branch or branch generalist positions. Finance Corps officers
pre–accessed, pre–designated, or designated into a career field other than the Operations career field will no longer
serve in BC44.
d. Deploy. Finance Corps officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to TOE units with high levels of readiness or TDA organizations, all Finance
Corps officers must be trained and ready to accomplish missions across the COE. Finance Corps officers may deploy
tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests, or as individuals to support
Joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peacekeeping missions. Finance Corps
Branch officers must prepare themselves and their families for this most challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustain. The OPMS changes the manner of execution of 3 major actions that affect officer career development.
(1) Promotion. Finance, as one of the Army’s basic branches, is in the Operations career field. The implementation
of career field–based promotion boards is a significant but fundamental change. Once officers are designated into a
career field, they will compete for promotion along with their peers in that career field.
(2) Command. Centralized selection will continue to determine who will command within the Operations career
field. Officers have the option of selecting the category or categories in which they desire to compete for command,
while declining competition in other categories. The result of the command selection process is announced in the CSL.
(3) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce linkage between officer development and OPMS. Beginning
with CPT evaluations, the rater and senior rater will recommend the career field for the rated officer that best suits his
or her abilities.
f. Develop. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in
troop units, staff assignments and institutional training assignments. Lifelong learning continues to be an essential
component of officer development. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly employ financial
management skills in support of combined arms and Joint operations. Learning experiences will be more prolific from
home station; however, improvement will also continue to occur through the Army school system.
g. Separate. The officer separation process remains unchanged.
22–8. Finance Corps Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. Army National Guard and USAR officers play an important role in the Finance
Corps. The wartime effectiveness of the Finance Corps depends upon the quality of the Finance officers in the ARNG
and USAR finance units as well as the IRR. For overall guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7.
(1) Reserve Component Finance officers are assigned to Finance Corps Branch–coded positions in TOE units or
TDA organizations at ARNG or USAR commands. They perform the same functions as Active Army Finance officers.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

239

Their peacetime duties are similar to the wartime duties, except they will also include personnel management,
administrative, and operational reporting requirements unique to the ARNG and the USAR.
(2) Geographical dispersion of units often constrains RC career progression. Some geographical areas lack sufficient
positions to provide continued career progression in Finance assignments. Planned rotation into progressively challenging Finance related positions by RC commands is essential to producing the best qualified Finance officers. This
includes assignment between the TPU organizations, IRR, and individual mobilization augmentation positions. If
geographic constraints make assignment to Finance positions impractical, officers should consider qualification and
assignment in another branch or FA required within the geographic region to which they are assigned.
(3) Officers in the IRR may obtain assignments in TPU organizations, Reinforcement Troop Units (RTU), and
individual mobilization augmentee positions in Active Army organizations, installations or HQDA agencies; as well as
tours of Active Duty for Special Work (ADSW) or annual training. Assignment in the IRR also qualifies for
completing Professional Military Education.
b. Branch enhancing and development opportunities. Reserve Component branch developmental standards are as
follows—
(1) Lieutenant (years 1–6).
(a) The FBOLC is the starting point for newly accessed Finance officers. Reserve Component officers should
complete the resident FBOLC by the end of their 2d year (USAR) or 18 months (ARNG) of commissioned service.
Officers should seek to serve in more than 1 unit position during this phase, allowing for maximum exposure to the
diversified functions within a finance unit. Typical Finance LT assignments include detachment and/or battalion
disbursing officer. Officers should actively participate in professional reading programs and continue corresponding
studies.
(b) Reserve Component officers who have completed a basic officer leader’s course other than Finance and the
FOBQ course in residence or by distance learning will satisfy the FBOLC requirement.
(2) Captain (years 7–13).
(a) Finance officers must complete the FCCC–RC in residence or through the Total Army School System (TASS).
The TASS includes non–resident instruction through distance learning, Inactive Duty for Training (IDT), and Active
Duty for Training (ADT). The FCCC provides officers training to enhance their performance as staff officers and
commanders and is required for consideration for promotion to MAJ. All officers are highly encouraged to pursue a
specialty related undergraduate or graduate degree. Typical assignments include— company or detachment command;
operations officer; service school instructor; and aide–de–camp.
(b) Officers who complete a CCC in a different branch may complete the FOBQ course in residence or by distance
learning to satisfy Finance career course requirements.
(3) Major (years 14–21).
(a) During this phase, officers should enroll in and complete ILE (50 percent completion required for promotion to
LTC) and pursue a specialty related graduate degree. Finance officers should seek further development in Finance
assignments during this phase. Branch standard assignments include— battalion executive officer; FINCOM S3; Joint/
ARNG/USAR headquarters staff officer; MACOM/STARC staff officer; and training/combat developer, Finance
School (individual mobilization augmentee).
(b) If not previously qualified, all MAJs must complete the FOBQ course in residence or by distance learning prior
to being awarded the Finance Corps 44A MOS.
(4) Lieutenant colonel (years 22–26).
(a) During this phase, officers should complete ILE or its equivalent, if not completed at MAJ, and seek professional military education at the Senior Service College level. Officers may seek assignment to senior command and
staff positions. Branch standard assignments include— finance battalion commander; FINMCOM Staff Officer; Joint/
ARNG/USAR staff officer; and total force integrator.
(b) If not previously qualified, all LTCs must complete the FOBQ course in residence or by distance learning.
(5) Colonel (years 26–30).
(a) Assignments during this phase should provide for maximum utilization skills in Finance or an FA. Typical
assignments include— FINCOM commander; and USARC/AR–PERSCOM/NGB/OCAR/MACOM/HQDA staff
officers.
(b) Completion of Senior Service College is desirable.
c. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for Finance Corps officers is shown at
figure 22–2.

Chapter 23
Chemical Branch
23–1. Unique features of Chemical Branch
a. Unique purpose of Chemical Branch. The Chemical Branch is a combat support branch that is focused primarily
on warfighting operations and training in support of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) defense;
obscurants, and flame employment; biological and chemical arms control verification; smoke and flame munitions
technology and management; support of weapons of mass destruction force protection programs; consequence management; and CBRN military support to civil authorities. Additional functions include scientific, developmental, and
material management activities for these programs. The branch provides the Army with a highly trained corps of
CBRN experts to advise commanders and staffs at all levels in the DOD and lead Chemical units. Officers assigned to
the Chemical Branch carry branch code 74.
b. Unique functions performed by Chemical Branch. Chemical Branch officers plan, employ and coordinate Chemical systems in support of Joint and combined arms operations. These systems include CBRN agent reconnaissance
systems, biological agent detection systems, smoke and obscurants systems, flame weapons, thermobaric devices and
munitions, CBRN decontamination systems and other CBRN hazard detection and warning systems at all levels of
command, platoon through unit of employment (UE)/corps, and Joint task force. Officers also coordinate assets and
efforts for weapons of mass destruction force protection programs, consequence management, and CBRN military
support to civil authorities.
(1) Chemical officers work at all levels of command to advise and provide protection from the full range of CBRN
hazards. Chemical officers are generally the sole subject matter experts on CBRN defense operations within their
organization. Chemical soldiers and units are recognized for their unique mission capabilities that include expertise in:
CBRN vulnerability analysis; multi-spectral obscuration; sensitive site exploitation; CBRN reconnaissance; CBRN
decontamination; weapons of mass destruction force protection; and combating weapons of mass destruction, which
includes nonproliferation, counterproliferation, and consequence management. These traits make Chemical units invaluable in supporting domestic and contingency operations. Additionally, Chemical officers perform the following
functions and tasks:
(2) Command and lead CBRN defense and obscuration units from platoon to brigade, to include the Special Forces
Chemical Reconnaissance Detachments (CRDs).
(3) Command ammunition manufacturing and storage activities/installations and Chemical weapons storage and
demilitarization activities/installations.
(4) Command and supervise environmental and forensic activities.
(5) Serve as Chemical officers in Army staffs from battalion to UE, as well as OSD, Joint and, combatant
commander staffs. As staff officers, Chemical officers will conduct CBRN vulnerability analysis; plan, conduct, and
supervise CBRN defense training; evaluate CBRN technical and tactical intelligence data; develop plans for employing
and conducting obscurant operations, flame field expedient and thermobaric operations; and plan CBRN reconnaissance, detection, and decontamination operations.
(6) Develop requirements, organizational structure, doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures for CBRN, obscuration, flame, and thermobaric capabilities.
(7) Serve as Chemical advisors to US Army Reserve and Army National Guard organizations.
(8) Support weapons of mass destruction force protection and CBRN military support to civil authorities. Advise
civil, federal, state, and international agencies in weapons of mass destruction force protection and response to
incidents involving CBRN materials.
c. Officer characteristics required. The Chemical Branch requires officers skilled in leadership at all levels, who
emulate the Warrior Ethos, possess strong Army Values; are technically and tactically proficient in CBRN defense
tactics, techniques, and procedures; and are educated in the CBRN sciences and technologies required for the 21st
century—a warrior scientist. They must be dynamic and competent and possess the following characteristics: Army
officers must be premier warfighters who can effectively apply the 4 core dimensions of leadership: values, attributes,
skills, and actions (see FM 22–100 for additional discussion). The 4 core leadership dimensions provide the basis for
what a leader must be, know, and do. The values and attributes set the basis for the character of the leader—what a
leader must be. The skills developed by leaders establish his or her competence—what a leader must know. The actions
that leaders conduct and execute constitute leadership—what a leader must do. The leadership framework describes a
leader of character and competence who acts to achieve excellence across the range of military operations.
d. Unique skills.
(1) Decisionmaking skills. Chemical officers often work in an environment where time available for problem
analysis is limited but where sound and timely decisions are urgent. Information gained in this environment will vary

242

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

in its completeness and ambiguity. An ability to operate under stress, make decisions, and act in austere field
conditions is critical to success.
(2) Tactical and technical skills. Chemical officers must be technically proficient with branch and mission-unique
equipment, tools, and systems. Chemical mission success requires the proper balance between technical skills and the
ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactical skills at the right moment. These skills must be gained and
developed through repetitive operational assignments and continuous professional study and self-development. Chemical officers must not only know their own unique branch skills, tactics, techniques, procedures, and specialized
equipment; but they must also know the uniqueness of the units to which they are assigned or are supporting.
e. Unique knowledge.
(1) Officers must possess expert knowledge of Chemical Branch requirements, combined arms, chemical unit
support, and coordination principles. This knowledge includes practical experience in tactics, combined arms operations, and the employment of all assets available to the Chemical Branch. Officers gain this knowledge through a
logical sequence of continuous education, training, and experience sustained through mentoring. Individual officers
sustain knowledge through institutional training and education, experience gained in operational assignments, and
continuous self-development.
(2) Serving as staff and faculty at the Chemical School allows officers with recent troop and Chemical staff
assignments to share their field experience with the school. In turn, officers from the school return to the field with an
updated knowledge of doctrinal, training, organizational, and materiel developments. With such an exchange of
knowledge and experience between the field and the Chemical School, these officers ensure that the Chemical Corps,
sister services, and the Army are fully prepared to fight and win on the increasingly complex battlefields associated
with the Contemporary Operational Environment (COE).
f. Unique attributes.
(1) Personal attributes. Chemical officers must know and routinely execute drills and operate within established
standard operating procedures (SOPs). Officers must be physically fit, flexible, agile, adaptable, and values-based if
they, as warfighters, are to lead Chemical Soldiers effectively across the full range of military operations.
(2) Task orientation. Work focuses on the successful accomplishment of the mission. Process is important, but
results count. Teamwork is vital for success.
(3) Multifunctionality. Chemical officer work is branch oriented, but becomes increasingly multifunctional as the
officers become more familiar with systems and skills that cross several basic branches and FAs. Officers must develop
and use a diverse set of skills as they move between branch TOE and TDA leadership positions and as they serve in
branch/FA generalist assignments.
(4) Situational awareness of the battlespace. The ability to quickly judge terrain, weather effects, friendly capabilities, and threat capabilities is key. This transcends viewing the terrain, analyzing the weather, and knowing the range
capability of threat weapon systems and our weapon systems. It is the ability to visualize the battlespace and know how
terrain and weather impact threat employment of CBRN weapons and how to optimize CBRN defense systems in a
multidimensional battlespace.
23–2. Critical officer developmental assignments.
a. Chemical officer career development. A Chemical officer should expect, over the span of a 20 to 30 year career,
to be assigned to a variety of units and organizations. An officer will serve in several troop assignments in Chemical
and other units from platoon to UE level; combat training centers (CTCs); TRADOC service schools; surety-related
positions; DA, DOD, field operating agency, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Joint and combatant command
staff positions; and Active Army assistance to the Reserve Component positions. Leader developmental positions for
each grade are listed below. Some assignments by their very nature offer greater opportunity to gain knowledge and
experience. These positions significantly impact the Army and the Chemical mission over the longer term and are
especially challenging. Officers should seek 1 or more of these assignments at each level of their career (see figs 23–1
and 23–2 and para 23–7c).

Figure 23–1. Chemical officer life cycle development and utilization

244

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(1) Lieutenant.
(a) Newly commissioned officers will attend the Chemical Officer Basic Course (COBC) at the U.S. Army
Chemical School (USACMLS) at Fort Leonard Wood (FLW), MO (in the near future this course will convert to phase
III of the Basic Officer Leadership Course). COBC prepares LTs to lead platoons and serve as battalion Chemical
officers. During COBC, Chemical LTs also undergo training with actual toxic Chemical agents in the Chemical
Defense Training Facility.
(b) LTs have the opportunity after COBC to attend Airborne and other schools if their follow-on duty assignment
requires that specific training. Ranger training is authorized for officers with a projected assignment to the 75th Ranger
Regiment.
(c) The COBC graduates should expect to serve in a variety of positions ranging from battalion level assistant S3/
Chemical officer to Chemical company positions that will develop critical leadership and Chemical Branch skills.
Typical duty positions include battalion/squadron staff officer, platoon leader (obscuration, decontamination, CBRN
reconnaissance, or Biological Integrated and Detection System (BIDS)), and company executive officer. These positions build a solid foundation that is the bedrock for the remainder of the officer’s career. Officers who are assigned to
battalions in life cycle brigade combat teams will be assigned for 36 months. LTs entering life cycle units will stay for
the unit’s entire life cycle and may be CPTs in LT positions at the end of the unit’s life cycle
(d) The focus during the LT years is to acquire and refine leadership and branch related coordination, logistics, and
administrative skills. Inculcation of the Warrior Ethos and Army core values is essential in the development of young
officers. Chemical LTs should also become proficient in both common core and branch tasks. Before promotion to
CPT, officers should possess an in–depth knowledge of combined arms operations as well as knowledge of CBRN
defense operations in combined arms organizations.
(e) Officers who have not completed an undergraduate degree must do so during this point in their careers. The
Degree Completion Program (DCP) enables selected commissioned officers to complete degree requirements at
accredited civilian colleges and universities as a resident full-time student. Officers interested in the DCP must submit
applications through their chain of command to the Combat Service Support Directorate, ATTN: Chemical Branch,
OPMD, AHRC–OPB–CM, 200 Stovall St., Alexandria, VA 22332–0414 not later than 5 months prior to the requested
DCP start date.
(2) Captain.
(a) Officers will attend the Chemical Captains Career Course (CMC3) at about the third year of service to prepare
for detachment/company level command and duties in brigade or higher-level staff positions. CMC3 will be either
TDY and return or PCS as fits the needs of the Army and follow-on assignment. Officers have another opportunity to
attend Airborne and other military schools en route from CMC3 to their next assignment, providing their next duty
assignment requires the training. Officers attending the CMC3 are strongly encouraged to participate in a master’s
degree program offering enrollment while in the CMC3.
(b) Following attendance at the CMC3, CPTs should expect to serve as Chemical officers in brigade combat teams
(BCTs) and UE organizations. In these positions, the officer has a major impact on the CBRN preparedness of that
unit.
(c) Command is highly desirable for professional development in the Chemical Corps. Chemical company command
opportunities are few and, as a result, are highly competitive. Therefore, many Chemical officers strive for branch
immaterial company commands, such as, battalion and brigade HHCs. CPTs should aggressively prepare for and seek
detachment/company level command.
(d) Following detachment/company command, officers should expect to be assigned to other positions that round out
leadership and technical proficiency, such as battalion level primary staff officers, service school instructors, CTC
observer controller/evaluators (OC/Es), Active Army/RC program trainers, USAREC company commanders, or technical escort battalion company commanders or team leaders. Qualified officers may be selected to participate in
additional professional development opportunities, such as advanced civil schooling, Training With Industry, the Joint
Staff Intern Program, or the USMA instructor program.
(e) A small number of CPTs may participate in Project Warrior, a program designed to spread the expertise
developed by combat training center (CTC) observer/controllers (O/C) to the rest of the Chemical Corps. After 2 years
at a CTC, Project Warrior officers are assigned to the Chemical School as Small Group Instructors, Training
Developers or Doctrine Developers to add current combined arms tactical experience to Chemical instruction and allow
CTC lessons learned to be incorporated into the training base and doctrine.
(f) Officers who have served at least 24 months in a branch coded position, preferably to include company
command, can be assigned to positions listed below:
1. OC/Es at one of the Army’s CTCs.
2. COBC/CMC3 small group instructor at the Chemical School.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

245

3. Branch/FA generalist positions (for example, USAREC, ROTC instructor, USMA faculty and staff, or Active
Army/RC duty) (see para 23–3).
4. Other nominative assignments (for example, JCS/DOD interns).
5. Functional area positions.
6. Advanced civil schooling. (Based on FA, Chemical Branch, or overall Army requirements.)
(g) All Chemical officers between their 5th and 10th year of commissioned service may submit their request for FAs
through the Functional Area Process system. This is an online system at HRC that provides the officer the opportunity
to work in the FA of his/her interest. This information will be used by HRC and the FA proponents to identify and
recruit officers with the right skills and experience for service in their FA. The careful selection of an ACS or Training
With Industry Program will lay the groundwork for the officer’s future career in an FA under the OPMS and the career
field designation board (CFDB) process at promotion to MAJ. Some FAs have extensive educational requirements. A
limited number of officers will be accessed into the Army Acquisition Corps upon completion of detachment/company
command (see chap 48). Career field designation is completed 6 months prior to a CPTs consideration for promotion to
MAJ. CPTs should submit their branch or FA designation preference statements. Following selection to MAJ, officers
are designated into their career field or FA specialty.
(h) CPTs should continue to gain an in-depth understanding of combined arms operations and become proficient in
all CPT level common core and branch tasks for Chemical officers. These tasks provide the foundation of CBRN
operations and leadership required to effectively serve in the branch at increasing levels of responsibility. CPTs gain a
working knowledge of command principles, battalion and brigade level staff operations, and combined arms and CBRN
operations at the battalion to brigade levels. An officer should also dedicate time to complete the Chemical Corps
Professional Reading Program to gain a historical perspective on tactical, strategic and leadership challenges of interest
to Chemical Corps Soldiers.
(i) The following developmental assignments are considered key for Chemical CPTs:
1. Detachment/company commander.
2. Brigade Chemical officer.
3. Primary battalion staff officer.
4. USACMLS COBC/CMC3 small group instructor (SGI).
5. CTC observer controller.
6. Technical escort team leader.
(j) Other developmental assignments include instructor for USMA, ROTC, or USACMLS and JCS/OSD intern.
(3) Major.
(a) Following selection for promotion to MAJ, officers will undergo a career field designation board (CFDB). This
HQDA–convened board of senior officers will decide the FA and career field in which each officer is best suited to
serve. Chemical officers who remain in the Operations career field (OCF) will serve only in branch or branch/FA
generalist assignments. Some Chemical MAJs will be designated to an FA in 1 of the other 3 career fields: Operational
Support (OSCF), Information Operations (IOCF), and Institutional Support. After promotion to MAJ, officers will
compete for promotion only within their designated career field. For officers designated in the OCF, the primary
professional development objective is to continue to strengthen Chemical Corps tactical skills and leadership. Officers
retained in the OCF will attend the resident ILE course.
(b) On completion of ILE, MAJs in the OCF should aggressively seek assignments as a battalion/brigade XO or S3,
MAJ level unit commander, brigade primary staff officer, tactical Chemical operations officer, Special Forces group or
separate brigade or regiment Chemical officer, DA or Joint staff officer, or OC/Es. Many Chemical officers seek XO/
S3 positions in other than Chemical battalions, such as FSBs and DISCOMs. Other developmental assignments include:
branch chief at the USACMLS; UE/corps, or MACOM/combatant command staff; Command and Staff College faculty
and staff; service school instructor; duty with chemical/biological arms control/verification activities, or Active Army/
RC support. MAJs will also serve in other branch/FA generalist positions such as ROTC or USMA faculty and staff
and Inspector General positions. Those officers selected for the School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) at Fort
Leavenworth will serve at a UE headquarters as planners.
(c) MAJs should continue self–development efforts to become experts in all aspects of the Chemical Corps and Joint
and multinational operations. Self–development should include correspondence courses (such as the Defense Strategy
Course) and civilian education. Officers should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their
warfighting perspective. Officers should strive to complete a master’s degree or equivalent at this point in their career.
For requirements at this grade, majors should have completed multiple developmental assignments as a CPT, assignments as a MAJ in Chemical Branch coded positions, ILE.
(d) The following developmental assignments are considered key for Chemical MAJs:
1. Battalion/brigade level XO or S3.
2. MAJ level commander.
3. Tactical Chemical operations officer.
4. MAJ level Chemical officer.

246

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

5. Brigade primary staff officer.
6. MACOM, DA or Joint staff officer.
7. CTC observer controller.
(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Officers selected for LTC in the Operations career field should seek assignments of greater responsibility in the
branch and branch/FA generalist positions. The objective for LTC assignments is to seek positions that provide greater
contributions to the branch and the Army. The 2 pinnacle assignments for Chemical LTCs are battalion commander
and Division Chemical officer.
(b) Chemical LTCs are centrally selected by a DA board to serve as commanders of Chemical battalions, training
battalions, ammunition plants, Chemical facilities, depots, base support battalions, garrisons and recruiting battalions.
Commands are typically 24 months in length.
(c) Chemical LTCs are chosen to serve as division Chemical officers by the chief of Chemical at the USACMLS.
Division Chemical officer assignments are typically 24 months for CONUS and Korea, and 36 months for Germany.
(d) The following developmental assignments are considered key for Chemical LTCs:
1. LTC level command.
2. Division/UEx Chemical officer.
3. Brigade XO/S3.
4. UE, MACOM, HQDA, OSD or Joint staff officer.
5. ROTC Professor of Military Science.
6. Duty with chemical/biological arms control/verification activities.
(e) Other challenging positions include duty at field operating agencies, and division chief at the USACMLS.
(f) Selection for Senior Service College (SSC) is extremely competitive. Officers are selected to either attend SSC in
residency or to complete SSC through the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course. A HQDA board
centrally selects both of these courses. Self–development objectives should continue to build warfighting and branch
technical expertise as well as support the officer’s FA when applicable.
(g) For requirements at this grade, LTCs should have successfully completed requirements as a MAJ as well as
assignments as an LTC in Chemical branch coded positions for at least 24 months.
(5) Colonel.
(a) The primary objective for this grade is optimal application of a COL’s tactical and technical capabilities and
executive and leadership skills in those positions that best support the OSD, unified combatant command, and
multinational force requirements.
(b) Chemical COLs are assigned to command and senior staff positions in a wide variety of branch and branch/FA
generalist positions.
(c) The following developmental assignments are considered key for Chemical COLs:
1. COL level command.
2. Assistant Commandant, USACMLS.
3. Corps/UEy Chemical officer.
4. MACOM, HQDA, OSD, or Joint staff (division chief level).
5. Army, MACOM or combatant command Chemical officer.
6. Director, USACMLS.
(d) For requirements at this grade, COLs should have successfully completed requirements as an LTC as well as
assignments for COLs in Chemical Branch positions for at least 12 months.
b. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Officers above the grade of LT can expect to serve in branch/FA
generalist assignments that may or may not be directly related to the Chemical Branch. In the past, Chemical officers
have rarely filled these positions based on the availability of Chemical officers. As the inventory of Chemical officers
dictates, the opportunity to serve in positions such as ROTC instructor, recruiting command, and Inspector General
may be available.
c. Joint assignments. Field grade Chemical officers can expect to be considered for Joint duty assignments worldwide following branch qualification. Joint experience is important to the Army and professionally develops officers for
advancement into senior leadership positions.
d. Other assignments. Chemical Branch officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated
above. These other assignments may include White House fellowships, National Security Council duty, United Nations
duty, and Chemical branch representative at Allied service schools. The spectrum of possible assignments is large.
These assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and important, requiring mature, skilled, and wellgrounded officers.
e. Army Acquisition Corps (AAC). Qualified Chemical officers may request accession into the AAC. An annual
AAC accession board selects 3 or 4 Chemical officers following successful completion of command. These officers are
managed as AAC (FA 51) officers and work strictly within the acquisition arena in the Operational Support career field
for the rest of their careers. An AAC officer’s career development is focused toward serving as a program manager or a
DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

247

commander of Army research and development centers. Throughout their acquisition career, they continue as members
of the Chemical Corps Regiment. This link between the Chemical Corps and AAC should be strong so that the best
possible CBRN-related equipment and systems are developed and procured. (Additional information on the AAC can
be found in chapter 48.)
f. Advanced Civil Schooling. Some Chemical Corps positions require advanced degrees. An advanced degree can
provide additional opportunities for select assignments. The Chemical Corps annually sends officers to graduate school
to obtain advanced science degrees in disciplines, such as chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, and environmental
engineering. Additionally, the USMA Academy Professor (FA 47), Psychological Operations/Civil Affairs (FA 39),
and Foreign Area Officer (FA 48) are sources of funding for advanced degrees in many disciplines. Training With
Industry (TWI) is another excellent program where officers are assigned to a civilian corporation for a one-year
internship. Selection for these programs is strongly tied to the manner of performance, undergraduate GPA, GRE
scores, and the individual officer’s career timeline. Officers incur a service obligation of 3 years for each year of school
or training IAW AR 350–100. Following training, officers will serve a follow-on utilization tour in a validated position
for 2 or 3 years. (Further details on ACS/TWI can be found in AR 621–1.)
g. Additional military schooling. Officers have additional opportunities to become proficient in several areas that
provide additional skill identifiers. Some of these programs and courses are Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Technical
Escort/J5, Chemical Surety, CBRN Responder/R1, Biological Integrated Detection System (BIDS), Fox Reconnaissance Vehicle/L5, and Stryker NBC Reconnaissance Vehicle/L6.
h. Branch detail officers. The following applies to branch officers who are detailed:
(1) Under the branch detail program, some Signal, Finance, Transportation, Ordnance, and Quartermaster Corps
officers are detailed to recipient branches for 2 years. In the same manner, Adjutant General and Military Intelligence
officers are branch detailed for 3 years. As a recipient branch, the Chemical Corps receives officers each year from
donor branches to fill its LT authorizations.
(2) LTs detailed to the Chemical Corps follow the same career development path as basic branch Chemical LTs.
They can expect opportunities to serve at the battalion level as an assistant S3/Chemical officer and in platoon leader
and executive officer positions at the company level. These officer development opportunities are the foundation for
successful careers in every branch of the Army. At the end of the detail period, officers revert to their basic branch.
These officers normally attend a transition course sponsored by their basic branch before serving subsequent assignments (see chapter 3 for additional information concerning the branch detail program).
23–3. Assignment preferences and precedence.
a. Preferences. The Chemical Branch has diverse assignment opportunities that allow for numerous career development paths. The professional development goal of Chemical Branch officers is to produce and sustain highly qualified
technically, tactically, and operationally oriented officers to lead the Chemical Branch in combat, and on other assigned
missions. Assignments in the Chemical branch are designed to develop the officer’s ability to achieve that goal while
maintaining unit readiness. Requests from officers for assignments that do not contribute to achieving that goal will
likely be rejected. Requirements for individuals in the Joint Domicile program are listed in AR 614–100, Officer
Assignment Policies, Details, and Transfers, and requirements for the Exceptional Family Member Program are listed
in AR 608–75, Exceptional Family Member Program. All family concerns for individuals in these programs will be
considered by assignment officers to support these individuals.
b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have a precedence, although there is flexibility on the sequence of assignments. Typically, Chemical branch officers should seek assignments in the following
order: Officer Basic Course, battalion staff (as an assistant S3/Chemical officer), platoon leader, Captains Career
Course, BCT or UA staff, detachment/company command, post–command assignment, ILE, troop assignment (as a
MAJ), Joint/HQDA staff assignment, troop assignment (as an LTC) such as battalion level command, division/UEx
Chemical officer, Senior Service College, Joint/HQDA staff assignment and troop assignment (as a COL) such as
brigade level command, and corps/UEy Chemical officer.
23–4. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments.
a. Key Chemical positions. At the company grade level, because of the wide variety of assignments, no one
quantitative standard will define success. The most important objective for the Chemical officer is to become versatile
and proficient in all CBRN defense functions. Captains should strive to serve as a company or detachment commander
for a minimum of 12 months, with a goal of 18 months. Majors should seek to serve in an S3 and/or XO position for
12 to 24 months. LTCs and COLs will serve 2 years in battalion and brigade commands. COLs selected for garrison
command have command tours of 2 years in length, with an option of a 3rd year.
b. Chemical Branch life cycle. Figure 23–1 displays a Chemical Branch life cycle with typical developmental
assignments.
23–5. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory.
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for Chemical branch officers. To do this the field
grade inventory must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support

248

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

branch/FA generalist positions, and to provide MAJs the opportunity to serve as a battalion S3/XO while attempting to
stabilize for 3 years.
b. OPMS implementation. The numbers of authorized Chemical billets, by grade, will vary as force structure
decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring additional information on Chemical
Branch authorizations or inventory are encouraged to contact the Personnel Proponency Office at the USACMLS or
USA HRC–Alexandria, Chemical Branch assignment officer.
23–6. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Chemical Corps
a. Structure. The Army has plans to make significant changes to the structure of Chemical organizations based on
the Total Army Analysis (TAA) process. Other minor changes are possible due to the iterative nature of the
restructuring and recoding process.
b. Acquire. Officers will continue to be accessed into the Chemical branch through the U.S. Military Academy,
Reserve Officer Training Corps, and Officer Candidate School. Accessions are based on the needs of the Army and
officer preference. Because of the lack of branch-specific civil schooling and opportunities for relevant experience,
there will be few opportunities for direct commissioning in the Chemical branch.
c. Distribute. Chemical branch officers will continue to rotate between TOE and TDA units in CONUS and
OCONUS.
(1) Stabilized Installation assignments. Officers assigned to stabilized installations will be initial entry officers from
OBC. Some company grade officers will complete their platoon leader and LT years, proceed to the CCC, and return to
the same installation to complete detachment/company command.
(2) Life cycle units. Officers at all levels may be assigned to life cycle units (generally the Stryker Brigade Combat
Teams (SBCTs) and Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs)) and will remain in the unit for a minimum of 3 years. Branch
detailed officers will remain in their detail branch until after completion of the assignment to the BCT.
(3) Cyclic units. The majority of the installations will be managed on a cyclic manning system. Replacements will
be sent to these units and installations periodically to maintain readiness of the units. Tour lengths and developmental
positions opportunities can vary. Branch detail officers will remain on standard branch detail timelines.
d. Deploy. Chemical Corps officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to deployable TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA
organizations, all Chemical Corps officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the range of military
operations. Chemical officers may deploy at any time with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect
national interests or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than war, such as humanitarian
and peace keeping missions. Chemical Corps officers must prepare themselves and their families for this most
challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustain.
(1) Promotion. Chemical Branch officers will compete for promotion only within the operations career field.
Knowledge, skills, experience, duty performance and adherence to branch requirements are all factors that influence
promotion. Promotion rates will be determined by Army needs/DOPMA goals.
(2) Command. Chemical branch commanders will continue to be centrally selected for battalion and brigade level
command. All Chemical officer command opportunities are in the operations career field. These commands are located
in 3 functional categories: Tactical, Training/Strategic Support, and Institutional (USAREC), garrison and base support
battalions for LTCs and area support groups for COLs). Officers have the option of selecting the category or categories
in which they desire to compete for command, while declining competition in other categories. The results of the
command selection process are announced in the Command Selection List (CSL).
(3) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS. Starting
with CPT, the rater will recommend the rated officer for the career field which best suits his or her abilities and
interests.
f. Develop. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in
TOE units with troops, staff/TDA assignments, and institutional training assignments. Self- development continues to
be an essential component of officer development. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly employ
CBRN and smoke assets and have knowledge of maneuver skills in support of combined, Joint, and multinational/
coalition operations. Development occurs through the Army and Joint school systems as well. Other officer development areas include ACS/TWI to support the needs of the Army and individual preferences.
g. Separate. The officer separation process remains unchanged.
23–7. Chemical Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. Reserve Component (RC) Chemical officer development objectives basically parallel those planned for their Active Army counterparts. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation through
assignments in their branch before specialization begins. The US Army Chemical RC officer plays a vital role in the
Chemical Corps combat support mission. The RC comprises the majority of all Chemical units and more than half of
the personnel associated with the Chemical Corps force structure. Therefore, interaction and interoperability between

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

249

the Active Army and RCs are essential. Reserve officers commissioned into the Chemical Corps are designated branch
code 74 (Chemical) by the CDR, AHRC–St Louis (see chap 7 for RC officer development).
b. Branch developmental opportunities.
(1) Even though RC Chemical officers are limited by geographical considerations, they should strive for Chemical
assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as their Active Army counterparts. RC career progression
is often constrained by the geographic dispersion of units. There may not be sufficient positions in a geographic area to
continue in Chemical assignments. Therefore, planned rotation into progressively challenging Chemical positions by
RC commands is essential to producing the best- qualified Chemical officer.
(a) To meet professional development objectives in the USAR, Chemical officers must be willing to rotate between
TPU, the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR), and the individual mobilization augmentee, Army Reserve Element (ARE),
and Active Guard Reserve (AGR) programs.
(b) Professional development objectives in the Army National Guard (ARNG) differ from the USAR in that ARNG
officers rotate between TPUs normally within their own states. ARNG officers also have an opportunity to apply for
and serve in Military Technician Programs (MilTec) and the Title 32 or Title 10 AGR programs.
(c) These transfers are necessitated by geographical considerations, the need to provide as many officers as possible
the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions, or to complete Professional Military Education
(PME) requirements. Such transfers will normally be temporary, and should not be seen as impacting negatively on the
officer’s career. The success of an RC Chemical officer is not measured by length of service in any one component or
control group, but the officer’s breadth of experience, duty performance, and adherence to branch development goals.
Officers may elect to apply for an FA beginning at the grade of CPT. AGR officers will be boarded and assigned a
career field designation as a senior CPT or junior MAJ. For additional guidance on RC officer development, see
chapter 7.
(2) Chemical officers in the IRR may find assignments in reinforcement units (RTU), IMA positions in AC
organizations, installations, or HQDA agencies, as well as tours of Active Duty for Special Work (ADSW), Annual
Training (AT), or Temporary Tour on Active Duty (TTAD). Assignment in the IRR can also be used for completing
PME requirements.
(3) Typical assignments could include the following:
(a) Positions in Chemical TPUs or Chemical positions in non-chemical units.
(b) IMA program which provides officers the opportunity to train in the positions they will occupy upon
mobilization.
(c) Counterpart Training Program.
(d) Positions in AREs.
(e) AGR tours where AGR officers serve full-time in support of either the ARNG or USAR. They receive the same
benefits as Active Army officers, including the opportunity for retirement after 20 years of Active Federal Service.
c. Life cycle development model. Professional development requirements are normally satisfied by attendance at
military schools combined with planned, progressive assignments in Chemical units or positions. The RC life cycle
development model for Chemical officers is shown in figure 23–2. In order for a Chemical officer to achieve the
desired branch experience at each grade, the length of service in a given position is not the focus; the key is assignment
diversity and sufficient time served during each assignment to develop branch competence. The following paragraphs
describe how company and field grade RC officers may gain and maintain Chemical Branch experience throughout a
career. The desired goal for Chemical officer assignments is at least one assignment in a Chemical branch coded
position for a total of 24 months at the company grade level and at least 2 assignments in a Chemical Branch coded
position for a total of 48 months at the field grade level. Officers should pursue the following experiences:

251

(1) Lieutenant.
(a) Newly commissioned officers branched Chemical will attend the Chemical Officer Basic Course (COBC) at the
U.S. Army Chemical School, Fort Leonard Wood, MO. COBC prepares LTs to lead platoons and serve as battalion
Chemical officers. During COBC, Chemical LTs also undergo instruction with actual toxic Chemical agents in the
Chemical Defense Training Facility. U.S. Army Reserve LTs must complete COBC by the end of their 2nd year of
commissioned service. ARNG officers must complete COBC by the end of 18 months commissioned service.
(b) A baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university is required for promotion to CPT.
(c) Officers should seek assignments as platoon leaders, company XOs, or battalion assistant S3s/Chemical officers.
These positions build a strong foundation for subsequent development as a Chemical officer.
(d) LTs should also become proficient in common core tasks.
(2) Captains.
(a) All officers should complete a CCC, preferably the resident Chemical CCC at Fort Leonard Wood, MO.
(b) Officers who have completed the Chemical Officer Basic Course or other branch basic course and are unable to
attend the resident Chemical CCC may receive credit by attending the RC–Chemical CCC that consists of a combination of distant learning course work and resident training at the USACMLS.
(c) Officers should seek assignments or experience equivalent to brigade/group level Chemical officer or other
brigade level staff positions. Company command is highly desirable for continued professional development.
(d) Chemical CPTs should continue to become proficient in common core tasks. An officer should also dedicate
time to complete the Chemical Corps Professional Reading Program to gain a historical perspective on tactical,
technical, strategic, and leadership challenges of interest to Chemical Corps soldiers.
(e) The desired goal for Chemical officer assignments at the company grade level is at least one assignment in a
Chemical Branch coded position for a total of 24 months.
(3) Major.
(a) Field grade officer development paths reflect a greater variety of assignment possibilities. Developmental
positions for majors include COSCOM, separate brigade, armored cavalry regiment, or group Chemical officer;
battalion XO and S3; and division and RSC/ARCOM staff positions.
(b) Chemical MAJs should continue self-development efforts to become experts in all aspects of the Chemical
Corps, Joint and multinational operations, as well as in an FA when applicable. Time should be devoted to a
professional reading program to broaden the warfighting perspective.
(c) MAJs should strive to obtain a master’s degree from an accredited college or university, but it is not a
requirement for promotion to LTC.
(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) The ILE must be completed within 3 years after promotion to LTC.
(b) LTCs who have not developed a breadth of experience as a Chemical officer at this point in their career may do
so through completion of the Senior Leader Qualification Course, sponsored by the US Army Chemical School. This
course is designed to fill in Chemical professional development gaps and refresh skills diminished by the passage of
time.
(c) Developmental positions include LTC level staff positions, Chemical or other battalion level commands, and
selection for resident/non-resident Senior Service College. In the National Guard, state and division Chemical officer
positions are available and desirable. Self-development objectives should continue to build warfighting and technical
expertise and support the officer’s FA when applicable.
(d) Assumption of Chemical position duties at the LTC level with no prior Chemical training or experience is
discouraged. Fully successful performance generally requires the skills and instincts developed over time by practice of
the Chemical segment of the military art. (Refer to chapter 7 for a detailed description of Reserve Component career
management and development.)
(5) Colonel.
(a) COLs who have not developed a breadth of experience as a Chemical officer at this point in their careers may
do so by completing the Senior Leader Qualification Course, sponsored by the U.S. Army Chemical School.
(b) Chemical positions available at this grade include Chemical brigade commander, deputy Chemical brigade
commander, and high-level staff.
(c) Assumption of Chemical position duties at the COL level with no prior Chemical training or experience is
discouraged. Fully successful performance generally requires the skills and instincts developed over time by practice of

252

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

the Chemical segment of the military art. (Refer to chapter 7 for a detailed description of Reserve Component career
management and development.)

Chapter 24
Transportation Corps Branch
24–1. Unique Features of the Transportation Corps Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Transportation Corps Branch. The Transportation Corps is a combat service support
branch that falls into the Operations career field and provides the transportation capabilities that are essential for a
CONUS-based power projection Army in support of the National Military Strategy and the physical capabilities
necessary to affect agile maneuver and movement of forces and materiel at the operational and tactical levels of
warfighting. The Transportation Corps consists of officers, warrant officers, enlisted, and civilian personnel responsible
for the worldwide movement of units, personnel, equipment, and supplies in peace and war. The Transportation Corps
moves critical supplies rapidly, under positive control, through an integrated, transportation-based global distribution
system, bypassing routine warehouse/storage functions from the source to the combatant. The Transportation Corps
leverages emerging technologies and thrives on the digitized battlefield. It provides movement control, in-transit
visibility, and directs delivery to deployed forces in a dynamically fluid, nonlinear battlefield. The Transportation
Corps is the "Spearhead of Logistics" because nothing happens until something moves.
b. Unique functions performed by the Transportation Corps Branch. Functions performed by the Transportation
Corps include:
(1) Plan, schedule, and supervise the use of each mode of transportation for the effective movement of units,
personnel, equipment, and supplies in a transportation-based, Joint-global defense and commercial deployment and
distribution systems.
(2) Plan, execute, track, and control movements of units, supplies, and sustainment from the source to the
combatant.
(3) Provide theater port opening terminal services for all modes of transportation and stevedoring services at fixed
ports, unimproved beach sites, and during Logistics-Over-The-Shore (LOTS) operations.
(4) Provides highway, rail, marine and terminal support for Army and Joint Operations. Six Core Competencies:
(a) Strategic Deployment
(b) Movement Control
(c) Terminal Operations
(d) Water Transport
(e) Highway Transport
(f) Rail Transport
(5) Provide DOD worldwide, single agency management for military traffic, land transportation, and common-user
ocean terminals.
(6) Develop transportation concepts and doctrine and develop unit organizations and the requirements to support
acquisition of transportation systems for the Army.
(7) Provide training and professional development for DOD, Active Army and RC, and civilian personnel in
transportation and deployment methods.
(8) Provide direct and general maintenance support and supply support for marine and rail equipment.
(9) Provide transportation engineering services.
c. Unique features of work in the Transportation Corps Branch.
(1) The Transportation Corps features work that is not common to many branches. Transportation Corps (TC)
officers and warrant officers may routinely work at any of the 3 levels of war: tactical, operational and strategic. This
is not limited to a specific grade; for example, a TC LT may operate an Arrival/Departure Airfield Control Group (A/
DACG), which can be a Joint operation operating at both operational and strategic levels. TC officers will find
themselves working in Joint environments or participating in Joint operations far more frequently than other branches.
Among other duties, TC officers:
(a) Manage all facets of transportation related to the planning, operation, coordination, and evaluation of all methods
of transportation including multi-modal systems.
(b) Command all types of transportation, movement control, and logistical organizations tasked with controlling and
carrying out personnel, cargo/supply, movement control, or logistical requirements within a geographic area(s).
(c) Recommend priorities, coordinate tasks, document cargo and/or personnel to be transported, allocate resources,
and determine the mode(s) necessary for the optimum utilization of assets and timely mission accomplishment.
(d) Play a key role in the development, procurement, and life cycle management of transportation-related equipment,
systems, and personnel.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

253

(2) All TC branch coded (88) positions are open to male and female officers with the exception of the Ranger
Regiment Movement Control Officer, which is specific to male officers. Male and female TC officers have equal
career opportunities. They can expect and should be prepared to work in any of the 4 transportation AOCs:
(a) Transportation General (AOC 88A). Officers command, direct, control, coordinate, manage, or serve in positions
requiring general knowledge of transportation organizations, equipment, and doctrine as well as organizations engaged
in transportation-related services. They develop doctrine, organizations, and equipment for the Transportation Corps.
They serve in Joint assignments, manage transportation personnel life cycle functions, and instruct transportation skills
at service schools, service colleges, pre-commissioning and commissioning programs, and combat training centers. RC
TC officers assist US Army Reserve and Army National Guard transportation organizations. Examples of TC general
duty positions are:
1. Headquarters staff officer
2. Instructor
3. Proponency officer
4. Division Transportation Officer
(b) Traffic Management (AOC 88B). Command, plan, procure, coordinate, and control the movement of personnel,
personal property, and military freight worldwide by military or commercial transport. Examples of TC traffic
management duty positions include:
1. Installation Transportation officer (ITO)
2. Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) commander/staff officer
3. Movement Control Officer (MCO)
4. Division/Corps Transportation Officer
(c) Marine and Terminal Operations (AOC 88C). Marine and terminal operations officers command, direct, control,
coordinate, manage, or serve in positions in water transport, marine maintenance, marine terminal, or inland terminal
units or organizations. Their duties encompass the command, control, or management of fixed ports, unimproved ports,
and bare-beach facilities; air, rail, motor, and inland waterway terminal operations; Joint- Logistics-Over-The-Shore
(JLOTS) operations; and marine maintenance and salvage operations. Examples of TC marine and terminal operations
duty positions are:
1. Terminal unit commander/executive officer/staff officer
2. Cargo transfer company commander/platoon leader/executive officer
3. Watercraft and causeway unit commander/platoon leader/executive officer
4. Port operations crane company commander/platoon leader/executive officer
5. Floating craft/direct and general maintenance support company commander
(d) Motor/Rail Transportation (AOC 88D). Motor/rail transport officers command, direct, control, coordinate, manage, or serve in positions in motor (truck), rail, truck terminal, or trailer transfer units or organizations. All rail units are
in the Reserve Component. Duties encompass command, control, management, and utilization of motor assets in
support of terminal clearance, inter and intra-zonal motor transport services and operational mobility, truck terminal/
trailer transfer points, area support, drive-away, retrograde, container and intermodal operations. Examples of TC
motor/rail transport duty positions include:
1. Motor (truck) transport commander/staff officer/platoon leader/executive officer
2. Rail operations commander/staff officer/platoon leader/executive officer
24–2. Officer characteristics required
a. The Way Ahead. Everything begins with the Warrior Ethos. Warrior ethos is the foundation for our total
commitment to victory in peace and war. It is the conviction that military service is much more than just another job. It
defines who officers are and what officers do. Officers require a demonstrated mastery of branch specific or FA skills,
and grounding in the seven Army Values in order to successfully lead Soldiers as the Army transforms. All officers
must be physically and mentally fit, maintain and display self-control, remain calm under pressure, and adhere to
published standards and regulations.
b. Unique skills. Mastery of the following skills relative to each officer’s leadership stage is critical for successful
performance by all TC officers.
(1) Junior leadership (company grade). Junior TC officers work in an extremely fluid and dynamic environment with
a wide variety of personnel and equipment; they often have to work independently with minimum guidance. As such,
they should focus on the following skills to develop their proficiency:
(a) Interpersonal skills. Working in a dynamic environment, officers will encounter information that varies in
completeness and ambiguity. Therefore, it is imperative that TC officers can communicate effectively in both written
and verbal forms. Officers should also develop excellent supervisory skills to ensure proper execution of all assigned
tasks and missions.
(b) Conceptual skills. Since TC officers may often work independently with minimum direction, supervision, or
support, creative thinking is a very critical skill.

254

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(c) Technical skills. TC officers must be technically proficient with employment of transportation and missionunique equipment, personnel, and systems. TC officers must understand transportation, supply, and maintenance
automated systems. In addition to working independently, TC officers often work in an environment where there is
little time available for problem analysis, but sound and timely decisions are crucial. Transportation Corps mission
success requires the proper balance between technical know-how and the ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactical expertise at the right moment. Hence, the ability to operate under stress, make decisions, and act under
primitive field conditions is critical to success.
(d) Tactical Skills. TC officers must be tactically proficient. At a minimum, they must attain a mastery of troop
leading procedures, unit defense operations, and tactical convoy operations.
(2) Senior leadership (field grade).
(a) Interpersonal skills. Even though envisioning may be considered a conceptual skill, it is essentially a group
process and is a talent that all senior TC officers need for professional development. Envisioning and innovation
contribute to the operational success of missions and assigned tasks by a process that includes establishing purpose,
vision, values, goals, and objectives.
(b) Conceptual skills. Senior TC officers should focus on conceptual skills such as critical and moral reasoning,
systems understanding, and analysis.
(c) Technical skills. The senior TC officer’s job becomes much more difficult, because they must not only have a
mastery of technical skills, they must also be able to mentor junior leaders in these skills. Their technical skills become
more complex because they are involved in resourcing, allocating, integrating, and synchronizing transportation
equipment, personnel, and technologies, which culminate in expert managerial abilities. As such, the conceptual skill of
systems understanding and analysis contributes to technical proficiency.
c. Unique knowledge.
(1) Transportation Corps officers must possess an expert knowledge of transportation and multifunctional logistical
support systems, personnel, equipment, and operations. This knowledge includes practical experience in transportation
and multifunctional logistic operations and the employment of those systems. Specifically, TC officers must strive to
possess and maintain a comprehensive understanding of the following:
(a) Power projection of forces and sustainment
(b) Reception, staging, onward movement and integration (RSO&I)
(c) Battlefield distribution
(d) Movement Control
(e) Joint Logistics-Over-The-Shore (JLOTS) operations
(f) Inter- and intra-theater transportation operations
(g) Deliberate and crisis action planning
(h) Emerging transportation technologies
(i) Transportation automated systems:
1. Automated Air Loading Planning System (AALPS)
2. Automated Movement Flow Tracking System (AMFT)
3. Cargo Movement Operation System (CMOS)
4. Computerized Movements Planning and Status System (COMPASS)
5. Deployment Sustainment and Support Tool (DS2T)
6. Enhanced Logistics Intra-theater Support Tool (ELIST)
7. Global Transportation Network (GTN)
8. Global Command and Control System- Army (GCCS–A)
9. Department of the Army Movements Management System-Redesigned (DAMMS–R)
10. Integrated Booking System (IBS)
11. Integrated Computerized Deployment System (ICODES)
12. Joint Deployment Logistics Model (JDLM)
13. Joint Flow and Analysis System for Transportation (JFAST)
14. Joint Force Requirements Generator II (JFRG II)
15. Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES)
16. Mobilization Movement Control System (MOBCON)
17. Transportation Coordinators’ Automated Information for Movement System II (TC–AIMS II) and Worldwide
Port System (WPS)
(j) Roles and functions of the Military Surface Deployment Distribution Command (SDDC)
(k) Roles and functions of the U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM)
(l) Roles and functions of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)
(m) Army maintenance and supply systems and automation
(n) Velocity management

(2) TC officers gain knowledge through training and experience in the operational domain and a logical sequence of
continuous education, which is sustained by mentoring, teaching, and coaching.
(3) Individual officers sustain knowledge through institutional training and education, duty in operational assignments, and continuous self-development.
24–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. Branch development. Leader development is determined by certain standards of schooling and operational
assignments (see fig 24–1), which will best prepare an officer for command or positions of greater responsibility. The
purpose of leader development is to ensure that the officer has acquired the necessary skills and experience, the breadth
and depth of knowledge, and attributes that are required to grow officers who are the centerpiece of a campaign quality
Army with a Joint expeditionary mindset.

(1) Lieutenant.
(a) After completing the Transportation Officer Basic Course (TOBC) or Basic Officer Leadership Course (BOLC
III), officers are normally assigned at the company level to gain leadership experience and to enhance technical and
tactical competence. Special training necessary to support an officer’s follow-on assignment may be scheduled after
TOBC or BOLC III. Officers should expect to serve in progressive positions to develop leadership, transportation
branch skills and, when appropriate, to complement this with staff experience at the battalion and brigade level. Typical
TC LT duty positions include:
1. Transportation unit platoon leader
2. Transportation unit executive officer
3. Detachment commander
4. Battalion/brigade staff officer
5. Executive officer or training officer in combat training center units
(b) The focus of LTs should be on acquiring and refining the following skills: Troop leading procedures; transportation branch related skills; and coordinating, planning, training, logistical and administrative skills. Prior to promotion to
CPT, LTs should possess an excellent knowledge of the Transportation Corps’ purpose, mission, and core competencies. This includes practical experience in TC operations, activities, and missions.
(c) Some LTs are accessed into the Transportation Corps, but detailed to a combat arms branch for 2 years. Those
officers, at the conclusion of their 2–year detail, will be assigned in a TC position. Some officers may attend the
Transportation Officer Branch Qualification Course. This course is highly encouraged for thorough branch development. Additional information on the Combat Arms Detail Program is in DA PAM 600–3, chapter 3.
(d) For self–development, the TC LT should master common core and branch tasks, expand their professional
readings, and support the Transportation Corps Regimental Association and other military and civilian transportation
professional organizations. An LT must have a baccalaureate degree in order to advance to the grade of CPT.
(e) In order to be best prepared for the challenges of the future Army, LTs must—
1. Graduate from the Transportation Officer Basic Course or a combat arms officer basic course (if branch detailed).
2. Serve as a platoon leader, detachment commander, or as an executive officer at the company level for a period of
time that allows the officer to gain breadth and depth of skills and experience. A minimum of 12 months in these
positions is preferred.
3. Become proficient in assigned common core and branch tasks for LTs as defined by their battalion commanders.
(2) Captain.
(a) Officers generally attend the CPTs’ career course (CCC) at about their 4th year of commissioned service in
preparation for company-level command and duties at battalion or higher-level staffs. This currently corresponds with
selection and promotion to CPT. Special training necessary to support an officer’s follow-on assignment may be
scheduled after completing CCC.
(b) Captains should aggressively prepare for and seek company-level command and assignments as transportation or
multifunctional battalion staff officers, service school instructors or combat training center observer controller/
evaluators (OC/Es).
(c) Captains can also expect assignments consistent with the needs of the Army. These include:
1. Branch/FA generalist (branch immaterial) positions; for example, USAREC, ROTC instructor, USMA faculty or
staff, or Active Army/RC duty.
2. Other nominative assignments, e.g., Joint Chiefs of Staff Intern, White House Fellowships or Inspector General
duties.
3. Functional Area (90) positions (refer to chap 29 for more information on this FA).
4. Advanced Civil Schooling (ACS), based on FA or overall Army requirements.
5. Training With Industry (TWI).
(d) Functional area process. There is no more FA designation board. TC officers may visit the HRC Web site and
enter their FA preference between their 5th and 10th year of service. At an officer’s 10th year of service, HRC may
recruit them for a possible change in career field based upon the needs of the Army, officer preference, military
experience and, in some cases, civil schooling. Officers who are offered and accept advanced civil schooling by an FA
will be early accessed into that particular career field during the career field designation (CFD) process. There is a
significant difference between branch qualification as a transporter and as a FA 90 multifunctional logistician (see chap
29 for detailed multifunctional development standards and opportunities).
(e) Captains should continue to gain an in-depth understanding of transportation operations as well as multifunctional logistic operations. They also must become proficient in both common core and transportation CPT tasks to gain
the knowledge required to be an effective leader at the company and battalion levels and in all aspects of transportation
operations.

258

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(f) For self–development, the TC CPT should master common core and branch tasks, expand their professional
readings, support the TC Regimental Association and other military and civilian transportation professional organizations, attend seminars and conferences, and participate in community activities.
(g) Captains must aggressively seek the skills, experience, and knowledge that will prepare them for the duties of
MAJ. The following are considered desired branch experience:
1. Successfully command a unit with at least 50 soldiers; a minimum of 12 months in this position is preferred.
2. Complete the Captains Career Course.
3. Successfully serve in at least one Transportation Branch coded (88) assignment or one FA coded (90) assignment.
(3) Major.
(a) Upon selection to MAJ, an HQDA board of senior officers will convene to determine what career field
designation (CFD) is best suited for each officer. The board considers officer skills and experience, Army requirements, and officer preference when determining the CFD. Transportation Corps MAJs not designated to the Operations
career field will be nominated to serve in one of the other 3 career fields: Operational Support, Information Operations
and Institutional Support. Selection into a career field other than operations means that the Transportation Branch will
no longer manage the officer. Transportation Corps officers, who remain in the Operations career field, will attend the
resident ILE course not later than the completion of their 12th year of commissioned service. They can expect to
receive branch, multifunctional logistics and branch/FA generalist assignments such as the Reserve Officers Training
Corps (ROTC) and U.S. Military Academy (USMA) faculty or staff. Their assignments will be managed by Transportation Branch assignments officers in the USA HRC, OPMD. Officers designated into one of the other 3 career fields
will serve FA and branch/FA generalist assignments and will have their careers managed by an FA assignment officer
in the OPMD Functional Area Management and Development Division. Officers in career fields other that the
operations career field may receive their common core instruction at distance education campus sites where qualified
instructors will teach them.
(b) Military Education Level (MEL/ILE) 4 education for all TC officers is essential to their professional development. Officers completing the ILE curriculum will be ILE and Joint professional military education (JPME 1) qualified.
The Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course (AOWC) is the second phase of ILE.
(c) Upon the completion of ILE, majors should aggressively seek the skills and experience that will best prepare
them for the duties of LTC. The following assignments are considered desirable branch development and experience
for majors:
1. Transportation General: Division transportation officer, battalion/group/brigade executive officer, battalion/group/
brigade S–3
2. Movement Control: Division movement control officer, movement control team commander, battalion/Theater
Movement Control Agency (TMCA) executive officer, battalion/TMCA S–3
3. Marine and Terminal Operations: Battalion/group/brigade executive officer, battalion/group S–3, SDDC Company
Commander
4. Highway/Rail Transportation: Battalion/group/brigade executive officer, Battalion/group/brigade S–3
5. Multifunctional Logistics: Support operations officer, support battalion/support group/DISCOM executive officer,
support group/DISCOM S–3, maneuver and other brigade S–4
(d) The following are examples of generating force professional development assignments for majors:
1. Division or corps staff
2. Joint/DOD/Army staff
3. MACOM staff
4. Combat training center (CTC) observer controller
5. Training schools faculty or staff
6. Service school instructor
7. Reserve Component (RC) assignment
8. School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) utilization tour (for officers who complete the one-year SAMS
Program after ILE). SAMS graduates normally serve as corps or division plans officers for at least one year,
immediately after graduation.
9. Other branch/FA generalist positions such as Inspector General
(e) Majors must exercise continuous self-development efforts to fully master all aspects of transportation operations
and multifunctional logistics to include Joint and multinational operations. Self-development may include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training. Officers must devote time to a professional reading program
in order to broaden their warfighting and logistical perspective; they must also conduct research and write articles for
professional, military publications.
(f) As stated earlier, skills and experience will drive an officer’s career path and future assignments. Completion of
ILE and successful service in branch desirable positions of responsibility will best prepare majors for promotion to
LTC. The optimal timeline to provide officers with the opportunity to successfully serve in branch desirable positions
of responsibility as previously mentioned is 18–36 months.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

9. SDDC transportation staff officer
10. USTRANSCOM staff officer
(b) Service school staff/faculty Officers selected for COL should apply for the US Army War College Distance
Education Course, if not selected for the Senior Service College resident course.
b. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. CPTs and above can expect to serve in branch/FA generalist
assignments, such as instructors and IGs that may or may not be directly related to the Transportation Corps branch,
but deemed important to the Army.
c. Joint assignments. Transportation Corps officers can expect to be considered for Joint duty assignments in Joint
organizations worldwide. Joint experience is important to the Army and is essential to individual officers for their
advancement into senior leadership positions.
d. Other assignments. TC officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated above. These
other assignments may include White House Fellowships and duty with the National Security Council, the United
Nations and other international staffs, as well as TC branch representatives at allied service schools. The spectrum of
possible assignments is large, and these assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and important,
requiring mature, skilled, and well-grounded officers.
e. Force stabilization. Force stabilization is a system (consisting of Home-basing and Unit Focused Stability)
designed to decrease personnel turbulence for units and set conditions for increased unit readiness, combat effectiveness, and cohesion.
(1) Stabilized installation assignments. Generally, officers assigned to stabilized installations will be initial entry
officers from OBC. These officers will be assigned to an installation for approximately 7 years. During this time, the
officers will complete their platoon leader and LT years. The officers will gain tactical and operational experience that
will benefit them and the Army in their development in future positions. Many of these officers will then proceed to
the Advanced Course and return to the same installation to complete company command. The remaining officers will
be reassigned to other installations for command and positions in accordance with the needs of the Army. Field grade
officers will be assigned to stabilized installations for a period of time to complete their branch assignments. The goal
for field grade officers is to maintain a minimum of 2 years time on station, possibly 3.
(2) Life cycle managed (LCM) units. Officers at all levels may be assigned to life cycle managed units (generally
the Stryker Brigade and Units of Action that are currently being developed) for a minimum of 3 years. The officers
will complete LT development, company, or battalion command, or MAJ branch development during this time.

260

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

Officers in these units have the possibility of a longer time in platoon leader, command, or MAJ branch desirable
positions. Branch detailed officers will remain in their detail branch until after completion of the assignment to the
LCM unit which may be longer than 2 years..
(3) Cyclic managed units. The majority of the installations and EAD CSS units will be managed on a cyclic
manning system. Replacements will be sent to these units and installations periodically to maintain readiness of the
units. Tour lengths and developmental position opportunities can vary. Branch detail officers will remain on standard
branch detail timelines.
24–4. Warrant officer qualification and development
a. The WO of the Future Force is a self–aware and adaptive technical expert, combat leader, trainer, and advisor.
Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the WO administers, manages,
maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment across the full range of Army operations. The purpose
of the WO component of OPMS is to enhance the effectiveness and professionalism of the WO corps while thoroughly
integrating management practices and leader development education within the larger field and company grade officer
corps.
b. Warrant Officers in the Transportation Corps manage the operation and maintenance of US Army watercraft and
movement control measures in both tactical and peacetime environments. These operations technicians support Army
missions by planning, coordinating, and directing Army units during ocean, logistics-over-the-shore (LOTS), coastal,
and harbor and inland water (CHI) missions as well as strategic, operational, and tactical movement control missions
worldwide.
c. The Transportation Corps has 3 different AOCs within the WO technical fields: Marine Operations, Marine
Maintenance, and Movement Control Operations.
(1) Marine Operations (880A): The MOS in this area of concentration has 2 distinct skill levels of technical training
and professional credentialing: MOS 880A1 and 880A2, Marine Deck Officer. Officers within this AOC command and
operate Army watercraft and watercraft detachments; serve aboard Army watercraft as the commanding officer, master,
navigator, cargo officer or deck watch officer; serve as an Army harbormaster or port operations officer; or may serve
on a battalion-level staff or higher as an operations officer or as a service school instructor.
(2) Marine Maintenance (881A): The MOS in this AOC has 2 distinct skill levels of technical training and
professional credentials: MOS 881A1 and 881A2, Marine Engineering Officer. Officers in this area of concentration
command watercraft maintenance detachments and maintain Army watercraft, serve as chief engineer, assistant
engineer or engineering watch officer; or may serve on a battalion–level staff or higher as a maintenance officer or as a
service school instructor.
(3) Movement Control Operations (882A): There is one WO specialty within this area of concentration: MOS 882A,
Mobility Officer. The skills and knowledge necessary to qualify for this specialty requires technical expertise to plan,
organize, and supervise the movement, deployment, and redeployment of Army personnel and equipment. They must
also be able to coordinate deployment and redeployment issues with Joint, Army, and commercial agencies as well as
provide technical expertise and guidance on the implementation and use of transportation automation systems. Mobility
officers coordinate and conduct training of unit deployment and redeployment operations. They advise and assist
commanders and staffs on deployment movement, sustainment, maneuver, and redeployment operations. Officers in
this AOC may serve on a battalion-level staff or higher, or as a service school instructor.

24–6. Transportation Corps Reserve Component officers
A significant portion of the Transportation Corps’ assets resides in the Reserve Components.
a. General career development.
(1) Transportation Corps RC officers serve in the same roles and missions as their Active Army counterparts. The
unique nature of the RC soldier’s role as a citizen–soldier poses a challenge for their professional development.
However, RC officers are expected to follow AC officer development patterns as closely as possible with the exception
that RC officers have increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements.
(2) To meet professional development objectives, RC officers must be willing to rotate between the ARNG and
USAR TPU, IRR, individual mobilization augmentee, and the AGR programs. These transfers are necessitated by
geographical considerations and the need to provide as many officers as possible the opportunity to serve with troops in
leadership and staff positions.
(3) There may be occasions when RC officers will be transferred to the IRR while they complete mandatory
educational requirements. Such transfers will be temporary and should not be seen as impacting negatively on the
officer’s career.
(4) Because of a lack of transportation units above company level in the Army National Guard, it is recommended
that CPTs attend the Captains Career Course (CCC) and seek multifunctional logistics units for career progression and
professional development after company command.
(5) The success of an RC officer is not measured by length of service in any one component or control group, but
by the officer’s breadth of experience, duty performance and overall branch development. Refer to DA PAM 600–3,
chapter 7, for a detailed description of an RC officer’s career management and development.
b. Branch development opportunities. Officers are professionally developed through a succession of schooling and
assignments described below. Generally, education and self- development requirements parallel those identified for
active duty TC officers. However, assignment opportunities/options are limited for RC officers. Officers may periodically be assigned to a branch/FA generalist (branch immaterial) position based on Army requirements. Prescribed
operational assignments are flexible to meet the needs of the Reserve Components. Recommended RC TC officer
professional development by grade is as follows:
(1) Lieutenant.
(a) The Transportation Officer Basic Course is the starting point for newly accessed RC TC officers. Reserve
Component officers should complete resident TOBC by their third year (USAR) or 18 months (ARNG) of service.
Officers should obtain assignments to troop units at the company level as a platoon leader or executive officer, and at
battalion/brigade level as an assistant staff officer.
(b) For self–development, the RC TC LT should master common core and branch tasks, expand their professional
readings, and support the TC Regimental Association and other military and civilian transportation professional
organizations.
(c) In order to be best prepared for the challenges of the Army’s Future Force, RC LTs should strive to:
1. Graduate from the TOBC or BOLC.
2. Serve as a platoon leader or as an executive officer at the company level for a period of time that allows the
officer to gain breadth and depth of skills and expertise; 12 months is preferred.
3. Be proficient in common core and branch tasks for LTs.
4. Have a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college prior to selection for CPT.
(2) Captain.
(a) RC CPTs must complete the resident or non-resident RC Transportation Officer Advanced Course (RCTOAC)

(b) Active Army CPTs transferring to the Reserve Component, who have completed their branch Captains Career
Course, have met the requirements described in paragraph 24-6b(2)(a) above.
(c) In order to be best prepared for the duties of a MAJ, RC CPTs should:
1. Graduate from an Officer Advanced Course (Captains Career Course).
2. Successfully serve in one of the following branch preferred positions for a period of time that allows the officer
to gain breadth and depth of skills and experience; 12 months is preferred:
a. Company commander
b. Battalion/brigade staff officer
c. During the 5th year of service, RC TC officers will be designated to single track in transportation or will be
assigned an FA. The majority of TC officers will be designated FA 90 (Multifunctional Logistician Program).
d. RC CPTs should continue to gain an in–depth understanding of transportation operations as well as multifunctional logistic operations. They also must become proficient in both common core and transportation CPT tasks to gain

264

Chapter 25
Ordnance Corps Branch
25–1. Unique features of the Ordnance Corps Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Ordnance Corps Branch. Ordnance Corps officers are warrior logisticians on today’s
battlefield who provide focused logistics support to sustain America’s Forces in victory today and into the future and
embody the spirit of service to the line, on the line, on time. The Ordnance branch is a combat service support arms
branch that has sustained America’s forces since 1812. Combat victory cannot be achieved without logistical readiness,
the timely availability and proper functioning of materiel, resources and systems to maintain and sustain operations on
a fluid and resource driven battlefield. The Soldiers of the Ordnance Corps ensure the highest level of combat readiness
by employing sound tactical and technical leadership and advice with innovative technical expertise in achieving the
Ordnance mission: to support the development, production, acquisition and sustainment of weapon systems and
munitions and to provide explosive ordnance disposal during peace and war. The Ordnance Corps also provides
materiel and distribution management expertise, combat developments, and doctrine writing, training and professional
developments of active Army, Reserve Component, civilian personnel, other Services and Allies in Ordnance branch
and common skill areas. Combined, the Ordnance Corps provides the key to the logistical success of sustaining
Soldiers and materiel, and directing logistics planning and operations across the entire operational continuum.
b. Unique features of work in the Ordnance Corps Branch.
(1) The Ordnance Corps offers a broad spectrum of opportunities. Every officer learns and trains to be a wellrounded logistician, gaining expertise and experience in diverse specialties and skills. The Ordnance Corps equally
values assignments in the operating force and the generating force. Assignment in either and/or both areas within an
officer’s career will enable promotion opportunities. Successful completion of key developmental and preferred branch
assignments at various grades is key to continued professional development and career advancement. Every officer
must strive to serve successfully in all leadership and staff positions in order to hone their skills and compete for
promotion.
(2) Ordnance Branch officer responsibilities encompass the functions of life cycle management in 3 primary areas:
tank/automotive materiel, munitions materiel and missile/electronics materiel. These include developing, testing, fielding, maintaining and disposing of Army materiel. The Ordnance Corps also provides Explosive Ordnance Disposal
(EOD) support for the U.S. Army and other U.S. government agencies. Ordnance branch warrant officers are focused
in specific technical specialties including ammunition handling and storage, electronic and missile maintenance, and
mechanical maintenance. Officers and warrant officers progress through a variety of worldwide assignments with
combat, combat support and combat service support units. Each MOS offers a wide diversity of experience and
expertise, and all Ordnance officer positions are open to women.
(a) Materiel Maintenance and Munitions Management (AOC 91A). Officers are responsible for integrated maintenance of Army conventional weapon systems, small arms, artillery, fire control equipment, missile systems and their
associated ground support equipment; electronics; tracked and wheeled vehicles; and engineer and power generation
equipment. Maintenance functions include metalworking, fabrication, welding, inspection, test, service, calibration,
repair, overhaul and reclamation. Officers working in this commodity effectively and efficiently ensure that the
maximum numbers of weapon systems are operational and available to the combat commanders. Duty positions in this
commodity require a comprehensive knowledge of maintenance management techniques, supply procedures, and
integrated logistic support as it applies to multiple commodity areas. Officers must be technically competent in
production control and quality assurance techniques. The technical sophistication of today’s Army weapon systems and
the high dollar cost of production, fielding and maintenance of these systems require officers with the highest
managerial and leadership skills. Officers also participate in the life cycle management of the Army’s munitions
inventory. These officers lead, manage, plan, direct and participate in activities and organizations engaged in support of
conventional munitions and in some cases captured enemy munitions. Support functions include supply, storage,

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

267

transportation, maintenance, surveillance, inspection, demilitarization, stock control, safety and security, including
maintenance of associated test and handling equipment.
(b) Explosive Ordnance Disposal (AOC 89E). Only Ordnance officers are eligible to apply for EOD. The opportunity to attend EOD school is available to officers after completion of Officer Basic Course (OBC) and the Combined
Logistics Captain’s Career Course (CLC3), with the majority of officers attending EOD school after CLC3 due to the
limited number of LT positions. Procedures for volunteering are located in DA Pam 351–4 and AR 611–105. Explosive
Ordnance Disposal officers provide a unique and critical service to the Army and other U.S. government agencies.
Officers must complete an intense 2–phased EOD course prior to being awarded this designation. These officers lead,
manage, plan and direct activities and organizations concerned with identification, location, rendering safe, handling,
removal and disposal of U.S. and foreign unexploded conventional, nuclear and chemical munitions. EOD officers
plan, develop, and integrate EOD operations for all types of contingency operations. These officers advise, integrate
and execute the render safe operations of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive Ordnance
Disposal (CBRNE) functions stemming from threats posed by unexploded ordnance (UXO), improvised explosive
devices (IED), and weapons of mass destruction. Officers in EOD can expect to serve throughout the world and serve
on major command staffs as advisors on EOD matters. These officers will also advise and assist law enforcement
agencies in the removal and/or neutralization of explosive devices; provide support/protection to the President of the
U.S., senior American officials, military and foreign dignitaries; and support intelligence activities through analysis of
foreign munitions.

equipment. This MOS is merged with 915E at the CW5 level.
c. Officer tasks. Ordnance officers and warrant officers work at all levels of the Army from platoon and detachment
to DA and Joint staffs. All Ordnance officers can expect to perform the following functions and tasks:
(1) Maintenance and munitions materiel management at battalion, group, brigade, UEx or UEy distribution management center.
(2) Course developer, service school instructor, and/or action officer in combat developments involved in planning
and development of doctrine, organizations and equipment required to support Army materiel systems.

(3) Commander, staff officer, executive officer, materiel officer, maintenance officer, ammunition officer, EOD
officer, support operations officer, logistics operations officer, or platoon leader of a unit or activity in support of tank/
automotive, missile/electronics or munitions materiel. This may include logistics staff officer positions on Joint and
Army staffs.
(4) Observer/controller at a combat training center, (NTC, JRTC, CMTC, or BCTP).
(5) Assignment within the USAREC, service as Ordnance advisors to the USAR and ARNG organizations, or
ROTC instructors.
(6) Ordnance warrant officers primarily work in technical maintenance and ammunition supervisory positions that
correspond to their specialty, and may fill positions similar to those described above. Warrant officers are not normally
assigned to positions such as platoon leader, XO, commander, or primary staff officer, but may be assigned to these
positions when circumstances dictate and with special permission from HRC.
25–2. Characteristics required of Ordnance Officers
The Ordnance Corps requires officers and warrant officers who are warrior logisticians skilled in leadership at all
levels; who are proficient in tactics, and Ordnance techniques and procedures; are physically and mentally fit, maintain
and display self-control, remain calm under pressure and adhere to published standards and regulations. Ordnance
officers must emulate Army Values and the Warrior Ethos, possess leader attributes and leader skills, and fully
understand the key leadership actions to ensure success.
a. Unique Attributes.
(1) Flexibility. As the Army continues to transform, flexibility is key for all Ordnance officers. The fluidity of the
modern battlefield and the types of missions ordnance and logistical forces must execute to support combat operations
necessitates a proactive officer who can adapt to changing environments. As we move to a modular force, Ordnance
officers must also be able to design and lead support organizations that enable the combatant commander to retain the
highest levels of combat power.
(2) Multifunctionality. At the company through field grade level, Ordnance officer work is primarily branch oriented
but becomes increasingly multifunctional — first within the career field and eventually as the officers become more
senior, across systems/skills that cross several branches. Officers must develop and utilize a diverse set of skills as they
move between branch assignments in operating force and generating force positions, and as they serve in branch / FA
generalists (formerly branch immaterial) assignments. Junior grade WO’s work is specialty oriented, but becomes
increasingly multidimensional, first within their MOS, and eventually, as the WO becomes more proficient, across
systems/skills that cross several career fields. Warrant officers must develop and use a diverse set of skills as they
move between assignments to prepare them to serve in branch area generalist assignments at the senior WO grades.
b. Unique Skills.
(1) Tactical and technical skills. Ordnance officers must be logisticians that are technically proficient with branch
unique operations, equipment, tools and systems. Ordnance mission success requires the proper balance between
technical skills and the ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactical skills at the right moment. These skills
must be gained and developed through repetitive assignments in the operating and generating force and through
continued professional study and self- development.
(2) Decisionmaking skills. Ordnance officers often work in an environment where time available for problem
analysis is seriously constrained, but where sound, timely decisions are urgently required. An ability to operate under
stress and make sound decisions is critical to success. In order to do so, officers must possess expert knowledge of
Ordnance and logistics support principles. This knowledge includes the tactics, techniques and procedures to employ
these principles in a combined arms environment. Officers gain this knowledge through a logical sequence of
continuous education, training and experience, sustained by coaching. Individual officers sustain knowledge through
institutional training and education, duty assignments throughout the Army, and continuous self-development.
(3) Leadership. Ordnance officers and WOs look to their raters, senior raters and mentors for advice and career
counseling. Some counseling is official, such as the preparation and submission of the OER and the Officer Evaluation
Support Form. Other counseling is less formal and may relate to career patterns, advice about assignments, and duty
positions. Commanders play a significant role by understanding the officer and warrant officer education systems,
ensuring that officers attend professional development courses at the proper times, and include all officers in unit
Officer Professional Development (OPD) sessions.
25–3. Critical Active Army Ordnance officer developmental assignments
a. Officer qualification and development. There are multiple career paths that can lead to success and Ordnance
officers should seek a breadth of assignment opportunities and experiences. Ordnance officers and warrant officers
must meet certain standards in terms of education and assignments to be successful in the Ordnance branch at each
grade. Meeting these standards ensures that the officer has acquired the skills, knowledge and attributes to remain
proficient in the Ordnance branch at that grade and is qualified for promotion or retention in the branch. The desired
skills and experiences for Ordnance officers at all grades are detailed in this paragraph. It is essential that the Ordnance
Corps have officers who are outstanding troop leaders, as well as those who can provide requisite technical expertise in

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

269

other areas, such as in specialized areas of concentration and logistics skills. Ordnance officers should be tactically and
technically proficient, be physically fit, and be of the highest moral and ethical character. Recognizing that various
assignments require different strengths, techniques and backgrounds, an officer’s most important assignment is the
current one and the officer should focus on outstanding performance in that job assignment. Underpinning officer
development are the 3 domains of leader development: institutional training, assignments and self-development. The
first 2, institutional training and assignments for Ordnance officers, are described in this chapter. Self-development is
the responsibility of every officer and ranges from professional reading during off-duty time to aggressively seeking
out positions of increased responsibility. Each officer, with support from coaches and mentors, should develop career
goals and clearly articulate those goals to the commander and assignments officer at HRC. Always remember that an
officer is his or her own best career manager. By actively participating in the management of career decisions, officers
will improve the likelihood of a successful career.
(1) Lieutenant. At the grade of LT, the officer should concentrate on developing leadership abilities, communicative,
management, technical and tactical skills. This is the stage where officers develop their basic foundation for the rest of
their careers. If an officer’s initial assignment is where limited leadership opportunities are available, the officer should
strive for a follow-on assignment where those skills can be developed.
(a) Career requirements are a bachelor’s degree and completing the Officer Basic Course (OBC.)
(b) Officers should expect to serve in company level positions that develop leadership, Ordnance branch skills and,
when available, supplemented with staff experience at battalion level. Officers should seek positions that include
platoon leader, ammunition officer, shop officer, maintenance officer, battalion staff officer or executive officer in
tactical maintenance, ammunition, or multifunctional support units, or training officer in training center units. LTs
assigned to Brigade Combat Team life cycle units can expect to remain in that unit for it’s entire life cycle, and upon
promotion to CPT, may serve in LT positions until the completion of the unit life cycle. Assignments will be based on
needs of the Army, professional development requirements, and officer’s preferences. Assignment to life cycle units is
discussed in paragraph 25–7c.
(c) Because all initial assignments are important, an officer should be primarily concerned with manner of performance, development of professional attributes, enthusiasm for the job, and demonstration of potential. The focus during
this phase should be on acquiring and refining troop leading skills, Ordnance branch related skills and coordinating
logistics and administrative skills. Before promotion to CPT, officers should possess an excellent knowledge of the
Ordnance branch and a basic knowledge of general logistics principles. This includes practical experience in Ordnance
branch activities and missions, and in tactics and logistics operations. After completing the Officer Basic Course
(OBC), to be replaced in the near future by the Basic Officer Leadership Course (BOLC), phase III (proponent
institutional training) officers can expect assignments to Units of Action or other Combat Service Support (CSS) or
logistics units supporting operational forces. By law, officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree before promotion to
CPT.
(2) Captain. A desired leadership and preferred assignment skill for CPTs is command of a company or detachment
for at least twelve months. However, not all CPTs can be guaranteed company command. Doing well and demonstrated
potential in all jobs is the important factor for promotions. Junior and senior CPTs continue to develop leadership,
tactical, technical, and management skills. CPTs must aggressively seek the skills and experience that will prepare
them for promotion to MAJ.
(a) Upon promotion to or selection for CPT, all officers attend the Combined Logistics Captains Career Course
(CLC3) to prepare for assignment at company level command and staff duties at the battalion or higher levels.
Currently CLC3 officers will receive both advanced tactical and technical training as well as instruction in advanced
materiel management and multifunctional logistics. CLC3 is the first time an officer will receive institutional training
in multifunctional logistics. Attendance at CLC3 will be in a Temporary Duty (TDY) status with return to the same
station, Temporary Change of Station (TCS) or Permanent Change of Station (PCS) status, as fits the needs of the
Army and the officer’s follow-on assignment.
(b) CPTs should seek duty assignment locations that provide reasonable opportunities for command, in either the
operating or generating force. Other desired assignments include battalion or brigade staff, service school instructor,
and combat training center observer controller/evaluator (OC/E). CPTs can also expect assignment opportunities
consistent with the needs of the Army that provide exposure to Army level operations, and in some cases, Joint
organizations. These include Branch Immaterial positions (for example, USAREC, ROTC instructor, USMA faculty
and staff or Active Army/RC duty). Some officers can also expect opportunities for selection to attend advanced civil
schooling either fully funded or on a cooperative basis. Assignments will be based on needs of the Army, professional
development requirements, and officer’s preferences. Assignment to life cycle units is discussed in paragraph 25–7c.
(c) Officers who volunteer for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) training and successfully complete EOD
training, will normally be assigned to EOD units or positions for the majority of their entire career. EOD officers may
serve in other assignments as described above for their grade, however opportunities are more infrequent.
(d) Overall, an officer should seek assignments to become technically proficient and master essential troop leading
skills that provide the opportunity to gain an in-depth understanding of logistics operations. These things provide the
foundation of knowledge required to effectively serve in the branch as a leader at the company and battalion level in all
aspects of Ordnance operations and in leading Ordnance soldiers. All officers should seek job opportunities in all
270

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

commodities available to them in the Ordnance Corps. For example, officers who have worked ammunition should
seek opportunities in maintenance positions. There is no FA designation point for CPTs, but officers can submit via
AHRC Web site preference for FA and be recruited by that functional proponent area for possible change of career
field. Functional areas are discussed separately in DA PAM 600–3.
(e) Advanced maintenance or supply courses, support operations course, or an advanced degree in engineering,
physical science, business, or logistics management all contribute to the Ordnance officer’s professional development.
However, job performance and completion of key developmental assignments should take precedence over advanced
schooling. Advanced degrees and additional schooling are available during this time, however, some of these programs
are highly competitive and selection is based on demonstrated performance and potential for promotion. Selected
officers may attend graduate school to meet specific Army requirements established by the Army Education Requirements Board. The Army approves the university or college the officer selects. Many Ordnance officers are also selected
to attend the Logistics Executive Development Course at the U.S. Army Logistics Management College (ALMC),
where advanced degrees in procurement and logistics management can be obtained through the U.S. ALMC Cooperative Degree Program with the Florida Institute of Technology (F.I.T.). More information on Advanced Civil Schooling
is located in chapter 4 of this pamphlet. Ordnance officers also have an opportunity to participate in the Training With
Industry (TWI) program. This program provides an officer an opportunity to spend up to 12 months with a civilian
industry that provides training in industrial procedures and practices. The training is designed to enhance knowledge,
experience and perspectives in management and operational techniques. This program is very competitive and requires
an officer to apply through the Ordnance branch future readiness officer at AHRC. The future readiness officer, in
conjunction with the Ordnance Corps’ TWI program coordinator in the Personnel Proponency Office of the Chief of
Ordnance, will select officers for the TWI assignment. Participants may also be exposed to innovative management
practices, techniques, procedures, and so forth, which have applicability to and benefit for the Army. Once the TWI
student is integrated back into an Army organization, they can use this information to improve the Army’s ability to
interact and conduct business with industry. Officers are also highly encouraged to seek Advanced Civil Education
(ACE) on their own through off duty programs at military installation education centers.
(3) Major. Upon selection to MAJ, an HQDA level board will convene to determine what career field designation is
best suited for each officer. The board considers officer skills and experience, preference and Army requirements. This
board of senior officers will decide which career field each officer is best suited to serve. Ordnance MAJs will have an
opportunity to seek an FA related assignment in one of the 4 career fields: Operational, Operational Support,
Information Operations and Institutional Support. After promotion to MAJ, officers will compete for promotion only
within their designated career field. Assignments after promotion to MAJ will be managed at AHRC by the Ordnance
Corps Branch for the Operations career field and by the Functional Area Management and Development Division for
officers designated into the other 3 career fields. MAJs not designated to the Operations career field will be nominated
to serve in one of the other 3 career fields: Operational Support, Information Operations, or Institutional Support (see
chaps 1 through 8). Selection into a career field other than operations means that the officer will no longer be managed
by Ordnance Branch. Officers retained in the Operations career field will attend the resident ILE course. Upon
completion of ILE, MAJs must aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience that will qualify them for
promotion to LTC.
(a) Military education required is completion of ILE. Officers attending ILE at Fort Leavenworth will also be
certified Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) I and ILE. The ILE will be an assignment process, not board
selected, and will normally occur between the 8th and 12th year of commissioned service. Completion of ILE and duty
in preferred branch assignments will prepare Ordnance MAJs to serve at the LTC level. The goal is for officers to
serve 24 months total in desired assignments. Officers desiring to be competitive to command LTC troop units should
have preferred branch experiences that included command at the company grade level. It is also desirable for officers
not tracked 89E (EOD) to seek assignment opportunities in both ammunition and maintenance functions of the
Ordnance Corps. Continued successful performance in the preferred branch assignments will enhance the officers’
selection potential for LTC. As a general rule, Ordnance officers selected for battalion command are likely to command
in the same command category in which they obtained their preferred branch experience as a MAJ.
(b) The preferred branch assignments for MAJs are in both the operating and generating forces. MAJs in the
Operations career field should aggressively seek the following preferred branch assignments to be competitive for
promotion to LTC. Battalion/Brigade XO — UE Ammunition Officer — Battalion/Brigade Support Operations Officer
- Distribution Center Manager — Battalion/Brigade S3 —Major Level Command —Combat Training Center Observer/
Controller/Evaluator —TO&E BDE S4 —Any FA 90 Major’s key developmental position IAW paragraph 29–3. Other
desired developmental assignments include: brigade or higher level staff, Joint /defense/Army staff, MACOM staff,
Command and General Staff College (CGSC) faculty and staff, service school instructor, or reserve component (RC)
support. MAJs can also serve in other branch/FA generalist (branch immaterial) positions. Those officers selected for
the School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) will serve at UE, and HQDA as staff planners.
(c) MAJs must exercise continuous self-development to fully master all aspects of operations including Joint and
multinational operations. Self–development may include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional
training. Officers should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their warfighting perspective. Skills
and experience will drive an officer’s career path and future assignments. FA 90 is in the Operations career field and

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

271

Ordnance officers may move between functional and multifunctional assignments. Ordnance officers who remain in the
Operations career field can expect to have both branch assignments and branch immaterial assignments. Other
objectives should be obtaining a master’s degree in a logistics related field (such as logistics management, business
management and engineering). Those officers not possessing a graduate degree are strongly encouraged to do so.
Ordnance Major’s military education opportunities expand to include not only traditional military schools but also
fellowships and internships. These include White House Fellowships; Congressional Fellowships; and Center for
Military History Internships. Joint assignments will offer the opportunity for military schooling.
(4) Lieutenant colonel. Upon selection for LTC, AHRC assignment managers review each LTC selectee’s file for
career experience. This review then acts as a guide for recommending the officer’s utilization plans for the remainder
of the officer’s career. This phase provides the Army with officers in senior grades who have developed the expertise
needed in specific career fields or multifunctional logistics.
(a) Officers selected for LTC in the Operations career field should seek assignments of greater responsibility in
branch and branch immaterial positions. The objective in LTC assignments is greater contribution to the branch and the
Army. All LTCs will have the opportunity to compete for battalion command at the LTC level. Selection for battalion
command is extremely competitive, with the majority of LTCs not having the opportunity.
(b) The majority of Ordnance LTCs should concentrate on seeking out and performing well in critical staff positions
at the Sustainment UA, UE, Army, Joint, and DOD levels. An LTC should serve in at least 2 of the following types of
positions to be considered competitive for promotion to COL: battalion command of a force structure/force generation
battalion or its equivalent; Joint assignment; Strategic Level of Logistics (for example, AMC/DLA); staff assignment at
the division, installation DOL, Corps, MACOM, HQDA or Joint staff levels (as G4/J4); Service school assignment (for
example, Ordnance Center and School, CGSC/ILE, and senior Service college); FA 90 (Multifunctional Logistician
Program) coded positions.
(c) LTCs benefit by having an advanced degree and also gain an advantage by being selected for and attending a
Senior Service College or completing the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course (MEL 1). LTCs enhance
their consideration for future command assignments by having a successful assignment in a battalion level command.
(5) Colonel.
(a) Attendance at a Senior Service College or completion of U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course
(MEL 1) is advantageous and selective. Except through an established resident program such as the Army War College
(AWC), the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF), and similar senior service courses, completion of the nonresident course is the only other means by which an Army officer can receive credit for Senior Service College
training. However, once selected and enrolled in the non-resident course, an officer is no longer eligible to attend a
resident Senior Service College. Therefore, it is recommended that the officer discuss this with his or her assignment
manager prior to applying for the correspondence course. The Senior Service College selection board is responsible for
selection of all active duty officers for participation in the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course (see AR
350–1).
(b) Colonels should serve in one of the following types of positions: Command of an Ordnance Brigade level unit,
training brigade or garrison command), Multifunctional staff positions; Advisory groups in foreign countries; Inspector
General (IG) office; USAREC staff; ROTC; USAR and ARNG liaison; USMA faculty and staff; Other executive staff
positions. Ordnance COLs may also serve in branch/FA generalist positions that contribute to their professional
development, but may not be specifically related to their area of concentration. Criteria for selection include overall
manner of performance, military experience, military and civilian education, and demonstrated potential to serve in
positions of increased responsibility. Ordnance officers are encouraged to seek Joint duty assignments and multinational forces assignments. These assignments are viewed as key for career enhancement. Joint duty assignments and the
Joint Specialty Officer program and designator (3L) are described in chapter 3.
(6) Ordnance WOs must meet certain standards in terms of professional development and operational assignments to
evolve as a well-rounded senior WO within their specialty. Meeting these standards ensures the WO has acquired the
skills, knowledge, and attributes to remain proficient in their specialty and serve at all levels within the Army. The
Warrant Officer Education System requires specific training designed to prepare WOs for competitive positions of
greater responsibility to serve at all levels in the Army. Ordnance Branch requires WOs who are skilled technicians in
their specialty. Every WO learns and trains to be a well–rounded logistician while gaining expertise in their specialty
through progressive levels of assignments.
(a) Warrant officer one and chief warrant officer two. After completing the WOCC, WO1s attend their MOS
WOBC. Appointment to WO1 is contingent upon successfully completing the WOBC for the officer’s respective MOS.
WO1 and CW2s are junior level tactical and technical experts who should expect to serve at the TOE platoon,
company, and battalion level, with some brigade and higher level support positions in the following type units;
Forward Support Company, Maintenance Company, or Maintenance Section (CA, CS, CSS, Battalion/Group/Brigade/
Regiment), Patriot Direct Support Co, Modular Ammunition Company (Heavy or Light), Ordnance Company Ammunition/Maintenance (Direct Support/General Support) and/or Signal Company/Battalion. The type of assignment is MOS
dependent and gives the junior Ordnance WO a solid base of experience, depth and breadth on systems and processes
that ultimately prepares them for assignments at the higher levels. The junior WO should focus on acquiring and
refining tactical, and administrative skills, as well as MOS unique technical skills. Warrant officers should devote time
272

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

to self-development, which should include correspondence courses, institutional training and civilian education. Junior
warrant officers should utilize a professional reading program to broaden both their warfighting perspective and
technical comprehension. CW2s can expect assignment to CW3 positions, but attend their MOS WOAC prior to
assignment. All officers in the grade of CW2 must complete the TRADOC mandated common core prerequisite studies
for the WOAC prior to promotion, selection and attendance at WOAC. Although not a requirement for promotion, all
officers in the grade of WO1 and CW2 should set as a goal completion of an associate’s degree. Successful completion
of every duty assignment is important, and will determine promotion potential.
(b) Chief warrant officer three. Ordnance CW3s must complete the WOAC in order to continue their professional
development and remain competitive for promotion to CW4. Upon selection for promotion to CW3, the WO will be
eligible to attend the WOSC. All officers in the grade of CW3 are advanced level tactical and technical experts who
normally serve as the senior WO in TOE platoon, company, battalion and brigade level positions in the following type
units; Ammunition Transfer Holding Detachment, Brigade or UE Ammunition Office, Forward Support Company,
Electronic Maintenance Company, Armor, Mechanized Infantry (Battalion/Brigade), or Cavalry Squadron/Regiment,
Maintenance Section/Company (CA, CS, CSS Battalion/Brigade/Regiment), Maintenance Section (Brigade Support
Battalion, Main Support Battalion, Engineer Company/Battalion/Brigade), Ordnance Company Missile and/or Signal
Company/Battalion. The type of assignment is MOS dependent. CW3s at this level should provide leader development,
mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs, warrant officers and officers, and advice to commanders on Ordnance
technical and WO issues. In addition, warrant officers may serve in TDA units in supervisory, advisory and training
positions that are MOS–specific. CW3s can expect assignment to CW4 positions, but attend their MOS WOAC prior to
assignment. CW3s should continue to acquire and refine advanced technical and administrative skills, as well as MOS
unique technical skills. The Training With Industry (TWI) Program is another avenue for warrant officers to develop
higher-level managerial techniques and cultivate an understanding of the relationship of their industry as it relates to
specific functions of the Army. This program is very competitive and requires an officer to apply through the Ordnance
branch WO career manager at AHRC. The Ordnance WO career manager, in conjunction with the Ordnance Corps’
TWI program coordinator in the Personnel Proponency Office of the Chief of Ordnance, will select officers for the
TWI assignment. Participants may be exposed to innovative practices, procedures, and so forth, which have applicability and benefit to the Army. Once the TWI student is integrated back into an Army organization, they use this
information to improve the Army’s ability to interact and conduct business with industry. Although not a requirement
for promotion, all officers in the grade of CW3 should set as a goal completion of a baccalaureate degree.
(c) Chief warrant officer four. Ordnance CW4s must complete the WOSC in order to continue their professional
development and remain competitive for promotion to CW5. CW4s are senior level tactical and technical experts who
should expect to serve as the senior WO in the Division Ammunition Office, Logistics Support Test, Measurement,
Diagnostic Evaluation (Branch, Detachment, Company, Activity), Maintenance Company at Field or Sustainment level,
Maintenance Section (CA, CS, CSS Battalion, Regiment, Brigade, UE), Maintenance Control Section or Maintenance
Section (Ordnance, Maintenance, Support, Supply Company), Brigade Support Battalion, Ordnance Battalion, Service
School, Branch Proponency and/or CASCOM. May serve in supervisory, advisory, staff and logistics positions in the
Theater Army, Army Material Command (AMC), Army Staff or separate operating agency, and MOS non–specific
positions. CW4s should continue acquiring and refining advanced technical and administrative skills, as well as MOS
unique technical skills. CW4s at this level should provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to
NCOs, warrant officers and branch officers. CW4s have special mentorship responsibilities for other warrant officers
and provide essential advice to commanders on Ordnance technical and WO issues.
(d) Chief warrant officer five. Ordnance CW5s should complete the WOSSC not later than 1 year after promotion to
CW5. CW5s are master level tactical and technical experts who serve in senior supervisory, advisory, staff and
logistics positions in brigade and higher-level units, Army Material Command (AMC), NGB, USARC, ARNG Joint
Staffs, USAR RRCs, or Army Staff or separate operating agency. CW5s may serve in positions that are MOS
non–specific. CW5s at this level should provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs, warrant
officers and branch officers. CW5s have special mentorship responsibilities for other warrant officers at all levels and
are responsible for providing essential advice to commanders on Ordnance technical and WO issues. CW5s should
sharpen their knowledge of personnel force integration functions for doctrine, training and personnel as pertains to the
Ordnance Corps. CW5s should become familiar with the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory basis for the force
projection Army and the capabilities that must be sustained through management of doctrinal, organizational, and
materiel change. CW5s must become familiar with Army organizational roles, functions and missions, especially at the
MACOM and Army staff level, and with the Force Management processes, from the determination of force requirements through to the resourcing of requirements and the assessment of their utilization in order to accomplish Army
functions and missions in a Joint/combined environment.
b. Functional area and immaterial "generalist" assignments. Officers above the grade of LT can expect to serve in
functional assignments that may or may not be directly related to the Ordnance branch, but which are important to the
Army and will contribute to the officer’s professional development. Criteria for selection include overall manner of
performance, military experience, military and civilian education, and demonstrated potential to serve in positions of
increased responsibility. These positions include but are not limited to:
(1) Multifunctional staff positions at the grade of MAJ and above.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

273

(2) Advisory groups in foreign countries.
(3) Inspector General (IG) office.
(4) USAREC staff.
(5) Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC).
(6) U.S. Army Reserve and Army National Guard liaison.
(7) USMA faculty and staff.
(8) Other executive staff positions.
c. Joint assignments. Ordnance officers can expect to be considered for Joint duty assignments after selection for
MAJ. Field grade officers are utilized in Joint organizations worldwide. Joint experience is important to the Army and
is essential to individual officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions. These jobs are highly
competitive and not all officers will have the opportunity. Joint duty assignments require and provide a wealth of
knowledge and experience for warrant officers; however, positions are few and are not necessary for WO career
development and promotion.
d. Nominative assignments. Ordnance branch officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those
indicated in earlier paragraphs. These other assignments may include; White House Fellows, duty with the National
Security Council or the United Nations, and Ordnance branch representatives at allied service schools. The spectrum of
possible assignments is large and these assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and important, and
requiring mature, skilled, and well-grounded officers. AHRC will screen all eligible officer packets and nominate those
officers most qualified.
25–4. Assignment preferences and precedence.
a. Preferences. The Ordnance branch has diverse assignment opportunities that allow for numerous career development paths. The goal of the professional development of Ordnance branch officers is to produce and sustain highly
proficient, tactically and operationally oriented officers who are experts in specific commodity areas and also have an
in-depth knowledge of and experience in the total logistics system. Assignments in the Ordnance branch will be made
to develop the officer’s ability to achieve that goal. Ordnance warrant officers will be assigned by grade. Warrant
officers assigned to senior positions should receive training commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of that
position prior to arriving at the assignment. Warrant officers in the rank of WO1 through CW3 can generally expect
repetitive assignments at the company and battalion level in operating force organizations. These assignments give the
Ordnance WO a solid base of experience with depth and breadth on systems, equipment and processes that prepare
them for assignment to field and sustainment level support organizations. Warrant officers in the rank of CW4 will
normally be assigned to battalion, brigade, UE, and Army level support and/or staff positions. Warrant officers in the
rank of CW5 can expect assignments at UE and Army level support and/or staff positions, at AMC, the Army Staff or
at separate operating agencies.
b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility
on the sequence of assignments. Typically, Ordnance branch officers should seek assignments in the following order:
Officer Basic Course, platoon leader, battalion staff, CLC3, company command, battalion primary staff, nominative or
branch developmental assignment, ILE, key developmental assignment as a MAJ, battalion command, SSC, and COL
level command. Those officers who opt to track outside the operational career field will work in assignments
commensurate with that career field. Assignment to a Joint position should be sought whenever possible following key
developmental requirements as a MAJ. Warrant officers gain experience and skills through repetitive, similar type
assignments requiring their MOS, however, WOs should seek increased levels of responsibilities commensurate with
their grade and seniority (the senior WO should seek and hold the senior WO position in the unit).
25–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments.
a. Key Ordnance developmental positions. It is preferred that Ordnance CPTs serve as company commanders for 18
months plus or minus 6 months. The OPMS goal is for majors to spend 3 years in an operational unit with 2 years
spent in key developmental jobs (battalion XO, support operations officer, ammunition officer, major (O4) level
command, materiel officer or brigade level XO/S3). All majors will be provided an Intermediate Level Staff College
Education and Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) I qualification instruction through a resident course at Fort
Leavenworth. LTCs and COLs who are selected for command and are not commanding within a BCT structure will
serve 2 years in battalion and brigade commands. Those serving in BCT units will serve 3 years in command. Officers
selected for garrison command may have command tours up to 3 years in length. Warrant officers do not normally
command TOE units, however, limited opportunities exist within TDA organizations and some TOE detachments.

25–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for Ordnance branch officers. To do this the field
grade inventory must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support
branch/FA generalist positions, and to provide majors with 2 years of key developmental assignment time.
b. OPMS implementation. The numbers of authorized Ordnance billets, by grade, will vary as force structure
decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers who desire more information on Ordnance
branch authorizations or inventory are encouraged to contact the Ordnance Personnel Proponency Office or their HRC
assignment officer.
25–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for the Ordnance Corps
a. Structure. There will be changes to overall authorizations of units based on the restructuring and recoding
initiatives associated with stabilization initiatives. One cannot look at the Ordnance Branch in isolation due to its close
relationship with FA 90, for at any given time; approximately 30 percent of the FA 90 authorizations will be filled with
Ordnance officers (see chap 29 for FA 90 descriptions).
b. Acquisition. Officers will continue to be accessed into Ordnance branch through the U.S. Military Academy,
Reserve Officer Training Corps and Officer Candidate School. Accessions are based on the needs of the Army and
officer preference. Because of the lack of branch specific civil schooling and opportunities for relevant experience,
there will be few opportunities for direct commissioning in Ordnance. As a donor branch, the Ordnance Corps strongly
supports the branch detail program, which provides officers adequate time to gain experience in their donor branch
prior to attending CLC3. Officers participating in the 2–year detail program will complete the Ordnance branch
transition course (non–resident) after their detail period is up. If assigned to a life cycle unit, the branch detail will be a
minimum of 3 years. The Ordnance proponent encourages the branch transfer of quality officers into Ordnance up to
and including the grade of MAJ. Majors desiring to branch transfer into Ordnance should do so early, thereby allowing
enough time to complete key developmental assignments prior to the LTC promotion board. Ordnance WOs are
accessed from the enlisted ranks within the Ordnance Corps or from other branches provided they possess related
technical training and experience and trained through the WOCS. Outstanding NCOs that demonstrate exceptional
leadership and technical skills are prime candidates for accession into the Ordnance WO specialties.
c. Distribution. The distribution pattern for Ordnance Branch officers will change in subtle ways. Officers will
continue to rotate between operating and generating force units in the CONUS and OCONUS but the tour lengths of
such assignments will be longer. Officers will have more time to gain the requisite skills in their branch and their
branch/FA generalist (branch immaterial) assignments. In particular, MAJs will receive more key developmental time
and increased stability. The OPMS changes some previous distribution rules, which formerly applied to Ordnance
Branch; officers of the branch who serve in the Operations career field will work either in branch or functional
positions. If an Ordnance officer is also an FA 90, he or she may alternate from Ordnance specific jobs to FA 90 jobs.
FA 90 is also in the Operations career field.
(1) Stabilized Installation Assignments. The goal is to stabilize soldiers as much as practically possible. Officers
assigned to major operating force installations may be assigned to that installation for up to seven years. During this
time, officers can complete multiple preferred branch assignments at different grades. The officers will gain tactical and
operational experience that will benefit them and the Army in their development in future positions. Many of these
officers will complete required schooling on a TDY basis return and to the same installation.
(2) Life cycle managed units. Officers and warrant officers at all levels may be assigned to life cycle managed units
(generally the Stryker, Heavy, and Infantry Brigade Combat Teams that are currently being developed) and will remain
in the unit for a minimum of 3 years. Assignments and reassignments will occur during the reset phase of the unit.
Depending on grade when assigned to a life cycle unit, an officer can expect to serve in key developmental
assignments at their current and potentially next higher grade. Officers in these units have the possibility of greater
than average time in platoon leader, command or MAJ branch preferred positions. Branch detail officers will remain in
their detail branch until after completion of the assignment to the life cycle managed unit.
(3) Cyclic Managed Units. Officers assigned to generating force installations or nominative type assignments will be
managed on a cyclic manning system. Replacements will be sent to these units and installations periodically to
maintain unit readiness and career progression of the officer. Tour lengths and developmental positions opportunities
can vary.
d. Deployment. Ordnance branch officers are war fighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to
deploy worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA
organizations, all Ordnance officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict.
Ordnance officers may deploy with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests, or as
individuals to support Joint and multinational operations. Ordnance officers must prepare themselves and their families
for this most challenging function.

278

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

e. Sustainment. OPMS changes the manner of execution of 3 major actions that affect officer career development.
(1) Promotion. The institution of career field based promotion boards is a significant but fundamental change.
Ordnance branch officers who remain in the Operations career field will compete for promotion only within the
Operations career field. Additionally, the percentage of below–the–zone promotions will decrease and officers will be
eligible for below–the–zone promotion 1 time for each grade. WO1 will be promoted to CW2 after 2 years in grade on
the recommendation of the first LTC (O–5) in the chain of command. All other warrant officers, CW2 through CW4,
will normally be considered for promotion to the next higher grade by a DA promotion board, first below–the–zone
after 3 years in grade and then in the primary zone after 4 years in grade. DA publishes zones of consideration prior to
each promotion board. The ARNG fills most Ordnance officer vacancies through unit vacancy promotions. Commanders select officers for most positions except for LT.
(2) Command. Ordnance branch commanders will continue to be centrally selected for command. (ARNG commander selections are decentralized and for the most part, Battalion Commanders are individually selected by the state
Adjutant General with input from the commanders/staffs). All Ordnance officer command opportunities are in the
Operations career field. These commands are organized into 4 functional categories: Tactical, Training and Strategic
Support, Institutional, and TRADOC System Manager. Officers have the option of selecting the category or categories
in which they desire to compete for command, while declining competition in other categories. The results of the
command selection process are announced in the Command Selection List (CSL).
(3) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS. Starting
with CPT, the rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the career field which best suits his or her
abilities and interests.
f. Development. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in TOE units with troops, staff/TDA assignments, and institutional training assignments. Self-development
continues to be an essential component of officer development. The goal of the Ordnance Corps is to develop highly
qualified officers who are experts in specific commodity areas and also have an in-depth knowledge of, and experience
in the total logistics system. Prior to assignment to CW3 positions, warrant officers will attend WOAC. Warrant
officers must complete their formal military education courses not later than one year after promotion to the next
higher grade: CW3 (WOAC, MEL 6), CW4 (WOSC, MEL 4) and CW5 (WOSSC, MEL 1).
g. Separation. The officer separation process remains unchanged.
25–8. Ordnance Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. Reserve Component Ordnance officer development objectives and qualifications
basically parallel those planned for their Active Army counterparts, with the difference being the Reserve Component
(RC) time in service/time in grade requirements. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation through assignments
in their branch before specialization begins.
b. Key developmental opportunities. Even though Reserve Component officers are limited by geographical considerations, they should strive for Ordnance assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as their Active
Army counterparts. Figure 25–3 displays the life cycle development for the reserve component.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

Figure 25–3. Ordnance officer life cycle development and utilization (RC)

280

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(1) Lieutenant. At the grade of LT, the officer should concentrate on developing leadership abilities and communicative, management, technical and tactical skills. This is the stage where officers develop their basic foundation for the
rest of their careers. If there is a limited leadership opportunity available in an officer’s initial assignment, the officer
should strive for a follow-on assignment where leadership assignment opportunities are available.
(a) During the 2LT years, RC officers are required to complete an Ordnance Officer Basic Course and complete a
bachelor’s degree. 2LTs should strive to become technical and tactical experts by training with the warrant officers and
senior enlisted Soldiers in their units. 2 LTs must learn the intricacies of how to best support their commands, manage
work order flow, common equipment failures and repair, repair parts management, and tracking work orders and parts
status through automated systems.
(b) During the 1LT years, an RC officer will concentrate on key leadership development positions. Those positions
may include, but are not limited to, platoon leader, maintenance control officer, or detachment commander. Within 2
years of consideration for promotion to CPT, RC officers should enroll and begin the RC Officer Advance Course
(OAC) and concentrate on honing troop leader procedures, and sound Ordnance operating procedures through assignments such as shop officer, battalion motor officer or S4.
(c) Because all initial assignments are important, an officer should be primarily concerned with manner of performance, development of professional attributes, enthusiasm for the job and demonstration of potential. The focus during
this phase should be on acquiring and refining troop-leading skills, Ordnance branch related skills, coordination,
logistics and administrative skills. Before promotion to CPT, officers should possess an excellent knowledge of the
Ordnance branch and a basic knowledge of logistics principles. This includes practical experience in Ordnance branch
activities and missions, and in tactics and logistics operations.
(2) Captain. It is at the grade of CPT where emphasis begins to be placed on achieving key developmental
assignments. Throughout this period the officer continues to develop leadership, tactical, technical and management
skills. For promotion to the grade of CPT, a bachelor’s degree is required.
(a) Officers will complete the RC OAC or attend the resident Ordnance Maintenance Management Officer Advanced Course immediately followed by enrollment in CAS3, (Captain’s PME), at or about the seventh year of service
to prepare for company level command and staff duties at the battalion or higher levels.
(b) Captains should aggressively prepare for and seek company or separate detachment level command, assignments
as battalion staff officers, battalion level primary staff officers, or training division/USAR/JFHQ school instructors.
(c) Captains should continue to gain an in–depth understanding of logistics operations and become proficient in both
the common core and Ordnance Branch CPT tasks. These tasks provide the foundation of knowledge required to
effectively serve in the branch as a leader at the company and battalion level in all aspects of Ordnance operation and
in leading Ordnance soldiers. All officers should seek opportunities in all of the commodities available to them in the
Ordnance Corps, for example officers who have worked ammunition should seek opportunity in the maintenance areas.
Captains gain a working knowledge of command principles, battalion level staff operations, and Ordnance operations at
the battalion to brigade levels.
(d) Ordnance officers will undergo FA designation during the 9th year of commissioned service. The formal
designation of FAs is based upon the needs of the USAR/ARNG, officer preference, military experience and, in some
cases, civilian schooling. Some FAs have extensive educational requirements. A large number of Ordnance officers will
be designated FA 90, Multifunctional Logistician Program.
(e) The Reserve Component Logistics Executive Development Course (RC- ALEDC), advance maintenance or
supply courses, support operations course, or an advanced degree in engineering, physical science, business, or logistics
management all contribute to the Ordnance officer’s professional development. However, job performance, completion
of key developmental assignment requirements and logistics experience, are required to prepare the officer for
advancement to the next grade.
(f) Branch transfer officers completing a CCC other than Ordnance should complete all phases of the Ordnance
RC–CCC the OD branch transition course, or attend the resident Combined Logistics Captains Career Course. Requests
to branch transfer to the Ordnance Corps should be directed through: (USAR officers) AHRC–ZPP, AHRC - St Louis,
1 Reserve Way, Saint Louis, Missouri 63132–5200; (NG Officers) NGB–ARL, 111 South George Mason Drive
Arlington, VA 22030 to: Commandant, USAOC&S, ATTN ATSL–RC, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland
25005–5201. Requests should include all documentation of Ordnance OAC or CCC completion.
(3) Major.
(a) At the grade of MAJ, the officer should focus on developing upper level staff skills, completing key developmental assignment if necessary and successfully completing the Intermediate Level of Education course. Majors should
seek battalion XO, MMO, SPO, MATO, and Brigade S4 positions.
(b) Majors should continue self-development efforts to become an expert in all aspects of Ordnance coordination to
include Joint and combined operations. Self- development should include correspondence courses, civilian education

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

281

and institutional training. Officers should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their war fighting
perspective.
(c) For branch transfer officers into the Ordnance Corps, majors must meet the requirements in paragraph 25–3, and
complete the support operations course. To prepare for advancement in grade as an Ordnance officer, a MAJ must have
successfully completed at least 1 Ordnance assignment of at least 12 months in duration. Documentation of assignment
will include all Officer Evaluation Reports and assignment orders and submitted for approval to: (USAR officers)
AHRC–ZPP, AHRC - St. Louis, 1 Reserve Way., Saint Louis, Missouri 63132–5200 (NG officers) NGB–ARL, 111
South George Mason Drive, Arlington, VA 22030; to: Commandant, USAOC&S, ATTN ATSL–RC, Aberdeen Proving
Ground, Maryland 21005–5201. Requests should include all documentation of Ordnance OAC completion.
(4) Lieutenant colonel. At the grade of LTC, an officer’s career reaches the full utilization stage. Emphasis is placed
on an officer successfully completing LTC level command and/or serving in key Ordnance headquarters staff positions
(a) LTC career objectives are to complete a pre–command course when selected for battalion command or equivalent staff position, attain military education level 4 (MEL 4).
(b) For branch transfer and key developmental assignment requirements, see paragraph 25–7c(3)(c).
(c) Key RC assignments include battalion commander, executive officer at support groups or ammunition groups,
maintenance division chief at USAR command headquarters, Joint Staff in a state command, director for maintenance
at area support groups, deputy assistant chief of staff materiel, materiel maintenance officer, plans officer at a materiel
management center, or maintenance evaluation team leader at a training division.
(d) Officers should complete resident RC or Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) ILE. Officers should further
develop their military education by enrolling in courses like the RC National Security Course.
(5) Colonel. At the grade of COL, officers reach the maximum utilization period of their career. Such officers
should have a broad background in Ordnance with highly developed skills in materiel management. Colonel career
objectives include the following: complete a pre-command course for group/brigade if selected for command, successfully complete COL level command of a group or activity, serve on general staff, serve as assistant chief of staff for
materiel or operations at a support command, and attend Senior Service College or enroll in the Army War College
Distance Education Course to achieve MEL 1. Completion of CGSC is a requirement for promotion to colonel.
c. Reserve Component warrant officers.
(1) General career development. Reserve Component WO development objectives and qualifications basically
parallel those of the Active Army, with the difference being the RC time in service and time in grade requirements.
(2) Developmental Assignments. Reserve Component WOs, like their Active Army counterparts, are assigned to
positions requiring their unique MOS and grade. Refer to paragraph 25–3 and figure 25–4 for information on
appropriate assignments for each WO grade.

Chapter 26
Quartermaster Corps Branch
26–1. Unique features of Quartermaster Corps Branch
a. Unique purpose of Quartermaster Corps Branch. Quartermaster Corps officers are warrior logisticians on today’s
battlefield who provide focused logistics support to sustain America’s Forces in victory today and into the future. The
Quartermaster Corps is a combat service support branch that has sustained Soldiers since 1775. Combat readiness
cannot be achieved without logistical readiness; the timely availability and proper functioning of materiel, resources
and systems to maintain and sustain operations on a fluid and resource driven battlefield. The officers, WOs and
enlisted soldiers of the Quartermaster Corps ensure the highest level of logistics readiness and military operations
sustainability by employing sound tactical and technical leadership and advise with innovative technical expertise in
achieving the Quartermaster mission: to provide supply support, field services, aerial delivery support, materiel and
distribution management, combat developments; and doctrine, training and professional developments of active Army,
Reserve Component, civilian personnel, other Services and Allies in Quartermaster proponent and common skill areas.
Combined, these warrior logisticians are the key to the logistical success in sustaining Soldiers, directing logistics
planning and operations across the entire operational continuum.
b. Unique functions performed by Quartermaster Corps Branch. The primary functions of Quartermaster officers
allow them to provide supply, field services, mortuary affairs, petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) supply, water
supply, general supply support, supply distribution management, subsistence and continuity at the right time, place and
quantity to support Soldiers, their units and systems in peace, operations other than war, and war. The Quartermaster
warrant officers serve as Combat Service Support (CSS) technicians who manage and maintain the Army’s property
accounting systems, supply accounting systems, airdrop support systems, food service programs and petroleum and
water systems. They are self-aware and adaptive Quartermaster technical experts, leaders, trainers, and advisors.
Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, Quartermaster Warrant Officers
administer, manage, maintain, operate, and integrate Quartermaster systems and equipment across the Army at all
levels. Quartermaster Warrant Officers are innovative integrators of emerging logistical technologies, dynamic teachers,
confident war-fighters, and developers of specialized teams of soldiers.
c. Unique features of work in Quartermaster Corps Branch. Quartermaster officers work at all levels of command
and staff, and perform the following functions and tasks:
(1) Command control, manage, estimate and supervise, activities of Army and Joint logistics units and organizations
engaged in the acquisition, receipt, storage, preservation, distribution and issue of equipment, repair parts, maps,
fortification and construction materiel, subsistence, petroleum products, water, and other general supplies (excluding
procurement of ammunition, medical and the management of cryptographic material).
(2) Command control, manage, supervise, airdrop and airdrop equipment maintenance activities that store, repair,
maintain, distribute, and dispose of air items, pack parachutes, and prepare supplies for sling load or aerial delivery.
Instruct and train personnel in airdrop procedures and equipment support techniques.
(3) Command control, manage, and supervise, the collection of salvage and/or abandoned property, unserviceable
supplies and equipment and dispose of such items through proper channels.
(4) Command control, manage and supervise, field service support in the areas of laundry and shower, bakery,
mortuary affairs.
(5) Command control, manage and supervise, subsistence operations including determination of requirements,
procurement, distribution, storage, issue, nutrition, food preparation, service, accountability, sanitation and
accountability.
(6) Command, control, manage and supervise, petroleum operations including procurement and determination of
bulk and packaged petroleum requirements, as well as the storage, distribution and quality assurance of all petroleum
products to include the inland distribution of petroleum products for all services in a theater of operations.
(7) Command control, manage and supervise, water operations including purification, storage and distribution of
bulk and packaged water, plan consumption requirements and establish water supply points.
(8) Command control, manage and supervise, supply, service support and other logistical matters.
(9) Command control, manage, and supervise, procedures to maintain necessary supply discipline to ensure maximum use of available assets.
(10) Command control, manage, and supervise, logistical support within the command. As S4, G4, J4 and C4s
provide logistics estimates for all operations.
(11) Command control, manage, and supervise, by coordinating with S3, G3, J3 or C3 for logistical training.
(12) Command control, manage, and supervise, the coordinating and executing host nation support for supplies,
services and facilities.

284

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(13) Command control, manage, and supervise, the development of doctrine, organizations, Training, Materiel,
Leaders, Personnel and Facilities for the Quartermaster mission area.
(14) Command control, manage, supervise and instruct Quartermaster skills at service schools, service colleges, precommissioning programs and Combat Training Centers.
(15) Command control, manage, and supervise, as Quartermaster advisors to U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) and Army
National Guard (ARNG) organizations. USAR/ ARNG officers also serve as liaisons to MACOMS in Active Army
organizations.
26–2. Officer characteristics required
The Quartermaster Corps officers must be warrior logisticians skilled in war-fighting tactics, techniques and procedures; possess strong Army Values, leader attributes and skills; and fully understand the key leadership actions that
must be taken to assure success. Additionally, there are branch unique skills, knowledge and attributes that require
professional development (see DA Pam 611–21).
a. Competencies and actions common to all. The Quartermaster Corps offers a broad spectrum of opportunities.
Every officer learns and trains to be a well–rounded logistician, gaining expertise and experience in diverse specialties
and skills. The Quartermaster Corps equally values assignments in the operating force as well as the generating force.
Successful assignment in either and/or both of the areas within your career will enable promotion through the grade of
LTC. With the successful completion of preferred branch assignments, at various grades, additional promotion
opportunities are available past the grade of LTC. Every officer must serve successfully in each of the critical
leadership positions and hone their skills in the key staff positions to be considered for promotion.
b. Unique officer skills. The Quartermaster Corps consists of 3 areas of concentration (AOC) and one skill identifier
(SI). Officers perform staff officer functions on Battle Staffs from Battalion to Regional combatant command levels.
All areas of concentration and the skill identifier are open to male and female officers.
(1) Quartermaster, Supply and Materiel Management (AOC 92A). The officer commands, directs, plans and/or
manages units engaged in the production, acquisition, receipt, storage, issue and distribution of equipment, repair parts,
fortifications and construction material, and general supplies. The officer serves as the focal point for property
management and accountability procedures.
(2) Aerial Delivery and Materiel (AOC 92D). The officer commands, directs, plans and or manages units engaged in
storage, packing and preparation of materiel to be delivered by air. The officer determines requirements for and plans
the employment of aerial delivery systems in support of tactical and special operations.
(3) Petroleum and Water (AOC 92F). The officer manages commands, directs, plans and or manages units or
activities engaged in petroleum and water operations. The officer directs acquisition, storage, inspection, testing, issue
and distribution of petroleum products and purification, storage, testing and distribution of water.
(4) Mortuary Affairs (SI 4V). The officer commands, directs, plans and or manages mortuary affairs support
including search, recovery, tentative identification and evacuation of deceased personnel, and collection and disposition
of personal effects of decedents.
c. Unique warrant officer skills. Quartermaster Branch requires warrant officers who are skilled technicians in their
specialty. Every WO learns and trains to be a well–rounded logistician while gaining expertise in their specialty
through progressive levels of assignments. The Quartermaster Corps consists of 5 military occupational specialties for
warrant officers. All MOSs are open to male and female warrant officers. A detailed description of each MOS is
contained in DA Pam 611–21.
(1) Logistics Management officer (MOS 920A). Supervises and manages the Army’s organizational property accounting systems at all levels. The officer monitors and evaluates subordinate supply operations while performing
financial inventory accounting and advice to commanders on proper property accounting procedures.
(2) Materiel Management officer (MOS 920B). Manages the requisition, receipt, storage, and distribution of supplies
and equipment at direct, general, or installation supply support activities (SSA). The officer plans stockage levels and
controls the management of operational float stocks.
(3) Airdrop Systems Technician (MOS 921A). Manages the Army’s airdrop and airdrop equipment maintenance
activities. The officer supervises the inspection and packing of parachutes and ensures that unserviceable, nonrepairable, and overage parachutes are retired from the inventory.
(4) Food Service Technician (MOS 922A). Manages the Army food service program. The officer advises the
commander on all matters relating to nutrition, food preparation, service, accountability and sanitation.
(5) Petroleum Systems Technician (MOS 923A). Supervises the acquisition, storage, inspection, testing, issue and
distribution of petroleum products and/or water and petroleum and water storage and distribution equipment.
d. Decisionmaking skills. Quartermaster officers often work in an environment where time available for problem
analysis is seriously constrained but where sound timely decisions are urgent. Information gained in this environment
will vary in its completeness and ambiguity. An ability to operate under stress, make decisions and act in austere field
conditions is critical to mission success.
e. Tactical and technical skills. Quartermaster officers must be warfighters who are technically proficient with
branch and mission unique equipment, tools and systems. Quartermaster mission success requires the proper balance

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

285

between technical skills and the ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactical skills at the right moment.
These skills must be gained and developed through repetitive operational assignments and continuous professional
study and self-development. Quartermasters must survive on a non-linear, non-contiguous battlefield. Quartermasters
must also negotiate asymmetric threats to accomplish their Quartermaster missions.
f. Unique knowledge.
(1) Officers must possess expert knowledge of logistics distribution management, combined arms and general
support and coordination principles. This knowledge includes practical experience in tactics, combined arms operations
and deployment operations.
(2) Officers gain this knowledge through a logical sequence of continuous education, training and experience
sustained by mentoring.
(3) Individual officers sustain knowledge through institutional training and education, duty in operational assignments and continuous self-development while warrant officers sustain and improve their knowledge through progressive levels of assignments within their specialty.
g. Unique attributes.
(1) Personal attributes. Quartermaster officers have a high acceptance of convention. They live the Army Values and
enforce high standards of training, physical fitness and discipline and are warfighters extremely well versed in doctrine.
However, they are also adaptable to changing environments and can update logistics estimates and apply non-text book
solutions to unique situations. Repetitive training is important to maintain unit readiness. However, the dynamics
associated with training and operational missions require a sense of ingenuity and foresight. Officers must recognize
the importance of physical fitness since high levels of stamina and vigor are critical to sustained endurance. These
standards require both officers and warrant officers to know and routinely execute drills and operate within established
SOPs.
(2) Multifunctional attributes. At the company grade level a Quartermaster officer’s work is branch oriented but
becomes increasingly multifunctional within the career field. As officers progress, work eventually blends across
systems and skills that cross several career fields. Officers must develop and use a diverse set of skills as they move
between branch assignments in force structure and force generation positions, and as they serve in branch/FA generalist
(formerly branch immaterial) assignments. At the junior grade level a WO’s work is branch orientated but becomes
increasingly multi–dimensional, first within their career field, and eventually, as the WO becomes more proficient
across systems/skills that cross several career fields. Warrant officers must develop and use a diverse set of skills as
they move between branch leadership positions to prepare them to serve in branch/FA generalist assignments.
26–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
Officers must meet certain standards in terms of schooling and operational assignments to be a proficient Quartermaster
officer at each grade. Meeting these standards ensures that the officer has acquired the skills, knowledge, and attributes
to remain proficient in the Quartermaster Branch at that grade and is competitive for promotion or retention in the
branch. The Quartermaster officer standards at the grades of CPT, MAJ, LTC, and COL are detailed below. It is
essential that the Quartermaster Corps have officers who are outstanding troop leaders as well as those who can
provide requisite technical expertise in other areas, such as in specialized areas of concentration and logistics skills. For
an officer to be considered fully trained in the Quartermaster Corps, the officer should be tactically and technically
proficient, be physically fit, and be of the highest moral and ethical character. Recognizing that various assignments
require different strengths, techniques, and backgrounds, an officer’s most important assignment is the current one and
the officer should focus on an outstanding performance in that job assignment. Underpinning officer development are
the 3 domains of leader development: education, operational assignments, and self-development. These domains are
described in the phases below. Self–development is the responsibility of every officer and ranges from professional
reading during off-duty time to aggressively seeking out positions of increased responsibility. Each officer, with
support from mentors, should develop career goals and clearly articulate those goals to the commander and assignments
officer at AHRC. Always remember that an officer is his or her own best career manager. By actively participating in
the management of career decisions, officers will improve the likelihood of a successful career. Professional development is divided into 5 phases: LT, CPT, MAJ, LTC, and COL with particular job assignments and schooling
appropriate to each phase (see fig 26–1).

a. Lieutenant.
(1) Education. All officers accessed into the Quartermaster Corps are designated AOC 92A, Quartermaster, Supply
and Materiel Management. The Quartermaster Corps requires young officers trained to perform duties in a wide range
of functional logistics areas. To prepare newly commissioned Quartermaster officers to meet the challenge of their
duties, they first attend the Quartermaster Officer Basic Course at the U.S. Army Quartermaster Center and School,
Fort Lee, VA. During this course, the officer receives training in general military subjects, such as leadership, military
justice, weapons and tactics, and is given an introduction to the general functions of logistics. Officers also receive
instruction in all of the Quartermaster areas of concentration, providing sufficient background to develop the graduates
as Quartermaster generalists, capable of filling any Quartermaster LT position (except aerial delivery positions). Some
officers will receive additional training in Aerial Delivery and Materiel (AOC 92D) and are, by regulation, the only
officers who may fill parachute rigger positions. These officers, however, will also retain their 92A identification and
be eligible for assignment in that area of concentration. The focus during this phase should be on acquiring and
refining troop leading, Quartermaster Corps related, coordination, logistics and administrative skills. In the future
Quartermaster LTs will attend 2 phases of a 3 phase Basic Officer Leaders Course. Phase I is conducted prior to
commissioning, with phases 2 and 3 conducted upon initial entry to active duty. Phase II is a branch immaterial
experiential leader-training phase that produces LTs, who have a common combined arms bond, developed through a
shared leadership experience, armed with basic common combat skills. Phase III is branch specific technical and
tactical training conducted at the Quartermaster Center and School located at Fort Lee, VA. During this phase the
officer is groomed in technical supply functions of Quartermaster Platoon Leaders. Quartermaster LTs are prepared for
service as platoon leaders and battalion level staff officers.
(2) Assignments. As an LT, the officer is normally assigned at the company level in order to gain troop experience
and build a solid leadership foundation. Assignments to a Brigade Combat Team will be for the 36-month life cycle of
the unit. Officer’s assigned to other force structure units and force generation units will have the ability to move to
other units. The officer should seek company level positions, such as platoon leader, accountable officer and executive
officer, and complement this with staff experience at the battalion level. To fulfill Army needs, a small number of LTs
are assigned to force generation positions, perhaps at training facilities. In all assignments, LTs should concentrate on
learning the basics of how the Army works, how to lead soldiers, and how to maintain a motivated and positive
outlook. Regardless of assignment, outstanding duty performance allows an LT to advance. Assignments will be based
on needs of the Army, professional development requirements, and officer’s preferences.
(3) Branch detail. Upon commissioning, some LTs accessed into the Quartermaster Corps are branch detailed for 2
or more years to another branch depending on type of initial assignment. Brigade Combat team assignments are for 3
years in length while other force structure or force generation assignments may be less. These branch detail officers
attend the officer basic course/Basic Officer Leaders Course. After service with a detail branch, the detail officers
attend the Supply and Services Management Officer course (SSMO) at the Quartermaster Center and School. This is a
5-week 3-day TDY and return course, which concentrates on specific Quartermaster skills. Following the course, these
officers return to their duty station with an assignment in a Quartermaster AOC 92 position. For example, a
Quartermaster officer branch detailed to the Infantry branch might spend 2 years in an infantry battalion in a division,
attend the transition course, and return to the same division and work in the forward support battalion (FSB) of the
division support command (DISCOM). HRC, the Quartermaster Corps proponency office, and the local unit adjutant
coordinate to ensure that detailed officers experience a smooth transition.
(4) Self–development. Opportunities include furthering civilian and military education by obtaining a master’s degree
in a logistics related field (such as logistics management, business management, and petroleum engineering) and
completing logistics related courses offered by the U.S. Army Logistics Management College (ALMC) or the Quartermaster Center and School, both located at Fort Lee, VA.
(5) Degree completion. Officers who have not completed a baccalaureate degree will not be promoted to the grade
of CPT without a wavier approved by the commander of HRC. The officer should coordinate with their branch
assignment officer at HRC to obtain an opportunity for degree completion.
b. Captain.
(1) Education. Upon promotion to or selection for CPT, all officers attend the Combined Logistics Captains Career
Course (CLC3). Currently CLC3 officers will receive both advanced tactical and technical training as well as
instruction in advanced materiel management and multifunctional logistics. Following CLC3, some officers will attend
specialized courses relating to various Quartermaster areas of concentrations and skill identifier such as the Aerial
Delivery and Materiel Officer Course (92D) or Advanced Petroleum/Water Management (92F) and Mortuary Affairs
(4V).
(2) Assignments.
(a) Aggressively seek company command as a preferred assignment. This enhances professional development and
complement’s staff experience at the unit level. Some specific company grade professional developmental assignments
for officers in the Quartermaster Corps include company command, staff officer, support operations and FA 90

288

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

positions. Overall successful duty performance in assignments is key to success. Through these assignments an officer
should become technically proficient and master essential troop leading skills. Assignments will be based on needs of
the Army, professional development requirements, and officer’s preferences.
(b) Captains branch transferred to the Quartermaster Corps from another branch after completion of a branch
required Captains Career Course must take the Quartermaster technical phase of the CLC3 (MEL 6). This can be
accomplished by attending the Supply and Services Management Officer (SSMO) course at Fort Lee. All officers
seeking branch transfers should contact the Quartermaster Branch at AHRC to discuss the officer’s timeline and
requirements necessary to be competitive in the officer’s future branch of choice. (See Quartermaster Officer timeline/
requirements on Figure 26–1)
(c) A CPT should serve in one Quartermaster troop assignment at a Force Structure/Force Generation battalion or
unit level.
(3) Self–development. A Quartermaster officer, who has a sound educational background, has completed the required
career course, and successfully commanded a company sized unit, may apply for a fully funded advanced degree in a
discipline directly related to his or her area of concentration, FA or skill. This program is highly competitive and
selection is based on demonstrated performance and potential for promotion. Selected officers attend graduate school to
meet specific Army requirements established by the Army Education Requirements Board. The Army approves the
university or college the officer selects. Many Quartermaster officers are also selected to attend the Logistics Executive
Development Course at the U.S. Army Logistics Management College, where advanced degrees in procurement and
logistics management can be obtained through the United States. ALMC Cooperative Degree Program with the Florida
Institute of Technology (F.I.T.). Quartermaster areas of concentration have a high requirement for advanced degrees.
More information on Advanced Civil Schooling is located in chapter 4 of this pamphlet. Quartermaster officers also
have an opportunity to participate in the Training With Industry (TWI) program. This program provides an officer an
opportunity to spend up to 12 months with a civilian industry that provides training in industrial procedures and
practices. The training is designed to enhance knowledge, experience and perspectives in management and operational
techniques. This program is very competitive and requires an officer to apply through the Quartermaster branch future
readiness officer at AHRC. Officers are also highly encouraged to seek Advanced Civil Education (ACE) on their own
through off duty programs at military installation education centers. Captains can also expect assignments consistent
with the needs of the Army which include assignments in branch/FA generalist (formerly branch immaterial) positions
(for example, USAREC, USMA faculty and staff or Active Army/RC duty) and other nominative assignments (for
example, POW/MIA Accounting Command Team Leader).
(4) Functional area process. There is no FA designation point but officer’s can submit via AHRC Web site
preference for a FA and be recruited by that FA for possible change of career field.
(5) Desired branch experience. Company command, as a CPT, is the preferred branch experience. This allows the
officer to be most competitive for future commands in their career. A command assignment of 12 months or more is
preferred.
c. Major.
(1) Education. Quartermaster majors must successfully attain MEL 4. Military education required during this phase
is completion of ILE. Officers attending ILE at Fort Leavenworth will be certified Joint Professional Military
Education (JPME) I and ILE upon completion of the common core and Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course
(AOWC). ILE will be an assignment process, not board selection, and will normally occur between the 8th and 12th
year of commissioned service.
(2) Assignments. Includes assignments to force structure and force generation units. The key to promotion is
successful completion of every assignment. The more time officers successfully spend in branch preferred experience
positions the more competitive the officer is for future command. See section 2 below for additional information
regarding FA90 Multifunctional Logistician qualification. Time is a critical factor in determining and selecting
assignment opportunities. MAJs have approximately 5 1/2 years from their pin on point until their primary zone LTC
promotion board meets. Of those 5 1/2 years, three years are required to attain ILE/MEL 4 and to complete branch
preferred experience positions if desired. Quartermaster majors must make informed assignment decisions to complete
both ILE/MEL 4 and branch preferred experience positions. ILE/MEL 4 education programs provide Quartermaster
majors skills that enhance their ability to be successful as field grade officers and in branch preferred experience
positions. ILE/MEL 4 completion is also a consideration used by commands when slating majors for branch preferred
experience positions.
(3) Branch preferred experience. An officer’s performance during these assignments demonstrates a mastery of
skills, knowledge and attributes expected of an officer for his or her grade. The purpose of is to determine an officer’s
potential to command at the LTC level. Completing these assignments does not mean automatic selection for LTC
command, but rather that an individual officer is eligible to be considered. MAJs should strive for successful
assignment in one (12 months minimum) of the following types of positions; however, it is a goal of OPMS to
successfully serve a total of 24 months in these positions that are listed below.
(a) QM Battalion Executive Officer:
(b) Functional (QM) Battalion S3

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

289

(c) QM Group/Brigade Executive Officer
(d) Group/Functional (QM) Brigade S3
(e) Brigade S4 O–4 coded
(f) Division and Corps Parachute Officer (92D)
(g) POL Operations Officer (92F)
(h) Joint Area Petroleum Officer (92F) (Completion of a previous preferred assignment is required prior to
assignment to this position)
(4) Multifunctional Logisticians (FA 90). An FA 90 Multifunctional Logistician trained MAJ is also considered
Quartermaster trained. There is a significant difference between becoming Quartermaster and FA90 Multifunctional
Logistician trained. See the Multifunctional Logistician Program (FA 90), chapter 29, for detailed multifunctional
development standards and opportunities.
(5) Professional development. Compared to the grade of Captain, the time spent as a Major is relatively short. This
time can be the most diversifying of an officer’s career. Quartermaster officers have an opportunity to broaden their
professional development in a designated area of concentration as well as multifunctional logistics training. Logistics
positions familiarize officers with the basis of those functions and skills inherent to the combat service support
community. Once Quartermaster officers master the tactical level, they should strive to diversify their experience at
operational and strategic level logistics assignments.
(6) Career field designation. Officers will undergo a career field designation board upon selection for MAJ. This
board of senior officers will decide in which career field each officer is best suited to serve. Quartermaster MAJs will
have an opportunity to seek an FA related assignment in one of the 4 career fields: Operational, Operational Support,
Information Operations and Institutional Support. After promotion to MAJ, officers will compete for promotion only
within their designated career field. Assignments after promotion to MAJ will be managed at AHRC by the Quartermaster Corps Branch for the Operations career field and by the Functional Area Management and Development
Division for officers designated into the other 3 career fields. Quartermaster officers who remain in the Operations
career field will receive a combination of branch assignments; FA (FA 90A) and/or branch immaterial assignments.
Quartermaster officers in the other 3 career fields will serve in FA and branch/FA immaterial assignments. Completion
of ILE/MEL 4 education for MAJs is essential to their professional development.
(7) LTC command opportunity. Officers desiring to command LTC troop units must have preferred branch experiences to include command at the CPT level. In addition, continued successful performance in the developmental
assignments enhances the officers’ selection potential for LTC commands. Note: To be competitive for a multifunctional battalion command you must obtain preferred branch experience as a MAJ.
(8) Additional assignments. Once an officer has demonstrated mastery of common core and branch skills, as well as
knowledge and attributes that assure the strong professional development foundation essential for success in the senior
field grades, they will have opportunity to serve at the Combined, Joint, DA, or MACOM staff level. Examples are
below—
(a) Combined staff logistics officer
(b) Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) logistics officer, HQDA
(c) Foreign Exchange Officer
(d) Army Material Command (AMC)
(e) MACOM staff logistics officer
(f) TRADOC School Assignment
(g) Professor of Military Science
(9) Self–development. Self–development should include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional
training. Officers should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their warfighting perspective.
(a) Civilian education. Other objectives should be obtaining a master’s degree in a logistics related field (such as
logistics management, business management and petroleum engineering). Those officers not possessing a graduate
degree are strongly encouraged to do so.
(b) Military education. For MAJs military education opportunities expand to include not only traditional military
schools but also fellowships and internships. These include White House Fellowships; Congressional Fellowships; and
Center for Military History Internships. Joint assignments will offer the opportunity for military schooling. Those
officers selected for the School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) at Fort Leavenworth, KS, must serve an initial
utilization tour as a plans officer on Corps or division staffs.
d. Lieutenant colonel.
(1) Professional development. Upon selection for LTC, AHRC assignment managers review each LTC selectee’s file
for career experience. This review then acts as a guide for recommending the officer’s utilization plans for the
remainder of the officer’s career. This phase provides the Army with officers in senior grades who have developed the
expertise needed in specific career fields or multifunctional logistics. Chapter 29 on the logistician program describes
multifunctional development standards and opportunities. A majority of LTCs serve in key staff positions throughout
the Army as well as in Joint duty assignments. A successful assignment as an LTC commander, DMMC/CMMC

290

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

commander/chief, brigade/ DISCOM/group executive officer, or division/COSCOM G4 also enhances the officer’s
selection potential for future command. At the LTC level or higher, officers can expect to be assigned to senior staff
positions at the Army, Joint and DOD level where they will serve in a wide variety of branch, logistical positions or
branch/FA generalist positions, unless selected for higher level command or schooling. While LTC and COL functional
and logistical command and schooling are key career goals, selection is extremely competitive.
(2) Assignments. The majority of Quartermaster LTCs or COLs should concentrate on seeking out and performing
well in critical staff positions at division, corps, Army, Joint, and DOD levels. An LTC should serve in at least 2 of the
following types of positions:
(a) Battalion command of a force structure/force generation battalion or its equivalent.
(b) Joint assignment.
(c) Strategic level of logistics (for example, AMC/DLA).
(d) Staff assignment at the division, installation DOL, Corps, MACOM, HQDA or Joint staff levels (as G4/J4).
(e) Service school assignment (for example, Quartermaster Center and School, CGSC/ILE and Senior Service
College).
(f) FA 90 (Multifunctional Logistician Program) coded positions.
(g) Professor of Military Science
(3) Self–development. LTCs benefit by having an advanced degree and also gain an advantage by being selected for
and attending a Senior Service College or completing the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course (MEL
1).
(4) Desired branch experience. LTCs enhance their consideration for future command by having a successful
assignment in a battalion level command.
e. Colonel.
(1) Education. Attendance at a Senior Service College or completion of U.S. Army War College Distance Education
Course (MEL 1) is advantageous and selective. Except through an established resident program such as the Army War
College (AWC), the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF), and similar senior service courses, completion of
the non-resident course is the only other means by which an Army officer can receive credit for Senior Service College
training (MEL 1). However, once selected and enrolled in the non-resident course, an officer is no longer eligible to
attend a resident Senior Service College. Therefore, it is recommended that the officer discuss this with his or her
assignment manager prior to applying for the correspondence course. The Senior Service College selection board is
responsible for selection of all active duty officers for participation in the U.S. Army War College Distance Education
Course. (See AR 350–1) Army Training and Education.
(2) Assignments. COLs should serve in one or more of the following types of positions:
(a) Command at a DISCOM/brigade/group or depot level.
(b) DLA, HQDA, AMC or MACOM staff officer.
(c) Service school assignment
(d) FA 90 (Multifunctional Logistician Program) coded positions.
(e) Joint assignments.
(3) Desired branch experience. For COLs, should include successful command at the COL level, MEL–1 qualification, and a full Joint duty tour.
(4) Branch/functional area generalist. Quartermaster officers may also serve in branch/FA generalist positions that
contribute to their professional development, but may not be specifically related to their AOC. Criteria for selection
include overall manner of performance, military experience, military and civilian education, and demonstrated potential
to serve in positions of increased responsibility. These positions include but are not limited to:
(a) Multifunctional staff positions at the grade of MAJ and above
(b) Advisory groups in foreign countries
(c) Inspector General office
(d) USAREC staff
(e) ROTC
(f) USAR and ARNG liaison
(g) USMA faculty and staff
(h) Other executive staff positions
(5) Joint and multinational forces assignments. Field grade Quartermaster officers are encouraged to seek Joint duty
assignments and multinational forces assignments. These assignments are viewed as key for career enhancement. Joint
duty assignments and the Joint Specialty Officer program and designator (3L) are described in chapter 3.
(6) Other assignments. Quartermaster Corps officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those
indicated above. These other assignments may include White House Fellows, duty with the National Security Council,
the United Nations and other international staffs, as well as Quartermaster Corps representatives at allied service
schools. The spectrum of possible assignments is large and these assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and important, and requiring mature, skilled and well–grounded officers.

f. Responsibility to warrant officers. Quartermaster WOs look to their rater, senior rater, and mentors for advice and
career counseling. Some counseling is official, such as the preparation and submission of the OER and the Officer
Evaluation Support Form. Other counseling is less formal and relates to career patterns, advice about assignments, and
duty positions. The commander plays a significant role by understanding the Warrant Officer Education System by
ensuring that WOs attend professional development courses at the proper times, and includes them in unit Officer
Professional Development (OPD) sessions. Commanders must be factually informed before rendering advice. The
following section contains much of the information commanders may need to provide when counseling.
26–4. Critical warrant officer developmental assignments
Warrant officers must meet certain standards in terms of schooling and operational assignments to evolve as a
well–rounded senior WOs within their specialty. Meeting these standards ensures the WO has acquired the skills,
knowledge and attributes to remain proficient in their specialty and serve at all levels within the Army. For a WO to be
considered fully trained in the Quartermaster Corps, the WO should be tactically and technically proficient, be
physically fit, and be of the highest moral and ethical character. Recognizing that various assignments require different
strengths, techniques and backgrounds, an officer’s most important assignment is the current one and the officer should
focus on an outstanding performance in that job assignment. Underpinning WO development are the 3 domains of
leader development: education, operational assignments and self-development. These domains are described in the
phases below. Self–development is the responsibility of every WO and ranges from professional reading during
off–duty time to aggressively seeking out positions of increased responsibility. Each WO, with support from mentors,
should develop career goals and clearly articulate those goals to the commander and assignments officer at HRC.
Always remember that a WO is his or her own best career manager. By actively participating in the management of
career decisions, WOs will improve the likelihood of a successful career. Professional development is divided into 4
phases: W01/CW2, CW3, CW4, and CW5, with particular job assignments and schooling appropriate to each phase
(see fig 26–2). The Warrant Officer Education System requires specific schooling designed to prepare warrant officers
for competitive positions of greater responsibility to serve at all levels in the Army. Quartermaster Branch requires
warrant officers who are skilled technicians in their specialty. Every WO learns and trains to be a well-rounded
logistician while gaining expertise in their specialty through progressive levels of assignments. The Quartermaster
Corps consists of 5 military occupational specialties for WOs. All military occupational specialties are open to male
and female WOs. A detailed description of each MOS is contained in DA Pam 611–21.

a. MOS qualification
(1) Basic level MOS qualification.
(a) Military education. Quartermaster WO1s must successfully attain an MEL 7 in order to continue their professional development and remain competitive for promotion to CW2. The WO1s must successfully complete the
Quartermaster Warrant Officer Basic Course. The WOBC provides functional training in Quartermaster MOSs 920A,
920B, 921A, 922A, and 923A. The WOBC also reinforces leadership training while further developing officership
skills. Upon successful completion of WOBC, the WO is certified in their MOS and given an initial operational
assignment commensurate with their grade. The WO1s should begin work on the prerequisite studies for the WOAC.
This is a MOS immaterial course administered by the Distributive Education Section of the WOCC. Successful
completion of this course is a requirement prior to attendance to the resident Quartermaster Warrant Officer Advance
Course.
(b) Professional development. WO1s can expect assignments at the company and battalion level. These assignments
give the junior Quartermaster WO a solid base of experience, depth and breadth on systems and processes that
ultimately prepares them for assignments at the brigade and higher levels.
(c) Self–development. Self–development should include correspondence courses, institutional training and civilian
education. WO1s should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden both their warfighting perspective
and technical comprehension. Civilian education objectives should include working towards obtaining an associate’s
degree. WO1s who do not possess an associate’s degree are strongly encouraged to pursue this educational goal.
(2) Advanced level MOS qualification.
(a) Military education. Quartermaster CW2s must successfully attain an MEL 6 in order to continue their professional development and remain competitive for promotion to CW3. Upon promotion to CW2, the WO will be eligible
to attend the resident Quartermaster Warrant Officer Advanced Course. Completion of the Advanced Course (MEL 6)
is a professional development requirement prior to consideration for CW3. The WO must complete the prerequisite
studies for the WOAC. This is an MOS immaterial course administered by the Distributive Education Section of the
WOCC. Completion of this course is a requirement prior to attendance to the resident Quartermaster Warrant Officer
Advanced Course.
(b) Professional development. CW2s can generally expect assignments at the company and battalion level. These
assignments give the junior Quartermaster WO a solid base of experience, depth and breadth on systems and processes
that ultimately prepares them for assignments at the brigade and higher levels.
(c) Self Development. Self Development opportunities include completing logistics related courses offered by the
U.S. Army Logistics Management College (ALMC) or functional courses offered by the U. S. Army Quartermaster
Center and School. CW2s should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden both their war-fighting
perspective and technical comprehension. Civilian education objectives should include work towards obtaining a
Baccalaureate Degree in a logistics related field (such as Logistics or Business Management). CW2s who do not
possess a Baccalaureate Degree are strongly encouraged to pursue this educational goal.
(3) Senior level MOS qualification.
(a) Military education. Quartermaster CW3s must successfully attain a MEL 4 in order to continue their professional
development and remain competitive for promotion to CW4. Upon selection to or promotion to CW3, the WO will be
eligible to attend the WOSC. The WOSC is a MOS immaterial course conducted by the WOCC. Completion of the
WOSC (MEL 4) is a professional development requirement prior to consideration for CW4.
(b) Professional development. The CW3s should begin to pursue non-operational assignments at Army Field
Operating Agencies, instructor positions and specified assignments OCONUS.
(c) Self–development. Self–development opportunities include completing logistics related courses offered by the
U.S. Army Logistics Management College (ALMC) or functional courses offered by the U. S. Army Quartermaster
Center and School. CW3s should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden both their war-fighting
perspective and technical comprehension. Civilian education objectives should include working towards completing a
Baccalaureate Degree in a logistics related field (such as Logistics or Business Management). CW3s who have not
completed a Baccalaureate Degree are strongly encouraged to complete this educational goal. CW3s who have a sound
educational background and a proven record of outstanding duty performance in their MOS may apply for a fully
funded advance degree in a discipline directly related to their specialty. This program is highly competitive and
selection is based upon demonstrated performance and potential for promotion. Many Quartermaster Warrant Officers
are also selected to attend the Logistics Executive Development Course (LEDC) at ALMC, where advanced degrees in
procurement and logistics management can be obtained through ALMC’s Cooperative Degree Program with the Florida
Institute of Technology (F.I.T). Quartermaster Warrant Officers also have the opportunity to participate in the Training
With Industry (TWI) Program. The TWI program provides a WO an opportunity to spend up to 12 months with a
civilian industry that provides training in industrial procedures and practices. The training is designed to enhance

294

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

knowledge, experience and perspectives in management and operational techniques. The TWI program is very competitive and requires the WO to coordinate with the Quartermaster Warrant Officer Career Manager at HRC.
(4) Master level MOS qualification.
(a) Military education. Quartermaster CW4s must successfully attain a MEL 1 in order to continue their professional
development and remain competitive for promotion to CW5. Upon selection to or promotion to CW4, the warrant
officer will be eligible to attend the WOSSC. The WOSSC is a MOS immaterial course conducted by the WOCC.
Completion of the WOSSC (MEL 1) is a professional development requirement prior to consideration for CW5.
(b) Professional development. The CW4s will serve as the senior Quartermaster WO in staff and logistics positions
at the MACOM and separate operating agency levels.
(c) Self–development. Self–development opportunities include completing logistics related courses offered by the
U.S. Army Logistics Management College (ALMC) or functional courses offered by the U.S. Army Quartermaster
Center and School. CW4s should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden both their war-fighting
perspective and technical comprehension. Civilian education objectives should include working towards completing a
master’s degree in a logistics related field (such as Logistics or Business Management). CW4s who have not completed
a master’s degree are strongly encouraged to complete this educational goal. CW4s who have a sound educational
background and a proven record of outstanding duty performance in their MOS may apply for a fully funded advance
degree in a discipline directly related to their specialty. This program is highly competitive and selection is based on
demonstrated performance and potential for promotion. Many Quartermaster Warrant Officers are also selected to
attend the Logistics Executive Development Course (LEDC) at ALMC, where advanced degrees in procurement and
logistics management can be obtained through ALMC’s Cooperative Degree Program with the Florida Institute of
Technology (F.I.T). Quartermaster Warrant Officers also have the opportunity to participate in the Training With
Industry (TWI) Program. The TWI program provides a WO an opportunity to spend up to 12 months with a civilian
industry that provides training in industrial procedures and practices. The training is designed to enhance knowledge,
experience and perspectives in management and operational techniques. The TWI program is very competitive and
requires the WO to coordinate with the Quartermaster Warrant Officer Career Manager at HRC.
(5) Chief warrant officer five. Warrant officers at this level should continue self development they will increasingly
be called upon to advise, mentor, counsel and train subordinates throughout the command. CW5s will serve as the
command’s senior Quartermaster technical advisor and accordingly the officer must be able to communicate efforts on
each of the 4 Quartermaster warrant officer specialties.

26–5. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Officer Preferences. The Quartermaster Corps has diverse assignment opportunities that allow for numerous
career development paths. The goal of the professional development of Quartermaster Corps officers is to produce and
sustain highly proficient tactically and operationally oriented officers to lead the Quartermaster Corps in combat and on
other assigned missions. Assignments in the Quartermaster Corps will be made to develop the officer’s ability to
achieve that goal. Requests from officers for assignments that do not contribute to achieving that goal will likely be
rejected.
b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility
on the sequence of assignments. Typically, Quartermaster Corps officers should seek assignments in the following
order— Basic Officer Course/Basic Officer Leader Course, platoon leader, battalion staff, Captains Career Course,
company command, brigade or division staff, nominative assignment, Command and Staff College/ILE, battalion S3 or
executive officer (as a MAJ), battalion level command, Senior Service College, and brigade level command. Typically,
Quartermaster warrant officers should seek assignments in the following order— basic warrant officer course, detachment and company level, battalion and below level; WOAC, group, brigade, regiment, and division level; WOSC
MACOM, Service School, Corps, and EAC level; WOSSC, DA, Joint, and national level.
26–6. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Key Quartermaster Corps positions. It is preferred that Quartermaster CPTs serve as company commanders for
18 months plus or minus 6 months. The OPMS goal is for MAJs to spend 3 years in an operational unit with 2 years
spent in critical branch preferred jobs (see para 26–3c(2)). LTCs and COLs will serve 2 years in battalion and brigade
commands that are not part of the BCT structure and 3 years in command within a BCT unit. Officers selected for a
force generation command have command tours for 2 years, with an option of a third year. Warrant officers are
required to serve in their specialty for an entire career. However, Quartermaster WOs should adhere to the proposed
Quartermaster warrant officer life cycle models for their MOS to assure a proper career path. Typically, junior
Quartermaster WOs should primarily serve in force structure organizations followed by progressive assignments that
lead to non–divisional and force generation assignments.

b. Quartermaster Corps life cycle. Figure 26–1 displays a Quartermaster Corps life cycle and developmental
positions.
c. Quartermaster warrant officer life cycle.
(1) Branch/FA generalist assignments. Quartermaster WOs can expect to serve in Quartermaster MOS immaterial or
staff assignments, such as inspector general positions, positions on the DA staff, field agencies (Defense Logistics
Agency) and as service school instructors. These positions may or may not relate directly to their MOS, but are
important to the Army.
(2) Joint assignments. Given the Congressional mandate to increase Joint duty experience, warrant officers can
expect consideration for assignment to Joint organizations. Joint experience is important to the Army and is essential in
the professional development of individual officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions.
(3) Other assignments. Quartermaster WOs may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated
above. Such assignments may include duty at the White House, duty with the United Nations and support to the RC
units. The spectrum of possible assignments is large, and these assignments are highly important, requiring mature,
skilled and well–grounded officers.

26–7. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Officer goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for Quartermaster Corps officers. To do this the
field grade inventory must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to
support branch/FA generalist positions, and to provide majors with at least 2 years of branch preferred assignment
time.
b. Warrant officer goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for Quartermaster Corps warrant
officers. This involves optimizing the inventory to meet branch authorizations, provide sufficient flexibility to support
all authorized positions, and to provide warrant officers with the optimum career pattern to develop their technical,
tactical and leadership skills.
c. Force Stabilization. This system is designed to reduce personnel turbulence for units, increase readiness, combat
effectiveness, and unit cohesion.
(1) Stabilized Installation assignments. Generally, officers assigned to Stabilized Installation units will be initial
entry officers from OBC/WOBC. These officers will be assigned to an installation for approximately 7 years while
junior warrant officers can expect to serve at the same installation from the rank of WO1 up to selection and promotion
to CW3. During this time, the officer will complete their platoon leader and LT years while junior WOs can expect
assignments at the TOE battalion and brigade level. The officers will gain tactical and operational experience that will
benefit them and the Army in their development in future positions. Many of these officers will then proceed to the
Advanced course and return to the same installation to complete company command. The remaining officers will be
reassigned to other installations for command and positions in accordance with the needs of the Army. Field grade
officers will be assigned to Stabilized Installations for a period of time to complete for branch preferred assignments.
Upon promotion to CW2, WOs who are between their 3rd and 5th year of WO service will to the WO advanced course
and return to the same installation to serve in a senior WO billet
(2) Life cycle managed units. Officers at all levels may be assigned to life cycle managed units (generally the
Stryker Brigade and Units of Action that are currently being developed) will remain in the unit for a minimum of 3
years. The officer will complete LT development, company or battalion command, or MAJ Branch preferred assignments during this time. Officers in these units have the possibility of greater than average time in platoon leader,
command or MAJ branch preferred positions. Branch detail officers will remain in their detail branch until after
completion of the assignment to the LCM unit.
(3) Cyclic managed units: The majority of the installations and EAD CSS units will be managed on a cyclic
manning system. Replacements will be sent to these units and installations periodically to maintain readiness of the
units. Tour lengths and developmental positions opportunities can vary. Branch detail officers will remain on standard
branch detail timelines.
d. Officer Personnel Management System implementation. The numbers of authorized Quartermaster Corps billets,
by grade, will vary as force structure decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring

306

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

more information on Quartermaster authorizations or inventory are encouraged to contact the Quartermaster Corps
proponency office or their AHRC assignment officer.
26–8. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Quartermaster Corps
a. Structure. The Quartermaster Corps initiative to create a petroleum warrant officer specialty will result in some
changes to the 92F AOC (Petroleum Officer) force structure. Selected positions in current and future petroleum units
will be identified to convert to the proposed petroleum warrant officer specialty. There will be changes to the
authorizations of those units based on the restructuring and recoding initiatives associated with the implementation of
OPMS. Other minor changes are possible due to the iterative nature of the restructuring and recoding process.
b. Acquire. Officers will continue to be accessed into Quartermaster Corps through the U.S. Military Academy,
Reserve Officers Training Corps and Officer Candidate School. Accessions are based on the needs of the Army and
officer preference.
c. Distribute. Officers will continue to rotate between force structure and force generation units in CONUS and
OCONUS, but the tour lengths of such assignments will be longer. Officers will have more time to gain the requisite
skills in their branch and their branch/FA assignments. OPMS changes some previous distribution rules, which
formerly applied to Quartermaster Corps; officers of the branch who serve in the Operations career field will work
either in branch or branch/FA generalist positions. Quartermaster Corps officers who select a FA in another career field
will no longer serve in Quartermaster Corps billets.
d. Deploy. Quartermaster Corps officers are war-fighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to
deploy worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to force generation units with high levels of readiness or fixed site
force structure organizations, all Quartermaster branch officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the
full spectrum of conflict. Quartermaster Corps officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential
adversaries and to protect national interests; or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than
war such as humanitarian and peace keeping missions. Quartermaster officers must prepare themselves and their
families for this most challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustain. OPMS changes the manner of execution of 3 major actions that affect officer career development in the
following areas.
(1) Promotion. The institution of career field based promotion boards is a significant but fundamental change.
Quartermaster Corps officers will compete for promotion only within the Operations career field, eliminating the
double counting which occurred previously when officers competed in both their branch and their FA.
(2) Command. Quartermaster Corps commanders will continue to be centrally selected for commands. Quartermaster
officer command opportunities are in the Operations career field. These commands are organized into 3 functional
categories: Tactical, Training and Strategic Support and Institutional. Officers have the option of selecting the category
or categories in which they desire to compete for command, while declining competition in other categories. The
results of the command selection process are announced in the Command Selection List (CSL).
(3) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS. Starting
with CPT, the rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the career field which best suits his or her
abilities and interests.
f. Develop. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in
troop units, staff assignments and institutional training assignments. Self- development continues to be an essential
component of officer development. The goal is to professionally develop Quartermaster officers to logistically support
combined arms and Joint operations. Development occurs through the Army school system as well, and all officers
selected for MAJ should complete ILE/MEL 4 training and all COLs selected for either resident or non-resident Senior
Service College instruction should complete MEL 1 training.
g. Transition. The officer transition/separation process remains unchanged.
26–9. Key warrant officer life cycle initiatives for Quartermaster Corps
a. Structure. The Quartermaster Corps’ initiative to create a petroleum WO specialty will result in some changes to
the 92F AOC (Petroleum Officer) force structure. Selected positions in current and future petroleum units will be
identified to convert to the proposed petroleum WO specialty. There will be changes to the authorizations of those
units based on the restructuring and re- coding initiatives associated with new missions. Other minor changes are
possible due to the iterative nature of the restructuring and re-coding process.
b. Acquire. Accessions are based on needs of the Army. Quartermaster Warrant Officers will continue to enter into
the Quartermaster Corps through accessions from Quartermaster enlisted feeder MOSs. Outstanding Quartermaster
NCOs who have demonstrated exceptional leadership, tactical and technical skills are ideal candidates for accession
into 1 of the 4 Quartermaster WO specialties. Army policy prohibits enlisted direct appointments to WO.
c. Distribute. Quartermaster WOs will continue to rotate between force structure and force generation units both in
CONUS and OCONUS. CONUS tours are expected to lengthen as the Army strives to improve family life through
more stability in assignments. Quartermaster WOs will have more time to gain the requisite technical skills and
experience across a broad spectrum of operational assignments. Specifically, Quartermaster WOs can expect pinpoint

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

307

assignments to the UIC level of the command. This will ensure WOs are assigned to the right unit at the proper grade
and experience level.
d. Deploy. Quartermaster Warrant Officers are technicians and leaders who remain personally and professionally
prepared to deploy worldwide at any time. Whether assigned to force structure units with high levels of readiness or
force generation organizations, all QM warrant officers must be fully deployable to accomplish the mission across the
full spectrum of conflict. Quartermaster Warrant Officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter adversaries
and to protect national interests or as individuals to support Joint or multinational operations other than war such as
humanitarian and peace keeping missions. Quartermaster Warrant Officers must prepare themselves and their families
for this most challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustain. ATLDP initiatives will change the manner of execution of 3 major actions that affect WO career
development.
(1) Promotions. Warrant officers will compete for promotion based on needs of the Army, Quartermaster Corps
requirements and best-qualified methods.
(a) WO1s are eligible for promotion to CW2 after serving 2 years in grade; promotion to CW2 is effected on the
recommendation by the first O–5 in the chain of command.
(b) Warrant Officers in the grade of CW2, CW3, and CW4 will be considered for promotion to the next higher
grade by a centralized DA selection board. DA will publish zones of consideration prior to each promotion board.
Warrant Officers are first considered for below–the–zone after 3 years in grade, then in the promotion zone after
serving four (4) years in grade.
(2) Assignment. Quartermaster WOs should adhere to the recommended career development pattern to maximize
their technical and tactical expertise and leadership development. This includes assignments at tactical, operational, and
strategic level as well as Joint, national and in the training base. Solid performance at various levels of assignment is
highly desirable for future advancement.
(3) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and personnel
management. Starting with WO1, the rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the career development
which best suits the Army’s needs and the WO’s abilities and interests.
f. Develop. Warrant officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive
Quartermaster coded positions at all levels from tactical to national. Self-development continues to be an essential
component of WO development as well as resident training in the Army school system. The goal is to professionally
develop Quartermaster Warrant Officers to logistically support Army missions across the full spectrum of operations.
Development occurs through self-study, the WO education system and progressive levels of assignments within their
specialty.
g. Transition. The WO separation process remains unchanged.
26–10. Quartermaster Corps Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. The Quartermaster RC officer plays an important role in the Quartermaster Corps
combat service support mission. The Reserve Component comprises the majority of units and personnel in the
Quartermaster Corps. Reserve Component Quartermaster officer development objectives and qualifications basically
parallel those planned for their Active Army counterparts. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation through
assignments in their branch before specialization begins.
b. Branch preferred assignments and development opportunities. Even though RC officers are limited by geographical considerations, they should strive for Quartermaster assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as
their Active Army counterparts. Reserve officers commissioned into the Quartermaster Corps are designated AOC 92A,
Quartermaster, Supply and Materiel Management, by the CDR, AHRC–St. Louis or The Adjutant General (TAG) of
the state to which assigned for Army National Guard officers. RC Quartermaster officers may attend specialized
courses relating to various Quartermaster AOCs such as the Air Delivery and Materiel Officer Course AOC 92D,
Advanced Petroleum/Water Management AOC 92F, or the Mortuary Affairs Course for skill identifier (SI) 4V. Upon
promotion to CPT, some RC Quartermaster officers may be given a 92D or 92F AOC respectively by the CDR
AHRC–St. Louis or by being assigned to TPU positions in one of these AOCs upon completing the Supply and Service
Management Officers Course (SSMO), Combined Logistics Captains Career Course (CLC3) or the Reserve Component
Quartermaster Officer Advanced Course (RC- QMOAC). However, the vast majority of RC Quartermaster officers are
awarded AOC 92A.
c. Professional development. Professional development for RC officers is divided into phases from the grade of LTC
(see fig 26–7). These phases are described below.

308

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

309

(1) Lieutenant. The initial development of a Quartermaster officer includes the establishment of basic leadership
skills in the areas of communication, management, technical and tactical knowledge, and troop leading experience. This
critical phase is the foundation for Quartermaster officers. LTs should strive for assignments in platoon leader positions
in a force structure/force generation unit. Developmental objectives in the LT phase are as follows:
(a) Education. Completing resident Quartermaster OBC/Basic Officer Leader Course within 2 years of initial
appointment or completion of college if commissioned early. Obtaining a bachelor’s degree. A bachelor’s degree is
required for promotion to CPT.
(b) Initial assignments. Obtaining key developmental assignments such as platoon leader positions in force structure/
force generation units. Completing a minimum of 3 years in a Quartermaster branch (branch code 92) assignment.
(2) Captain. During this phase, an officer requires completion of the CLC3 or the RC- QMOAC, successful
command or time in troop leadership positions. Throughout this phase, the officer continues to develop leadership,
tactical, technical, communication, and management skills. Captain developmental objectives are as follows:
(a) Education. Attending CLC3 or both phases of the RC–QMOAC. Reserve Component officers must complete an
OAC prior to consideration for promotion to the grade of MAJ. For branch transfer officers, completing a Captains
Career Course other than Quartermaster, completing the Supply and Service Management Officers Course (SSMO) the
resident CLC3 or RC- QMOAC. Branch transfer officers who have attained a high level of technical competence
through command of a Quartermaster unit, military or civilian quartermaster related experience, or education may
apply for constructive credit for RC- QMOAC. Requests for this credit should be directed to Commander,
USAQMC&S, ATTN: ATSM–AC–R, Fort Lee, VA 23801. The request should contain substantiation of the individual’s experience and training and a recommendation from the officer’s commander.
(b) Assignments. Obtaining key developmental assignments such as company commander and staff officer at the
battalion, brigade/group, DISCOM or COSCOM level. It is preferred that the officer successfully completes a company
or detachment command of a force structure/force generation unit. Having a cumulative total of 6 years of Quartermaster experience, of which 3 years should be in a force structure/force generation troop unit.
(3) Major. At the grade of MAJ, focus is on the development of upper level staff skills and branch standards.
(a) Education. Successful completion of ILE. In addition, RC officers may obtain a skill identifier. For branch
transfer officers who have completed an OAC other than Quartermaster, completion of the Supply and Service
Management Officers Course or RC–QMOAC is required. Branch transfer officers who attain a high level of technical
competence through command of a Quartermaster unit, military or civilian experience or education in a Quartermaster
related field, may apply for constructive credit for phase I of the RC QMOAC at the following address: Commander,
USAQMC&S, ATTN: ATSM–RC, Fort Lee, VA 23801. The officer’s commander should substantiate this request with
proof of experience and a recommendation. All officers must attend the resident phase II. Completion of 50 percent of
the Command and General Staff Officer Course (CGSC)/ILE.
(b) Assignments. Completion of Quartermaster branch training should be obtained through developmental assignments such as battalion/ brigade/group XO/S3, support operations officer, or staff officer at a DISCOM or COSCOM
level. In addition to these objectives, officers should further develop their Quartermaster education. The Associate
Logistics Executive Development Course (LEDC), other U.S. Army Logistics Management College courses, and an
advanced degree all contribute to the professional development of a Reserve Component Quartermaster officer.
(4) Lieutenant colonel and colonel. This is the utilization stage in an RC officer’s career. Emphasis is placed on an
officer successfully completing LTC and COL level commands as well as serving in key quartermaster or multifunctional/logistical staff positions. In addition, all officers should strive to complete their military education level
requirements. The developmental objectives for these phases are as follows:
(a) Completion of a pre–command course when selected for LTC or COL command.
(b) Completion of LTC and COL level command requirements.
(c) Achievement of MEL 4 for promotion to LTC.
(d) Obtain key RC assignments such as command, division G4, MACOM/HQDA/DOD/Joint level staff, and chief at
USAR Command Headquarters or Headquarters State Area Command.
(e) For LTCs, completion of CGSC/ILE is required for promotion to COL.
(f) LTCs are required by ARNG policy to have completed CGSC/ILE to be assigned in battalion or higher
commands and in brigade executive officer or S3 positions. LTCs with 3 years of time in grade should complete
CGSC/ILE to qualify for assignment to any principal staff position at brigade or higher.
(g) The officer should continue to enhance military education through other military courses. Upon promotion to
LTC, the Chief, Army Reserve, and the Chief, National Guard Bureau, select Reserve Component officers for
participation in the U.S. Army War College Distance Education achieve MEL1. Except through an established resident
program, completion of the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course is the only other means by which an
Army officer can receive credit for senior Service college (SSC) training.

26–11. Quartermaster Reserve Component warrant officers
Reserve component WO development objectives and qualifications basically parallel those planned for their Active
Army counterparts. Junior WOs must develop a strong foundation through assignment in their branch. Even though
geographical considerations limit some RC WOs, all should strive for QM assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as their Active Army counterparts. The RC life cycle development model for QM WOs is at
figure 26–8. See chapter 7 for a detailed discussion of RC WO professional development issues.

Chapter 27
Psychological Operations Functional Area
27–1. Unique features of Psychological Operations functional area
a. Unique purpose of Psychological Operations functional area. The Psychological Operations FA (FA 37) is one of
3 FAs in the Operations career field, and as such, holds a unique place among FAs in the Army. Psychological
Operations (PSYOP), FA 37, forms an FA where officers must apply their specific expertise within a regional and
cultural context. The CG, U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, is the proponent for FA 37.
b. Unique functions performed by Psychological Operations functional area. Psychological Operations officers
possess expertise in assessing foreign target audiences, developing PSYOP plans, programs and products, disseminating
PSYOP products, and synchronizing PSYOP activities in peacetime and combat operations. The PSYOP officer is an
expert in the command and employment of PSYOP individuals, teams and units in support of these missions. PSYOP
officers must maintain proficiency in critical skills associated with a specific region of the world to include foreign
language competence, political-military awareness, and cross-cultural communications. Conducting PSYOP requires
interaction with host nation military, civilian officials, the general populace, displaced civilians, and internees; as well
as interagency coordination within the U.S. government. This interaction is necessary for managing the development of
effective PSYOP actions and products in support of a combatant commander or Joint task force; obtaining PSYOPrelated intelligence; developing pre-test and post-test PSYOP products; providing PSYOP support to foreign internal
defense (FID) and internal defense and development (IDAD) operations in support of country teams; and providing
PSYOP support to counter-drug operations. PSYOP is a combat and diplomatic multiplier.
c. Unique features of work in Psychological Operations functional area. The PSYOP plays a crucial role in the full
spectrum of operational missions conducted by the U.S. military. They are essential to peacetime theater security
cooperation plans and military operations other than war (MOOTW), stability and support operations, humanitarian
assistance missions and operations short of war. Conducting PSYOP requires interaction with host nation military and
civilian officials as well as the general population, displaced civilians, and internees. This interaction is necessary for
managing development of valid PSYOP actions and products in support of a Regional Combatant Commander or Joint
task force; obtaining PSYOP related intelligence; pre-testing and post-testing PSYOP products; assisting in the control
of civilian populations; providing PSYOP support to foreign internal defense (FID); internal defense and development
(IDAD) operations in support of country teams; and providing PSYOP support to the counter-drug effort and other
global threats.
d. Functional area 37 areas of concentration.
(1) Psychological Operations (AOC 37). This AOC coding applies to both PSYOP officers and PSYOP positions.
An officer with a FA designation of 37 is a PSYOP officer. A position that is coded 37 on an authorization document
calls for a PSYOP officer to fill that position.
(2) Untrained FA 37 officer (AOC 37X). A newly accessed FA 37 officer is designated as 37X to denote that he or
she has not completed initial FA 37 AOC training.
(3) Mission requirements. Due to their missions, FA 37 officers require a combination of diverse traits. Preferably,
FA 37 officers should have previous company grade combat arms or combat support experience. Most of the officers
assigned to FA 37 will work in TOE units.
27–2. Officer characteristics required
a. Unique skills.
(1) The core competencies for all Army Special Operations forces officers are— cross–cultural communications,
regional expertise, language ability, interpersonal skills, personal lethality (Warrior Ethos), adaptive thinking and/or
leadership and technical proficiency.
(2) PSYOP leaders will be proficient operating in widely dispersed areas in integrated combined arms teams and/or
with Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational units and Special Operations Forces (SOF) teams. PSYOP
leaders must be self-aware and adaptive, comfortable with ambiguity and able to predict second and third order effects.
(3) They must have the ability to solve complex political-military problems and develop and employ conventional
and unconventional solutions. They also must be able to develop and employ non-doctrinal methods and techniques
when applicable, and capable of decisive action for missions for which no doctrine exists.
(4) The PSYOP officer is an expert in the command and employment of PSYOP individuals, teams and units in the
execution of these missions.
(5) Be qualified military parachutists.
b. Unique knowledge.
(1) Functional area 37 officers form a pool of regionally aligned, culturally attuned and language qualified officers

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

313

capable of supporting tactical, operational and strategic level requirements in peace and war. The FA 37 officers are
required to display a wide range of skills, knowledge, and attributes.
(2) Psychological Operations officers conduct PSYOP planning and operations in support of missions across the full
spectrum of conflict. PSYOP officers are adept at cross-cultural communications, proficient at multimedia marketing
techniques and planning, familiar with the use of polling and focus groups to provide scientifically based measures of
effectiveness, and skilled at integrating the PSYOP effort with the other information operations/warfare components.
They provide PSYOP training, advice and assistance to U. S. forces, other government agencies and friendly nations/
forces. They are able to analyze target groups from a cultural, historical, political, social, economic, systematic and
religious perspective for exploitable psychological weaknesses.
(3) The FA 37 officers must have an aptitude for learning a foreign language and must sustain foreign language
proficiency throughout their careers.
(4) The FA 37 is unique in that all active duty officers are required to be qualified military parachutists.
(5) Select FA 37 officers are afforded the opportunity to obtain a PSYOP-related master’s degree, or equivalent
from a Proponent authorized graduate program.
(6) Completion of the FA 37 training provides officers with a baseline knowledge of Psychological Operations. As
they develop, officers gain a broader understanding of PSYOP and its application in supporting conventional and
special operations forces in the Joint, interagency and multinational environments.
c. Unique attributes.
(1) Human dimension. The human dimension is the differentiating factor that separates Army Special Operations
forces from all other military organizations. Army Special Operations forces are people–centric. Though fully comfortable and capable in high technology oriented operations, their unique strength is their ability to accomplish the goals
and objectives of the Nation by frequently operating in conjunction with, by or through indigenous populations or
surrogate elements. Army Special Operations forces do not operate in an environment of clearly delineated boundaries.
Their operational ethos is not defined by mathematical equations, force ratios, platforms or equipment. The Army
Special Operations forces–unique operational area is people— the human dimension, the human sensor, force multiplication, and ground truth. The Army Special Operations forces Joint battlespace framework is space, air, land, sea, and
the mind.
(2) Capacity for independent action. PSYOP officers must be warfighters able to work in remote, austere and often
hostile environments. They must be able to make important decisions with little or no immediate supervision. They
must be self-reliant and team players that can function as leaders in tightly knit small groups as well as larger
organizations.
(3) Maturity. Due to the nature of work, PSYOP officers must be extremely mature professionals. They are required
to work at the highest levels of command organizations on sensitive issues, often briefing and advising strategic and
operational commanders, media representatives, senior U.S. and foreign government officials.
(4) Tolerance. The PSYOP officers must demonstrate a spirit of cooperation and consideration for their soldiers and
others, and work well in the international, multicultural and Joint communities. PSYOP officers must be able to tolerate
and accept foreign practices and behaviors despite their cultural beliefs.
(5) Ability to deal with ambiguity and change. The PSYOP officers must be adaptable, flexible and capable of
independent operations in an unstructured environment. The PSYOP officers must be able to thrive in complex and
ambiguous situations.
27–3. Critical officer development assignments
a. Development pattern. FA 37 officers begin their careers in one of the Army’s accession branches. All attend
Officer Basic Courses and Captain Career Courses in their basic branch and serve in developmental positions as LTs
and CPTs. They can request the FA between their 5th and 6th years of service via the FA request process.
b. Accession criteria. All officers accessed into the FA must meet the following criteria:
(1) Eligible for a Top Secret security clearance according to the provisions of DA Personnel Security Program
regulations.
(2) Possess a baccalaureate degree, preferably in social/political science or related disciplines. Past academic
performance must demonstrate potential for graduate study.
(3) Have attained a minimum score of 85 on the Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) or have foreign
language ability as demonstrated by an acceptable Defense Language Proficiency Test score.
(4) Be airborne qualified or medically and physically capable and willing to volunteer for airborne training.
c. Opportunities for female officers. There are currently 5 positions closed to female officers. All other positions are
open to women.
d. Education and training. After CPT basic branch development, FA 37 officers begin their FA training. Officers
accessed into FA 37 must attend the USAJFKSWCS Psychological Operations Officers’ Course (POOC). This is
followed by regional studies, and language training (if not already language qualified). This training is 9 - 11 months.
After initial FA37 training and 12 - 15 months of utilization, a select number of highly qualified officers will receive
an opportunity to complete their MEL 4 requirements and a master’s degree in Defense Analysis from the Naval

314

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

Postgraduate School or Political Science from the University of Kansas. Other curriculums area acceptable with prior
coordination with the proponency office.
e. Career field designated officers. Officers who career field designate FA 37 will complete ILE and select officers
will have the opportunity to compete to attend the FA 37 master’s program. Those who attend the fully funded
master’s degree program at NPS and the common ore curriculum will receive ILE credit in lieu of attendance at Fort
Leavenworth. Select individuals will have an opportunity to complete a Training With Industry (TWI) assignment.
f. Attendance at Advanced Military Studies Program. The Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP) is a year of
highly competitive advanced study for selected officers completing the Command and General Staff College at Fort
Leavenworth. It provides a broad, deep education in the art and science of war at the tactical, operational and strategic
levels, followed by a tour as an operational planner.
g. Functional area 37 Masters of Science in Defense Analysis. The fully funded FA 37 Masters of Science in
Defense Analysis–specific masters is the preferred advanced degree for this FA, however the following advanced
degrees are desirable (table 27–1).

h. Functional area qualification and development.
(1) Captain.
(a) Completion of all FA 37 requisite training.
(b) Minimum requirement of 12 months with a goal of 24 months assigned to FA 37 coded positions within the 4th
Psychological Operations Group (A).
(c) Must conduct PSYOP in an operational environment.
(d) In addition to professional development through operational assignments, FA 37 CPTs should begin an intensive
self-development process. Their efforts should focus on gaining an in-depth understanding of combined arms operations, gaining and maintaining regional and linguistic competence.
(2) Major.
(a) Completion of all FA 37 requisite training.
(b) The key leader developmental assignments for FA 37 MAJs is successful service for a minimum of 12 months
with a goal of 24 months in any of the following positions or combination of positions: Company/Detachment
Commander, Battalion XO, Battalion S–3, Group XO, Group S–3, SFG PSYOP Officer, UEx/UEy PSYOP Officer,
and Joint PSYOP Officer. The intent of these FA developmental assignments is to prepare FA 37 majors for future
leadership responsibilities as battalion commanders and senior field grade officers.
(c) Service as a Joint or combined staff officer. Special Operations are Joint operations and FA 37 MAJs should
seek Joint or combined duty utilization as part of their overall FA development.
(d) FA 37 MAJs must maintain and enhance their foreign language proficiency and continue their self-development
reading program.
(e) Successful service in multiple aforementioned branch qualifying positions is considered enhancing for battalion
command.
(3) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) The desired developmental progression for FA 37 LTCs is successful service in any FA 37 coded LTC position
or combination of positions. The most critical of these assignments is service as an FA 37 battalion commander, which
develops the LTC for responsibilities as an FA 37 group or equivalent commander. Furthermore, there are opportunities
for an LTC to command a PSYOP unit in contingency operations. For the majority of LTCs, assignments will be
aimed at developing the officer for broader contributions to the FA, special operations in general, and the U.S. Army.
(b) An FA 37 officer who commands at the LTC level is eligible to compete for command of a PSYOP group.
(c) Completion of the Senior Service College.
(d) For self–development, FA 37 LTCs focus on general areas of knowledge. They should enhance their regional
knowledge and improve their language proficiency as well as continue their self–development reading program.
(4) Colonel.
(a) FA 37 COLs continue to serve the FA, special operations and the Army through service in any FA 37-coded
COL position or combination of positions within USSOCOM, USACAPOC, HQDA, Joint staffs, and other key
organizations.
(b) Opportunities exist for FA 37 COLs to command a Command Selection List (CSL) billet in the Institutional/
Garrison category or an RC unit.
(c) For self–development, FA 37 COLs focus on general areas of knowledge. Colonels should further enhance their
regional orientation and language proficiency and continue to follow an extensive professional reading regimen.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

27–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. Assignment to FA developmental positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility on the
sequence of assignments. There are sufficient FA developmental billets for FA 37 officers to serve a minimum of 12
months in FA developmental positions. The initial assignment for all FA 37 CPTs is to the 4th Psychological
Operations Group (A). Select officers will serve a tour assigned to an RC PSYOP unit.
b. Precedence. While not essential, it is preferred that an officer serve as a company commander prior to other MAJ
level assignments. To be considered for command of the 4th Psychological Operations Group (A), an FA 37 officer
must have served in an LTC level command.
27–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. With the exception of CPTs, all officers will serve a minimum of 12 months with a goal of 24 months in a FA
position at the appropriate grade.
b. Figure 27–1 displays the FA 37 life cycle model with FA qualifying and developmental assignments.

Figure 27–1. Functional area 37 life cycle development and utilization

318

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

27–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
FA 37 authorizations will increase under OPMS. Officers desiring more information on FA 37 authorizations, by grade,
are encouraged to contact the FA 37 Proponency Office or their HRC assignment officer.
27–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Psychological Operations
a. Structure. Functional area 37 structure is different from that of other FAs because of its high percentage of TOE
billets.
b. Acquisition. The FA accesses officers between their 5th and 6th year of service in proportion to the size of their
year group and needs of the Army.
c. Distribution. Under OPMS, FA 37 controlled officers will only serve in FA 37 and branch/FA generalist
positions. Only officers with FA 37 training are authorized to fill FA 37 positions. Only FA 37 controlled officers
command FA 37 units. The FA 37 PSYOP Assignments Branch, Career Management Division (CMD) at HRC OPMD
manages FA 37 officer assignments.
(1) Unit focused stabilization. PSYOP Officer Assignments Branch only assigns career field designated officers thus
the unit focused stabilization program which can assign company grade officer to home based assignments for up to 7
years and does not affect the distribution of designated PSYOP officers.
(2) Life cycle units. Officers in the grade of MAJ are subject to assignment to life cycle units (generally the Ranger
Regiment or Special Forces Groups). These are considered key developmental assignments for FA 37 officers.
(3) Cyclic units. Functional area 37 PSYOP officers may be assigned to cyclic units as determined by Army
authorizations for FA 37s at these installations/units.
d. Deployment. Functional area 37 officers must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide
at all times. Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA organizations, all
FA 37 officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. Functional area 37
officers may deploy suddenly with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests; or as
individuals to support Joint, interagency and multinational operations. Functional area 37 officers must prepare
themselves and their families for this challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustainment. The OPMS changes the manner of executing 2 major areas affecting officer career development.
(1) Command. Functional area 37 commanders will be centrally selected for command. All FA 37 officer command
opportunities are in the Operations career field. Army wide these commands are organized into 4 functional categories:
Tactical, Training and Strategic Support, Institutional, and TRADOC system managers. Officers have the option of
selecting the category or categories in which they desire to compete for command, while declining competition in other
categories. The results of the command selection process are announced in the command selection list (CSL). The
personnel proponent for FA 37, the USAJFKSWCS, closely monitors the number of commands available to FA 37
officers in order to achieve FA professional development on par with that of the branches in the Operations career
field.
(2) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS. Raters
and senior raters must clearly delineate who should be retained in FA 37 and who should return to their basic branch.
This information will assist CFD board members in choosing the best officers for FA 37.
f. Development. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in TOE units with troops, staff/TDA assignments, Joint, interagency and institutional training assignments.
Assignments may include developmental positions in Reserve Component units. Self-development continues to be an
essential component of officer development. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly conduct special
operations at the strategic, operational and tactical levels in support of the warfighting combatant commanders.
Development starts in the Army school system. All FA officers selected for MAJ will complete the 10-month ILE
military education level 4 (MEL 4) training in residence at Fort Leavenworth. Officers should strive to obtain a
master’s degree as discussed earlier. Officers who attend the Naval Postgraduate School will also attend the ILE
Common Core Curriculum 12 week course (CL site Monterey, CA) as part of their masters program. Graduating
officers will receive full ILE credit commensurate with those who attend in residence at Fort Leavenworth. All colonels
should complete MEL 1 training.
g. Transition. The FA separation process is the same as for all Army officers. Separating officers are encouraged to
consider a career in RC PSYOP units.
27–8. Psychological Operations Reserve Component officers
a. Organizational class identification. The USAR officers are classified into 4 groups: Selected Reserve, Individual
Ready Reserve, Standby Reserve and Retired Reserve. For purposes of career development, focus is on the Selected
Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve. Selected Reserve encompasses individuals assigned to TPU, individual mobilization augmentees/drilling individual mobilization augmentees and AGR. Individual Ready Reserves include Annual

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

319

Training, Reinforcement, Officer Active Duty Obligator, and Dual Component. USAR officers should reference
Reserve Components Update 23 or the following regulations AR 140–1, Army Reserve: Mission, Organization and
Training, and AR 140–10, Army Reserve: Assignments, Attachments, Details and Transfers, for specific definitions
and descriptions relating to career development.
b. General career development. FA 37 officers in the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) may command or serve in
PSYOP units or serve in staff positions requiring PSYOP experience or training. Army National Guard (ARNG) FA 37
officers serve as PSYOP staff officers within the Army National Guard UEx or within the Special Forces group
headquarters.
c. FA 37 areas of concentration. Psychological Operations (AOC 37)— coding applies to both PSYOP officers and
PSYOP positions. An officer with a FA designation of 37 is a PSYOP officer. A position that is coded 37 on an
authorization document calls for a PSYOP officer to fill that position.
d. Functional area experience and development opportunities.
(1) Prerequisites. All ARNG and USAR officers who desire to become FA 37 officers must complete officer basic
and advanced course instruction prior to attending FA 37 training. RC officers should set as a goal the completion of
the same training requirements as those of their AC counterparts.
(2) Knowledge. The RC officer however, may be unable to complete all of the training concurrently, as do the
Active Army officers. Officers designated in FA 37 must at a minimum complete the 2–phase Reserve Component
Psychological Operations Officer Course (RCPOOC). Phase I must be completed by distance learning. prior to
beginning phase II. Phase II is a mandatory 2–week resident phase taught at the USAJFKSWCS. Completion of the
Regional Studies Course, language training, and an advanced degree are all highly desirable but not required. Officers
should strive to attend the various PSYOP related courses provided at the USAJFKSWCS and the Joint Special
Operations University (JSOU) at Hurlburt Field, FL. There are 5 quotas per FY for Reserve Component officers to
attend the Regional Studies Course. Annually, RC officers are afforded an opportunity to attend resident advanced
military instruction. Additionally, the more FA 37 related training an officer receives, the more competitive he or she
may be for selection for assignments, promotion and mobilization designee slots. Self-development is critical to the
professional development of the RC officer. Ideally, the officer will possess a background compatible with one of the
master’s degrees listed in Table 27–1. FA 37 officers should maintain this expertise through their civilian employment
and continuing civilian and military schooling. Like their AC counterparts, RC officers should be regionally oriented
and must possess an expert knowledge of a region’s culture, history, politics, economics and religion. Ideally, the
officer’s knowledge of a region will include the ability to speak one of a region’s languages. The ability to learn and
sustain a foreign language is usually acquired through self-development and mandatory language training at regularly
scheduled reserve drills.
(3) Designation. The FA 37 officers must request FA designation from the Special Operations Proponency Office at
the USAJFKSWCS upon completion of training.
(4) Attributes. Officers should strive for assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as their active
duty counterparts. Geographic considerations will obviously limit assignment possibilities. Initially, all FA 37 officers
should serve in the various positions within a PSYOP tactical support company. The experience gained at this level is
instrumental in preparing officers for future assignments within PSYOP. Officers should strive to obtain certain
educational and assignment requirements in PSYOP at each grade. Meeting these objectives ensures that the officer has
acquired the skills, knowledge and attributes to be competitive for promotion. More importantly, however, completing
all professional development goals will increase the chances of being allowed to retain a position, and will also
improve the possibility of selection for LTC and COL command. Developmental opportunities within PSYOP are open
to female officers except those authorizations in the ARNG Special Forces groups.
(a) Captain.
1. Qualification. The ARNG and USAR FA 37 CPTs must complete an advanced course or CCC prior to being
considered qualified for promotion. CPTs must also complete the RC PSYOP officer course. The RC CPTs should
serve in any CPT FA 37 position at group or brigade level or below.
2. Further professional development goals.
a. Gain foreign language qualification.
b. Complete the Regional Studies Course.
c. Complete a FA 37 related advanced degree.
(b) Major.
1. Qualification. The RC MAJs should strive to serve in any FA 37 coded MAJ position for a minimum of 12
months with a goal of 24 months as a company/detachment commander, battalion XO/S3, brigade or group staff.
2. Further professional development goals.
a. Complete ILE.
b. Gain foreign language qualification.
c. Complete the Regional Studies Course.
d. Complete the Joint PSYOP Staff Planners Course or the Joint Psychological Operations Course.

320

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

e. Complete a FA 37 related advanced degree.
(c) Lieutenant colonel.
1. Education and assignments. LTCs must have completed ILE to be considered for promotion. The ARNG and
USAR LTCs should strive to serve in any FA 37 coded LTC position for a minimum of 12 months with a goal of 24
months.
2. Further professional development goals.
a. Enrollment in Senior Service College.
b. Gain foreign language qualification.
c. Complete the Regional Studies Course.
d. Complete an FA 37 related advanced degree.
(d) Colonel.
1. Education and assignments. The RC COLs should have served in any FA 37 position that is coded for colonels to
be considered for promotion. Positions should be held for a minimum of 12 months with a goal of 24 months.
2. Further professional development goals.
a. Attain MEL 1.
b. Gain foreign language qualification.
c. Complete the Regional Studies Course.
d. Complete a FA 37 related advanced degree.
3. USAR battalion and group command selection. The foundation for battalion and group command qualification in
the USAR for FA 37 is experience and above average job performance. When evaluating USAR FA 37 officers for
command the following should be considered:
4. FA 37 related training. The more FA 37 related training attained the better.
5. FA 37 assignment history. The officer should have met the USAR CPT and MAJ developmental requirements
detailed above. Certain FA 37 assignments are more sought after than others. Officers who serve successfully in key
jobs should be considered better suited for command than officers who have not. However, manner of performance is
the most important criteria that distinguishes an officer and prepares him or her for command selection. FA 37 duty
positions that are considered preferrable for USAR command selection are: PSYOP group S3/XO or DCO, PSYOP
battalion command, PSYOP battalion S3/XO, and PSYOP company command.
(e) Life cycle development model. The life cycle development model for RC FA 37 officers is shown at figure
27–2.

Civil Affairs Functional Area
28–1. Unique features of Civil Affairs functional area
a. Unique purpose of Civil Affairs functional area. The Civil Affairs FA (FA 38C) is one of 3 FAs in the Operations
career field, and as such holds a unique place among FAs in the Army. Civil Affairs (CA), FA 38C, forms an FA
where officers must apply their specific expertise within a regional and cultural context. The CG, U.S. Army John F.
Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, is the proponent for FA 38C.
b. Unique functions performed by Civil Affairs functional area. Civil Affairs. CA operations are those activities
conducted across the full spectrum of operations that strengthen the relationship between U.S. military forces, civil
authorities, and people of the nations in which the military forces are operating. CA supports conventional and special
force’s missions as well as those of select government agencies. A CA officer is an expert in the command, control and
employment of CA Soldiers, teams, and units in support of these missions. CA officers are able to support, train and
advise U.S. forces, other government agencies and foreign nations/forces on the civil affairs mission activities. The CA
officer can analyze, assess, and interact with the political, social, economic and religious aspects of an operational
environment in the context of his or her CA mission.
c. Unique features of work in Civil Affairs functional area. The CA FA combines regional expertise, language
competency, political-military analysis, foreign cultural awareness and professional military skills to conduct Civil
Affairs operations and support Civil-Military operations. The CA mission activities are humanitarian assistance,
populace and resources control, support to civil administration, foreign nation support, emergency services and
military-civic action. CA officers’ expert knowledge and training preparedness enable them to develop and direct
operations that are planned, executed and transitioned by a functional specialist intended to mitigate the negative
consequences of hostilities, reduce the conflict escalation potential of pol/mil instabilities or deter future national and/or
regional threats. CA mission activities are routinely conducted with, by and through indigenous populations and
institutions, military/para-military or security forces, international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and/or
other governmental agencies. CA officers leverage and orchestrate the use of military and non-military capabilities not
available elsewhere in the armed forces while operating independently or in support of component, Joint or combined
forces. CA represents the nucleus of the Army’s CMO expertise who routinely support Conventional and Special
Operations Task Forces.
d. Functional area 38 areas of concentration.
(1) Civil Affairs (AOC 38C). This AOC coding applies to both CA officers and CA positions. An officer with a FA
designation of 38C is a CA officer. A position that is coded 38C on an authorization document calls for a functionally
oriented CA trained officer to fill that position.
(2) Untrained FA 38 officer (AOC 38X). A newly accessed FA 38 officer is designated as 38X to denote that he or
she has not completed initial FA 38 AOC training.
e. Missions. Due to their missions, FA 38C officers require a combination of diverse traits. Preferably, FA 38C
officers must be branch qualified in accordance with requisites outlined in DA Pam 600–3 for their basic branch. Most
of the officers assigned to FA 38C will work in TOE units.
28–2. Officer characteristics required
a. Unique skills.
(1) The core competencies for all Army Special Operations forces officers are— cross–cultural communications,
regional expertise, language ability (1/1/1), interpersonal skills, personal lethality (Warrior Ethos), adaptive thinking
and/or leadership and technical proficiency.
(2) Civil Affirs leaders will be proficient operating in widely dispersed areas in integrated combined arms teams
and/or with Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational units and Special Operations Forces (SOF). CA
leaders must be self–aware and adaptive, comfortable, and competent problem solvers capable of operating in austere
environments and in widely dispersed areas in combined arms teams and/or with Joint, interagency, intergovernmental,
and multinational units and SOF. CA leaders must be mature, self-aware, versatile and adaptive, comfortable with
ambiguous situations with an intuitive ability to predict second and third order effects. They must be proficient in
executing missions through, with and by indigenous populations and their institutions.
(3) They must have the ability to solve complex political-military problems and develop and employ conventional
and unconventional solutions. They also must be able to devise and execute non-standard and non-doctrinal methods
and techniques when applicable to remedy unforeseen circumstances, and capable of decisive action for missions for
which no doctrine exists.
(4) The CA officer commands and employs CA soldiers, teams and units in the execution of CMO and CA mission
activities in support of conventional and special operations forces and US government agencies as required.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(5) Be qualified military parachutists.
b. Unique knowledge.
(1) The FA 38 officers form a pool of regionally aligned, culturally attuned and language qualified officers capable
of supporting tactical, operational and strategic level requirements in peace and war. FA 38 officers are required to
display a wide range of skills, knowledge and attributes. They command units conducting CA operations.
(2) The CA officers are able to support, train and advise U. S. forces, other government agencies, international
organizations (IOs), nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), humanitarian relief organizations (HROs) and foreign
nations/forces on the civil affairs mission activities. The CA officer can analyze, assess, and interact with the political,
social, economic and religious aspects of an operational environment in the context of his or her CA mission. CA
officers are adept at cross-cultural communications, organizing humanitarian relief operations and developmental
programs, developing and evaluating measures of effectiveness, and skilled at integrating the CA effort across the full
range of military operations.
(3) The FA 38C officers must have an aptitude for learning a foreign language and once acquired, they must sustain
foreign language proficiency throughout their careers.
(4) The FA 38C is unique in that all officers are required to be qualified military parachutists.
(5) The FA 38C officers require an in-depth knowledge of at least one region of the world and proficiency in at
least one of the region’s languages.
(6) Select FA 38 officers are afforded the opportunity to obtain a CA related master’s degree or equivalent from a
Proponent authorized graduate program.
(7) Completion of the FA 38C training provides officers with baseline knowledge to be successful in their first
developmental or utilization assignment. As they develop, officers gain a broader understanding of CA and its
application in supporting conventional and special operations forces in the Joint, interagency, intergovernmental and
multinational environments.
c. Unique attributes.
(1) The human dimension is the differentiating factor that separates Army Special Operations forces from all other
military organizations. Army Special Operations forces are people–centric. Though fully comfortable and capable in
high technology oriented operations, their unique strength is their ability to accomplish the goals and objectives of the
Nation by frequently operating in conjunction with, by or through indigenous populations or surrogate elements. Army
Special Operations forces do not operate in an environment of clearly delineated boundaries. Their operational ethos is
not defined by mathematical equations, force ratios, platforms or equipment. The Army Special Operations forces–unique operational area is people— the human dimension, the human sensor, force multiplication, and ground
truth. The Army Special Operations forces Joint battles pace is air, land, sea, space, and the mind.
(2) Civil Affairs officers must be warfighters able to work in remote, austere, and often hostile environments. They
must be able to make important decisionS with little or no immediate supervision. They must be self–reliant and team
players that can function as leaders in tightly knit small groups.
(3) Due to the military, social, and political significance of Civil Affairs mission activities, Civil Affairs officers
nature of work, Civil Affairs officers ability to function effectively within a military task force, the interagency or with
a U.S. country team is critical. Accordingly, the Civil Affairs officer’s situational awareness, cultural sensitivities, and
knowledge of the AOR form the basis of a highly competent Army Special Operations forces operator. The officer’s
sense of service, duty, and integrity are hallmarks of this professional who operates with confidence at the highest
levels of government and military command on sensitive issues, often briefing and advising national leaders and senior
military commanders, media representatives, and foreign governmental officials.
(4) Civil Affairs officers must demonstrate a spirit of cooperation and consideration for their soldiers and others, and
operate comfortably in the international, interagency and multiservice communities. Civil Affairs officers must be able
to tolerate and accept foreign idiosyncrasies and behaviors despite their origin or cultural beliefs.
(5) Civil Affairs officers must be adaptable, flexible, and capable of independent operations in an unstructured and
seemingly chaotic environment. Civil Affairs officers must be able to excel in complex and ambiguous situations.
28–3. Critical officer development assignments
a. Development pattern. Functional area 38C officers begin their careers in one of the Army’s accession branches.
All attend Officer Basic Courses (future BOLC) and serve in branch key developmental positions as LTs and CPTs.
They are accessed into the FA between their 5th and 6th years of service.
b. Criteria. All officers accessed into the FA must meet the following criteria:
(1) Possess a minimum of a Secret clearance at the time of accession to the FA and be eligible for a Top Secret
security clearance according to the provisions of AR 604–5.
(2) Possess a baccalaureate’s degree, preferably in social/political science, sociology, economics, public health,
public administration or related disciplines. Past academic performance must demonstrate potential for graduate study.
(3) Have attained a minimum score of 85 on the Defense Language Aptitude Battery or have a foreign language
ability as demonstrated by a Defense Language Proficiency Test score of 1/1 or higher.
(4) Be airborne qualified or medically and physically capable and willing to volunteer for airborne training.
324

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

c. Opportunities for female officers. All authorizations are open to women except for 20 direct combat probability
code (DCPC) 1 positions in Special Forces Groups (A), Ranger Regiment and the conventional brigade unit’s of action.
d. Education and training. After CPT branch key developmental assignments, FA 38C officers begin their FA
training. Officers accessed into FA 38C must attend the USAJFKSWCS Civil Affairs Qualification Course. This is
followed by an area studies course, and language training (if not already language qualified). This training is 9 to 11
months. After initial FA 38C qualification and 12 to 15 months of utilization, a select number of highly qualified
officers will receive an opportunity to complete their MEL 4 requirements and a master’s degree in Defense Analysis
from the Naval Postgraduate School or University of Kansas.
e. Career field designated officers. Officers who career field designate FA 38 will complete ILE and select officers
will have the opportunity to attend the fully funded FA 38 masters program. Those who attend the fully funded
master’s degree program at Naval Postgraduate School and the Common Core Curriculum will receive ILE equivalent
credit in lieu of resident attendance at Fort Leavenworth. Select individuals will have an opportunity to complete a
Training With Industry assignment.
f. Attendance at the Advanced Military Studies Program. The AMSP is a year of highly competitive advanced study
for selected officers completing the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth. It provides a broad,
deep education in the art and science of war at the tactical, operational and strategic levels, followed by a tour as an
operational planner. Utilization tours are frequently in special operations units conducting strategic and operational
planning.
g. Functional area 38C Masters of Science in Defense Analysis. The fully funded FA 38C Masters of Science in
Defense Analysis–specific master’s is the preferred advanced degree for this FA, however the following advanced
degrees are acceptable (table 28–1).

h. Functional area qualification and development.
(1) Captain.
(a) Completion of all FA 38C requisite training.
(b) Serve a minimum of 12 months as a Civil Affairs team leader.
(c) Must conduct CA activities in an operational environment.
(d) Goal for a CPT is 24 months assigned to FA 38 coded positions within an Active Army Civil Affairs battalion
(A).
(e) In addition to professional development through operational assignments, FA 38 CPTs should begin an intensive
self–development process. Their efforts should focus on gaining an in–depth understanding of combined arms operations, interagency awareness, gaining and maintaining regional and linguistic expertise.
(2) Major.
(a) Completion of all FA 38C requisite training.
(b) The key leader development assignments for FA 38 CPTs and MAJs are successful service for a minimum of 12
months with a goal of 24 months in any of the following positions or combination of positions: company/detachment
commander, battalion executive officer, battalion S–3, Group/Brigade Assistant 3, Army CA Officer, Assistant Corps
CA Officer (UEy), Assistant Division G5/CMO Officer (UEx), Group/Brigade CA Officer (UA/BCT), Cavalry CA
Officer, SBCT CA Officer, JTF–B Deputy J5, SF Group/Battalion S5, and Ranger Regiment CA Officer. The intent of
these career field developmental assignments is to prepare FA 38 MAJs for future leadership responsibilities as
battalion commanders and senior field grade officers.
(c) Service as a Joint or combined staff officer. Special Operations are Joint operations and FA 38 MAJs should
seek Joint or combined duty before or after their developmental assignment.
(d) Officers who serve 120 or more days in contingency operations will receive special consideration regarding
credit for a developmental assignment.
(e) Functional area 38 MAJs should also maintain and enhance their foreign language proficiency and continue their
self–development reading and education program.
(f) Successful service in one of the aforementioned key developmental positions is considered enhancing for
battalion command.
(3) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) The key developmental requirement for an FA 38 LTC is successful service in any FA 38 coded LTC position
or combination of positions. The most critical of these assignments is service as an FA 38 Division (UEx) S5 or
combatant command CA plans officer. Given the reality of few Civil Affairs command opportunities for the majority
of LTCs, promotion to LTC constitutes success and assignments will be aimed at developing the officer for broader
contributions to the FA, Special Operations in general, and the U.S. Army.
(b) An FA 38 officer who commanded at the LTC level is most eligible to compete for command at the COL level.

326

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(c) Completion of Senior Service College.
(d) For self–development, FA 38 LTCs focus on general areas of knowledge as it relates to the Civil Affairs mission
activities as well as the functional specialties. They should enhance their regional knowledge and improve their
language proficiency as well as continue their self–development reading program.
(4) Colonel.
(a) The FA 38 COLs continue to serve the FA, Special Operations, and the Army through service in any FA 38
coded COL positions, or combination of positions within USSOCOM, USACAPOC, HQDA, Corps, Joint staffs, and
other key organizations.
(b) Opportunities exist for FA 38 COLs to command a Command Selection List (CSL) billet in the Institutional/
garrison category or an RC unit.
(c) For self–development FA 38 COLs focus on general areas of knowledge. COLs must further enhance their
regional orientation and language proficiency and continue to follow an extensive professional reading regimen.
28–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. Assignment to FA key developmental positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility on
the sequence of assignments. There are sufficient FA key developmental billets for FA 38 officers to serve a minimum
of 12 months in FA qualifying positions. Select officers will serve a tour assigned to an RC CA unit. The initial
assignment for FA 38 CPTs is to an Active Army CA unit.
b. Precedence. While not essential, it is preferred that an officer serve as a company commander prior to other MAJ
level assignments.
28–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. With the exception of CPTs, all officers should serve a minimum of 12 months with a goal of 24 months in a FA
position at the appropriate grade.
b. Figure 28–1 displays the FA 38C life cycle model with FA and developmental assignments.

328

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

28–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
The FA 38C authorizations will increase under OPMS. Officers desiring more information on FA 38C authorizations,
by grade, are encouraged to contact the FA 38 Proponency Office or their AHRC CMD assignment officer.
28–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Civil Affairs
a. Structure. Functional area 38 structure is different from that of other FAs because of its high percentage of TOE
billets.
b. Acquisition. The FA accesses officers between their 5th and 6th year of service in proportion to the size of their
year group and needs of the Army.
c. Distribution. Under OPMS, FA 38C controlled officers will only serve in FA 38C and branch/FA generalist
positions. Only officers with FA 38C training are authorized to fill FA 38C positions. Only FA 38C controlled officers
command FA 38C units. The FA38 Civil Affairs Assignments Branch, Career Management Division (CMD) at HRC
Officer Personnel Management Directorate (OPMD) manages FA38 Officer assignments.
(1) Stabilized Installation units. Civil Affairs Officer Assignments Branch only assigns career field Designated
officers thus the unit focused stabilization program which can assign company grade officer to home based assignments
for up to seven years does not affect the distribution of designated Civil Affairs Officers.
(2) Life cycle units. Officers in the grade of MAJ are subject to assignment to Life Cycle Units (generally the
Ranger Regiment, Striker Brigade Combat Teams or Special Forces Groups). These are considered key developmental
assignments for FA38 officers.
(3) Cyclic units. FA 38 Civil Affairs Officers may be assigned to Cyclic Units as determined by Army authorizations for FA38s at these installations/units.
d. Deployment. FA 38C officers must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all
times. Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA organizations, all FA
38C officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. FA 38C officers may
deploy suddenly with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests; or as individuals to
support Joint, interagency and multinational operations. FA 38C officers must prepare themselves and their families for
this challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustainment. OPMS changes the manner of executing 2 major areas affecting officer career development.
(1) Command. FA 38C commanders will continue to be centrally selected for command. All FA 38C officer
command opportunities are in the Operations career field. Army wide these commands are organized into 4 functional
categories: Tactical, Training and Strategic Support, Institutional, and TRADOC System Managers. Officers have the
option of selecting the category or categories in which they desire to compete for command, while declining
competition in other categories. The results of the command selection process are announced in the command selection
list (CSL). The Personnel Proponent for FA 38C, the USAJFKSWCS, closely monitors the number of commands
available to FA 38C officers in order to achieve FA professional development on par with that of the branches in the
Operations career field.
(2) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS. Raters
and Senior Raters must clearly delineate who should be retained in FA 38 and who should return to their basic branch.
This information will assist CFD board members in choosing the best officers for FA 38C.
f. Development. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in TOE units with troops, staff/TDA assignments, Joint, interagency, and institutional training assignments.
Assignments may include developmental positions in Reserve Component units. Self-development continues to be an
essential component of officer development. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly conduct special
operations in support of the war fighting combatant commanders. Development starts in the Army school system. All
officers selected for MAJ should complete military education level 4 (MEL 4) training and should work to obtain a
master’s degree as discussed earlier. All LTCs should strive to complete JPME II. All COLs should complete MEL 1
training.
g. Transition. The FA separation process is the same as for all Army officers. Separating officers are encouraged to
continue their careers, and apply their experience and training, in a USAR CA unit.

Chapter 29
Multifunctional Logistician Functional Area
29–1. Unique features of Multifunctional Logistician functional area
a. Unique purpose of Multifunctional Logistician functional area. The Multifunctional Logistician FA (FA 90) is in

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

329

the operations career field. The goal of the FA 90 career path is to ensure the development of officers to the grade of
COL who are competent in planning and directing multifunctional logistical operations across the tactical, operational,
and strategic spectrum of logistical functions of maneuver sustainment. Today’s multifunctional logisticians must be
comfortable working in fluid, nonlinear, noncontiguous environments, with highly distributed forces functioning
continually, at various tempos, and in various phases of military operations. Additionally, logisticians must understand
the concepts and employment of Joint interdependent logistics capabilities in order to provide support to the combatant
commander wherever the force is located, as well as being able to sustain interagency and coalition partners. The CG,
U.S. Army Combined Arms Support Command is the proponent for FA 90.
b. Unique functions performed by Multifunctional Logistician functional area. The FA 90 position code is used in
personnel authorization documents to identify multifunctional logistics officer positions from CPT to COL. These
positions are located in operational and generating force structures and require experience in integrating the functions
of supply, transportation, maintenance, aviation logistics, medical service administration, field services as well as being
adept in the areas of contracting, procurement, finance and personnel. Logisticians at all levels (tactical, operational,
and strategic) are needed to ensure successful wars, campaigns, operations, battles, and stability and sustainment
operations. Multifunctional logisticians must be proficient in their basic branch skills as well as obtaining the requisite
skills of the other logistics functions based on grade and years of service.
c. Unique features of work in multifunctional logistician functional area. Functional area 90 is a dual–track FA for
Active Army and RC officers. Officers (MAJs and LTCs) who meet the criteria for certification in FA 90 also meet
equivalent certification in their basic branch. FA 90 officers work at all levels of command and staff and perform the
following functions and tasks:
(1) Command, direct, and control multifunctional and functional logistics units.
(2) Provide logistical coordination at all levels of command.
(3) Coordinate logistics in Joint, interagency and multinational operations.
(4) Develop doctrine, organizations and equipment for logistics.
(5) Instruct logistical skills at service schools and colleges.
(6) Serve in positions requiring multifunctional logistics skills such as staff officers in battalions, brigades, DISCOMs, Divisions/UEx, COSCOMs, Corps/Uey, Theater Sustainment Commands and MACOM headquarters.
(7) Active Army officers may serve as logistics advisors to Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve
organizations.
29–2. Officer characteristics required
FA 90 requires officers who are skilled in leadership at all levels; that are proficient in tactics, techniques and
procedures; who possess strong Army Values, leader attributes and skills; and who fully understand the key leadership
actions that must be taken to assure success. They regard themselves as part of a Joint team, have an expeditionary
outlook, and can think for themselves in unpredictable situations. They are adaptive, trained and ready, physically fit,
and are comfortable working in Joint, interagency and multinational environments.
a. Unique skills.
(1) FA 90 eligibility. The award of FA 90 as an FA does not imply that officers are qualified multifunctional
logisticians. In order to be certified as FA 90, officers must have the requisite skills and experiences based on current
grade. FA 90 seeks to build and develop adaptive, warfighting multifunctional logistics officers through an initial
introductory phase (apprenticeship) followed by a progressive and developmental management path of future multifunctional assignments that grow more challenging and capitalize on the application of learned skills and experiences.
FA 90 is only available to the following logistics officers (branch codes (BR) or medical functional area (MFA) noted):
(a) Transportation (TC) - BR 88.
(b) Ordnance (OD) - BR 91.
(c) Quartermaster (QM) - BR 92.
(d) Medical Service Corps (MSC) - MFA 70. Note. Only MSC officers who attend the Combined Logistics Captains
Career Course (CLC3) or the Logistics Executive Development Course (LEDC) may apply for FA 90. Aviation is no
longer assigning officers to FA 90 positions. Refer to chapter 14 for Aviation career progression.
(2) Decisionmaking skills. The new modular design units are more self-reliant, and require proactive leaders who
will work in asymmetric and unpredictable environments where time available for problem analysis is seriously
constrained, but where sound, timely decisions are urgent. Officers must be trained HOW to think, not WHAT to think.
Information gained in this environment will be uncertain and ambiguous. An ability to operate under stress, be
adaptive, make decisions, and act in austere field conditions is critical to success.
(3) Tactical and technical skills. Logistics officers must be warfighters who are technically proficient with branch
and mission-unique equipment, tools and systems. For example, logistics officers should be grounded in all the CSS
Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMISs), Battle Command Sustainment and Support System
(BCS3) and Global Combat Support System - Army (GCSS–A). Logistics mission success requires the proper balance
between technical skills and the ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactical skills at the right moment.

330

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

These skills must be gained and developed through multiple operational assignments and continuous professional study
and self–development.
b. Unique knowledge. Officers must possess expert knowledge of logistics, combined arms, and general support and
coordination principles. This knowledge includes practical experience in tactics and combined arms operations at the
tactical, operational, and strategic levels as well as deployment operations. Officers gain this knowledge through a
logical sequence of continuous education, training and experience, sustained by mentoring. Individual officers sustain
knowledge through institutional training and education, duty in operational and institutional assignments and continuous self- development.
c. Unique attributes.
(1) Personal attributes. The dynamics associated with training and operational missions across the full spectrum
require a sense of ingenuity and foresight. Logistics officers must fully embrace the Warrior Ethos, be confident in
their abilities and training, competent in their area of expertise, ready and adaptable to change, and have a Joint and
expeditionary mindset. They must be innovative and comfortable working with complex, information technologies.
(2) Multifunctional attributes. At the company grade level, logistics officer work is branch-oriented, but becomes
increasingly multifunctional as an officer progresses within the career field. As officers progress, work eventually
blends across systems, skills, and levels of operations that cross several logistics career fields. Officers must develop
and use a diverse set of skills as they move between branch leadership positions in operating and generating force
positions and as they serve in branch/FA generalist assignments.
29–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. Functional area qualification and development. Positions coded FA 90 on authorization documents provide
opportunities for the multifunctional experience and development necessary for logistics officers to mature in FA 90.
Officers may use the life cycle development and utilization model (fig 29–1) as a guideline for monitoring their career
paths. FA 90 provides progressive career development through challenging command and staff assignments in logistics
management and leader development. The logistics education process develops officers using a 2–phased approach.
Phase 1, the apprentice phase, focuses on educating the officer. Phase 2, the application phase, allows the officer to use
previously acquired skills and knowledge in assignments of greater complexity. Officers should become as proficient as
possible in their basic branch before seeking assignment to FA 90 development positions. Active Army professional
development objectives for each FA 90 officer grade follow.
(1) Captain. At this grade, CPTs strive to obtain a full understanding of their basic branch through schooling and
assignment experiences. These experiences lay the foundation for them throughout their career. They also begin
understanding and experiencing warfighting multifunctional logistics at the battalion and brigade level. Officers who
are contemplating a career as multifunctional logisticians should seek assignments in operational force CSS units as
much as possible. Once experienced in their basic branch, CPTs should seek assignments in FA 90 positions or CSS
positions not of their basic branch. Ideally, officers will serve in company grade positions in 2 or more logistics
functions (supply, transportation, field services, maintenance, or medical service logistics/administration).
(a) Education. Logistics CPTs receive their initial training at CLC3 and during developmental assignments in the
operating and generating force. Attendance to CLC3 will be TDY and return or PCS as fits the needs of the Army and
follow-on assignments. Though not required, there are numerous education opportunities that enhance and broaden an
officer’s understanding of multifunctional logistics. Officers should strive to complete one or more of the following:
1. The Support Operations Course.
2. Training With Industry (TWI).
3. Complete an advanced degree in a logistics discipline.
4. The Logistics Executive Development Course (LEDC). LEDC best prepares officers for multifunctional duties
across the spectrum of operations; attendance is very desirable. For a select number of officers, attendance to LEDC
may be coupled with a cooperative degree program pursuing an advanced degree in logistics from the Florida Institute
of Technology.
(b) Assignments. Assignments are based on needs of the Army, professional development requirements, and officer
preference. Officers assigned to life cycle units can expect 3-year tours. Captains can expect functional and multifunctional logistics assignments as company commanders, battalion and brigade staff officers as well as other staff positions
in the operating and generating force.
(c) Self-development. CPTs should continue to broaden their experience in the entire logistics arena. All are
encouraged to:
1. Establish a professional reading program.
2. Participate in their branch’s regimental association.
3. Participate in civilian professional logistics organizations.
4. Become a Certified Professional Logistician (CPL).
(d) Functional area process. With the elimination of the FA designation board, officers now submit during their 5th
to 10th year of service via an HRC Web site, preference for an FA. Once submitted, officers are eligible to be recruited

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

331

by the FAs for a possible change of career field. Officers who are offered and accept advanced civil schooling by an
FA will be early accessed into that particular career field during the CFD process.
(e) Desired branch experiences. CPTs desiring to be multifunctional logisticians should strive to serve in CSS
positions in operating and generating force units. Officers who desire to be competitive for commanding a multifunctional logistics battalion should strive to serve as operational CSS company commanders.
(2) Major. As a MAJ, the officer is to demonstrate their abilities to manage multifunctional organizations and
missions. They will build on their skills and experiences from their CPT years and institutional training to further their
skills as logisticians, and develop as better leaders and prepare themselves for positions of greater scope and
responsibility. This is a critical time in a professional logistician’s career, and will lay the foundation for future
positions in multifunctional logistics. Majors desiring a career as multifunctional logisticians should focus gaining
experiences at the tactical level by serving in critical FA 90 positions at the battalion, brigade, DISCOM, Division/
UEx, COSCOM or in modular units under a Theater Sustainment Command (TSC). Immediately after promotion to
LTC, officers that do not have the requisite skills in FA 90 can lose their FA 90 designation upon recommendation of
an HRC panel, and will revert back to their basic branch. Officers may choose to remain branch functional by working
positions within their basic branch area (see the specific chapter for the specific branch). FA 90 field grade officers will
be able to work most CSS branch functional coded positions as well as any FA 90 coded positions.
(a) Education. MAJs must complete ILE. FA 90 officers are in the Operational career field and will also complete
the Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course at Fort Leavenworth. Completion of ILE will make officers MEL 4/
ILE and JPME I qualified.
(b) Assignments. Majors are assigned to positions of increased responsibility and supervision. Assignment opportunities for FA 90 officers include key positions on staff at battalion, brigade, DISCOM, Division/UEx, MACOM, HQDA,
Joint staffs, and in TRADOC training centers and schools. The basic branch and FA 90 branch in the Combat Service
Support Division (CSSD) of HRC Officer Personnel Management Directorate manages assignments.
(c) Career field designation. All officers will undergo a CFDB upon selection for promotion to MAJ. The CFDB
will decide in which career field each officer is best suited to serve. Decisions are based on the officer’s preference,
rater and senior rater’s recommendations, the officer’s skills and training and the needs of the Army. Logistics MAJs
will have an opportunity to seek designation into the Operations career field or one of the other 3 career fields—
Operational Support, Information Operations and Institutional Support. After the CFDB, officers will compete for
promotion only within their designated career field. Officers do not CFD into FA 90. TC, OD, QM and select MSC
officers who receive their basic branch as a result of the CFDB will automatically receive the FA 90 designation.
(d) Self–development. MAJs should continue self–development efforts to become an expert in all aspects of logistics
to include Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational operations. Self–development should include correspondence courses, civilian education in logistics related fields and institutional training. Officers should continue to
devote time to their professional reading program.
(e) Desired branch experiences. MAJs who desire a career as multifunctional logisticians should pursue serving 12
months, preferably 24 months, in a 04/05 90A coded position at the tactical level (battalion, brigade/group, DISCOM,
division/UEx, COSCOM, modular brigade/group under a TSC). These positions will give majors the requisite skills
and experiences needed to be successful FA 90 officers at this grade and will prepare them for service and possible
command at the next grade. Additionally, the following are desired experiences for MAJs seeking to be multifunctional
logisticians:
1. CSS observer controller (MAJ–level) at a combat training center.
2. MAJ–level multifunctional logistics command position.
3. MAJ–level functional command position different from the officer’s basic branch.
4. Any of the desired branch experiences listed in the separate chapters for TC, OD and QM that is different from
the officer’s basic branch.
5. FA 90 Joint Staff Officer (JSO) or serving in a CSS JSO position different from the officer’s basic branch (only if
the officer served at least 12 months in a tactical position that meets the criteria in paragraph (e) above).
(f) Multifunctional experience. Multifunctional experience at the field grade level adequately prepares an officer to
serve in other logistics branch positions at the field grade level. Specifically, a FA 90 officer who is MEL 4/ILE and
has served successfully for a minimum of 12 months, preferably 24 months, in one of the multifunctional logistician
positions listed in paragraph (e) above is eligible for assignment to any other major 88, 91, or 92 coded position or
LTC 88, 91, or 92 command coded position.
(g) If an officer does not meet the above criteria, refer to para 29–3a(3)(d).
(3) Lieutenant colonel. This grade requires a higher level of supervisory and managerial skills. FA 90 officers are
responsible for integrating and synchronizing logistics operations and influencing and developing policy as it relates to
logistics management. In addition, FA 90 LTCs are responsible for providing more comprehensive supervisory control
of subordinate FA 90 and other CSS officers.
(a) Opportunities include— Battalion Commander, MACOM G4/J4, deputy director or branch chief at Army, DOD
or Joint headquarters, Corps or UEy Logistics staff officer, logistics assistance officer (LAO), key positions in ARNG

332

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

and USAR logistics organizations (TOE and TDA), serving in a FA 90 position on a Joint, Coalition or Multinational
staff
(b) Officers desiring assignments that will enhance their knowledge of multifunctional logistics should strive to
serve 24 cumulative months in one or more FA 90 coded positions in the operating and generating force. Some desired
experiences for multifunctional logisticians at this grade include—
1. Commander of a multifunctional battalion.
2. FA 90 Staff officer in a brigade, DISCOM, Division/UEx, COSCOM, Corps/UEy, and TSC.
3. FA 90 Joint Staff Officer (JSO) or serving in a CSS JSO position different from the officer’s basic branch.
4. FA 90 staff officer on a coalition or multinational staff.
(c) Multifunctional command experience at the LTC level prepares an officer to serve in other branch positions at
the LTC level. Specifically, a Transportation, Ordnance, or Quartermaster officer who has served in a multifunctional
command position is eligible for an assignment to any LTC 88, 91, or 92 coded position.
(d) After selection to LTC and before the O–5 CSL board, a panel at HRC to review multifunctional skills and
experiences will screen all FA 90 officers’ records. Officers that do not have adequate experiences in FA 90 will lose
their FA 90 designation and revert back to their basic branch. The experiences in paragraph 29–3a(2)(e) will be used as
a guide for the panel. Officers who revert to their basic branch will not be allowed to compete in the Multifunctional
Tactical (6S) or Multifunctional Training and Strategic Support (6SR) command categories, and will only compete in
their functional branch command categories. Those officers that retain FA 90 can compete in the multifunctional CSL
categories and their respective functional category.
(4) Colonel. FA 90 ensures the development of officers who can plan and direct multifunctional logistical operations
and deliver material readiness on an end to end capability from source of supply to point of use; across the entire
spectrum of combat service support functions of maneuver sustainment. FA 90 COLs command at the brigade level
and hold the senior executive post on Corps/UEy, TSC and many HQDA, JCS and DOD staffs.
(a) Education. In order to better develop officers with a global perspective, COLs should complete a Senior Service
College (MEL 1 training) as soon as possible. All officers are encouraged to obtain a graduate-level education in an
appropriate discipline.
(b) Assignments. COL assignments include: Commanders of Sustainment Brigades, DISCOMs, CSGs and ASGs;
Directors of logistics (DOL); Corps/UEy G4; Division and directorate TDA and TRADOC logistics positions; Senior
Logistics Joint Staff Officer.
(c) Multifunctional command experience. Multifunctional command experience at the LTC or COL level prepares an
officer to serve in other branch positions at the COL level. Specifically, a Transportation, Ordnance, or Quartermaster
officer who has served in a multifunctional command position is eligible for an assignment to any COL 88, 91, or 92
coded position.
b. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. CPTs and above can expect to serve in branch/FA generalist
assignments, such as ROTC, USMA faculty and staff and Inspector General, that may or may not be directly related to
FA 90, but which are important to the Army.
c. Joint assignments. Functional area 90 officers can expect to be considered for Joint duty assignments worldwide.
Joint experience is important to the Army and is essential to individual officers for their advancement into senior
leadership positions. Joint is the way we fight and Joint assignments and education are interwoven into the fabric of
Army officer development.
29–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. Functional area 90 has diverse assignment opportunities that allow for numerous career development
paths. The goal of the professional development of multifunctional logistics officers is to produce and sustain highly
qualified tactically and operationally oriented individuals to provide seamless logistical support in combat and other
missions. Assignments in FA 90 will be made to develop the officer’s ability to achieve that goal. Requests from
officers for assignments that do not contribute to achieving that goal may be rejected.
b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility
on the sequence of assignments. Stabilization policies may influence assignment precedence.
29–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Key FA 90 positions. At each grade, the amount of time spent in key assignments must be monitored to ensure
that officer professional development is optimized. At the grade of CPT, officers should strive to become experts in
their basic branch and spend as much time as possible in multifunctional or non-basic branch CSS assignments. The
goal for majors is to spend 36 months in an operational unit with at least 24 months spent in FA 90 positions. LTCs
and COLs will normally serve 24 months in command or as multifunctional Joint, coalition, or multinational logistics
staff officers. Army manning policy is allowing extended command times as a result of operational requirements and
force stabilization. Therefore, some commands will serve beyond 24 months. In regard to professional development,

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

333

there is no preference in the length and type of command for FA 90. The important factor is that each selected officer
performs to a high standard and is successful in manner of performance.
b. FA 90 Life cycle. Figure 29–1 displays the Multifunctional Logistician Program FA life cycle model.

334

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

Figure 29–1. Functional area 90 life cycle development and utilization

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

335

29–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for FA 90 officers. To do this, the field-grade
inventory must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, provide sufficient flexibility to support branch/FA
generalist positions, and fill FA 90 coded positions. In addition, the inventory must be sufficient enough to provide
majors with a minimum of 12 months service in a FA 90 position while stabilized for 36 months if in a life cycle
managed unit or BCT.
b. Army Transformation. The numbers of authorized FA 90 billets, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions
are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring specific numbers, by grade, should contact the
HRC OPMD FA 90 assignment officer.
29–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Multifunctional Logistician Program
a. Structure. FA 90 officers serve at all echelons worldwide. FA 90 positions exist in Army battalion, brigade,
division/UEx corps/UEy units, TSCs, headquarters staffs and Joint, coalition and multinational commands. As the
Army undergoes transformation, there will be changes in the FA 90 authorization structure.
b. Acquire. Officers will continue to be accessed into basic branches through the U.S. Military Academy, Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps and Officer Candidate School. Accessions are based on the needs of the Army and officer
preference. All Ordnance, Quartermaster, and Transportation Corps officers who are career field designated in operations/basic branch will receive FA 90 and carry both their basic branch designation and FA 90. Only Medical Service
Corps officers in MFA 70 who have attended CLC3 or LEDC will be awarded FA 90.
c. Distribute.
(1) Stabilized Installation assignments. Generally, officers assigned to stabilized installation units (primarily BCTs)
will be initial entry officers from OBC. These officers will be assigned to an installation for approximately 36 months.
During this time, the officer will complete their platoon leader and LT years. Most of these officers will then proceed
to CLC3 either in a TDY and return status or as a PCS. Some officers may return to the same installation to complete
company command or other CPT assignments, but most will be reassigned to other installations for command and
positions in accordance with the needs of the Army. The officers will gain tactical and operational experience that will
benefit them and the Army in their development in future positions. Field grade officers assigned to life cycle managed
units can expect to be stabilized on an installation for 36 months.
(2) Life cycle managed units. Officers at all levels may be assigned to LCM units (generally the Stryker Brigade and
Brigade Combat Teams) will remain in the unit for a minimum of 36 months. The officer will complete company grade
development, or field-grade developmental assignments, or battalion command during this time. Officers in these units
have the possibility of greater than average time in developmental positions. Branch detail officers will remain in their
detail branch until after completion of the assignment to the LCM unit.
(3) Cyclic managed units. The majority of the installations and EAD, UEy/TSC CSS units will be managed on a
cyclic manning system. Replacements will be sent to these units and installations periodically to maintain readiness of
the units. Tour lengths and developmental position opportunities can vary. Branch detail officers will remain on
standard branch detail timelines.
d. Deploy. FA 90 officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at
all times. Whether assigned to mobile operating force units with high levels of readiness or fixed site generating force
organizations, all FA 90 officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. FA 90
officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests; or as
individuals to support Joint, coalition and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace
keeping missions. FA 90 branch officers must prepare themselves and their families for this most challenging life cycle
function.
e. Sustain. There are 3 major factors that affect officer career development.
(1) Promotion. Promotions are requirements driven and career field based. FA 90 officers will compete for
promotion within the Operations career field and within their basic branch. Basic branch officers (officers that lose
their FA 90 designation after promotion to LTC) will not be allowed to compete for FA 90 multifunctional commands.
(2) Command. FA 90 officers will continue to be centrally selected for command. FA 90 officer command
opportunities are in the Operations career field. These commands are organized into 4 functional categories: Tactical,
Training and Strategic Support, Institutional, and TRADOC System Manager (at COL level only). Officers have the
option of selecting the category or categories in which they desire to compete for command, while declining
competition in other categories. The result of the command selection process is announced in the Command Selection
List (CSL).
(3) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and promotion

336

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

potential. Starting with CPT, the rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the career field which best
suits the officer’s abilities and interests.
f. Develop. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in
troop units, staff assignments and institutional training assignments. Self- development continues to be an essential
component of officer development. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly furnish assured end-to-end
distribution in support of combined arms, Joint or coalition operations. Development occurs through the Army’s school
system as well, and all FA 90 officers selected for MAJ will complete some form of MEL 4 education. Beginning in
4th quarter FY 2005, all FA 90 MAJs will attend the ILE Common Core and Advanced Operations and Warfighting
Course at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. All officers selected for COL should complete a SSC (MEL 1 education).
g. Separate. The separation process for FA 90 officers remains unchanged.
29–8. Multifunctional Logistician Program Reserve Component officers
a. The FA 90 RC officer plays an important role in the logistics mission, as the RC comprise the majority of units
and personnel in the logistics force structure. The training RC officers receive prior to mobilization is extremely
important in enhancing wartime effectiveness.
b. FA 90 is available to the following RC logistics officers: Transportation (BR88), Ordnance (BR91), Quartermaster (BR92), and Medical Service Corps (MFA70). FA 90 is not available to officers of any other branch. The
designation of FA 90 as an FA does not imply that officers are trained multifunctional logisticians. In order to be
certified as FA 90, officers must meet educational requirements and serve in FA 90 coded positions for specified
amounts of time, based on current grade. Figure 29–2 displays the Multifunctional Logistician Program FA life cycle
model.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

337

Figure 29–2. Functional area 70 life cycle development and utilization (RC)

338

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

c. Professional development of RC officers is divided into the following 4 phases from the grades of CPT to COL.
(1) Phase 1 captain. During this phase, an officer must become proficient in their basic branch. The objective is to
attend a Logistics Officer Advanced Course or Combined Logistics Captains Career Course. If the officer is assigned to
a division or lower organization, then the officer must complete the Support Operations Course (SOC). If the
assignment is to echelons above divisions (EAD), then the officer must complete the Reserve Component Multifunctional Combat Service Support (RCMCSS) Course or ALEDC phase I (resident). Officers assigned to corps support
battalions/groups may attend either course. Officers should serve in an FA 90 coded position for a minimum of 12
months covering at least one annual training period.
(2) Phase 2 major. At the grade of MAJ, focus is on the development of logistical skills and successful completion
of the ILE or completion of the ALEDC or the Logistics Executive Development Course. The LEDC best prepares
officers for multifunctional duties across the spectrum of operations; attendance is very desirable for professional
logisticians regardless of what echelon they serve. Officers who complete CGSC should complete SOC or RCMCSS to
enhance educational requirements. Objectives for this phase are to become proficient as multifunctional logisticians.
Officers should strive to:
(a) Serve a minimum of 12 months (to include an annual training period) in an FA 90 coded position in a
multifunctional logistics support organization (SRC 63 series TOE) in the same positions listed in para 29–3 above.
(b) Pursue self–development opportunities. These opportunities include Army correspondence courses, civilian
education in logistics related fields, participation in logistics professional organizations, certification as a Certified
Professional Logistician and a professional reading program.
(3) Phases 3 and 4 lieutenant colonels and colonels. LTCs and COLs are the refinement stages of an RC officer’s
career. Thereafter, focus is placed on an officer successfully completing LTC or COL level command as well as
serving in key FA 90 positions. Objectives include—
(a) Officers are to complete the CSS pre–command course when selected for LTC or COL level command.
(b) Officers who have attend Senior Service College meet FA 90 educational requirements.
(c) Officers should successfully serve 12 consecutive months in any FA 90 position (to include an annual training
period) and strive to complete SOC or RCMCSS.
d. To apply for designation of FA 90, Army Reserve and ARNG officers should forward applications in accordance
with published command guidance to their State Adjutant General, USA HRC, St. Louis, Full-time Support Management Directorate (FTSMD) or the U.S. Army Reserve Command, as appropriate.
e. To assist boards in determining if an officer is qualified as an FA 90, RC officers may present civilian
employment records to the board for consideration as a substitute for military experience. Board members must look
closely at the civilian position for both similarity and performance.

Part Three
Institutional Support Career Field
Chapter 30
Introduction
Institutional Support career field officers are accomplished leaders and warfighters who excel at determining, justifying, and managing critical Army resources. These dynamic officers constitute a cadre of high performing, committed
officers who are intimately familiar and must ardently apply The Army life cycle model (manning, developing,
educating, sustaining, deploying, stationing, funding, and maintaining readiness) to daily Army processes and procedural operations. Their Warrior Ethos, immersed in Army Values, allows ISCF officers to comprehend, coordinate, and
synchronize the technical and complex nature of running the Army as an organization. The ISCF career field
Coordinator is the Director of The Army Staff, HQDA.
30–1. Unique features of the Institutional Support career field
a. Composition. The Institutional Support career field is distinctly comprised of 7 FAs that include: Human
Resource Management (FA 43), Comptroller (FA 45), Academy Professor, U.S. Military Academy (FA 47), Operations
Research & Systems Analyst (FA 49), Force Management (FA 50), Nuclear Research & Operations (FA52), and
Strategic Plans & Policy (FA 59). Institutional Support career field officers are responsible for: acquisition of and
management of human resources; financial management; professors for the US Military Academy; quantitative analysis
and modeling; doctrine development; providing technical advice and policy recommendations on weapons of mass
destruction; and formulation of regional, military and national strategy and policy.
b. Function. This highly trained set of officers are specialized in FAs related to the following institutional force core
competencies:

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

339

(1) Develop the force. Design the force necessary to support strategic and operational plans.
(2) Sustain the force.
(a) Resource the force by developing programs which execute the policy, and program and budget decisions of the
President and the Secretary of Defense.
(b) Develop policies and programs to access, retain, and promote the morale and welfare of the force.
(3) Support.
(a) Develop analytical methods and models that facilitate the strategic decisionmaking process of the force.
(b) Provide the necessary knowledge and expertise to support nuclear operations and decisions at both the theatre
and strategic level.
(c) Provide the knowledge and expertise necessary to support regional and national strategy and policy
decisionmaking.
(4) Administer the academic programs at the U.S. Military Academy.
30–2. Composition
a. Functional area 43. The Human Resource Management FA (FA 43) provides the Army with a professional
human resource manager focused on projecting requirements; developing capabilities; and planning, programming and
managing Army human resource life cycle functions in support of senior military leadership. As senior career staff
officers, FA 43 officers are responsible for developing, interpreting, integrating and implementing the DOD, Joint, and
Army human resource programs and policies for the military, civilian, retiree, and contractor work force and their
families at all echelons.
b. Functional area 45. The Comptroller (FA 45) FA provides advice and guidance concerning resources (dollars,
manpower and time) to Senior Army Leaders across the tactical, operational, and strategic spectrum. Comptrollers are
primarily responsible for generating revenue, controlling costs, leveraging resources, managerial accounting, and
executing budget programs in concert with Senior Army leader’s resource priorities. Their recommendations ensure the
Army is properly resourced to fight and win the Nation’s wars and successfully execute Operations Other Than War
(OOTW).
c. Functional area 47. Academy Professors, U.S. Military Academy (USMA) (FA 47), are appointed to administer
the academic programs at the USMA and provide daily mentorship to USMA cadets and faculty. In addition to
formulating USMA curriculum, methods of instruction, and academic standards required for graduation, Academy
Professors develop educational tools that assist field commanders to enhance officer technical and tactical
competencies.
d. Functional area 49. The Operations Research & System Analysis (ORSA) (FA 49) FA encompasses the
application of analytic methods to varied and complex strategic, operational and managerial defense issues. ORSA
officers’ rich tactical background enables them to develop important decision–support tools that allow battlefield
commanders to identify optimal use of myriad scarce resources.
e. Functional area 50. The Force Management (FA 50) FA is the capstone process that identifies Army requirements and integrates Doctrine, Organizations, Training, Materiel, Leader development & education, Personnel and
Facilities (DOTMLPF) to establish and field mission–ready organizations. They must fully comprehend organizational
structure, the planning, programming, budgeting and execution system, Total Army Analysis process, and how The
Army Runs. Their efforts are directly related to what, how, where and when combat systems are fielded and how
combat (Operating Force) and institutional (Generating Force) Army units are organized, manned, resourced, and
sustained.
f. Functional area 52. The Nuclear Research and Operations (FA 52) FA requires the expertise and employment
application of nuclear weapons. FA 52 officers must understand the tactical, strategic, social, political, and economic
effects that support a theater commander’s strategic operations. FA 52 encompasses research and development
associated with material acquisition, national nuclear strategy planning and policy formulation, verification and
monitoring.
g. Functional area 59. Strategic Plans and Policy (FA 59) officers provide MACOM, Service, Theatre, and Joint
commanders’ strategic analysis in developing requirements and operational plans. FA 59 officers are experts on
national security and national military strategic issues, and they possess a deep understanding of the international
environment. FA 59 officers specialize in relating national security and national military strategies, and strategic level
plans, policies and concepts to Army force requirements.
30–3. Career options
a. General considerations. The ILE criteria are unique to each FA within this career field. ILE is completion of
CSC plus required FA training. Each FA chapter delineates how its officers are developed. While command opportunity is not afforded ISCF officers, they are expected to excel in their FA, serve in positions of increasing responsibility
supporting senior level decisionmakers within and outside DOD, and seek the initiative.
b. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. All ISCF officers may expect to perform in one 24 to 36 month
branch/FA generalist assignment prior to consideration for COL. These assignments include but are not limited to

340

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

USAREC, ROTC instructor, service school/USMA faculty and staff, or Active Army in RC duty. Generalist assignments are intended to fulfill Army requirements and broaden the Institutional Support career field officer’s perspective.
With the exception of FA 47, all officers in the Institutional Support career field are eligible for assignment to officer
generalist (01A) positions.
c. Joint assignments. ISCF officers should aggressively seek Joint duty. It broadens the knowledge base of individual officers and puts them in position to best use the skills, knowledge, and attributes to assist senior Army and DOD
leaders. The Army perspective that ISCF officers bring to the Joint arena is critical to the health of the Service. The
provisions of Title 10, USC, specify that officers on the ADL may not be appointed to the grade of BG unless they
have completed a full tour of duty in a Joint duty assignment (JDA).

Chapter 31
Human Resource Management Functional Area
31–1. Unique features of the Human Resource Management functional area
a. Unique purpose of Human Resource Management functional area. The Human Resource Management FA (FA
43) provides the Army with a professional human resource manager and leader with a Warrior Ethos who is educated,
trained and repetitively assigned into positions focused on projecting requirements; developing capabilities; and
planning, programming and managing Army human resource life cycle functions in support of senior military
leadership and a Campaign-quality, Joint and Expeditionary Army at War. As senior staff officers, FA 43 officers are
responsible for developing, interpreting, integrating and implementing the DOD, Joint, and Army’s human resource
programs and policies for the military, civilian, retirees, and contractor work force and their families at all echelons.
Functional area 43 is an FA within the Institutional Support career field. The U.S. Army Soldier Support Institute
(SSI), U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) is the proponent for FA 43.
b. Unique functions performed by Human Resource Management functional area. Human Resource Management
officers are the principal coordinators and integrators of activities that assist military commanders and leaders at all
echelons to fulfill their responsibility to military and civilian personnel. FA 43 functions include the common staff
responsibilities and duties found in FM 6–0, Mission Command: Command and Control of Army Forces. They closely
mirror many of the Assistant Chief of Staff G–1/AG (S–1) specific responsibilities also found in FM 6–0. These
responsibilities include manning, personnel services, personnel support, headquarters management, and coordinating
staff responsibility for special and personal staff officers. They serve as primary advisors to commanders on all matters
related to human resources at brigade, division, corps, MACOM, Theater, HQDA, Joint, and DOD levels. The FA 43
officer actively contributes to developing personnel doctrine and directing personnel programs. Functional area 43
officers develop and implement policies that significantly bear on the commitment and job satisfaction of the work
force and their families and serve to build and sustain combat readiness in the Army and DOD. These officers support
the eight military life cycle functions of personnel structure, acquisition, distribution, development, deployment,
compensation, sustainment, and transition.
c. Unique features of work in Human Resource Management functional area. FA 43 assignments require leaders to
undertake full human resource responsibility at all echelons. Human resource management positions are located in
Table of Organization and Equipment (TOE) units at brigade and higher, in Table of Distribution Allowance (TDA)
organizations, on headquarters staffs and in Joint commands. Both AG branch and FA 43 officers serve in division and
above organizations, and each may work for the other depending on the particular position. The linkage between these
officers in performing the human resource management functions is critical and must be mutually supportive to execute
the full range of service and support to commanders, service members, civilians, retirees, families and other service
personnel. Some unique features of work in FA 43 include:
(1) Embedded Human Resource Integrator at brigade (Brigade Combat Team -BCT and Unit of Action- UA) level
as the S1. The BCT and UA is the preeminent operational and tactical structure that the Army will deploy in the Joint
environment. The BCT/UA S1 must be capable of performing all personnel and human resource (HR) functions and
must be well-versed enough to train the Battalion S1s, of which some are basic branch officers specific to that type of
unit. As the Army moves toward a modular deployment of the BCT/UAs as part of the Joint team, the FA 43 MAJ
must be prepared to serve as a Joint Task Force J1.
(2) Implementer of personnel plans, programs and policy (e.g. Deployment Cycle Support Program (DCSP), wellbeing, and family readiness activities).
(3) Strategic planner, coordinator and integrator of Army and Joint HR.
(4) Mobilization planner.
(5) Developer of personnel service support operations in support of contingency operations spanning the fullspectrum of warfare. Oversees execution of PSS operations at the tactical and operational levels.
31–2. Officer characteristics required
FA 43 requires officers with a Warrior Ethos and outstanding adaptive and determined leadership skills at all levels.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

341

They are thoroughly trained to perform human resource management throughout the Army, Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational activities; possess strong Army Values, leader attributes, and leader skills; and fully
understand the key leadership actions that must be taken to ensure success. They must have a thorough understanding
and working knowledge of the common staff and specific Assistant Chief of Staff, G–1/AG (S–1), Personnel,
responsibilities and duties as outlined in FM 6–0, Mission Command: Command and Control of Army Forces.
Furthermore, there are unique functional skills, knowledge, and attributes that may require additional professional
development during an officer’s FA 43 career.
a. Unique skills. The FA 43 officers must—
(1) Possess interpersonal skills necessary to effectively communicate with supported commanders, peers, Soldiers,
other military service members, civilians, family members, and others who provide HR support and services. These
officers must be able to listen, motivate, and lead.
(2) Be able to use well-developed analytical skills to anticipate, forecast, and source HR requirements and apply
better business practices for the supported commander.
(3) Act as strategic partners, change agents, service member champions, and functional experts.
b. Unique knowledge. The FA 43 officers must—
(1) Fully understand the organization, structure, and doctrine of the warfighting Army as it evolves in the 21st
century.
(2) Understand the roles and missions of the other Services and how to support Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational human resource and manpower operations.
(3) Develop and maintain competency in the operation and management of existing and emerging HR systems that
are critical to success on the battlefield.
(4) Remain current on human resource management programs, systems, and techniques in general.
(5) Understand the relationship between human resource management, Unit Status Readiness (USR) reporting and
Strategic Readiness System (SRS) Reporting..
(6) Understand manpower management, funding, staffing, and the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution System (PPBES).
31–3. Critical officer developmental assignments.
a. General. Once an officer has completed all company grade education requirements and is branch experienced,
they may be considered to serve in an FA position. The majority of FA 43 officers will serve their first FA assignments
following designation to FA 43 through the career field Designation Board (CFDB) process.
b. Functional area qualification and development. Active Army FA 43 officers must complete the FA 43 Human
Resource Management Qualification Course and serve a minimum of 24 months in FA 43 coded positions at each
grade to be fully FA qualified. The purpose of HR FA training and development is to provide the Army and Joint
community with an adaptive and Warrior Ethos focused, quality human resource management professional to fully
support commanders, service members, civilians, retirees, and family members. The HRM qualification course is
focused on providing graduate level HR training to newly CFD’d FA43 officers. The course’s focus is 1/3 on strategic
and 2/3 on tactical/operational HRM doctrine; Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs); and HR systems. As
officers progress through their careers, they will be afforded other HR and Army-unique educational opportunities
based on their performance and the needs of the Army.
c. Captain. FA 43 experience as a CPT is not a requirement but can enhance selection during career field
Designation Board (CFDB) consideration. What is required is successful completion of company grade leader development and the quality experience and assignments in their basic branch that ground them in the operational Army and its
doctrine. For those interested in being CFD’d into FA43, experience as company commander or battalion/squadron S1
is desired. Captains interested in FA 43 should seek those developmental assignments listed in figure 31–1 to gain
additional experience. The following list is not all inclusive, but provides some jobs and additional duties that should
be sought by FA 43 officers to enhance their CFDB selection potential for FA43:
(1) Assistant Brigade/Regt/Group/Unit of Action (UA) S1/Adjutant.
(2) Division/Corps Staff Officer.
(3) Secretary of the General Staff (SGS) Officer.
(4) Personnel Programs Officer.
(5) Aide-de-Camp.
(6) Rear Detachment OIC.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

before their initial assignment to an FA 43 position. Brigade/Regiment/Group/BCT/UA S1 Adjutant and Division/UEx
Deputy/Assistant G1 are the primary FA positions for MAJs that provide the principal HR skills and experience needed
for development and further utilization. Most officers will serve their first 24 months as brigade/BCT/UA S1s. Officers
will continue to serve in a variety of human resource management positions following their brigade S1 tour(s). Other
primary FA qualifying jobs are Corps/MACOM HR plans, policy and operation officer, Joint HR/Manpower Staff
officer, Chief MACOM/Corps OPMD or Assistant Corps G1. FA 43 officers should seek an advanced degree in HR or
related fields and other civilian HR training. Officers identified to serve as equal opportunity program managers must
complete the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Course. Some Advanced Civil Schooling (ACS) and Training
With Industry (TWI) positions may be available to a few FA 43 majors each year. FA qualified officers may serve as a
HR instructor at a Service School or CTC S1/CSS observer/controller to carry out the important task of developing
future HR professionals. FA 43 officers compete only against other officers in the Institutional Support career field for
promotion to LTC. While this list is not all inclusive, some specific jobs to be sought by FA 43 officers include

(f) Personnel Staff Officer.
(g) Service School/DEOMI HR Instructor/Staff/faculty Officer.
(h) CTC S1 Observer/Controller.
e. Lieutenant colonel. LTCs are generally assigned to senior staff positions, where they can fully use their human
resource expertise. To become fully FA qualified, FA 43 LTCs will serve a minimum of 24 months in FA qualifying
positions. To develop their HR depth and breadth in experience, they should strive for FA qualification leadership and
responsibility positions as, Deputy/Assistant UEy/Corps G1’s, Assistant MACOM G1s, Joint HR/Manpower (Task
Force) C1/J1’s or Deputy C1/J1’s, Army G1 Branch/Division Chiefs, and HR Command Branch/Division Chiefs, EO
Program Managers, and Chief, MACOM/Corps HR Plans, Policy, Operations, Strength Management, or OPMD
positions. Other human resource management staff officer positions at field operating agencies (FOA), MACOM staffs,
Army staff, Joint commands and in DOD are also considered key developmental jobs. Officers identified to serve as
equal opportunity program managers must complete the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Course. Functional
area qualified officers may instruct at a Service School with the important task of developing future HR professionals.
LTCs should seek to complete an advanced degree in HR or related fields and complete the Senior Service College in
residence or by correspondence if selected. Functional area 43 officers compete only against other officers in the
Institutional Support career field for promotion to COL. Functional area 43 developmental and utilization assignments
for LTCs are—
(1) Deputy/Assistant Corps/ (UEx) G1.
(2) Deputy/Assistant MACOM/ (UEy) G1.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

343

(h) TRADOC EO Training Proponent Branch Chief.
f. Colonel. Functional area 43 COLs will serve as FA qualified senior practitioners in leadership and responsibility
positions on MACOM/HQDA/HR Command/DOD and Joint staffs. Some recommended senior HR assignments are—
(1) MACOM G1.
(2) UEy Deputy G1.
(3) Deputy/Asst MACOM G1.
(4) Colonel (O6) level Chief of Staff.
(5) Colonel (O6) Level Staff Director.
(6) Army G1/HR Command/DOD Staff Officer.
(7) MACOM/(UEy) Staff Officer.
(8) Joint HR/Manpower Staff Officer (C1/J1).
(9) Executive Officer to a Flag Officer.
(10) Personnel Staff Officer.
g. Officer generalist assignments. FA 43 officers should not expect to serve in officer generalist assignments. These
billets, such as ROTC and recruiting, are not identified with a specific branch or FA. Some FA 43 officers may be
expected to complete one generalist assignment prior to selection for COL if extenuating circumstances exist.
h. Joint assignments. FA 43 officers are highly encouraged to seek Joint assignments. In these positions, they will
develop the "...skills to coordinate timely and effective manpower and personnel support for Joint force commanders in
order to enhance the readiness and operational capabilities of the total force." (Joint Pub 1–0) Most, if not all, future
conflicts will be Joint oriented, multicomponent, interagency, and multinational. It is imperative that HR officers are
proficient in Joint HR/ manpower (J1/C1) operations.
31–4. Assignment sequencing, preferences, and precedence.
a. Assignment sequencing. Assignment sequencing in a FA is not rigid. The spectrum of possible assignments is
large and provides breadth, as well as depth, in the HR field. These assignments can be characterized as highly
responsible, important, and requiring mature, skilled, and well-grounded officers.
b. Preferences. FA 43 has diverse opportunities that allow for numerous career development paths. The professional
development goal of FA 43 officers is to ensure they are trained and experienced in developing, interpreting,
integrating, coordinating, and implementing the Army’s human resource management programs and policies at all
echelons to include DOD, Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational. Assignments in FA 43 are made to
develop the officer’s ability to achieve that goal. Requests for assignments that do not contribute to achieving that goal
should be limited to Joint domicile, exceptional family members, compassionate circumstances, or other extenuating
considerations.
c. Precedence. Assignment to and utilization in developmental FA assignments will have precedence, although there
is flexibility on the sequence. Some FA 43 billets will require additional training. Officers assigned to those jobs
should complete the required courses prior to reporting to their duty assignments.
31–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. General. Most assignments for FA 43 officers are 24 to 36 months in length. OCONUS locations will continue to
require specific tour lengths. As the force stabilization concept continues to develop, tour lengths may extend.
b. Key functional area 43 qualification assignments. Completion of applicable qualification courses as outlined in
paragraph 31–3.a and successful completion of 24 months in FA 43 coded positions at each grade are required for
active component FA qualification at the field grade level. Before assignment to a Joint command or at DOD, FA 43
officers will have successfully completed a previous FA 43 assignment and attended requisite training.
c. FA 43 life cycle. Figure 31–1 depicts an active component FA 43 life cycle and lists developmental and utilization
assignments within the FA.

344

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

345

31–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory.
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for FA 43 officers. In order to do this, the field grade
inventory must be optimized to fulfill FA requirements. This provides field grade officers sufficient time for FA
qualification prior to promotion to LTC and COL.
b. Officer Personnel Management System implementation. The number of authorized FA 43 authorizations, by
grade, will vary as force structure decisions are made and implemented. Officers desiring more information on current
authorizations or inventory should contact either the FA 43 personnel proponency office or the FA 43 assignments
officer at DA HRC OPMD.
31–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Human Resource Management
a. Structure. FA 43 officers serve at all echelons worldwide. Human Resource Management FA officer positions are
found at brigade (REGT/Group/BCT/UA), division (UEx), Corps (UEy), and echelons above corps. In addition to TOE
organizations, FA43 positions are also found throughout the AUGTDA and TDA Army, within DOD and Joint
commands.
b. Acquire. The FA 43 officer population is selected and designated following selection by the career field
Designation Board (CFDB) that is currently conducted immediately following the MAJ’s promotion board. The board
designates officers based on several factors including, but not limited to, the needs of the Army, civilian education,
relevant experience, manner of performance, and personal preference. FA 43 experience as a CPT is not a requirement
but can enhance selection during CFDB consideration. For officers considering FA 43 as an FA, experience as
company commander or battalion/squadron S1 is desired. They should seek those developmental assignments listed in
figure 31–1 to gain additional experience. They should have or consider earning a graduate degree in an appropriate
field such as human resource management, public administration, or personnel management. career field Designation
(CFD) preferences will generally be submitted via the HRC Knowledge Center on the AKO Web site at http://
www.us.army.mil.
c. Distribute. The Officer Personnel Management Directorate (OPMD), HRC, manages all FA 43 officer assignments. The FA 43 assignment’s officer assigned to the Functional Area Division manages MAJs and LTCs assignments. The Institutional Support career field assignment’s manager assigned to Colonels’ Division manages FA 43
COLs. Below is the proposed officer assignments guidance as the Army moves towards the Future Force.
(1) Stabilized installation assignments. The Functional Area Division only assigns officers in the grade of MAJ;
thus, the Unit Focused Stabilization Program which assigns company grade officers to stabilized installations for up to
7 years does not affect the distribution of designated FA officers.
(2) Life cycle managed units. Officers at all levels are subject to assignment in life cycle managed units (generally
brigade combat teams, Stryker brigades, or future units of action). Generally, officers assigned to home–station life
cycle units will be initial entry officers from Officers Basic Course. These officers will be assigned to an installation
for approximately 7 years. Field grade officers will be assigned to home station installations for a period of time to
complete their FA qualification. The goal for field grade officers is to remain with a unit during its entire life cycle.
(3) Cyclic managed units. The majority of the installations and echelons above division combat service support units
will be managed on a cyclic manning system. Replacements will be sent to these units and installations periodically to
maintain readiness of the units. Tour lengths and developmental positions opportunities can vary.
d. Deploy. Functional area 43 officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Functional area 43 officers will deploy with their units to deter potential adversaries and to
protect national interests; or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than war such as
humanitarian and peace keeping missions. Functional area 43 officers must prepare themselves and their families for
this most challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustain. Officers designated into the Institutional Support career field will compete within the Institutional
Support career field for promotion to LTC and COL.
f. Develop. Functional area 43 incorporates a professional officer development career plan offering maximum
diversity for schooling, assignment and self–development. As FA 43 officers progress through their careers, in addition
to advanced military and civilian schooling/training opportunities, they are developed through operational utilization
assignments that prepare them for positions of increased responsibility.
(1) Training. Functional area 43 institutional training includes the following elements:
(a) Intermediate level education common core curriculum. Upon implementation of the ILE program, FA 43 officers
will attend the 12–week common core course in residence at a course location site. Upon completion of the common
core curriculum, officers are Intermediate Staff College (ISC) graduates and credentialed with Joint Professional
Military Education (JPME) 1 qualification. Full ILE credit is awarded when the officer has completed the common
core and the FA 43 qualification course attended before or after ILE common core. Full ILE credit is required prior to
promotion to LTC. Officers will primarily attend the course location campus sites in a TDY and return status; some

346

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

officers may attend in a TDY en route status. Temporary duty travel and applicable per diem costs will be charged to
the MACOM’s Military Training Specific Allotment (MTSA) account for those officers attending TDY en route.
(b) Human Resources Management Qualification Course. All FA 43 officers will attend the Human Resources
Management Qualification Course before or after attendance at the ILE common core course location site in order to be
awarded full ILE credit.
1. The 1999–2003 two–week course was designed to meet the needs of a transitioning population at all grades into
FA 43.
2. The current 2–week resident course, with a distance learning prep phase, focuses on training for entry–level FA
43s (all components). The course focus is on tactical/operational level human resource training. It provides human
resource training that supports— efficiently and effectively executing human resource duties, roles, and responsibilities;
educating entry–level human resource providers on personnel policies, programs, processes, and plans; training FA 43s
on all levels of human resource systems and management tools; inspiring the FA 43 officer to be the human resource
subject matter expert; and supporting the commander of the future modular force with a Joint human resource
expeditionary mindset. A working knowledge of the above is key to the success of the brigade/regiment/BCT/UA S1 as
the power of increased reach back empowers the ground commander’s mission. In addition to gaining a foundation for
all tasks required in the entry–level assignments, the FA 43 will prepare the human resource officer to assume strategic
assignments, as well as Joint assignments.
3. The current course location is at HRC–Alexandria, VA. The future 8–week resident course and location will be at
the U.S. Army Soldier Support Institute, Fort Jackson, SC. For information on the latest changes to the qualification
training or other FA 43 issues, go to www.army.mil/fa43.
(2) Self–development. In addition to seeking an advanced degree in human resource or related fields, FA 43 officers
should continue their self–development by joining professional human resource organizations, self–study, and completing correspondence or distance learning courses. All should strive to become certified human resource professionals.
g. Transition (separate). The officer transition process remains unchanged (see AR 600–8–24).
31–8. Human Resources Management Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. The RC describes both the USAR and ARNG and, unless otherwise indicated,
references to the RC are applicable to both. Human Resources Management officers serve the same roles as their
Active Army counterparts. The unique circumstances within the RC pose a challenge for professional development.
Reserve Component officers are expected to follow Active Army officer development patterns as closely as possible,
except that RC officers have, in some cases, increased windows to complete mandatory education requirements (see
chap 7 for RC officer development).
b. Reserve Component officer qualification and development. The RC Human Resource Management officers can
expect assignments that are similar to their Active Army counterparts. The exception is that these assignments will also
include those separate RC human resource management, administrative, and operational reporting requirements unique
to the ARNG and USAR (see fig 31–2). The success of an RC officer is not measured by the length of service in any 1
component or control group, but by the officer’s breadth of experience, duty performance and adherence to the
requirements described herein. Every attempt will be made to assign RC Human Resource Management officers to FA
43 or branch/FA generalist positions. Unlike their Active Army counterparts, geographic constraints limit the ability of
RC officers to stay in FA 43 positions throughout their career. When barriers such as this deny the opportunity to
successfully participate in the USAR, officers are encouraged to seek qualification and utilization in another FA.
Reserve Component qualification standards are as follows:
(1) Lieutenant qualification. Not applicable.
(2) Captain qualification.
(a) As with the Active Army, FA 43 experience as a CPT is not a requirement. What is required is successful
completion of company grade leader development and the quality experience and assignments in their basic branch that
ground them in the operational Army and its doctrine. For those interested in becoming a FA 43 officer, experience as
company commander or battalion/squadron S1 is desired. CPTs interested in FA 43 should seek those developmental
assignments listed in figure 31–2 to gain additional experience. The following list is not all inclusive, but provides
some jobs and additional duties that should be sought by FA 43 officers to enhance their potential for FA 43:
(b) Complete the current CCC and Combined Arms and Services Staff School (CAS3) or Combined Training
Exercise (CTX).
(3) Major qualification.
(a) Serve in an FA 43 developmental or utilization position for 12 months.
(b) Complete the Human Resources Management Qualification Course.
(c) Complete 50 percent of the current Command and General Staff Officer Course (CGSOC) or ILE common core
curriculum. Reserve Component officers can attend The Army School System (TASS) classrooms located in the
CONUS and OCONUS.
(4) Lieutenant colonel qualification.
(a) Serve in at least one FA 43 developmental or utilization position for 12 months.

Chapter 32
Comptroller Functional Area
The Army is building capability for both current and future forces, reorganizing Army forces into modular, brigadebased unit designs in order to enable rapid packaging and responsive, sustained employment. The emerging designs of
the Units of Employment and Units of Action (UA) have precipitated the requirement to adjust the approved Financial
Management Redesign (FMR) Force Design Update (FDU) 03–1 concept and design to support the Army’s evolving
modular brigade-based Army. Therefore, the intent of this chapter is to address both current and future units, positions
and job titles.
32–1. Unique features of Comptroller functional area
a. Unique purpose of Comptroller functional area. Comptroller (FA 45) is an FA within the Institutional Support
career field where trained and experienced officers respond to the resource management requirements of the full
spectrum Army of the 21st century. Functional area 45 officers provide commanders with the expertise and guidance
on resource planning, programming, budgeting and execution; accounting; cost analysis; manpower documentation and
management; management practices; review and analysis; and decision on the use of resources. Comptrollers are the
commanders’ principal advisor on resource management. The Comptroller proponency principal responsibilities for
personnel proponency as well as oversight, integration, and requirements generation for Comptroller Doctrine, Organizations, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) have transferred from the
ASA–FM&C Comptroller Proponency Office, to the U.S. Army Finance School (USAFIS), U.S. Army Soldier Support
Institute (USASSI), U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (USATRADOC). The ASA(FM&C) Comptroller
Proponency Office will retain responsibilities for policy, general oversight and provide guidance for financial management impacting FA 45 officers. Additionally, the ASA(FM&C) Comptroller Proponency Office will manage, in
coordination with the USAFIS, the ACC, PRMC, Professional Military Comptroller School (PMCS), ACP, TWI
program, and the Army OMB developmental assignment with input and advise from the USAFIS.
b. Unique functions performed by Comptroller functional area. Ensure commanders at the tactical, operational,
strategic, and Joint level have the resources necessary to conduct sustained operations throughout the entire Military
Decisionmaking Process (MDMP). At all levels, the FA 45 officer serves as the commander’s "honest broker" and
provides staff input and recommendations on the allocation and limitation of resources. FA 45 officers perform a
myriad of key resource management functions: issuing instructions for developing and preparing the program and
budget; providing resource recommendations to leaders and managers to assist in mission accomplishment; monitoring
execution of the program and budget at all echelons of resource management; developing performance factors;
analyzing capabilities based on available funds and recommending appropriate funding to implement approved programs; exercising staff supervision and control of accounting functions; performing cost and economic analysis;
evaluating organizational structure and functional responsibilities as well as conducting work analysis and studies of
organizational problems; providing for manpower management and documentation of civilian work force and military
structure; coordinating review and analysis presentations and making recommendations; and administering internal
controls.
c. Unique features of work in Comptroller functional area. The cornerstone of work in the Comptroller FA is the
effective and efficient stewardship of resources. This stewardship is essential in ensuring the Army can accomplish its
core competencies. FA 45 officers serve as the primary staff officer for resource management. They plan, develop,
justify, analyze, decide on the use of funds, and execute programs and budgets. They also make recommendations to
the commander on matters pertaining to programming and budgeting, accounting, cost analysis, manpower documentation and management, management practices, and review and analysis.
32–2. Officer characteristics required
The Comptroller FA requires officers who are skilled in leadership at all levels; who are experienced in the Operational
Army and its doctrine, tactics, techniques and procedures; who possess strong Army Values and embody the Warrior
Ethos, leader attributes and leader skills; and who fully understand the key leadership actions that must be taken to
assure success. Additionally, there are FA unique skills, knowledge and attributes that require professional
development.
a. Unique skills. FA 45 officers must have a warfighter’s ethos and be capable of serving in operational assignments. In addition, they:
(1) Routinely serve in staff positions where guidance is minimal and close interaction with senior level decisionmakers is routine.
(2) Apply highly technical resource management concepts to more generalized military unique issues.
(3) Are well versed in information technology and automated financial management systems and have the ability to
clearly articulate this technical expertise.

350

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(4) Are adept at organizing workload, assigning tasks and mentoring civilian and military subordinates.
(5) Are able to anticipate and quickly react to change that is sensitive to political and legislative considerations.
(6) Possess the ability to translate technical data into useable information and staff recommendations.
(7) Are creative in resolving complex financial management impasses.
b. Unique knowledge. Comptroller FA officers must maintain a knowledge base of the DOD military resource
management process, including manpower management. They must understand the laws, regulations and other guidance governing resource management. They also:
(1) Possess the technical expertise and understanding of automation technology and related financial management
systems.
(2) Remain current on developments in the civilian community in general and Comptroller civilian career program
(CP 11) specifically.
(3) Understand how to influence the funding cycle from Congress to local program budget advisory council (PBAC)
at installations.
(4) Stay attuned to economic trend indicators to facilitate anticipation of their impacts.
c. Unique attributes. FA 45 officers are warfighters who possess the highest standards of discretion, judgment,
integrity and professional ethics.
32–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
Officers submit an FA preference via the HRC Interactive Assignment Module (IAM) at the 5th and 6th years of
service. The IAM enables branch managers and proponents to identify officers with the skills and knowledge desired
for FAs. Officers are selected into FA 45 based on the needs of the Army, officer IAM preference selection, and
civilian education. FA 45 officers are considered for an initial Comptroller assignment after they have successfully
completed their company grade quality experience assignments in their basic branch.
a. Functional area qualification and development. Developmental qualifications and opportunities are listed below
by grade.
(1) Lieutenant. Not applicable.
(2) Captain. Comptroller FA experience as a CPT is not a requirement for promotion to MAJ, but obtaining critical
skills, knowledge, and experience at this level could enhance early designation to the Institutional Support career field.
CPTs have the opportunity to compete for advanced civil schooling through the Army Comptrollership Program and
other qualifying programs. If an officer is accepted in these Comptroller qualifying programs, the officer is automatically career field designated into Institutional Support career field.
(a) CPTs must successfully complete their basic branch company grade leader development and quality experience
assignments that are grounded in the Operational Army and its doctrine prior to selection to Comptroller assignments.
There are no specific FA experience requirements for FA 45 CPTs. However, a successful 12 month assignment in an
FA 45 position supports early accession or designation into the Institutional Support career field as an FA 45 officer by
the Career Field Designation Board. Early accession into FA 45 does not guarantee promotion; officer performance
remains the key indicator for future potential.
(b) There are a variety of FA 45 CPT positions at various levels. For FA developmental assignments, an FA 45 CPT
may be assigned to one or more of the following positions:
1. Budget officer.
2. Budget analyst.
3. Program analyst.
4. Management analyst.
5. Resource Management Systems officer.
6. Separate brigade comptroller.
7. Deputy comptroller.
8. Budget officer, UEy.
9. Resource Management officer.
10. Resource Management instructor.
(3) Major. After selection for promotion to MAJ, a Career Field Designation Board will designate those officers not
previously accessed into 1 of the 4 OPMS career fields. Comptroller FA 45 officers are part of the Institutional Support
career field and will serve in FA 45 assignments. All Comptroller officers will complete the common core course ILE
and FA 45 ILE. Also, MAJs have the opportunity to compete for advanced civil schooling through the Army
Comptrollership Program and other qualifying programs. Functional area 45 MAJs are encouraged to complete
graduate level education. In addition, FA 45 MAJs will have the opportunity to compete for Training With Industry
and various fellowship programs. Functional area 45 MAJs will compete only against other MAJs within the Institutional Support career field for promotion to LTC. To meet the FA 45 skills, knowledge, attributes, and experience
required for MAJ, an FA 45 officer must successfully meet the following criteria:
(a) Complete common core ILE (MEL 4/JPME I) and FA 45 ILE.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

351

(b) Officers who were career field designated FA 45 prior to the implementation of ILE must obtain MEL 4/JPME I
either resident or non–resident and attend a minimum of 80 hours of FA 45 additional training listed in figure 32–1.
(c) Successfully serve 24 months as a MAJ in FA 45 assignments.
(d) Obtaining the Certified Defense Financial Manager accreditation is highly encouraged, but not required for
promotion.

14. Comptroller proponency officer.
(4) Lieutenant colonel. LTCs are generally assigned to UEx, UEy, and other senior staff positions where their
knowledge of the Army and comptroller expertise is best utilized. In addition, FA 45 LTCs will have the opportunity to
compete for Training With Industry and various fellowship programs. Functional area 45 LTCs will compete only
against other LTCs in the Institutional Support career field for promotion to COL. To meet the FA 45 skills,
knowledge, attributes, and experience required for LTC, an FA 45 officer must successfully meet the following criteria:
(a) Serve 48 cumulative months as a field grade officer in FA 45 assignments.

16. Military assistant/executive officer.
17. Deputy Director for Cost Analysis.
18. Chief, Financial Management officer
19. Budget officer
20. Director, DFAS Field Site
b. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. CPTs and above can serve in branch/FA generalist assignments.
These billets are not identified with a specific branch or FA, but are important to the Army. Many of the branch/FA
generalist positions are within the USAREC, ROTC, USMA faculty and staff, Inspector General, and RC.
c. Joint assignments. Comptroller FA positions are on the Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL). In order to be
considered for selection to JSO, an officer must have completed JPME II and a full Joint Duty Assignment (JDA), or
with a waiver, must have completed 2 full JDAs. Officers will be considered for the Joint Specialty Officer (JSO)
(Skill Identifier 3L), in accordance with the guidelines of the HQDA Selection Designation Board. Comptroller officers
are not generally considered for Joint duty assignments until selected for MAJ. Even though Joint experience is
important to the Army and to individual officers for advancement into senior leadership positions, not all Comptroller
officers will receive Joint assignments. This will not preclude selection to the grade of COL.
d. Other assignments. Some FA 45 officers will have opportunities to serve in assignments in the business sector
and state governments. Training With Industry (TWI) is a unique opportunity for the Army Comptroller FA officers to
work in the financial management of robust businesses to learn the best business practices for possible implementation
within the Army. Additionally, some FA 45 officers will have the opportunity to serve in assignments outside of the
FA including White House Fellowships, Congressional Fellowships, Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
developmental assignment, and RAND Arroyo Fellowships.
32–4. Preferences, precedence, and assignments
The assignment sequencing in the Comptroller FA is not as rigid as that of a basic branch. However, the professional
development of FA 45 officers has certain requirements to ensure all of the Army’s Comptroller officers are well
grounded in operations. Officers will receive their initial FA training through designated Comptroller training
programs.
a. Preferences. The Comptroller FA has diverse opportunities that allow for numerous career development paths.
The goal of the professional development of FA 45 officers is to produce and to sustain highly qualified tactically and
technically proficient officers who are able to lead, to think and to leverage existing and future technology in
performing resource management functions. Assignments in the Comptroller FA will be made to develop the officer’s
ability to achieve that goal. Requests from officers for assignments that do not contribute directly to this goal must be
fully justified.
b. Precedence. Assignment to qualifying FA positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility on the
sequence of assignments. Some Comptroller FA billets will be designated as requiring advanced education; military,
civilian, or both. Officers assigned to these positions must complete the required courses prior to reporting to their duty
assignments.
c. Assignments. Functional area 45s are highly encouraged to seek assignments in developmental positions in TOE
organizations. They serve in a variety of positions at the tactical, operational, strategic, and Joint staff levels. The
positions and assignments for each grade serving at these various levels will serve as building blocks for successful
performance at the next higher grade. Examples are listed below—

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(3) Lieutenant colonel. Division Comptroller, DRM; Chief, Program/Budget Officer — UEy, MACOM, DA, or
Joint Staff, Chief, Resource Management, Comptroller
(4) Colonel. UEy Comptroller/G–8, DCSRM MACOM/Installation, Staff Officer Joint/DOD/HQDA/OSD Staff; or
Director within ASA (FM&C)
32–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
Most CONUS assignments for Comptroller FA officers will be 24 to 36 months in length. Overseas locations and Joint
assignments will continue to require specific tour lengths. Officers desiring additional information on assignments
should contact the HRC Comptroller assignments officer or the Comptroller proponency officer in the office of the
U.S. Army Finance School.
a. Key Comptroller career enhancing positions. Successful completion of Comptroller assignments as well as
applicable level courses, education, and certification as outlined in paragraph 32–3 enables the officer to obtain the
proper level of required skills, knowledge, and attributes. Before consideration for assignment to a Joint command or at
DOD, FA 45 officers will have successfully completed a previous Comptroller FA assignment and attended requisite
training.
b. Comptroller functional area life cycle. Figure 32–1 depicts a Comptroller FA life cycle with FA qualifying
positions. Additionally, it identifies developmental assignments within the FA.

32–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
The Comptroller FA goal is to maintain a healthy and viable career path for FA 45 officers. To accomplish this, the FA
45 population must be closely managed to provide the required training and education to prepare officers for increased
responsibilities and promotion.
32–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Comptroller
a. Structure. Comptroller officers serve at all echelons worldwide. Functional area 45 positions exist in Army
division and corps units, headquarters staffs, Joint commands, DOD multinational and national agencies. The majority
of Comptroller related billets will be on MACOM, HQDA and Joint staffs.
b. Acquire. Commissioned officers comprising a particular year group are designated into the FA between their 5th
and 6th years of service. The criteria for selecting an officer into FA 45 include type of civilian undergraduate degree,
grade point average, personal preference and needs of the Army. Functional area 45 CPTs, who request Advanced Civil
Schooling (ACS) through the Army Comptrollership Program (ACP), should understand that their acceptance in ACP/
ACS will be supportive of their designation into the Institutional Support career field when considered by the career
field designation board (CFDB).
c. Distribute. After designation into the Institutional Support career field, the Functional Area Management and
Development Division (FAMDD), Officer Personnel Management Directorate (OPMD), at HRC will manage all
Comptroller officer assignments. Field grade officers will be assigned to home station installations for a period of time
to obtain necessary skills, knowledge, attributes and experience. The goal for field grade officers is to maintain a
minimum of 24 months time on station with a goal of 36 months.
d. Deploy. Comptroller FA officers must have a warfighter’s ethos and remain personally and professionally
prepared to serve in operational assignments deployed worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to TOE units or TDA
organizations, all FA 45 officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict.
Comptrollers may deploy with their units or as individuals to support tasking for Joint and multinational operations.
e. Sustain. Officers designated into the Institutional Support career field will compete only within their career field
for promotion to LTC and COL. FA 45 MAJs, LTCs, and COLs will compete for qualifying and developmental
assignments as well as military and civil schooling opportunities.
f. Develop. Functional area 45 incorporates a professional officer development career plan offering maximum
diversity for schooling and assignment. There are many developmental opportunities for Comptroller officers as they
progress through their careers. In addition to advanced military schooling opportunities, they are eligible for Advanced
Civil Schooling through the Army Comptrollership Program or other accredited universities that confer a MBA. They
are also eligible to compete for Training With Industry (TWI) and various fellowship programs. Additionally, all
officers selected to MAJ will complete ILE. FA 45 MAJs will attend the 12–week common core course in residence at
a Course Location (CL) site. At a CL site, officers are Intermediate Staff College (ISC) graduates and credentialed
Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) 1 qualification. Full ILE credit is awarded when the officer has
completed the common core and FA 45 ILE course. FA 45 ILE attendance before or after common core ILE is
acceptable. Full ILE credit is required prior to promotion to LTC. Reserve Component officers can attend The Army
School System (TASS) classrooms located in CONUS and OCONUS CL sites.
g. Separate. Functional area 45 officers will transition from the Army to civilian status in the same manner as all
other officers.
32–8. Comptroller Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. Reserve Component ARNG and USAR Comptroller officers play an important role
in the Comptroller mission of America’s Army. The effectiveness of RC FA 45 officers is dependent upon their
assignments, quality of training, and education. For AGR FA 45 officers, their development objectives and qualifications basically parallel those of the Active Army. Other RC officers’ TPU, IRR, individual mobilization augmentee
career progression is often constrained by the geographical dispersion of units. Often there are insufficient Comptroller
FA positions in a geographic area to accommodate all FA 45 officers. If geographic constraints are such that
assignment to FA 45 positions are not possible, RC officers are encouraged to seek qualification and development
opportunities in another branch or FA required in the region. Officers in the IRR may find assignments in reinforcement troop units (RTU), IMA positions in Active Army organizations, installations or DA agencies, and tours of Active
Duty for Special Work (ADSW) or annual training. Assignments in the IRR can also be used for completing
Professional Military Education (PME). Junior officers must develop a strong foundation through assignments in their
basic branches before specializing in their FA (see chap 7).
b. Functional area qualification and development opportunities. Reserve Component FA 45 officers perform the
same general functions as their active duty counterparts and most provisions of paragraphs 32–1 to 32–7 apply to the
RC FA 45 officers.
(1) Award of FA 45 designation for RC officers. Regional Readiness Commanders (USAR) and National Guard

356

Professor positions while in the grade of MAJ must focus on earning a Ph.D.
(3) Lieutenant colonel. LTCs are generally assigned within their respective organizations to significant academic,
administrative and leadership positions such as program directors, division chiefs, and directors of centers of excellence. LTCs with a Ph.D. are considered eligible to compete for promotion to COL.
(4) Colonel. COLs are generally assigned within their respective organizations to significant academic, administrative and leadership positions such as program directors, division chiefs, directors of centers of excellence, and deputy
heads (in academic departments not authorized 47A deputy head positions).
b. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. FA 47 officers do not serve in branch/FA generalist assignments.
c. Joint assignments. FA 47 officers do not serve in Joint assignments.
33–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. FA 47 assignments are at the U.S. Military Academy and U.S. Military Academy Preparatory
School.
b. Precedence. Developmental assignments will have precedence within an academic hierarchy.
33–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
Duration of stabilized faculty assignment is through mandatory retirement for Academy Professors (28 years for LTCs
and 30 years for COLs) and for Professors, USMA (age 64).
33–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a faculty, sensitive to both Army needs and academic standards, that supports the
USMA mission to provide the Army with commissioned leaders of character.
b. OPMS implementation. Officers desiring more information on current authorizations or inventory, by grade,
should contact either the FA 47 personnel proponent or the FA 47 assignment officer at AHRC.
33–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Academy Professor
a. Structure. FA 47 positions exist only at the U.S. Military Academy and U.S. Military Academy Preparatory
School.
b. Acquire. USMA–stabilized faculty positions are normally filled through a USMA faculty search committee
process. FA 47 vacancies are advertised in the Army Times newspaper (worldwide), on various computer bulletin
boards, and computer Web sites to include the USMA Adjutant General Web site (http://www.usma.edu/adjutantgeneral). The advertisement will include specific criteria that an officer must meet to be considered for appointment. Applications are forwarded to a selection committee composed of both stabilized and rotating faculty members,
civilian faculty and, in some cases, representatives appointed by HQDA. The committee considers all applicants;
evaluating the breadth of the applicant’s military experience, depth achieved in military specialties and evidence of
leadership. A list of the top qualified applicants is forwarded to the Dean of the Academic Board, to the Superintendent, and to the Academic Board. The Academic Board will make a final recommendation. Professor, USMA (AOC
47A) appointments require presidential nomination and congressional approval. HQDA has approval authority for
Academy Professors (AOC 47*).
c. Distribute. After designation into FA 47, officers are managed by the Functional Area Division (FAD), Officer
Personnel Management Directorate, at AHRC.
d. Deploy. FA 47 officers are stabilized and normally not considered for worldwide deployment.
e. Sustain. FA 47 officers will compete within their career field for promotion to LTC and COL.
f. Develop. Orderly progression for USMA stabilized faculty includes completing military schooling; training with
military units; completing a Ph.D. not later than 3 years following assignment to USMA faculty as an Academy
Professor; teaching; developing and implementing courses, programs and curricula; assessment; conducting research
and participating in scholarly activities; and conducting outreach activities in support of the Army. Conducting research
and participating in scholarly activities provide continued growth and development opportunities within the officer’s
selected academic discipline. Outreach activities in support of the Army provide continued military growth and
professional development opportunities within the officer’s selected academic discipline. FA 47 officers are not
considered for selection by Army competitive boards for attendance at Senior Service College (SSC). The Dean of the
Academic Board has developed a military schooling program that provides SSC opportunities for USMA stabilized
faculty. USMA stabilized faculty perform outreach service, to include service with Army laboratories and consultation
with HQDA and DOD agencies, related to their academic and military expertise and special duty with units in the
Army. USMA stabilized faculty members normally remain on the USMA faculty until retirement and follow a career
pattern that is necessarily directed toward academics, teaching and research. These activities are necessary to ensure
that the stabilized faculty continues to develop mastery of their academic disciplines and possesses the latest, as well as
emerging, techniques and information.
g. Separate. Upon retirement, any professor, USMA (47A) of the U.S. Military Academy whose grade is below BG,

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

361

and whose service has been long and distinguished, may, at the discretion of the President, be retired in the grade of
BG. Academy Professors (FA 47*) officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.

Chapter 34
Operations Research/Systems Analysis Functional Area 49
34–1. Unique features of the Operations Research/Systems Analysis functional area
a. Purpose. The ORSA FA provides uniquely skilled officers–problem solvers–who produce the analysis and logical
reasoning necessary to inform and underpin critical decisions by leaders and managers at all levels of DOD. These
officers recommend potential solutions for complex strategic, operational, tactical, and business issues. ORSAs are an
integral part of the Army and Joint leaderships’ decisionmaking processes to organize, man, train, equip, sustain and
resource transformation from the current to the Future Force and conduct analysis in support of the Global War on
Terrorism and other war fighting operations.
b. Management. FA 49 is managed within the Institutional Support career field (ISCF). The FA 49 Proponent Office
resides in the Program Analysis and Evaluation Directorate, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G–8, HQDA.
c. Functions. The FA 49 officer uses knowledge–based tools and advanced technology to add value to leadership
decisions in a constantly changing global environment. ORSAs introduce quantitative and qualitative analysis to the
military’s decisionmaking processes by developing and applying probability models, statistical inference, simulations,
optimization and economic models. The ORSA FA encompasses diverse disciplines that include personnel management, doctrine and force development, training management, system testing, system acquisition, decision analysis and
resource management, as well as tactical, operational and strategic planning from Unit of Employment through
combatant command, and from MACOM through the highest levels of the DOD.
d. Unique features of ORSA work. The FA49 officer integrates military knowledge and experience with the scientific
and managerial fields. They serve as subject matter experts in designing forces, allocating resources, analyzing effects,
performing course of action and trade–off analysis, and they effectively communicate potential solutions to complex
problems to decisionmakers. The ORSA officer will typically serve in one of several general assignments as:
(1) An analyst on an Army, Joint or defense agency staff.
(2) An analyst in an organization that provides the analytical underpinning for fielding, equipping, manning, training
and operations of military forces. Such organizations include Center for Army Analysis (CAA), TRADOC Analysis
Command (TRAC), the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), branch battle labs and combat development
organizations.
(3) An instructor teaching ORSA and/or mathematics courses at the US Military Academy (USMA), Army Logistics
Management College (ALMC), Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), or Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT).
(4) A combat analyst on a UEx, UEy, or equivalent Joint headquarters staff.
34–2. Officer characteristics required
The ORSA FA requires officers with the potential to lead at all levels, who understand military operations, and who
possess strong Army Values, a Warrior Ethos, and leader attributes and skills described in FM 22–100. The ORSA FA
also requires officers who have the technical aptitude necessary to grasp complex, abstract ideas.
a. Unique skills. An FA 49 officer must be able to:
(1) Formulate solutions to complex problems and design research and study approaches whose conclusions affect
positive change.
(2) Apply technical analytic skills to military issues.
(3) Infer causal relationships from observed events.
(4) Conduct and supervise quantitative and qualitative analyses.
(5) Communicate complex ideas, analysis, and recommendations to decisionmakers at all levels in terms appropriate
to the audience.
(6) Organize workload, assign tasks, and lead and mentor civilian and military subordinates.
(7) Plan, evaluate, coordinate and integrate actions with other staff elements and functions.
(8) Conduct research to acquire sufficient knowledge of new or unfamiliar processes or systems requiring
assessment.
b. Unique knowledge. The ORSA field requires the application of quantitative and qualitative methods to a wide
variety of military problems. Therefore, an ORSA officer should strive to:
(1) Understand military strategy and operations, program costing, force structure, combat developments, requirements analysis, human resource management, system testing evaluation, modeling, simulation, and wargaming.

362

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(2) Understand the applications of the principles of scientific inquiry, mathematical models and analytical software
programs.
(3) Keep pace with technology and methodology developments in the operations research field.
c. Unique attributes. FA 49 officers bring scientific approaches to solving complex military problems. An FA 49
officer should strive to:
(1) Attain operational experience to complement analytical skills in order to understand the military context of the
analysis.
(2) Work and excel at quick–turn analyses in dynamic high–tempo environments, as well as thorough long–term
studies.
(3) Communicate and defend analytic work and results in technical and non–technical terms at all levels of interest,
from peers to senior officers and officials.
(4) Identify, understand and solve complex problems.
(5) Work as part of a team with other members who may or may not be analysts.
(6) Be mathematically oriented.
(7) Possess an inquiring mind.
(8) Assist decisionmakers to validate assumptions.
(9) Filter and present data in intuitive and meaningful forms.
34–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. Functional area qualification. Generally, ORSA officers complete initial FA 49 qualification training prior to
performing duties in an FA 49–coded position. This training is completed regardless of the officer’s rank. Credit for
initial FA 49 qualification training can be obtained by 1 of the following 2 means:
(1) ORSA Military Applications Course I (ORSAMAC I). Most officers receive initial FA49 qualification training
by completing ORSAMAC I. This course is a 14–week intense immersion into the basics of Operations Research and
Management Science offered at Fort Lee, VA through the Army Logistic Management College (ALMC). Officers will
generally attend this course while PCS in route to an initial FA 49 assignment.
(2) Advanced Civil Schooling (ACS). Officers may also receive credit for initial FA49 qualification training via
ACS by completing a master’s–level graduate degree in a primary or associated discipline listed in table 34–2 and
34–3.
b. Additional Functional area development. ORSAs should continue their education beyond the initial ORSAMAC I
or ACS qualification. Although not mandatory, the ORSA Technologies and Applications Course (ORSA TAC),
offered by the ALMC Systems Engineering Department, provides a follow–on training opportunity for previously
qualified ORSA analysts. ORSA TAC exposes ORSAs to emerging technologies and operations research applications
related to military problem solving. ALMC also offers a variety of Continuing Education Programs (CEP) dealing with
topics such as simulations, data mining, optimization, and other subjects. The operations research and management
science societies and organizations provide additional ORSA learning opportunities. The Military Operations Research
Society (MORS), Army Operations Research Society (AORS), and the Institute for Operations Research and the
Management Sciences (INFORMS) hold recurring symposia that provide opportunities to share studies and analyses
within the ORSA community.
c. Qualification by grade. The qualification criteria listed below are the minimum requirements for an FA 49 officer
to qualify for promotion to the next higher grade.
(1) Captain.
(a) Qualification— There are no FA qualification requirements for CPTs; however, CPTs have the opportunity to
attend initial FA 49 qualification training and serve in FA 49 coded positions.
(b) Development— Between the 5th and 6th years of service, officers establish their branch or FA preferences. HRC
selects officers to serve in FA 49 assignments based on individual preference, needs of the Army, and undergraduate
degree discipline (see table 34–1). Generally, CPTs will be eligible for an ORSA assignment after they successfully
complete assignments designed to gain the requisite skills and experiences required by their basic branch. CPTs
desiring to serve in an ORSA assignment should contact the HRC FA 49 assignment officer as soon as possible after
establishing their preference to allow sufficient time to coordinate initial FA 49 FA qualification training and a
follow–on FA 49 assignment. The ORSA CPTs normally serve as members of analytical study teams or as ORSA staff
officers, where they apply the skills gained through initial training. Although there are no requirements for FA
qualification at the grade of CPT, ORSA training and experience as a CPT may enhance the officer’s chances of being
career field Designated (CFD) into the Institutional Support career field as an FA 49 officer. CFD occurs at the 4th,
7th, or 10th year of service. Officers career field designated FA 49 will serve primarily as ORSAs in subsequent
assignments.
(2) Major.
(a) Qualification— An officer must complete MEL 4 requirements to be qualified at the grade of MAJ. Additionally, the officer must successfully serve in an FA 49 coded position for 2 years. As an exception, an officer who
completes a master’s level graduate degree in a primary or associated discipline as listed in tables 34–2 and 34–3 must
DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

363

serve only 1 year in an FA 49–coded position to be qualified as a MAJ. Officers in cohort year groups affected by full
implementation of universal ILE will be required to complete the FA 49 qualification course in addition to completing
other ILE requirements for MEL 4 designation, either the ILE Common Core Course and/or the Advanced Operational
Warfighting Course (AOWC). The FA 49 qualification course is designed to prepare field grade officers to serve
successfully in FA 49 positions through the grade of LTC as senior analysts on Army and Joint staffs.
(b) Development— The Career Field Designation Board designates officers into 1 of the 4 OPMS career fields at
the 4th, 7th, and 10th year of service. Officers designated into the Institutional Support career field as FA 49s will
serve the remainder of their careers in FA 49 assignments with occasional opportunities for assignment to branch/FA
generalist (formerly branch immaterial) positions. All FA 49 coded positions are considered FA qualifying. Officers
should seek assignments that provide additional breadth to their FA 49 experience. Functional area 49 MAJs serve
primarily as ORSA analysts on study teams or as individual action officers with specific analytical areas of responsibility. MAJs should continue their professional development through continuing education and self–development with the
ultimate goal of completing a master’s level graduate degree in a primary or associated discipline (see tables 34–2 and
34–3). Some senior FA 49 MAJs may be selected for additional advanced civil schooling to earn a doctoral degree.
Officers are encouraged to apply for the School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS), and seek combatant command,
Joint Task Force, or other operational–level staff positions where they may refine their battle staff and military
operations analysis skills.
(3) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Qualification— An officer who has a total of 5 years field grade experience in FA 49 coded positions is
considered qualified at the grade of LTC.
(b) Development— All FA 49 coded LTC positions are FA qualifying. FA 49 LTCs are generally assigned to
supervisory positions or to positions on senior level staffs. LTCs are expected to develop analytic requirements, design
studies and establish appropriate methodologies, guide and review the analytic work of subordinates, and apply ORSA
techniques to a wide range of military and managerial issues. Some ORSA LTCs fill branch/FA generalist authorizations. FA 49 LTCs should seek a broad range of experiences to provide breadth to their professional competence,
including Department-level, Joint Staff, UEy, or other operational level staff positions. It is highly recommended that
LTCs complete a master’s degree program in a primary or associated discipline (see tables 34–2 and 34–3).
(4) Colonel. As senior analysts, COLs serve in assignments that require both technical ORSA and senior leadership
skills. They must be able to oversee and direct diverse studies and analytical efforts. To be qualified at the grade of
COL an officer must—
(a) Have completed all requirements for FA qualification at the LTC level.
(b) Have obtained a master’s level degree in an OR discipline listed in tables 34–2 and 34–3
(c) Serve a minimum of 24 months in an FA 49 COL position. Colonels should have a broad background in analysis
throughout the Army, having served in a variety of previous FA 49 field grade assignments. Their military education
goal should be completion of resident Senior Service College, the Army War College Distance Education Course, or a
MEL 1 fellowship.

Notes:
1 May require additional mathematics before FA 49 training period.
2 Degrees in other Engineering disciplines, Information Systems and Information Technology, Oceanography, Geophysics and other subjects may also support FA 49 designation. The critical factor is a curriculum that provided education in college-level mathematics or other quantitative problem solving courses
that will facilitate successful FA 49 training and application.

d. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. These billets, such as ROTC professor of military science and
certain faculty and staff positions, while not identified with a specific branch or FA are important to the Army. The
frequency that FA 49 officers fill branch/FA generalist positions depends on FA 49 inventory and the needs of the
Army.
e. Joint assignments.The ORSA FA positions exist on the Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL) for MAJs and above.
Joint experience, while highly encouraged and desirable, is not required for FA 49 field grade promotions. Officers
seeking assignment opportunities within the Office of the Secretary of Defense or the Joint Staff should first
successfully complete at least one FA 49 assignment, preferably at DA or MACOM level.
f. Advanced Civil Schooling. FA 49 offers several opportunities for fully funded advanced civil schooling as
described in AR 621–1, "Training of Military Personnel at Civilian Institutions." Interested officers should visit the
HRC FA 49 assignment officers’ Web site (https://www.perscomonline.army.mil/opfamis/fa49.htm) for more information. FA 49 officers may also seek advanced degrees through the Army’s tuition assistance program or cooperative
degree programs offered by some analytical organizations.
g. Fellowships. FA 49 MAJs and LTCs may compete for a RAND Arroyo Center Fellowship. RAND is a Federally
Funded Research and Development Corporation (FFRDC) headquartered in Santa Monica, California. The RAND
fellowship is 12 months long and, upon completion, officers are usually assigned to HQDA, the Joint Staff, or OSD.
The RAND fellowship invokes a 3-year Active Duty Service Obligation (ADSO). Interested officers should contact the
FA49 HRC assignment officer for more information. All applicants must meet the minimum requirements specified in
AR 621–7, "Fellowships and Grants."
34–4. Assignment preferences and precedence.
The professional development of an ORSA officer requires that the officer be exposed to a variety of ORSA–related
work, preferably in a number of challenging assignments. The fundamental theories behind ORSA techniques do not
change rapidly over time, but the environments and problems to which the tools are applied may vary greatly, as well
as the implementation of software tools available. After initial FA 49 training, officers should seek a variety of ORSA
assignments in diverse organizations to support their professional development and broaden their experience.
a. Preferences. Functional area 49 has diverse opportunities that allow for numerous career development paths. The
goal of FA 49 professional development is to produce operationally competent officers skilled in conducting quantitative and qualitative analysis on a wide variety of military issues. Assignments in this FA should provide the officer
exposure to a number of organizations that require FA 49 skills so the officer develops a broader understanding of the
application of ORSA techniques throughout the military.
b. Precedence. The sequencing of assignments within the FA is flexible, although in some instances there is
assignment precedence. Officers who have not met qualifying requirements at their respective rank are given precedence for assignment to FA 49 authorized positions. An officer’s 1st field grade assignment is generally to an FA 49
authorized position or to initial FA 49 graduate education rather than to a branch/FA generalist position. Additionally,
an officer’s initial assignment should be to a location with multiple ORSA positions and mentors to facilitate growth
and development. Some FA 49 authorizations require advanced education. Officers assigned to these positions must
complete the required education prior to their assignment. Prior to serving on the Joint Staff or in OSD, officers should
plan to serve in at least one FA 49 assignment, preferably at Army Staff level, on a UEy equivalent staff, or on a
COCOM or JTF staff.
34–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
Most FA 49 tour lengths are 24 to 36 months. An officer may be assigned longer to a location with a large FA 49
concentration, such as the National Capital Region. ORSA officers should seek assignment diversity if their tour length
in a particular area exceeds 3 years. OCONUS assignments will continue to require specific tour lengths.
a. Key Operations Research/Systems Analysis qualification positions. There are no specific assignments required for
FA 49 qualification at any grade. The only FA qualification requirements are outlined in paragraph 34–3 above.

366

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

b. Branch/functional area generalist positions. Branch/FA generalists positions within analytic or resource management organizations offer “hard skill” development. Positions in non–analytical organizations may offer more leadership
development. Duty in one of these positions should augment or develop skills missing from previous assignments
leading to a more broadly skilled officer.
c. Operations Research/Systems Analysis functional area life cycle. Figures 34–1 and 34–2 depict the ORSA FA life
cycle with FA qualifying requirements for both active and reserve components. They also identify developmental
assignment examples within the FA.

34–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. Provide a sufficient variety and number of FA 49 authorizations that provide challenging assignments and
multiple career paths for professional development while maintaining an inventory that enable officers to be competitive for promotion at rates consistent with Army averages.
b. Officer Personnel Management System and personnel transformation. The number of FA 49 authorizations, by
grade, will vary as force structure changes. Officers desiring more information on current authorizations or inventory
should contact either the FA 49 personnel proponent or the FA 49 assignments officer at HRC.
34–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Operations Research/Systems Analysis
a. Structure. FA 49 officers serve primarily on Army, Joint, or DOD staffs and in their field operating activities, in
dedicated analytical organizations, such as the Center for Army Analysis or TRADOC Analysis Center, or as
instructors. Approximately 90 percent of FA 49 authorizations are in the Army Generating Force. The remaining FA 49
structure is in the Operating Force from Combatant Command and MACOM–level down to UEx. FA 49s may deploy
forward from the Generating Force to support employed forces or support these employed force commanders’ analysis
requirements through reach–back to CONUS.
b. Acquire. There are 2 programmed points in an officer’s career at which they may enter FA 49. The first is the FA
preference selection between the officer’s 5th and 6th years of service, although this is not necessarily a permanent
career field change. Permanent entry into FA 49 is made in conjunction with a career field Designation Board held at
the 4th, 7th, and 10th years of service. In addition to the programmed points in a career, an officer may request a
transfer to FA 49 at any time. The request for transfer is adjudicated by HRC’s internal review mechanisms and
approval is based on Army needs.
(1) The criteria for selecting a CPT for FA 49 duty include the needs of the Army, personal preference, qualifications, which may include certifications, type of undergraduate degree, and grade point average. Selection for duty as a
FA 49 CPT does not guarantee future designation into the Institutional Support career field as FA 49 (see paragraph
34–3).
(2) The criteria for selecting an officer during the CFD process include officer preference, Army requirements, rater
and senior rater OER recommendations, undergraduate degree, and graduate degree, if applicable. Prior training and
experience in FA 49 as a CPT does not guarantee ISCF CFD as a FA 49, but may increase the probability of such a
designation.
c. Distribute. The Career Management Division (CMD), OPMD, HRC manages FA 49 officer assignments after
career field designation into ISCF. Assignments to FA 49 authorized positions or other assignments depend on the
needs of the Army, officer preference, and officer qualifications at the time of assignment.
d. Deploy. ORSAs are operationally proficient officers who remain personally and professionally ready to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to the Operating Force or Generating Force, all FA 49 officers must be
prepared to deploy to support missions across the full range of military operations.
e. Sustain. FA 49 officers designated into the ISCF compete for LTC and COL promotions with other ISCF officers.
The HRC FA 49 assignment officers monitor officers’ careers, and the personnel proponent provides FA policies.
f. Develop. Officers develop FA 49 skills through a series of progressively more challenging assignments and
education that provide officer opportunities to apply their skills to a wide range of Army and DOD problems.
Additional officer development accrues through service in branch/FA generalist positions. In generalist positions, FA
49 officers are exposed to varied Army organizations and functions, allowing officers opportunities to apply their skills
outside normal areas of application. Schools include the standard Army education opportunities— ILE, SAMS, and
SSC - as well as ORSA MAC I and ACS to complete a master’s or doctoral degree. Officers should complete a
master’s degree in either a primary or associated discipline (tables 34–2 and 34–3). FA 49 MAJs will generally attend
ILE through the 12–week common core course in residence at a Course Location (CL) site. After successful course
completion at a CL site, officers are Intermediate Staff College (ISC) graduates and credentialed with Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) 1 qualification. Full ILE credit is awarded when the officer has completed the
common core or AOWC and the FA 49 Qualification Course. An alternative is attendance at The Army School System
(TASS) classrooms located in CONUS and OCONUS CL sites g. Separate. FA 49 officers separate from the Army in
the same manner as other officers.

34–8. Operations Research/Systems Analysis Reserve Component officers
a. General. Reserve Component ORSA officers fulfill similar roles and missions as their Active Army counterparts.
The range and scope of possible RC assignments is somewhat more limited than those found within the Active Army,
due, in part, to differences in force structure and partly because there are no RC organizations comparable to the
TRADOC Analysis Center or the Center for Army Analysis. Nevertheless, every attempt will be made to assign RC
ORSA officers either in FA49 or branch/FA generalist positions, given available opportunity. Unlike their Active Army
counterparts, RC ORSA officers may be expected to revert to basic branch assignments to continue reserve participation and career development (see chap 7 for RC officer development).
b. Assignment opportunities. Reserve Component ORSA assignments are similar to AC assignments with a few
exceptions. Generally, USAR entry–level positions are in the accessions system area. U.S. Army Reserve analysts have
2 other areas of activity in which to gain experience toward becoming a well–rounded senior analyst. The 1st is in
resourcing and represents all assignments relevant to the PPBE process. The 2nd is in the operations, plans, and
doctrine area, which includes operational deployments, COCOM and MACOM assignments, and basic branch/branch
immaterial assignments relevant to strategy and doctrine development. Army National Guard analysts are primarily
assigned to organizations in the National Capital Region and to ARNG UEx staffs.
(1) Captain. U.S. Army Reserve entry–level positions include several CPT billets, most managed under the AGR
program. Almost all USAR CPTs serve as marketing officers at USAREC brigade headquarters. They are supervised
and mentored by senior civilian analysts, work alongside their AC peers, and complete their tours prepared for
personnel, strength management, or accessions system policy assignments at USARC, USAREC, OCAR, RTD,
HRC–St. Louis, and HQDA.
(2) Major and lieutenant colonel. Most RC ORSA positions are field grade and are governed by the IMA and AGR
programs, and most authorizations for senior MAJs and above are in the National Capital Region. Two ARNG ORSA
MAJs are authorized for the UEx staff.
(3) Colonel. There are few COL positions, and senior analysts should seek branch/FA generalist positions. COLs
should maintain broad perspectives and should seek experience throughout the analytical community.
c. Mobilization requirements. Significant numbers of mobilization requirements exist for FA 49 qualified officers.
HRC–St. Louis manages pre–trained individual manpower to fill shortfalls in RA, USAR, and ARNG units using
officers assigned to the IRR.
d. Qualification and professional development. Reserve Component ORSA officers satisfy FA qualification requirements and become competitive for promotion when they attend military schools and serve in positions of increased
responsibility. The following standards must be met to be considered qualified for promotion to the next higher grade
unless otherwise noted (length of service in a given position should not be narrowly construed; key is assignment
diversity, level of participation, and sufficient time within each assignment to develop competence):
(1) Captain.
(a) Successfully complete basic branch CPTs Officer Education System (OES) courses (either AC or RC
curriculum).
(b) Serve in at least 1 basic branch position for a minimum of 24 months to gain the requisite skills and experiences
required by their basic branch
(c) Complete ORSA MAC I or obtain a master’s degree in a primary or associated ORSA discipline listed in table
34–2 or table 34–3.
(d) Serve in at least 1 entry level ORSA position for a minimum of 24 months.
(e) Advanced civil schooling is available to both CPTs and MAJs, but NPS is the only fully funded ACS
opportunity, and these opportunities are limited. Officers should develop a plan to obtain a relevant master’s degree.
(2) Major.
(a) Best–qualified officers will also complete the FA 49 Qualification Course.
(b) Serve a minimum of 24 months in at least one ORSA position. Best–qualified officers will serve 36 or more
months in ORSA positions.
(c) Continue development through CEP or various civilian education venues with the ultimate goal of obtaining a
master’s degree in a primary or associated ORSA discipline listed in table 34–2 or table 34–3. A master’s degree is not
a requirement for promotion to LTC, but is highly encouraged. Some assignments, including HQDA staff and OSD,
may require a master’s degree in an ORSA discipline.
(d) If a second ORSA assignment is not available, serve a minimum of 36 months in a branch/FA generalist or basic
branch position. Active Guard Reserve officers will be single tracked FA 49 to the maximum extent possible.
(3) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Successfully complete ILE within 3 years after promotion to LTC.
(b) Serve a minimum of 6 years at the field grade level in an ORSA position. Time spent obtaining a master’s
degree listed in table 34–2 or table 34–3 as a full time duty may be included as part of the 6–year minimum. Civilian
ORSA service such as time spent as a GS 1515 series employee will be considered towards meeting the 6–year
minimum as well. Civilian OR service must be annotated on the biography submitted to promotion boards.

372

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(c) If a second ORSA assignment is not available, seek an assignment in a branch/FA generalist or basic branch
position (AGR officers will be single tracked FA 49 to the maximum extent possible).
(d) Be selected for Senior Service College (MEL 1).
(4) Colonel.
(a) Serve in at least 1 ORSA position for a minimum of 24 months.
(b) As senior analysts, COLs serve in assignments that require both technical and managerial skills. They should be
able to oversee and direct diverse studies and analytical efforts. COLs should have a broad background in analysis
throughout the Army, having served in a variety of different FA 49 authorizations in previous field grade assignments.
(c) If a second ORSA assignment is not available, seek an assignment in a branch/FA generalist or basic branch
position.
e. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for FA 49 officers is shown at figure 34–2.
f. Civilian acquired skills. Many RC officers possess education and/or work experience through their civilian
profession comparable to that of ORSA officers but are not designated FA 49. These officers are strongly encouraged
to seek FA 49 designation through HRC–St. Louis. Civilian ORSA–related work experience will be considered for
developmental equivalency when qualifying these officers for positions of increased responsibility.
g. Reserve Component training participation and credit. (See chapter 7.)

Chapter 35
Force Management Functional Area
35–1. Unique features of Force Management functional area
a. Unique purpose Force Management functional area. The Force Management FA provides distinctively skilled
officers who lead and implement change and are integrated in all echelons of command. Force management officers are
trained and educated in every aspect of the Force Management process to create a mission ready campaign quality
force with Joint and expeditionary capabilities for the combatant commanders. The Force Management FA is involved
in the organization, integration, decisionmaking and execution of the full spectrum of activities encompassing requirements definition, force structuring, combat developments, materiel developments, training developments, as well as
analyzing and resourcing at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of the Army.
b. Unique functions performed by Force Management functional area. Force management officers, also known as
FA 50 officers, are the Army’s experts on the broad and complex subject of change management. They are critical to
accomplishing the Army’s requirements under 10 USC. Functional area 50s are highly educated and serve as the
subject matter experts on Force Management. They are trusted advisors at every level of command and provide
expertise in design, development, and funding strategies of the Army to support Defense Strategic Planning documents.
Force management officers are involved in determining warfighting requirements, designing operational forces and
institutional Army structures, identifying and allocating authorized resources, and analyzing 2nd and 3rd order effects
to provide a mission ready force. The Force Management officer manages the integration and synchronization of Army
requirements across the Doctrine, Organizations, Training, Materiel, Leader development & education, Personnel and
Facilities (DOTMLPF) domains. These domains are managed through the Army’s life cycle process from conceptual
development to the eventual deactivation or obsolescence. Functional area 50 is managed within the Institutional
Support career field (ISCF). The FA 50 Proponency Office is located within the Office of Deputy Chief of Staff, G–8,
Force Development Directorate, Army Pentagon.
c. Unique features of work in Force Management functional area. The institutional force creates, provides and
sustains the Army’s contribution to the land component of the combatant commander’s Joint/multinational force. The
Force Management FA directly supports 10 USC responsibilities of DA by developing the 4 core capabilities of the
force required to support the current and Future Force. These core capabilities are—
(1) Develop the force.
(2) Generate and project the force.
(3) Sustain the force.
(4) Direct and resource the force. Functional area 50 provides the Army with a highly trained cadre of officers who
specialize in leading and integrating change and Force Management (the inter–relationship of Force Management, force
development, and force integration). The expertise held by Force Management officers is essential to building the core
capabilities of the Army. They possess in–depth FA and operational expertise gained through both formal schooling
and demanding repetitive Force Management assignments and at echelons. The work in this FA is performed across
Army, Joint, and DOD level organizations and staffs. At times, the Force Management officer is required to interface
with interagency organizations, officials from other Services and the DOD staff. The demands of influencing change
management require officers to operate routinely within and outside institutional paradigms that exist today. Change
management work is demanding, challenging, and rewarding. It provides the officer an opportunity to develop the
Army of the future. A Force Management officer is involved in—

35–2. Officer characteristics required
The Force Management FA requires officers who are skilled in leadership at all levels; who understand military
operations; who possess strong Army Values, leader attributes, and leader skills; and who fully understand the key
leadership actions that must be taken to ensure success. Force management officers also have the technical aptitude
necessary to grasp complex, abstract ideas.
a. Competencies and actions common to all. Army officers must be premier warfighters who can effectively apply
the 4 core dimensions of leadership— values, attributes, skills, and actions (see FM 22–100).
b. Unique skills. A Force Management officer must be able to—
(1) Operate routinely in high level staff assignments where guidance may be minimal and close interaction with
senior level decisionmakers is frequent.
(2) Express him/herself clearly, concisely, and accurately in both oral and written communication.
(3) Apply highly specialized knowledge effectively in both military and civilian environments to address national
issues, including political, military, economic, social, and international challenges.
(4) Demonstrate highly developed analytical and problem solving skills while clearly articulating 2nd and 3rd order
effects of recommendations and solutions to senior level decisionmakers.
(5) Prepare and present clear, concise, and informative briefings and information papers for senior decisionmakers
on highly technical subjects.
(6) Reduce raw data to form and substance usable by senior level decisionmakers.
(7) Listen to senior level decisionmakers and understand their guidance and implement their intent quickly and
accurately.
(8) Conceptualize and develop creative solutions beyond those of the established operational paradigm.
(9) Organize, integrate, and lead work groups of military and civilian specialists in areas related to the problem
being addressed.
(10) Conduct research to acquire sufficient knowledge of a new or unfamiliar process or system that is to be
analyzed, perhaps for the first time.
c. Unique knowledge. Force management officers require specialized knowledge of Army organization, structure,
and doctrine. Additionally, they are the subject matter experts in change management. Force management officers
must—
(1) Possess keen intellect and knowledge, gained through attendance at specialized education and training courses
and through repetitive duty assignments at various levels of command.
(2) Be able to quickly determine the best possible solution for the Army void of branch affiliation or proponent
influence.
(3) Embrace change and the fluid environment associated with managing, articulating, and leading change.
(4) Understand the organization, structure, and doctrine of the warfighting Army, DA, DOD, Joint Staff, unified
commands, multination and coalition warfare, and the U.S. Government.

(PPBE).
d. Unique attributes. Force management officers are expected to display and possess the following personal
attributes—
(1) Ability to determine requirements and authorizations for doctrine, training, leader development, organizations,
and material.
(2) Ability to translate organizational requirements into capabilities based organizational models.
(3) Ability to translate doctrinal requirements into techniques, tactics, and procedures.
(4) Ability to translate requirements for training and leader development into programs, methods, or devices.
(5) Ability to understand the conception, development, and execution of solutions to material requirements identified
and initiated through the combat development process.
(6) Ability to translate equipment requirements into executable programs within acceptable performance, schedule,
and cost parameters.
(7) Ability to understand and translate authorization allocations; distribute projected resources to meet requirements
and authorizations in Army organizations as well as activities according to established priorities.
(8) Ability to understand and articulate Unit Development Model for TOEs, MTOEs and TDAs, and the means for
managing changes to these documents.
(9) Highly developed analytical and problem solving skills.

35–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. General. Force management officers possess significant skills in organizing, equipping, and resourcing the Army
and are the leaders of change. Generally, Force Management officers complete initial FA 50 qualification training prior
to performing duties in an FA 50–coded position. This training is completed regardless of the officer’s grade.
Attending the 4–week “How the Army Runs” course at the Army Force Management School (AFMS) at Fort Belvoir,
VA., awards credit for initial FA 50 qualification training. Together with the Qualification Course (Q–Course), it
provides the officer with the knowledge and practical application of skills that will prepare him/her for their first Force
Management assignment. Ideally, the Force Management officer, to ensure continued contribution to the mission of
providing quality capabilities to the combatant commanders, will begin his/her career at HQDA. An initial assignment
in HQDA offers practical application of the skills learned in the Qualification Course. Following initial assignment, and
to remain competitive for promotion, the Force Management officer must seek to refine his/her skills, knowledge,
attributes, and experiences in his/her current grade. One should aggressively seek to broaden those skill sets by seeking
the diversity that comes from alternating assignments in positions that vary both in type (organizational vs. material
and requirements vs. solutions) and echelon major headquarters (HQDA, Joint/Defense, or MACOM) vs operational
units (Corps or Division; later UEx or UEy). A few officers may elect to focus their skill sets in either requirements
determination or material solution. While this pattern enables the officer to develop specialization in one or the other
field, this path diminishes the officer’s utility at senior rank in FA positions; seeking alternating assignments on
requirement determination and material solutions is the most preferred path.
b. Functional area qualification and development. All Force Management officers are expected to attend the 4–week
“How the Army Runs” course at the Army Force Management School (AFMS) at Fort Belvoir, VA., to receive initial
FA 50 qualification. Officers new to the FA are required to attend a follow–on Q Course at the AFMS to learn the
optimal skill sets necessary for success in the FA. The FA 50 Q–Course is based on the logical flow of operational
concepts, requirements to capabilities–based assessments, analysis of alternatives, resourcing, acquisition, testing and

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

375

eventual fielding. The Q–Course is an applied course (vice theoretical) with mini–practical exercises spread throughout
the course. This course will develop core essential competencies and the confidence of Future Force management staff
officers. It builds on the foundation from the “How the Army Runs” Course at the AFMS. Taking in sum the ILE core
course, the “How the Army Runs” Course, and the FA 50 Qualification Course (Q–Course) will provide the officer the
required training and education for MEL 1 and JPME 1 qualification. Also, pursuing an advanced degree (see table
35–3) is highly recommended and very desirable anytime in a Force Management officer’s career. Additional opportunities outside the typical FA professional development path do exist for some officers. Officers may apply for the
School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) at Fort. Leavenworth, KS. Interested officers should submit requests for
attendance and exception to policy to their branch manager and the proponency office. Force managers at the LTC
grade who are competitive for selection for Senior Service College should consider ranking the Industrial College of
the Armed Forces (ICAF) the top consideration for slating. Force managers should actively pursue 180–day TDY
opportunities in order to increase their operational exposure in major theaters and combat training centers.
(1) Captain.
(a) Qualification. There are no FA requirements for CPTs; however, CPTs have the opportunity to attend the initial
FA 50 qualification training and serve in FA 50–coded positions once they have completed their basic branch
requirements and required schooling.
(b) Development. Officers select their desired career field designation at their 10th year of service or prior to the
MAJ selection board. Generally, officers who are designated FA 50 will be eligible for a Force Management
assignment after they have met all the basic branch requirements as a CPT and completed the MEL 1 and JPME 1
qualification training. CPTs desiring to serve in a Force Management assignment should contact the HRC FA 50
assignment officer no later than 12 months prior to completing their last company grade assignment. This will allow
sufficient time to coordinate the scheduling of initial FA qualification training and a follow–on Force Management
assignment to an authorized billet. Although no requirements for FA qualification exist at the grade of CPT, training
and experience in operational assignments (that is, Plans Office, DCS, G–3/5/7; Assistant S3; Project Warrior at a
CTC) provide the officer with a solid foundation for Force Management work. Additionally, an FA 50 assignment as a
CPT may enhance the officer’s chances of being career field designated (CFD) into the Institutional Support career
field as a Force Management officer under OPMS III. CFD occurs near the 10th year of service in conjunction with
selection for promotion to MAJ. Officers who are designated to FA 50 in the CFD process will serve in Force
Management assignments for the remainder of their careers.

(2) Major.
(a) In order to gain the required skills and experience at the grade of MAJ an officer must complete the following
requirements—
1. Obtain Military Education Level (MEL) 4.
2. Complete the FA 50 Q–Course.
3. Serve a minimum 2–years in a FA 50 MAJ authorized key developmental or developmental position. These
required duty assignment milestones qualify the officer for consideration to LTC. Functional area 50 MAJs serve
primarily as a Force Management specialist or as individual action officers with specific focus in Force Management
areas of responsibility. Officers should seek Force Management assignments that provide additional breadth to their
experiences and skill sets and should strive to take demanding and challenging positions. MAJs, as a minimum, must
successfully serve at least 24 months in one of the following 6 key developmental positions:
a. Requirements synchronization officer, DCS, G–3/5/7.
b. Force management officer, at MACOM or DCS, G–3/5/7.
c. Force modernization officer, at division, corps, or MACOM.
d. System synchronization officer, DCS, G–8.
e. Joint force manager, at Joint Staff J8 or DCS, G–8.

a. Force structure officer, at MACOM or DCS, G–3/5/7.
b. Force structure analyst at MACOM or DCS, G–8.
c. Force design officer at MACOM.
d. Combat developer at MACOM.
(b) Utilization— Force Management MAJ can expect utilization at either HQDA or at the operational level (division
(UEx), corps and Army Service Component Command (ASCC) (UEy)). Some MAJs will be utilized as functional
experts in change management at the MACOMs level. MAJs should work toward the completion of a master’s level
graduate degree in a primary or associated discipline (see tables 35–2 and 35–3) either through fully funded programs
or on their own.
(3) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Serve a minimum of 2 years in an FA 50 LTC authorized key developmental or developmental position. These
required duty assignment milestones qualify the officer for consideration to COL. FA 50 LTCs are generally assigned
to supervisory positions or to positions on senior level staffs. LTCs are expected to understand the programmatic
underpinnings of requirement determination and materiel solutions, force design and establish appropriate
methodologies for achieving funding guidelines, guide and review the Force Management work of subordinates and
apply analytical assessment techniques to a wide range of military and managerial issues. Force management LTCs
should serve 24 months in one of the following 6 key developmental positions:
1. Deputy division chief at the DCS, G–3/5/7.
2. FA 50 branch or team chief at MACOM, DCS, G–3/5/7, or DCS, G–8.
3. Force integration officer at Corps, MACOM, or DCS, G–3/5/7.
4. Force developer at Corps or MACOM.
5. Requirement synchronization officer/system synchronization officer at DCS, G–3/5/7 and DCS, G–8.
6. Joint force manager at Joint Staff or DCS, G–8.
(b) Or, serve at least 24 months in one of these 3 developmental positions
1. Force manager at MACOM or DCS, G–3/5/7.
2. Force analysis manager at MACOM, DCS, G–3/5/7, DCS, G–8.
3. Command manager at DCS, G–3/5/7.
(c) Utilization— Force Management LTCs can expect utilization at either HQDA, MACOM, or at the operational
level (Corps, ASCC (UEy)) and should aggressively seek different types of jobs within Force Management authorizations and structure to widen the breadth of their Force Management experience. Additionally, it is in the best interest of
the officer to work in FA 50 authorized positions that increase their experiences in leadership. It is highly recommended that LTCs complete a master’s degree program in a primary or associated discipline (see tables 35–2 and
35–3). Assignments outside of the career field do exist and the opportunities to compete for nominative assignments
are available to the Force Management officer.

(4) Colonel. As senior force managers, colonels serve in assignments that require both technical Force Management
and managerial skills. They should be able to oversee and direct diverse Force Management efforts and analytical
studies in order to determine the best feasible Force Management solution. Colonels should have a broad background in
analytical processes, and possess the following qualifications:
(a) Joint qualified (3A or 3L)
(b) MEL 1
(c) Serve a minimum 2 years in a FA 50 COL FA authorized position. These required educational and duty
assignment milestones qualify the officer for consideration to BG. Assignments outside of the career field do exist and
the opportunities to compete for nominative assignments are available to the Force Management officer.
c. Functional area generalist assignments. All COL billets are critical assignments and will require a trained Force
Management officer to fill the authorization. The actual number of FA 50 COLs filling FA positions depends on the
overall inventory and the needs of the Army. However, the intent of the Army is to utilize its senior level force
managers in positions where their utilization as a senior force manager is maximized.
d. Joint assignments. Functional area 50 FA positions exist on the Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL) for MAJs
and above. Joint experience, while highly encouraged, is not required for an FA 50 officer to be promoted to COL.
Officers seeking assignment opportunities within the JCS or OSD should first successfully complete at least one Force
Management assignment, preferably at the DA or MACOM staff level.
e. Advanced Civil Schooling (ACS). Functional area 50 MAJs and LTCs can compete for a fully funded Masters in
Business Administration or System Engineering with a concentration in Force Management once they are FA qualified
at their present rank. FA 50 sends six to eight officers a year to attend a 16 month curriculum at George Mason
University, at Fairfax, VA or the Naval Postgraduate School, at Monterey CA. The curriculum year begins in August
and ends the next following December. Officers assessed into the ACS program will incur a 3-year commitment upon
completion of the program studies. In order to compete for the ACS program, the officer must meet the minimum
standards outlined in AR 621–1, Training of Military Personnel at Civilian Institutions. Interested officers are asked to
contact the FA 50 branch manager at HRC no later than 31 October of the current year and the Proponency Office to
ensure timely preparation of their ACS packet.
f. Fellowships. Functional area 50 MAJs and LTCs can compete for a RAND, Arroyo Center Fellowship. RAND is
a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) with its headquarters in Santa Monica, California.
Functional area 50 sends 1 officer a year to serve a 12–month tour with the RAND Arroyo Center in Alexandria, VA.
The fellowship offers the officer the opportunity to conduct in–depth research and analysis on critical Force Management issues at the Departmental and DOD levels; the opportunity to become a published author exists as a part of this
fellowship as well. Interested officers endure a rigorous selection process and interview to ensure that the best officer is
selected to represent the Force Management community. Upon successful completion of the year tour, the officer incurs
a 3–year commitment. Officers interested in competing for this Fellowship must meet the minimal requirements
outlined in AR 621–7 and should contact the FA 50 branch manager at HRC and the FA 50 proponency office not later
378

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

than 31 May of the current year to ensure timely preparation of their Fellowship packet. Officers should complete a
master’s degree in a primary or associate discipline (refer to tables 35–2 and 35–3).
35–4. Assignment preferences and precedence.
The professional development of a Force Management officer requires that the officer be exposed to a variety of Force
Management related work, preferably in a variety of challenging assignments. The fundamental theory behind Force
Management procedures and processes does not change rapidly over time, but the environments in which the tools are
applied can vary greatly. After receiving their initial training, FA officers should seek various types of Force
Management assignments in different types of organizations to foster their professional development and hone the
critical skill set and experiences necessary for success.
a. Preferences. Force Management officers articulate, manage, and lead change; they become an invaluable tool to
the commander on the requirements to solution paradigm. The goal of the professional development of the FA is to
produce officers skilled in the technical aspects of leading efficient change management, yet retaining our understanding of the operational Army. Additionally, the Force Management officer is capable of managing requirement
determination and materiel solutions while leveraging quantitative and qualitative analysis on varied DOD issues.
Assignments in the FA are made to provide the officer exposure to a number of organizations that require Force
Management skills and attributes so that the officer develops a fuller understanding of the application of Force
Management techniques throughout the military.
b. Precedence. The sequencing of assignment to positions within the FA is flexible; although, in some instances,
precedence for assignments exists. Officers who have not met key developmental or developmental requirements at
their respective grade are given the precedence for assignment to FA 50 authorized positions. An officer’s 1st field
grade assignment is in an FA 50 authorized coded developmental position, and officers can expect sequential repetitive
assignments in FA 50 positions throughout the breadth of the Army and Joint Staffs. Where sequential field grade
positions are not available (for example, division (UEx) and corps (UEy)), some officers will serve their duration in an
initial FA developmental position. Additionally, for new officers assessed into the FA, the FA 50 Q–Course is required
training.
35–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
Officers assigned to the FA 50 FA will normally spend 12 to 36 months in a specific position. An officer may spend a
longer period assigned to a geographical area where there is a high concentration of billets such as the National Capital
Region. Force Management officers should seek to diversify the types of jobs they fill if the tour length in a particular
area exceeds 3 years in order to broaden the scope, skill set, and experiences obtained through repetitive assignments.
Outside CONUS locations will continue to require specific tour lengths.
a. Key Force Management developmental positions. A field grade officer is expected to hold a specific FA 50
position for a minimum of 2 years to be considered branch qualified in that grade. However, it is important to
understand that the qualification is tied more closely to the skills, attributes, and experience gained at each grade vice
the position an officer holds. Officers are encouraged to seek to broaden their individual and professional skill sets by
seeking the diversity that comes from alternating assignments in positions that vary both in type and echelon of major
headquarters and achieve a balance between MACOMs and operational units.
b. Force management functional area life cycle. Figure 35–1 depicts a Force Management FA life cycle with FA
qualifying requirements. Also, it identifies key developmental assignments within the FA.

380

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

35–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to have a field grade officer mix of Force Management authorizations that provide challenging
assignments and a career path for professional development while maintaining an inventory of officers that enables
each Force Management officer to be competitive for promotion at rates that meet or exceed Army averages.
b. OPMS and personnel transformation. The number of FA 50 authorizations, by grade, will vary as force structure
decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more information on current authorizations or inventory should contact either the FA 50 proponency office or the FA 50 assignments officer at HRC.
35–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Force Management officers
a. Structure. Officers serve primarily on Army, Joint, or DOD staffs and in their field operating activities, in
dedicated organizations (that is, Force Design Directorate, TRADOC Combat Developments, and so forth). Force
management also has officers within the TOE structure at the division (UEx) and corps (UEy) levels serving as the
primary advisor to the commander on issues relating to Force Management, structure, and synchronization of the
integration of requirements to solution process.
b. Acquire. There are 2 points in an officer’s career when the officer may acquire the FA 50 designation. The 1st is
a result of the career field designation (CFD) board that corresponds with the officer’s selection for promotion to MAJ.
The 2nd is later in the officer’s career pattern depending on his/her performance of duty. The criteria for selecting an
officer during the CFD process includes needs of the Army, officer preference, commander’s input (OER), undergraduate degree, and graduate degree. Prior training and experience in FA 50 as a CPT does not guarantee selection to Force
Management during CFD, but may enhance the officer’s chances of being designated into the career field.
c. Distribute. The FA 50 Officer Assignments Branch, Career Management Division (CMD) at HRC Officer
Personnel Management Directorate (OPMD) manages FA 50 officer assignments. The Career Management Division
(CMD), HRC, OPMD manages the FA 50 officer assignments after the officers’ designation into the Institutional
Support career field at the grade of MAJ. Assignment to FA 50 authorized positions, to ACS, Fellowships or to branch/
FA developmental positions depends upon the needs of the Army, officer preference, and officer qualifications at the
time of assignment.
d. Deploy. Functional area 50 officers are operationally relevant and remain personally and professionally prepared
to deploy worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to mobile MTOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site
TDA organizations, all FA 50 officers must maintain a deployable status. Functional area 50 officers may deploy with
their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests; or as individuals to support Joint and
multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping missions. In any circumstance, Force
Management officers must prepare themselves and their families for this most challenging life cycle function.
Additionally, the officer will be managed with an understanding that—
(1) Unit focused stabilization. Functional area 50 officer Assignments Branch only assigns officers in the grade of
MAJ and LTC; thus, the Unit focused stabilization program which assigns company grade officers to home–based
installations for up to 7 years does not affect the distribution of designated FA 50 officers.
(2) Life cycle units. Officers at all levels are subject to assignment to life cycle units (generally Brigade Combat
Teams or the Stryker Brigades). Although unlikely on a routine basis for FA 50 officers (typically assigned only at
division level or above), there may be a unique requirement for the assignment of an FA 50 officer to such a unit in
support of contingency missions or other Army needs. This would be considered a branch qualifying assignment by
exception.
(3) Cyclic units. Functional area 50 may be assigned to cyclic units as determined by Army authorizations for FA
50 officers at these installations/units.
e. Sustain. Officers designated into the ISCF compete for promotions with other ISCF officers for LTC and COL
promotions. The FA 50 assignments officers in FAMDD monitor the officers’ careers, and the proponency office
provides the directive policies for the FA.
f. Develop. Officers develop their FA 50 skills through a series of progressively more difficult assignments and
schools that provide the officer an opportunity to apply his or her skills to a wide range of Army and DOD problems.
Additional development of the officer occurs through service in branch qualifying and FA developmental positions. In
these developmental positions, officers are exposed to varied Army organizations and functions while allowing FA 50
officers the ability to hone their skills. Also, development includes ACS for completion of a master’s level degree and
a Fellowship with RAND Arroyo Center. Officers should complete a master’s degree in a primary or associate
discipline (see tables 35–2 and 35–3).
g. Separate. Functional area 50 officers separate from the Army in the same way as other officers.
35–8. Force management Reserve Component officers
a. General. Reserve Component Force Management officers serve the same role and mission as their Active Army

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

381

counterparts. The unique nature of the RC soldier’s role as a citizen–soldier poses a challenge for professional
development. However, RC officers are expected to follow Active Army officer development patterns as closely as
possible, except that RC officers have increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. To meet
professional development objectives, RC officers (ARNG and USAR), minus AGR officers, must be willing to rotate
among TPU, IRR, and individual mobilization augmentee programs both within and outside of their respective
components. Active Guard Reserve professional development assignments are managed separately by each component’s full–time support branch. Geographical considerations, as well as the need to provide as many officers as
possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions necessitate these transfers. Additionally,
there may be occasions when the RC officer will be placed in the Trainee, Transient, Holdee, and Student (TTHS)
account until training is completed educational requirements. Such transfers will not be seen as impacting negatively on
the officer’s career. Every attempt will be made to assign RC Force Management officers in developmental positions,
but opportunities are limited. Unlike their Active Army counterparts, RC Force Management officers may have to
revert to back basic branch assignments to continue their reserve participation and career development (see chap 7).
b. Assignment opportunities. Reserve Component Force Management officers can expect assignment opportunities
that mirror those of Active Army officers, as well as positions applicable exclusively to the RC. Reserve Component
FA 50 officers serve at all levels within the DOD, and consequently must fully understand and be able to articulate the
roles, missions, and composition of the RC as an integral component of the Total Army. The success of an RC Force
Management officer is not measured by length of service in any one component or control group, but by the officer’s
breadth of experience, duty performance, and adherence to FA requirements. Assignments in FA 50 are available
throughout the RC (AGR, TPU, individual mobilization augmentee).
c. Qualification and professional development. Reserve Component Force Management officers satisfy FA qualification requirements and become competitive for promotion when they attend military schools and then seek assignments
in positions of increased responsibility. The following standards listed below must be met in order to prepare the
officer to be considered qualified for promotion to the next higher rank unless otherwise noted (length of service in a
given position should not be narrowly construed; key is assignment diversity, level of participation, diverse experiences
and skill set and sufficient time within each assignment to develop competence; AGR officers will be single tracked to
the extent possible).
(1) Captain
(a) Successfully complete basic branch CCC courses (either Active Army or RC curriculum).
(b) Serve in at least one basic branch position for 24 months.
(2) Major.
(a) Successfully complete CGSC/core ILE course. Best qualified officers will also complete the FA 50 Qualification
Course portion of FA 50 ILE.
(b) Serve 24 months in a MAJ grade level Force Management position. Best qualified officers will have 36 or more
months in Force Management positions.
(3) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Successfully complete CGSC/core ILE course.
(b) Serve a minimum of 24 months in an LTC grade level Force Management position. Civilian Force Management
service such as time spent as a Career Program (CP) 26 Series, Manpower and Force Management, employee will be
taken into consideration. Civilian Force Management service must be annotated on the biography submitted to
promotion boards.
(4) Colonel.
(a) Successfully complete CGSC.
(b) Serve in at least 1 Force Management position for 24 months. As senior force managers, COLs serve in
assignments that require both technical Force Management and managerial skills. They should be able to oversee and
direct diverse Force Management efforts and analytical studies. COLs should have a broad background in analysis
throughout the Army, having served in a variety of different FA 50 authorizations in previous field grade assignments.
Their military education goal should be completion of resident Senior Service College , a MEL 1 fellowship, or the
Army War College Distance Education Course.
d. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development models for FA 50 officers are shown at figures
35–2 and 35–3.

e. Civilian acquired skills. Many RC officers are qualified Force Management officers in their civilian profession,
yet they do not possess FA 50 qualifications. These officers are strongly encouraged to apply for FA 50. The FA 50
proponency office through HRC–St. Louis will be the approval authority for all requests. Civilian Force Management
assignments will be considered as developmental equivalents when qualifying these officers for positions of increased
responsibility.
f. Reserve Component training participation and credit. See chapter 7.

Chapter 36
Nuclear and Counterproliferation Functional Area
36–1. Unique features of the Nuclear and Counterproliferation functional area
a. Unique purpose of the Nuclear and Counterproliferation functional area. Nuclear and Counterproliferation is an
FA within the Institutional Support career field where trained and experienced officers apply knowledge and expertise
in nuclear and related weapons of mass destruction in developing national and theater strategy, plans and policy; in
conducting weapons effects research and analysis, to include consequence of execution and consequence management;
in international treaty formulation and verification; and in planning the employment of nuclear weapons to support
theater and strategic operations.
b. Unique functions performed by the Nuclear and Counterproliferation functional area. The mission of FA 52 is to
provide technical advice and policy recommendations to the Army, combatant command, DOD, and interagency
leadership in the areas of nuclear and related weapons of mass destruction. To accomplish this mission, the Nuclear
and Counterproliferation officer performs the following FA 52 functions:
(1) Conducts research and analysis of nuclear weapons effects and the effects of related weapons of mass destruction, to include consequence assessment and management.
(2) Assists in forming national, Joint, Army and theater–level nuclear weapons strategy, plans, and policies. Assists
in identifying requirements for nuclear weapons and for the development, operation, and sustainment of nuclear
weapons systems.
(3) Serves as a staff officer or liaison supporting warfighting forces in the areas related to nuclear and related
weapons of mass destruction.
(4) Provides technical expertise in nuclear weapons and their effects to assure the operational effectiveness of our
nuclear forces and their survivability and endurance based upon nuclear and other threats.
(5) Provides technical assistance in target analysis and employment planning of nuclear and advanced conventional

(15) Operates, oversees the operation of, or regulates the operation of research or testing nuclear reactors and
weapons effects simulators.
(16) Provides technical oversight and management of nuclear and related weapons of mass destruction modeling and
simulation efforts.
c. Unique features of work in the functional area. Work within the Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA requires the
application of technical skills in their military applications. Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers are frequently the
sole subject matter experts within their command or organization. They:
(1) Serve as staff or liaison officers in Army, Joint, DOD, and interagency organizations.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

385

(2) Serve as instructors in the Department of Physics, Department of Chemistry and Life Sciences, and Department
of Civil and Mechanical Engineering, U.S. Military Academy (USMA).
(3) Serve as Military Research Associates at Department of Energy National Laboratories.
(4) Serve in fellowship positions within interagency organizations and through the Training With Industry (TWI)
program.
36–2. Officer characteristics required
The Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA requires officers who are skilled in leadership at all levels; who are proficient
in branch tactics, techniques and procedures; who possess strong Army Values, leader attributes and skills; and who
fully understand the key leadership actions that must be taken to assure success. There are skills, knowledge, and
attributes unique to this FA that require professional development, and FA 52 candidates must acquire or possess them
to ensure success.
a. Values, attributes, skills and actions common to all.
(1) Army Values. Consistent with the new OER.
(2) Leader attributes. Fundamental qualities and characteristics.
(3) Leader skills. Skill development is part of self–development; prerequisite to action.
(4) Leadership actions. Major activities leaders perform: influencing, operating, and improving.
b. Unique skills. Functional area 52 officers must fully comprehend the organization, structure, and doctrine of the
warfighting Army as it evolves into the 21st century. In addition, they must—
(1) Possess the ability to obtain a master’s degree in a nuclear related field.
(2) Routinely serve in staff positions where guidance is minimal and close interaction with senior–level decisionmakers is common.
(3) Apply highly technical scientific concepts to more military–specific issues and applications.
(4) Be capable of communicating this technical expertise in either written or oral communications.
(5) Be extremely adept at organizing workload, assigning tasks, and mentoring civilian and military subordinates.
c. Unique knowledge. Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers must maintain current knowledge on Army organization, structure, and doctrine. They also must—
(1) Possess the technical expertise and operational understanding of nuclear and related weapons effects relative to
their FA.
(2) Remain current on developments in research and applications in both the civilian and military environments for
possible application to their area of expertise.
d. Unique attributes. Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers must possess the highest standards of discretion,
integrity, and professional ethic. In addition they will—
(1) Be both technologically and operationally oriented.
(2) Think in the abstract and be able to apply the engineering approach to problem solving.
(3) Be able to obtain a top secret clearance with access to sensitive compartmented information.
36–3. Critical Nuclear and Counterproliferation functional area officer
a. General. Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA assignments or entry into a Nuclear and Counterproliferation
advanced civil schooling program usually commences when an officer completes his CPT–level basic branch developmental assignments. Officers may submit their request to serve in the Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA to HRC
through the preference submission tab in the HRC Assignment Interactive Model (AIM). This information notifies both
HRC and the FA 52 proponent of an officers desire to serve in the Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA. This
information will be used to identify those officers with the requisite skills, educational background, and experience
needed for service in the Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA. Because of the limited number of FA 52 authorizations
for CPTs, most officers will not receive Nuclear and Counterproliferation assignments until after attending an FA 52
sponsored advanced civil schooling program or undergoing the Career Field Designation Board after selection to MAJ
and designation into their career fields.
b. Nuclear and Counterproliferation functional area qualification and development. Officers should complete the
Nuclear and Counterproliferation (FA 52) Course (NCP52C) prior to their initial assignment to an FA 52 position.
Those unable to attend prior to their initial assignment should attend during their 1st year in an FA 52 assignment. As
officers progress through their careers, they will be afforded other FA–related and Army–unique educational opportunities based upon their performance of duties and the needs of the Army.
(1) Captain. The years following completion of basic branch developmental assignments are an opportunity for
Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers to attend advanced civil school and begin a FA utilization tour prior to career
field designation, currently conducted in year 10. Selected officers will be afforded the opportunity to early career field
designate into the Institutional Support career field; FA 52 (ISCF/52) by electing to attend FA 52 sponsored advanced
civil schooling after completion of basic branch developmental assignments. The preferred entry into advanced civil
schooling, in support of either the ISCF/52 early career field designation option or in support of instructor requirements

386

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

for the USMA Department of Physics or Department of Chemistry and Life Sciences is the 7th year of service. There
are limited opportunities for officers to serve in Nuclear and Counterproliferation CPT assignments without attending
ACS following completion of basic branch developmental assignments.
(2) Major. After selection to MAJ, officers will be designated into 1 of 4 OPMS 3 career fields by a career field
designation board. Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers (ISCF/52) will then serve primarily in their FA, with an
occasional opportunity for assignment to a branch immaterial position. These branch immaterial billets provide Nuclear
and Counterproliferation officers the opportunity to continue to sustain the knowledge and understanding of the
operational force. All Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers must complete the requirements to obtain MEL 4.
When ILE is fully implemented, MEL 4 qualification for FA 52 officers will consist of the completion of the
Command and General Staff Officer’s Course Common Core Curriculum (ILE phase 1) and the FA 52 Qualification
Course (NCP52C) (ILE phase 2). There is no required sequence for the completion of the 2 phases of ILE. Some will
complete graduate school to prepare for Nuclear and Counterproliferation officer assignments requiring additional
skills. FA 52 MAJs will serve in Army, Joint and DOD organizations and on combatant command staffs to provide
them a foundation in nuclear and related weapons of mass destructions skills. Functional area 52 MAJs should develop
skills in basic nuclear and related weapons effects and weapons effects modeling and simulation, and understand the
interagency relationships of the organizations that are included in the nuclear and related weapons of mass destruction
community. Functional area 52 MAJs will compete against other officers in the Institutional Support career field for
promotion to LTC.
(3) Lieutenant colonel. LTCs are generally assigned to senior staff positions, where they can fully use their
knowledge of the Army and their FA. Since there are fewer functional integrator positions at this grade, officers will
mainly serve in their FA. A limited number of opportunities exist for FA 52 officers to attend graduate school, at both
the master’s and Ph.D. levels, to prepare them for FA 52 assignments requiring additional skills. Functional area 52
LTCs should continue to maintain their technical skills while expanding their influence in the nuclear and related
weapons of mass destruction community by serving in key staff and supervisory positions. Functional area 52 LTCs
will compete against other officers in the Institutional Support career field for promotion to COL.
(4) Colonel. All Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers selected for COL should apply for Senior Service College
(non–resident) Corresponding Studies Course if not selected for the resident course. As senior practitioners in their FA,
they will primarily serve as Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers on Army, Joint, or DOD staffs, or may be
assigned to functional integrator positions.
c. Branch immaterial assignments. CPTs and above can expect to serve in branch immaterial assignments. These
billets are not identified with a specific branch or FA, but are important to the Army. As a minimum, officers can
expect to complete one 24–36 month branch immaterial assignment prior to selection for COL.
d. Joint. Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA positions are on the Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL). Officers
assigned to those billets may attend Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) and may be designated as a Joint
Specialty Officer (skill identifier 3L) upon successful tour completion. Additionally, a number of Nuclear and
Counterproliferation officer positions are found in Joint and DOD agencies, even though that position may not be listed
on the JDAL. Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers are not generally considered for Joint duty assignments until
selected for MAJ. Even though Joint experience is important to the Army and individual officers for advancement into
senior leadership positions, not all Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers will receive Joint assignments. This will
not preclude their selection to the rank of COL.
36–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
The assignment sequencing in an FA is not as rigid as that of a branch. However, the professional development of
Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA officers has certain requirements to ensure all of the Army’s Nuclear and
Counterproliferation officers are well grounded in operations. Officers will receive their initial FA training through
attendance of the Nuclear and Counterproliferation (FA 52) Course (NCP52C) at the Defense Nuclear Weapons
School, Kirtland, AFB, NM. FA52 officers, less those assigned as instructors at USMA, can anticipate that their first
assignment will be with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. As the organization with the largest number of assigned
FA 52 officers, an entry–level assignment at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency will serve as a foundation for
future assignments within the nuclear weapons and related weapons of mass destruction communities. As part of their
continued development, they may also serve at least 1 assignment in a branch immaterial position.
a. Preferences. .The Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA has multiple opportunities that allow for numerous career
development paths. The goal of the professional development of FA 52 officers is to produce officers with a broad base
of skills in multiple areas of nuclear research, nuclear operation and counterproliferation, and to apply those skills
across the full spectrum of weapons of mass destruction operations. Assignments in the Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA will be made to develop the officer’s ability to achieve that goal. Requests from officers for assignments that
do not contribute to achieving this goal will likely be rejected. Functional area 52 assignments are aligned into 4
general categories— Defense Threat Reduction Agency; USMA; combatant command/4–star headquarters; and all
others. Throughout a career, an FA 52 officer could anticipate assignment to each of the 4 general categories, though
service as an instructor at USMA is limited to those who meet the specific requirements established by the various

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

387

academic departments. For additional information on the organizations and positions found in each general category,
contact the FA 52 assignments officer at HRC or the FA 52 personnel proponent manager at USANCA.
b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental FA positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility on the
sequence of assignments. Most Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA billets will be designated as requiring advanced
education, either military or civilian. Officers assigned to those jobs must complete the required courses prior to
reporting to their duty assignments.
36–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Nuclear and Counterproliferation functional area life cycle. Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers will be
24–36 months in length. Officers serving their initial, entry–level assignment at Defense Threat Reduction Agency can
anticipate that it will be 48 months in length, with the goal for the officer to serve 24 months in each of 2 different
directorates in the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. Tours could be longer in areas of high concentration of billets
such as the National Capital Region. Outside continental United States locations will continue to require specific tour
lengths.
b. Key Nuclear and Counterproliferation functional area qualification positions. There are no specific Nuclear and
Counterproliferation FA assignments that are considered key developmental assignments. Completion of the applicable
level courses as outlined in paragraph 36–3, and successful completion of a Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA tour
are the only requirements for initial FA development at the field grade level. Though preferred, there is no requirement
for a Nuclear and Counterproliferation officer to have completed a previous FA assignment prior to assignment to a
Joint command or agency.
36–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers. To do
this, the field grade inventory must be optimized in order to fulfill FA and functional integrator authorization
requirements and to provide field grade officers sufficient time for FA development prior to promotion to LTC and
COL. Sufficient inventory must be available to meet authorization requirements, while allowing sufficient FA 52
officers to attend professional military education, functional training and advanced civilian education required for the
positions in which they will later serve.
b. Implementation. The number of FA 52 authorizations, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions are made
and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more information on current authorizations or inventory, by
grade, should contact either the FA 52 personnel proponent or the FA 52 assignments officer at HRC.
36–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives/alternatives for the Nuclear and Counterproliferation functional
area
a. Structure. Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers serve at echelons above the operational Army worldwide.
Functional area 52 positions exist in Army agencies, headquarters staffs, Joint commands, and defense and national
agencies. The majority of Nuclear and Counterproliferation–related billets will be in Joint and defense agencies.
b. Acquire. Officers may submit their request to serve in Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA to HRC through the
preference submission tab in the HRC Assignment Interactive Model (AIM). This information notifies both HRC and
the FA 52 proponent of an officers desire to serve in the Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA. This information will be
used to identify those officers with the requisite skills, educational background and experience needed for service in the
Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA.
c. Distribute. After designation into the Institutional Support career field at the grade of MAJ, all Nuclear and
Counterproliferation the Command Management Division (CMD), Officer Personnel Management Directorate, at HRC,
will manage officer assignments.
d. Develop.
(1) General. Functional area 52 incorporates a professional officer development career plan offering maximum
diversity for schooling and assignment. As Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers progress through their careers, in
addition to advanced military schooling opportunities, they become eligible for advanced civil schooling in nuclear
related fields. These are available at a wide variety of academic institutions, and prepare them for positions of
increased responsibility and augment their technical expertise.
(2) Intermediate level education. ISCF/52 officers will attend the 12–week common core course, ILE (phase 1), in
residence at a course location site. At a course location site, officers are Intermediate Staff College (ISC) graduates and
credentialed Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) Level 1 qualification. Full ILE credit is awarded when the
officer has completed the common core (ILE phase 1) and the Nuclear and Counterproliferation (FA52) Course
(NCP52C) (ILE phase 2) at the Defense Nuclear weapons School. There is no required sequence for the completion of
the 2 phases of ILE. Full ILE credit is required prior to promotion to LTC.
e. Sustain. Officers in the Institutional Support career field will compete within their career field for promotions to
LTC and COL.
f. Compensate. Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers will be financially compensated in the same manner as all

388

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

other officers. A majority of Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA billets requires officers with specialized degrees.
Therefore, fully funded advanced civilian education opportunities exist for FA 52 officers at both the master’s and
Ph.D. levels.
g. Separate. Functional area 52 officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
36–8. Nuclear and Counterproliferation Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. Reserve Component describes both the Army Reserve and Army National Guard
and, unless otherwise indicated, references to the RC are applicable to both. Reserve Component officers serve the
same roles as their Active Army counterparts. The unique circumstances within the RC pose a challenge for professional development. Reserve Component officers are expected to follow Active Army officer development patterns as
closely as possible, except that RC officers have, in some cases, increased windows to complete mandatory education
requirements. To meet professional development objectives, RC FA 52 officers must be willing to rotate among ARNG
and the USAR TPU, individual mobilization augmentee programs, and the AGR program (see chap 7 for RC officer
development).
b. Reserve Component officer qualification and development. Reserve Component Nuclear and Counterproliferation
(FA 52) officers can expect assignments that are similar to their AC counterparts. The exception is that these
assignments will also include those separate RC FA 52, administrative, and operational reporting requirements unique
to the ARNG and USAR. The success of an RC officer is not measured by the length of service in any one component
or control group, but by the officer’s breadth of experience, duty performance, and adherence to the requirements
described herein. Every attempt will be made to assign RC Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers to FA 52 or
branch immaterial positions. Unlike their Active Army counterparts, geographic constraints limit the ability of RC
officers to stay in FA 52 positions throughout their career. When barriers such as this deny the opportunity to
successfully participate in the USAR, officers are encouraged to seek qualification and utilization in another FA.
Reserve Component qualification standards will mirror those of the Active Army whenever possible. They are as
follows:
(1) Lieutenant. Not applicable.
(2) Captain. There are limited requirements for RC FA 52 CPTs and these are considered entry level. Nuclear and
Counterproliferation FA experience as a CPT is not a requirement for promotion to MAJ, but would enhance selection
for future service in the FA.
(3) Major. Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers may continue serve primarily in their FA, with an occasional
opportunity for assignment to a branch immaterial position. These billets ensure Nuclear and Counterproliferation
officers continue to sustain the knowledge and understanding of the operational force. All RC FA 52 officers should
complete 50 percent of CGSC. Reserve Component FA 52 officers should attend the Nuclear and Counterproliferation
(FA 52) Course (NCP52C) during their 1st year of assignment to an FA 52 entry–level position. Functional area 52
MAJ positions can be found in TPU, individual mobilization augmentee, and AGR programs.
(4) Lieutenant colonel. Reserve Component FA 52 LTCs should complete CGSC within 3 years of promotion to
LTC. Functional area 52 positions can be found in TPU and individual mobilization augmentee programs, with
positions in the AGR program anticipated. Reserve Component FA 52 MAJs should develop skills in basic nuclear and
related weapons effects and weapons effects modeling and simulation, and understand the interagency relationships of
the organizations that are included in the nuclear and related weapons of mass destruction community.
(5) Colonel. All Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers selected for COL should apply for Senior Service College
(non–resident) Corresponding Studies Course if not selected for the resident course. Currently, because of the limited
number of RC FA 52 COL positions, officers selected for COL can expect to serve primarily in branch immaterial
positions.

Chapter 37
Strategic Plans and Policy Functional Area
37–1. Purpose
a. Unique purpose of Strategic Plans and Policy functional area. Officers in FA 59 are a highly trained cadre of
experts that provide Army organizations, combatant commands, the Joint staff, and the interagency community the
capability for strategic analysis in support of the development and implementation of plans and policies at the national
strategic and theater strategic levels. These officers possess unique comprehensive strategic expertise acquired through
formal schooling, self–development, and experience gained in a variety of repetitive FA assignments. Functional area
59 officers serve in both the institutional and the operational Army and specialize in the creation, deployment,
employment, sustainment, and recovery of the land component of the Joint/multinational force. Through assignments
within the institutional Army these officers directly support the 10 USC responsibilities of DA and the 10 USC
responsibilities of the Secretary of Defense concerning the strategic direction of the DOD.
b. Unique functions performed by Strategic Plans and Policy functional area. Functional area 59 officers execute

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

389

key institutional and operational core processes, including— formulation and implementation of strategy and strategic
concepts and policies, and the generation, strategic projection, and operational employment of decisive Joint and
coalition land combat power.
c. Unique features of work in Strategic Plans and Policy functional area.
(1) Officers in FA 59 specialize in the development and implementation of national level strategic plans and
policies; theater strategy and planning; and the development of concepts for deploying and employing military forces at
the operational and strategic levels of warfare; particularly as these relate to Army force requirements and capabilities.
FA 59 officers are experts on national defense issues and possess a deep understanding of the domestic and
geo–strategic security environment. This strategic work is performed primarily in Army and Joint organizations and
staffs, within DOD level organizations and agencies, and within the interagency. Effective performance of these duties
often requires extensive interface and coordination with national and international organizations and their senior
officials and with civilian and military academic and defense analysis institutions. Although the bulk of such work is
goal oriented, its results may only become apparent over a long period of time— particularly at the national strategic
level. Some FA 59 officers will serve in the UEx headquarters now under development and will conduct planning at
the operational level of war. Therefore, FA 59 officers must have a solid foundation of experience within the field
Army, complemented by extensive education and experience in Joint and multinational force planning and
employment.
(2) Key functions performed by FA 59 officers include—
(a) Analyzing national security policy and strategy to develop and articulate assessments and recommendations to
senior military and civilian decisionmakers.
(b) Contributing to the formulation of national security strategy and policies.
(c) Assessing Army, Joint and multinational force requirements, capabilities, and plans against the requirements
identified in the national security and national military strategies and those identified by the combatant commanders.
(d) Developing operational and strategic level Army and Joint warfighting concepts.
(e) Teaching and developing curriculum to support Senior Service College education in military theory, the strategic
arts, national security policy, and strategic and operational warfare.
37–2. Officer characteristics required
a. Competencies and actions common to all. Army officers must be “decathletes” and or multifunctional. They must
be competent across the spectrum of conflict with the ability to effectively apply the 4 core leadership dimensions of
values, attributes, skills, and actions as articulated in FM 22–100.
b. Unique skills. FA 59 officers demonstrate mastery of the overall skills, knowledge, and attributes common to
Institutional Support career field officers, particularly staff, management, and leadership skills. With these skills, FA 59
officers have the capability to—
(1) Operate effectively in high–pressure senior level staff assignments where guidance may be minimal and close
interaction with senior level decisionmakers is frequent.
(2) Communicate clearly, concisely, accurately, and persuasively (both orally and in writing) highly technical,
complex, or conceptual subjects to support senior leader strategic decisionmaking.
(3) Apply analytically rigorous methods to develop feasible, suitable, and acceptable innovative solutions to complicated strategic challenges across the spectrum of conflict.
(4) Exploit fully the capabilities of automated and collaborative web–based analytical decision aids to enhance the
speed and accuracy of time sensitive staff work and coordination.
(5) Establish and sustain an effective collaborative network of personal contacts within large military staff organizations and with other governmental departments and agencies and non–governmental organizations.
(6) Apply comprehensive leadership skills to effectively organize, train, and lead standing or ad hoc staff groups
which may consist of any mixture of U.S. and coalition soldiers, military civilians, interagency government employees,
and nongovernmental civilians; including the coaching and mentoring of group members.
c. Unique knowledge. Strategic plans and policy officers require specialized knowledge in strategic matters and
must—
(1) Understand the organization, structure, and doctrine/operating principals of the institutional and operational
Army and, more generally, that of the other Services, as well as, DOD, the Joint staff, the combatant commands, U.S.
military alliances, and the U.S. Government; particularly the distribution of authority, roles, missions, and functions,
and responsibilities engendered by the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, and the Goldwater–Nichols Act.
(2) Understand the integration of the Army’s capabilities that enable the prosecution of effective combined arms
land combat within the context of Joint and multinational warfare; particularly the integration of Joint and service
planning, resourcing and warfighting systems at the strategic, theater strategic, and operational levels of war.
(3) Understand the domestic political and constitutional context in which DOD provides for national security and in
which the Army must fulfill its 10 USC and 32 USC responsibilities; particularly the formal and informal systems that
operate the U.S. Government.

390

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(4) Understand the key issues at work within the domestic and geo–strategic security environments and their
implications for US national security strategy and policies.
(5) Understand broadly the formal and informal procedures and processes for resourcing DOD and for developing
the national security strategy and national military strategy; particularly the Joint Strategic Planning System (JSPS),
and the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS).
(6) Understand the missions, roles, and functions of the combatant commands and the various defense agencies and
those agencies of other departments that support military operations.
(7) Understand in detail the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES).
d. Unique attributes. Functional area 59 officers are expected to live the Army Values and display the same traits of
character and leadership expected of every other professional officer. In addition to these, the strategist must display
the following personal attributes and abilities:
(1) Highly developed analytical and problem solving skills allowing him/her to rapidly conceptualize and develop
creative feasible solutions to complex strategic challenges.
(2) Ability to clearly and concisely convey complicated conceptual or analytical material through any medium and
in a manner so that senior military and civilian leaders easily understand.
(3) Intellectually inquisitive; both capable of rapidly understanding even the most rapidly evolving complex international situation and of mastering topics across the spectrum of strategy related fields through a lifetime of learning and
self–development.
(4) Poised, confident, and unflinchingly honest in dealing with senior leaders including time sensitive high–pressure
situations and possessing the moral courage to state and defend positions.
37–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
The experience gained by LTs and CPTs during basic branch assignments becomes the foundation for future effectiveness as an FA 59 officer. All officers will attend a branch CCC and are encouraged to seek company command, which
together provide critical leader development experience. CPTs who have a strong interest in becoming strategists
should signal their intentions using the HRC established link on AKO. The proponent and HRC will personally contact
officers who have indicated a desire to become strategists. Most CPTs will not serve in strategist positions prior to
career field designation; however, CPTs are encouraged to seek advanced civil schooling opportunities and planning
assignments at the operational level to enhance their understanding of strategy related fields and of higher level
military planning and warfare.
a. Functional area experience and development. Functional area 59 officers are expected to serve in positions of
increasing responsibility throughout their careers. The Officer Education System outlines critical FA experiences under
the ILE portion. The ILE will consist of a 14–week common core course taught by the Command and General Staff
Officer College (CGSOC) at selected Distance Education locations. Officers who complete this instruction receive
MEL 4 credit. Officers will then attend the 14–week Basic Strategic Arts Program at Carlisle Barracks, PA to enhance
their understanding of strategic planning and policy development. While an advanced academic degree is not required,
it is highly recommended that officers attain 1 in a strategy related field. Additionally, FA 59 provides several training/
fellowship opportunities that provide specialized policy and strategy education and experience. All FA 59 officers
should seek developmental opportunities (education, seminars, symposia, speaking engagements, writing for publication) to enrich their personal and professional knowledge of the development of plans and policy at the national
strategic and theater strategic level.
(1) Captain.
(a) Training and education. Functional area 59 has no authorizations for CPTs; however, officers who seek strategic
planning/education experience should apply for the Army G–3 Harvard Strategist Program. This annual, HQDA
selected board considers officers with outstanding branch and academic backgrounds for attendance at the Mid Career
Masters Program in Public Administration at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University. Upon
acceptance and graduation, officers serve a 2–year utilization tour on the Army staff; typically within G–3. Some
officers selected to teach at the USMA may attend advanced civil schooling for a graduate degree in a strategic plans
and policy related discipline while serving as a CPT.
(b) Career field designation. After selection for promotion to MAJ, officers are designated into their career field.
Those officers accessed in strategic plans and policy will serve in future assignments either in FA 59 or in generalist
(branch immaterial) billets.
(2) Major.
(a) Education. All FA 59 officers (year group 94 to present), will complete MEL 4 schooling, and the Basic
Strategic Arts Program. Officers seeking additional education in planning should request enrollment in the Advanced
Military Studies Program, which is a competitively selected year long resident course taught by the School of
Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) at CGSC. For FA 59 officers, the Advanced Military Studies Program provides
these specially educated officers key skills in operational planning. Officers who complete the Advanced Military
Studies Program can expect to be assigned to plans and policy positions within the UEy/UEx. If selected for attendance
to foreign military schools or other service colleges, officers should take strategy related and warfighting doctrine

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

391

courses and electives. Sister Service education opportunities include the School of Advanced Warfighting (SAWS) and
the School of Advanced Air and Space Studies. The newly established Joint Advanced Warfighting School (JAWS)
provides a Joint education opportunity.
(b) Utilization. Most FA 59 MAJs will serve in TDA assignments that provide FA experience in either plans or
policy positions at the UEx, UEy, HQDA, MACOM/COCOM or Joint and Combined Staffs. No FA 59 position is
considered more important or essential than another. Performance of duty is the key to success. If not serving in an FA
59 position, officers should seek to serve in branch/FA generalist positions that enhance their ability to develop and
enhance their skills in operational and strategic planning, force requirements, and concepts; ideally within higher level
staffs.
(3) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Education. An HQDA board determines selection for resident or non–resident Senior Service College for eligible
LTCs and COLs. Senior Service College selected officers should consider competing for fellowships that would further
develop their skills, experience base, and FA 59 qualifications. Officers who attend Senior Service College should seek
FA 59 related electives. Strategists attending Senior Service Office or MEL 1 fellowships, who do not yet have a
master’s degree, are encouraged to complete a master’s program in conjunction with their Senior Service College or
fellowship experience.
(b) Utilization. Normally, FA 59 officers will have completed at least 1 assignment in an FA 59 coded position prior
to being assigned to an FA 59 position as an LTC. Functional area 59 LTCs should strive for key branch/FA generalist
and other developmental positions; especially staff positions at Army Service Component Command (ASCC) or higher
levels, Joint assignments, or nominative assignments. The intent is, through a variety of strategy related staff assignments throughout DOD, to develop officers well–versed in both plans and policy and able to succeed in any higher
level strategic plans or policy assignment; including those in coalition or interagency environments.
(4) Colonel.
(a) Education. A COL’s formal military education requirement is successful completion of a recognized SSC
program. The goal should be completion of resident Senior Service College, a MEL 1 fellowship, the Army War
College Distance Education Course or a foreign military school. A master’s/MMAS or doctoral degree in an appropriate discipline is strongly encouraged.
(b) Utilization. Functional area 59 COLs must have successfully completed at least 2 previous strategic plans and
policy assignments before being assigned to an O–6 FA 59 position. Only those FA 59 COLs with ASCC or higher,
and Joint experience will be recommended for interagency assignments.
b. Critical officer developmental assignments. Although every FA 59 position is critical to the success of Army and
the Joint force, there are no positions that are “critical” for career progression as a strategist. In the end, it is manner of
performance rather than duty position that determines if an officer is promoted or selected for particular schools or
assignments. All officers are highly encouraged to seek demanding, challenging assignments that maximize their
professional development and provide both width and depth of experience.
c. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Strategists can expect to serve in non–FA 59 coded positions
when those positions require the special skills and capabilities that FA 59 officers possess such as O1A billets on
senior planning staffs. However, branch immaterial assignments such as ROTC, USMA staff and faculty, and Inspector
General will typically be by exception only.
d. Joint assignments. All assignment rules concerning Joint positions apply to FA 59 officers. Joint qualification is
not a prerequisite for promotion to any field grade. Nonetheless, because of the developmental benefits of such an
assignment, all FA 59 officers should seek Joint duty.
37–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. As discussed in paragraph 37–3, the Strategic Plans and Policy FA has diverse opportunities that
allow for numerous career development paths; all of which are equally viable. Specific assignments in this FA are
made in order to develop well–rounded highly qualified strategists who are operationally oriented and able to serve
effectively anywhere within DOD, in the interagency, or with our coalition partners.
b. Precedence. Assignments to Strategic Plans and Policy officer positions begin after FA 59 designation. Functional
area 59 officers will receive repetitive assignments within the FA. Job sequencing is not critical, however, strategists
should seek a variety assignments at various levels in both planning and policy development to broaden their
experience and knowledge base.
37–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Strategic Plans and Policy functional area experience. Most assignments to Strategic Plans and Policy positions
will be 24 to 36 months in length (see examples fig 37–1).
b. Strategic Plans and Policy functional area life cycle. Figure 37–1 displays the FA 59 life cycle with FA
qualifying and developmental positions.

37–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a sustainable, viable career path for FA 59 officers. To accomplish this, the field
grade inventory must be optimized to fulfill FA and branch/FA generalist requirements while also providing field grade
officers with sufficient opportunities to gain critical experience in variety of assignments. The experience gained
through such a variety of assignments strengthens their files prior to consideration for promotion to LTC and COL.
b. Officer Personnel Management System implementation. The number of Strategic Plans and Policy authorizations,
by grade, will vary as force structure decisions are made and implemented. Officers desiring more information on
current authorizations or inventory should contact either the Strategic Plans and Policy personnel proponency office in
Army G–3, or the FA 59 assignments officer at AHRC OPMD.
37–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Strategic Plans and Policy
a. Structure. As with the other FA based career fields, FA 59 reflects the field grade structure of the OPMS III
career field based management system. All FA 59 authorizations are in the field grades.
b. Acquire. The principal method of accessing FA 59 officers will be the career field designation process. Functional
area 59 officers accessed as MAJs will have strong files that reflect successful completion of critical basic branch
experiences. Although not required for accession into FA 59, company level command is an important developmental
assignment that provides indicators of an officer’s aptitude for successful service as a strategist. Officers already
accessed into other FAs who may be considering an FA transfer into Strategic Plans and Policy should contact the FA
59 proponent or HRC. Senior MAJs and junior LTCs with strong files and relevant experience (planning and policy)
will be favorably considered. While there is no need to acquire an officer with any special degrees at this time, a bench
of officers with certain degrees and skill sets is certainly desirable. For Strategic Plans and Policy officers, undergraduate or graduate degrees in political science, international relations, history, government, economics, area studies, and
other social sciences are desirable. Because of the need for a very broad grounding in the Army early in their careers,
direct commissioning into FA 59 is not an option.
c. Distribute. The Functional Area Division, Officer Personnel Management Directorate, at AHRC will manage all
strategist FA officer assignments after designation into the Institutional Support career field at the grade of MAJ.
d. Deploy. Regardless of current assignment, Strategic Plans and Policy officers must remain personally and
professionally prepared to deploy worldwide.
e. Sustain. Promotions will be based predominantly on Army requirements and the promotion goal is expected to be
at or near DOPMA rates. FA 59 officers will be eligible for below–the–zone promotions. Selection will be based on
clearly superior performance over a career, not just in FA 59 coded duty positions. At this time, Institutional Support
career field FA 59 officers are not eligible for field grade level command selection.
f. Develop. All FA 59 officers (YG 1994 to present) will complete the ILE common core course and the Basic
Strategic Arts Program (BSAP) after selection for Major and career field designation. Officers are encouraged to seek
civil schooling and consider fellowships in strategy related fields that will broaden their professional backgrounds.
g. Separate. FA 59 officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
37–8. Strategic Plans and Policy Reserve Component (RC) Officers
a. General career development. Reserve Component Strategic Plans and Policy officer development objectives and
desired experiences basically parallel those planned for their Active Army counterparts. Due to the complexity and
detailed understanding of Army systems and functions required to serve effectively in this FA, junior officers must
develop a strong foundation through assignments in their branch before FA work begins.
b. Assignment Opportunities. RC Strategic Plans and Policy officers can expect assignment opportunities that mirror
those of AC officers, as well as positions applicable exclusively to the RC. RC FA 59 officers serve at all levels within
the Department of Defense, and consequently must fully understand and be able to articulate the roles, missions and
composition of the RC as an integral component of the Army. The success of an RC Strategic Plans and Policy officer
is not measured by length of service in any one component or control group, but by the officer’s breadth of experience,
duty performance, within the FA. Strategic Plans and Policy assignments are limited primarily to AGR and IMA.
Strategic-level civilian acquired skills, advanced military and civilian education, and demonstrated abilities to function
in a strategic environment are highly desirable for assignment to any RC FA 59 position.
c. Functional area development opportunities.
(1) The unique nature of the RC soldier’s role as a citizen–soldier poses a challenge for professional development.
However, RC officers are expected to follow AC officer development patterns as closely as possible, except that RC
officers have increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. To meet professional development
objectives, RC officers must be willing to rotate between ARNG and USAR Troop Program Units (TPU), Individual
Ready Reserve (IRR), Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) Program, and the Active Guard and Reserve (AGR)
Programs. These transfers are necessitated by geographical considerations, as well as the need to provide as many

394

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

officers as possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions. Additionally, there may be
occasions when RC officers will be transferred to the IRR while they complete mandatory educational requirements.
Such transfers will be temporary and should not be seen as impacting negatively on the officer’s career.
(2) Due to the complexity and diversity of assignments in FA 59, RC officers assigned to these positions must
continually develop their knowledge and analytical skills. RC officers awarded FA 59 will be offered the opportunity to
pursue continuing education opportunities (civilian and military), and government internship programs. FA59 Officers
in the grade of Major should strive to attend resident BSAP, and complete the Defense Strategy Course (online).
d. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for Strategic Plans and Policy officers will
essentially mirror that for AC officers, except that assignments will not be limited to one component or control group
within a component. Figure 37–2 illustrates a typical RC FA 59 career.

Chapter 38
Introduction to the Information Operations Career Field
38–1. Information Operations career field
Information Operations career field (IOCF) officers are highly trained leaders, warfighters, and specialists capable of
integrating and optimizing the Army’s relevant information, intelligence, information systems, public affairs, space
operations and simulations to gain information dominance. The IOCF brings together a cadre of professional, dedicated
officers in the related disciplines of information operations that provide the Army and DOD with the mental agility to
thrive in all conditions, anywhere, anytime, with the capability of operating with a Joint and expeditionary mindset.
The IOCF provides officers who fully understand and capitalize on the opportunities and challenges presented by the
accelerating growth of information systems and capabilities. The IOCF coordinator is the CG, TRADOC.
38–2. Unique features of the Information Operations career field
a. The IOCF FAs are an integral part of the Army Team and are composed of officers highly trained and skilled in
the techniques of information operations; technically and tactically competent, they provide relevant and credible
support to the Army and DOD decisionmakers. The IOCF FA officers provide commanders a specialized capability for
planning, developing, and integrating information operations to support military operations across the full spectrum and
at all levels of war.
b. The IOCF is 1 of 4 career fields established under the OPMS and is comprised of 7 distinct FAs— Telecommunication Systems Engineering (FA 24), Information Operations (FA 30), Strategic Intelligence (FA 34), Space Operations
(FA 40), Public Affairs (FA 46), Information Systems Management (FA 53), and Simulations Operations (FA 57). The
IOCF officers perform a wide range of missions which include, but not limited to— designing and developing
telecommunications networks; planning and integrating offensive and defensive information operations; developing
collecting and producing intelligence requirements and the acquisition of intelligence and information; developing
space estimates and analysis and conducting space operations; media facilitation and developing and executing
information strategies; planning, managing, and maintaining computer networks and information technology resources;
and conducting training, exercises, mission planning and mission rehearsals with simulations, developing future
simulations, and integrating simulations with battle command systems.
38–3. Composition
a. The Telecommunication Systems Engineering FA (FA 24) provides the Army with a core of professional
telecommunications systems engineers, who engineer, design, develop, install, implement, integrate, test, accept, and
upgrade tactical, strategic and sustaining base wired and wireless ground–based (terrestrial) and space–based (satellite)
telecommunications systems and networks enterprise–wide in support of Army, Joint, combined, and coalition operations worldwide.
b. The Information Operations FA (FA 30) officers employ the core capabilities of electronic warfare, computer
network operations, psychological operations, military deception, and operations security, in concert with specified
supporting and related capabilities, to affect or defend information and information systems, and to influence decisionmaking. Information Operations are enabling operations that create and present opportunities for decisive operations.
The FA 30 officer provides the commanders integrated and synchronized offensive and defensive Information Operations simultaneously to accomplish the mission, increase their force effectiveness, and protect their organizations and
systems. All Information Operations are inherently Joint operations.
c. The Strategic Intelligence FA (FA 34) coordinates, supervises, and participates in all phases of the intelligence
cycle— planning and direction; collection; processing and exploitation; analysis and production; dissemination and
integration; and evaluation and feedback. This includes providing indications, warning and crisis intelligence support,
supporting Army and unified command intelligence requirements, developing Army and Joint intelligence doctrine,
developing Army and Joint intelligence architecture, coordinating support requirements, and providing targeting
support. Develops collection requirements and plans, including the use of strategic and theater level collections
resources. Develops production requirements to include support to Effects Based Information Operations and Targeting.
Evaluates, interprets, analyzes and produces intelligence products in support of DOD, unified command, and Army
requirements.
d. Space Operations (FA 40) provides the Army with a core of space–smart professionals. These officers synchronize, optimize, and deconflict the use of space–based resources with the commander’s staff and across the battlefield
operating systems. Officers follow a career path to obtain operational experience spanning from the tactical to the

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

397

strategic levels in space related assignments that focus on providing space-based products and force enablers to
warfighters. This FA provides 2 distinct career paths— space operations officer (AOC 40A) and astronaut (AOC 40C).
AOC 40A officers provide commanders with expertise and guidance on conducting the space component of information operations, which enhances a command’s ability to task, collect, process and act on space–based products,
information, warnings and space–related capabilities. The AOC 40C provides the opportunity for officers specially
selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to serve as astronauts for exploration of space.
Army doctrine, tactics, techniques and procedures are becoming increasingly dependent on space products and
capabilities for successful operations. The FA 40 officers in non–tactical assignments, formulate policy, develop
operational concepts, conduct research, develop technologies, evaluate and implement the tactics, techniques, and
procedures for the operation and use of space. This core of space professionals furnishes the Army officers who are
well versed and experienced in the integration of Army and Joint space capabilities in military operations. Functional
area 40 officers are dedicated to providing commanders and their units with relevant, timely, and accurate space–based
information, and capabilities.
e. The Public Affairs FA (FA 46) fulfills the Army’s obligation to keep the American people and the Army
informed. Relationships between the Army and its public affect the conditions that lead to confidence in America’s
Army and its ability to conduct operations in peacetime, conflict and war. The Public Affairs FA includes— media
facilitation, developing and executing information strategies, maintaining community relations, conducting public
affairs planning and training. Public Affairs is a command responsibility, FA 46 officers serve on the commander’s
personal staff and are the commander’s primary advisor on all public affairs issues.
f. The Information Systems Management FA (FA 53) provides the Army with a core of professional information
systems managers to support the Nation’s full spectrum dominance strategy for the 21st century. Information Systems
Management officers plan, manage, administer, maintain, and secure computer systems, computer networks, and
associated information technology resources in support of Army, Joint, combined and coalition operations worldwide.
Information Systems Management officers design, develop, install, implement, integrate, test, and accept computer
hardware, software, systems, and networks.
g. The Simulations Operations FA (FA 57) is about warfighting. The operational focus is on the integration of
appropriate modeling and simulation (M&S) tools with battle command systems to assist commanders in meeting their
mission readiness requirements either during training or real world military operations. Functional area 57 officers are
experienced leaders who understand the varied dynamics associated with unit readiness training. Functional area 57
officers understand the applications, interfaces, and operational requirements of battle command systems. The scope of
work will range from single domain Army only training events (for example, use of constructive simulations for
company battle drill training), management of Army training aids, devices, simulations, simulators (TADSS) to major
exercises or mission rehearsals involving Joint or multinational participants, incorporating all aspects of the live,
virtual, and constructive environments in conjunction with battle command systems.
38–4. Career options
a. General considerations. The IOCF officers pursue a professional development model as specified by their
individual FA Proponency. Functional area qualification criteria are unique to each FA and are addressed in their
respective chapters in DA Pam 600–3. However, as a minimum, each IOCF officer must have completed the Command
and General Staff Officer’s Common Core Course (Intermediate Staff College (ISC), their individual Functional Area
Qualification Course and served in an FA qualifying assignment. Officers in the IOCF are not afforded Command
Selection List (CSL) opportunity. However, select FAs may have requirements for command which are by nominative
assignment.
b. Functional area generalist assignments. All officers within the IOCF, regardless of FA designation, will be
eligible for assignment into an officer generalist position. These assignments require those leadership and managerial
skills common to all Army officers and are not limited to a specific branch or FA. These assignments include
USAREC, ROTC, Service School/USMA faculty and staff, Inspector General, or RC duty.
c. Joint assignments. Information Operations career field officers should aggressively seek Joint duty. Officers
assigned to positions on the Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL) broaden their knowledge base and experience, putting
them in a position to assist senior Army and DOD leaders. Officers assigned to Joint duty assignments may attend Joint
Professional Military Education (JPME) and may receive Joint Specialty Officer (JSO) designation (skill identifier 3L)
upon successful completion of a Joint assignment. The provisions of 10 USC specify that officers on the ADL may not
be appointed to the grade of BG unless they have completed a full tour of duty in a Joint duty assignment (JDA).

request to be designated as FA 24 at any time between their 5th and 10th year of service. Officers may submit such a
preference online via the HRC Web site, or contact the FA 24 assignments officer at HRC. Additionally, the FA 24
personnel Proponent will actively recruit quality CPTs to fill FA 24 requirements. Some CPTs will have an opportunity
for early CFD into FA 24.
a. Desired officer background. Officers should possess an undergraduate or graduate degree in 1 of the following
disciplines:
(1) Electrical Engineering (Communications)
(2) Telecommunication Systems Engineering

(10) Physics
b. Functional area training and development. All FA24 positions are considered functional area developmental
positions. As officers progress through their careers, they will be afforded a variety of functional area assignments and
Army unique training and educational opportunities based on their performance of duties, educational background and
the needs of the Army.
(1) Captain. FA 24 CPTs are encouraged to pursue development and utilization in Telecommunication Systems
Engineering to gain training and experience prior to career field Designation (CFD) at MAJ. CPTs accessed into FA 24
will be trained primarily by attending the Information Systems Operations Leveler (ISOL) course followed by the
Telecommunications Systems Engineering Course (TSEC) at Fort Gordon, GA. Some CPTs may be selected for fully
funded Advanced Civil Schooling (ACS) with a follow-on utilization assignment in an Army Education Requirements

(b) Director, Joint Spectrum Center
(c) Deputy Director, Battle Command Battle Lab, Fort Gordon, GA
(d) Technical advisor for an acquisition program executive office
c. Functional area qualification. All FA 24 positions are considered key and essential to professional development
in this FA, and all are FAQ positions. Functional area 24 replaces Signal AOC 25D and AOC 25E. Therefore, for the
purpose of determining FA qualification, time served in AOC 25D or AOC 25E positions is considered equivalent to
serving in FA 24A assignments.
(1) Major. In order to be FA qualified an officer must—
(a) Complete MEL 4, Command and Staff College or ILE.
(b) Complete FA training requirements outlined in paragraph 39–3a or 39–3b.
(c) Serve a total of 24 months in any FA 24 coded MAJ position.

d. Joint assignments. Many FA 24 field grade positions are on the DOD Joint Duty Assignment List. Officers

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

401

assigned to Joint Duty Assignment List billets may attend Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) II and may be
designated as a Joint Specialty Officer (skill identifier 3L) upon successful tour completion.
39–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
The assignment sequencing in an FA is not as rigid as that of a branch. However, the professional development of FA
24 officers does have certain requirements to ensure all are well–grounded in telecommunication systems engineering.
Officers must complete initial entry qualification before their 1st utilization assignment. Once officers are career field
designated FA 24, the focus of all training, education, and developmental assignments is in telecommunications
systems engineering and military operations. As part of lifelong learning and professional development, they have the
responsibility to continuously seek civilian education opportunities, industry certification and related military training.
a. Preferences. Although not required, FA 24 officers are encouraged and may be offered the opportunity to obtain a
master’s or Ph.D. degree in one of the fields of study listed in paragraph 39–3a, and/or obtain certification from
civilian industry in areas related to telecommunication systems engineering. Officers are encouraged to complete the
DOD Chief Information Officer (CIO) Certification course at the National Defense University.
b. Precedence. All officers must complete functional area training requirements outlined in paragraph 39–3a or
39–3b prior to their initial assignment in their FA. Some FA 24 billets will be designated as requiring advanced
education, either military or civilian. Officers assigned to those jobs must complete the required degree programs or
courses prior to reporting to their duty assignments.
39–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
The goal under Force Stabilization rules for most FA 24 assignments is 36 months. Tours may be longer in areas with
a high concentration of billets such as the National Capital Region. Outside continental United States locations will
continue to require specific tour lengths. Figure 39–1 depicts FA 24 developmental assignments by grade.

39–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for FA 24 officers. To do this, the field grade
inventory is optimized in order to fill functional area authorization requirements and to provide field grade officers
sufficient time for functional area qualification prior to consideration for promotion to LTC and COL. In order to
enhance specialization and development, FA24 officer participation in generalist (01A) assignments should be
minimized.
b. Structure. The number of FA24 authorizations, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions are made and
actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more information on current authorizations or inventory should
contact either the FA24 Personnel Proponent Office or the FA24 assignments officer at HRC.
39–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Telecommunication Systems Engineering
a. Structure. FA24 officers serve at all echelons worldwide. FA24 positions exist in Army division and corps units,
headquarters staffs, Joint commands and national agencies. The majority of FA24 related billets are on MACOM,
Army and Joint staffs. However, in concert with Army Transformation, FA24 officers are also assigned in the UEx and
UEy.
b. Acquire. FA24 officers are accessed in the following ways:
(1) All CPTs in the Army Competitive Category (ACC) may request FA 24 designation at any time between their
5th and 10th years of service. The request can be submitted through the HRC Web site, or by contacting the FA 24
assignment officer at HRC. Additionally, the FA 24 proponent will actively recruit quality CPTs into FA 24. Officers
accessed in this manner are dual tracked and are not guaranteed an assignment nor CFD as an FA 24. The pool of
available officers identified in this manner will be used to select those officers who will receive training and an
assignment in FA 24. This process replaces the Functional Area Designation Board (FADB).
(2) Select CPTs may receive early career field designation into FA 24 to fill company grade requirements. These
officers will have their CFD as an FA 24 revalidated upon selection for promotion to MAJ.
(3) The majority of officers receive final designation into the FA during the CFDB immediately after being selected
for promotion to MAJ. They are then single–tracked in FA 24 from MAJ through COL.
(4) Qualified officers in the Operational career field may submit a Request for Personnel Action (DA Form 4187) to
HRC to request transfer to FA 24/IOCF. Request for transfer may be approved subject to the officer’s qualifications
and the Army’s requirements in the basic branch and FA.
c. Distribute. The Career Management Division (CMD), Officer Personnel Management Directorate (OPMD) at
HRC, manages all officers serving in FA 24 assignments. Officers who complete an FA 24 assignment and are not
CFD as an FA 24 will return to the control of their basic branch manager at HRC. All CFD FA 24s (CPT through
LTC) remain under the control of CMD. FA24 COLs are managed by Colonels Division, OPMD, HRC.
d. Compensate. FA24 officers receive the same pay, entitlements and benefits as all other officers.
e. Deploy. Telecommunication Systems officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared
to deploy worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site
TDA organizations, all FA 24 officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of
operations.
f. Sustain. CPTs will compete for promotion to MAJ within the Army Competitive Category. Upon selection to
MAJ, officers career field designated as FA 24 into the IOCF will compete for promotion to LTC and COL only
against other officers within the IOCF. Officers who CFD into the IOCF as FA 24 are eligible to change their
regimental affiliation to the Signal Regiment. This can be accomplished in accordance with AR 600–82, through the
officer’s local military records officer or by contacting the FA 24 Personnel Proponent Office.
g. Develop. FA 24 incorporates a professional officer development career plan offering significant opportunity for
schooling and assignments. As FA 24 officers progress through their careers, they should seek advanced military
schooling and education opportunities to stay abreast of the rapidly changing telecommunication technology field. FA
24 officers should diversify their assignments to broaden their operational experiences and increase their skills,
knowledge and abilities in military information technology. FA 24 officers are encouraged to complete professional
training and technical certification programs or obtain a license as a professional engineer related to telecommunication
systems engineering technology.
(1) Training. FA 24 institutional training includes the following elements:
(a) Information Systems Operations Leveler Course (ISOL), Fort Gordon, GA
(b) Telecommunications Systems Engineering Course (TSEC), Fort Gordon, GA
(c) Intermediate Level Education Common Core Curriculum. FA 24 senior CPTs and MAJs will attend the ILE
Common Core in residence at a Course Location (CL) site. Normally, the CL site for FA 24 is at Fort Gordon, GA.
Upon completion of the common core course, FA 24 officers are Intermediate Staff College (ISC) graduates and
credentialed Joint Professional Military Education I (JPME I). Full ILE credit is awarded an FA 24 officer upon

404

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

completion of the ILE Common Core, the Information Systems Operations Leveler Course (ISOL), and the Telecommunications Systems Engineering Course (TSEC). The ILE common core can be taken before, after, or in conjunction
with the ISOL/TSEC course sequence. In select cases, an appropriate graduate degree program may take the place of
ISOL/TSEC for ILE credit. Full ILE credit is required prior to promotion to LTC. Reserve Component officers can
attend The Army School System (TASS) classes located in CONUS and OCONUS as well as CL sites.
(d) National Defense University. NDU offers several professional development programs that apply to FA 24. These
include the Chief Information Officer (CIO) Certificate Program and the Information Assurance Certificate Program.
(2) Civilian Training and Education. The programs below are available for FA 24 officers to enhance their skills
within their career field.
(a) Training With Industry. The TWI is a work–experience program to provide an extensive exposure to managerial
techniques and industrial procedures within corporate America to competitively selected officers and NCOs officers.
Training received is normally not available either through the military school system or civilian university system. An
officer is assigned to a 1–year tour with an approved industry partner, followed by a 2–year utilization assignment. FA
24 officers can apply for TWI by contacting their assignments officer at HRC.
(b) Signal Regiment Graduate Education Program (SRGEP). The US Army Signal Center partners with civilian
universities to provide information technology related graduate degree programs for FA 24 officers. These programs
are available worldwide online. Selected graduate classes are also available in residence at Fort Gordon, GA. Interested
officers should contact the FA 24 Proponent for more information.
(c) Information Assurance Scholarship Program (IASP). The IASP is a competitive, fully funded scholarship
program open to officers and civilians throughout the DOD. Selected officers attend graduate school full–time and earn
a master’s or doctorate degree in the field of Information Assurance. Officers interested in this program should contact
their assignments officer at HRC.
(3) Self–Development. FA24 officers should pursue an aggressive self-development program throughout their careers
that includes such elements as industry certifications, academic certificates, professional licenses, and memberships in
professional organizations.
h. Separate. FA24 officers separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
39–8. Telecommunication Systems Engineering Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. Army National Guard and USAR Telecommunication Systems Engineering officers
serve the same role and mission as their Active Army counterparts. The unique nature of the RC soldier’s role as a
citizen–soldier poses a significant professional development challenge. To fulfill their wartime mission of planning,
engineering and managing the integration of diverse communication, information and visual information equipment
into interoperable systems and enterprise networks, Telecommunication Systems Engineering officers are dependent
upon extensive interaction between the AC and the RC. The quality of the Telecommunication Systems Engineering
officers in the RC is important to support this mission. For guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7. FA 24
has one area of concentration, 24A Telecommunications Systems Engineer.
b. Functional area qualification and development opportunities.
(1) FA 24 officers in the RC have challenging and complex missions. Inherent with these missions are specific
managerial and technical attributes for developing and employing telecommunications systems in both fixed and
mobile configurations. FA 24 officers must be tactically and technically proficient and capable of understanding the
scope of a Systems Engineer officer’s duties. A requirement for proficiency in both peacetime and wartime skills will
provide significant educational and experiential challenges. Planned rotation into progressively challenging FA 24
related positions, while considered essential to producing the best qualified Systems Engineer officer, will be limited to
geographical considerations.
(2) Geographic dispersion of Systems Engineer positions constrains RC career progression in FA 24. Few RC FA 24
officers will be afforded an opportunity to meet minimum career progression goals of the Active Army. To meet
professional development objectives, RC Telecommunication Systems Engineering officers should be willing to rotate
between assignments with USAR TPU organizations, ARNG units and IMA positions. Usually there will be insufficient numbers of positions within a geographic area to continue in Telecommunication Systems Engineering functional
area assignments. If geographic constraints are such that assignment to a Telecommunication Systems Engineering
position is not possible, officers should seek assignment in their basic branch or in a related functional area required in
the geographic region.
(3) Telecommunication Systems Engineering officer assignments in the RC are almost split evenly between TOE
and TDA organizations. Their duties and responsibilities are fundamentally the same as their AC counterparts except
for those personnel management, administrative and operational requirements unique to the ARNG and USAR.
(4) Officers may be assigned to the IRR when unable to accept a TPU or ARNG unit assignment. Officers in the
IRR may request assignment to a Reinforcement Training Unit (RTU), IMA position, a tour of Active Duty for Special
Work (ADSW), Annual Training (AT), or Active Duty for Training (ADT). Officers in the IRR may meet professional
military education (PME) requirements by requesting ADT. All RC officers, MAJ and below with less than 15 years of
Active Federal Service (AFS), may request AGR assignment.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

405

(5) RC FA 24 authorizations will vary as force structure decisions are made and actions to implement them are
taken. U.S. Army Reserve officers desiring more information on current authorizations or positions may contact the
Combined Functional Area Management Office (CFAMO) at the Army Reserve Personnel Command, St. Louis,
Missouri. ARNG officers desiring more information on current authorizations or positions may contact the National
Guard personnel office of the state or territory in which they reside.
(6) Reserve Component officers (CPT and above) who acquire telecommunication systems engineering skills,
knowledge and attributes in a civilian workplace or through education and training may apply for constructive credit to
award FA 24. Awarding constructive credit is based on documented experience in telecommunications systems
engineering; professional certifications, advanced degrees, and civilian workplace experience. Candidates should submit
requests for constructive credit with supporting documents through their USAR or ARNG component chain of
command to Commander, USASC&FG, Office Chief of Signal, ATTN: ATZH–POO, Fort Gordon, GA 30905.
Supporting documents include (as applicable):
(a) Cover letter outlining qualifications
(b) Resume
(c) DA Form 2–1 (Personnel Qualification Record)/officer record brief (ORB) or biographical record brief (BRB)
(d) Transcripts (graduate and/or undergraduate)
(e) OERs/civilian job evaluations
(f) Civilian training certificates
(g) Industry certification certificates (MCSE, MCP, CNA, and so forth)
(h) Letter(s) of recommendation
c. Professional development. There are 4 phases of professional development for RC Telecommunication Systems
Engineering officers. The phases relate to military rank and include broadly based goals and career objectives at each
rank so that an officer may expand capabilities and optimize performance. Telecommunication Systems Engineering
life cycle development objectives, RC requirements and an officer’s own strengths, priorities, civilian experience,
private and service provided education, and performance influence their professional development. Functional area
qualification standards by grade, along with typical RC duty positions are as follows:
(1) Captain.
(a) Telecommunications Systems Engineer officer. For 24A qualification as well as consideration for promotion to
MAJ, Telecommunications Systems Engineer officers should have a hard skill undergraduate degree in one of the
following:
1. Electrical Engineering (Communications)
2. Telecommunication Systems Engineering
3. Telecommunication Engineering
4. Telecommunications Management
5. Information Systems Engineering
6. Computer Systems Engineering
7. Engineering
8. Computer Science
9. Math
(b) Physics Officers must complete the Information Systems Operations Leveler Course (ISOL, ATRRS Course
Number 7E–F70) followed by the Telecommunications Systems Engineering Course (TSEC, ATRRS Course Number
4C–24A) to be initially qualified as a FA 24. Attendance at the ISOL may be waived based on prior equivalent
education/experience. Typical TOE positions include communications- electronics engineer, systems engineer, and
communications-electronics staff officer. Typical TDA positions include Signal support officer, systems engineer and
communications-electronics staff officer.
(2) Major. The primary professional development objective of a Telecommunication Systems Engineering MAJ in
the RC is to continue to strengthen telecommunication systems engineering skills. During this phase, officers must
enroll in and complete Command and Staff College (MEL 4) level military education, ILE, or its equivalent (50
percent completion required for promotion to LTC). Selected RC officers may attend the ILE common core course at a
Course Location Site such as Fort Gordon, GA. FA 24 MAJs are highly encouraged to pursue a specialty related
graduate degree and obtain a professional engineering license. Telecommunication systems engineering MAJs should
serve a minimum of 24 months cumulative service in a Telecommunication Systems Engineering operations or
operational support MAJ position.
(3) Lieutenant colonel. LTCs can expect assignments to senior staff positions employing them in a variety of diverse
and challenging FA related positions. FA 24 officers should seek professional military education at the Senior Service
College level. Telecommunication Systems Engineering RC LTCs are eligible for selection to the grade of COL upon
completion of the requisite service requirements listed in chapter 7 of this pamphlet. Lieutenant colonels remain
eligible for promotion as long as they continue to serve in an active status and meet selection criteria. FA 24 LTCs

406

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

should serve a minimum of 48 months cumulative service in a Telecommunication Systems Engineering support
position.
(4) Colonel. The primary objective for officers during this phase is maximum use of the officer’s technical and
tactical capabilities, managerial skills and executive skills in positions of higher responsibility. Reserve Component
Telecommunication Systems Engineering COLs should serve a minimum 72 months cumulative service in an FA 24
operations or operational support position.
d. Reserve Component life cycle model. See figure 39–1 for the FA 24 Reserve Component life cycle model (TBP).

Chapter 40
Information Operations Functional Area
40–1. Unique features of Information Operations functional area
a. Unique purpose of Information Operations functional area.
(1) Information Operations (IO) is a functional area (FA 30) within the IO career field. Information operations is the
employment of the core capabilities of electronic warfare, computer network operations (CNO), psychological operations (PSYOPs), military deception, and operations security (OPSEC), in concert with specified supporting and related
capabilities, to affect or defend information and information systems, and to influence decisionmaking (FM 3–13).
Information Operations officers are educated, trained, and equipped warfighters who integrate forces and IO capabilities throughout the physical, information, and cognitive domains of the battle space in order to create and sustain
desired and measurable effects on leaders, forces, audiences, information, and information systems in AO/AI; while
protecting and defending their own information and information systems against enemy, adversary, and other’s
intrusions and attacks. Information Operations is integral to every phase of Army and Joint planning and operations and
is necessary across the full spectrum of operations.
(2) Information Operations officers synchronize IO actions to help fulfill the commander’s intent, provide critical
information for expeditious decisions, and exploit information advantages. The IO FA supports commanders of the
unified commands; the Joint staff; DOD agencies, other government agencies; DA and its MACOMs; and Army
warfighting organizations at Brigade Combat Teams (BCT), Units of Execution X (UEx), Units of Execution Y (UEy),
and Echelons Above Corps (EAC).
(3) The CG, Combined Arms Center is the Army proponent for IO and FA 30.
(4) Unique functions performed by IO FA brings together several previously separated functions as IO elements and
related activities. Offensive information operations are the integrated use of assigned and supporting capabilities and
activities, mutually supported by intelligence to affect enemy decisionmakers or to influence others to achieve or
promote specific objectives (FM 3–0). Defensive information operations are the integration and coordination of policies
and procedures, operations, personnel, and technology to protect and defend friendly information and information
systems. Defensive information operations ensure timely, accurate, and relevant information access while denying
adversaries the opportunity to exploit friendly information and information systems for their own purposes (FM 3–0).
(5) The IO officer is the principal staff officer for all responsibilities concerning IO, including current operations,
plans, and IO related targeting (FM 6–0).
(a) Information Operations current operations responsibilities include— ensuring IO supports achieving information
superiority; synchronizing and coordinating offensive and defensive IO with the overall operation; assessing the effects
of offensive and defensive IO throughout the operations process, recommending IO adjustments as required; coordinating and synchronizing tactical IO with theater–strategic, and operational–level IO; coordinating IO elements and related
activities for the Chief of Staff, Army; integrating intelligence from the G2 (S2) into IO; coordinating the attachment of
the 1st Information Operations Command Field Support Team and other specialized IO teams; and monitoring
execution of IO tasks to ensure delivery of massed information effects when needed.
(b) Information Operations planning responsibilities include— exercising staff coordination over the conduct of the
overall IO effort; coordinating preparation of the IO portions of plans and orders; producing other IO products;
recommending priorities for accomplishing IO tasks identified during planning; leveraging the capabilities of higher
echelon IO agencies and units. The FA 30 officers integrate efforts to attack adversary information and information
systems, and plan and integrate offensive and defensive information operations to gain and maintain information
superiority in support of the commander’s overall concept of the operation.
(c) Information Operations targeting responsibilities include participating in targeting meetings, recommending IO
effects to influence adversary perceptions, decisions, and actions.
(6) The IO officer has the staff planning and supervisory responsibilities for establishing and supervising an IO
section (FM 6–0) and providing IO connectivity with national and theater–level IO agencies.
(7) The IO officer has coordinating staff responsibility for the following staff officers: military deception officer,
electronic warfare officer, OPSEC Officer and PSYOPs officer (FM 6–0). The IO officer coordinates with the Public
Affairs and CA operations officers.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

407

b. Unique features of work in Information Operations functional area. The IO involves intellectual flexibility,
operational focus, technological understanding, and interpersonal skills utilizing both military and nonmilitary resources. Unique IO tasks that revolve around the primary functions above are—
(1) Exercise coordinating staff responsibility for OPSEC and integrating actions to identify the Essential Elements of
Friendly Information (EEFI) and subsequently analyzes friendly actions attendant to military operations and other
activities.
(2) Exercise coordinating staff responsibility for the PSYOP officer and integrating actions into planning, current
operations, and targeting. Clearly understands the capabilities and limitations of the PSYOP assets available.
(3) Exercise coordinating staff responsibility for military deception and integrating actions into planning, current
operations, and targeting. The IO officer coordinates with the G2 to determine requirements or opportunities for
military deception. Coordinates with the G3 to ensure the military deception actions support the commander’s intent
and concept of the operation.
(4) Exercise coordinating staff responsibility for electronic warfare. Coordinates EA target deconfliction with the
G6, and identifies jamming, military deception and PSYOP targets with the G2. Deconflicts electronic warfare tasks
with other IO tasks in current operations, planning, and targeting.
(5) Request computer network attack support from the Joint task force or combatant command through operations
channels to support commander’s intent.
(6) Coordinate with the G2, G3, and G6 to assess friendly command and control procedures and other IO
capabilities and vulnerabilities.
(7) Coordinate with the G2 to assess adversaries’ vulnerabilities.
(8) Monitor in conjunction with coordinating and special staffs the status of information systems and networks at
MACOM or higher level.
(9) Coordinate with PA to obtain and disseminate relevant information to eliminate unnecessary duplication of
effort, ensure unity of purpose, and ensure credibility is not undermined.
(10) Coordinate activities supporting IO objectives and civil–military operations tasks with the G5.
(11) Synchronize with the G2 and G3 the means to attack, deny, degrade, exploit and/or influence adversaries in
support of the commander’s intent at UEx and higher level.
(12) Synchronize with the G2 and G6, measures to protect friendly information, command and control systems, and
other IO capabilities from attack to include information assurance and automation protection measures.
(13) Coordinate with the G3, SJA, and other staff officers concerning rules of engagement, release authorities,
privacy matters, and other legal issues.
(14) Consolidate and prepare IO input to command standard operating procedures, operations plans and orders,
fragmentary orders, and warning orders.
40–2. Officer characteristics required
Information Operations officers must have a Top Secret clearance with special compartmented information access.
Information Operations officers must initiate procedures to obtain the proper level of clearance immediately upon
notification of the FA 30 career field designation. Additionally, there are FA unique skills, knowledge, and attributes.
a. Unique skills. Information Operations officers must comprehend the organization, structure, and doctrine of the
warfighting Army as it evolves. In addition, they must—
(1) Be tactically and technically proficient at synchronizing all aspects of core, supporting, and related IO capabilities in support of the commander’s objectives.
(2) Have the ability to understand cultural implications and use of information as a means to influence adversaries
and events across the full spectrum of operations.
b. Unique knowledge. Information Operations officers must remain up–to–date on Army organization, structure, and
doctrine. They must also—
(1) Possess tactical and operational expertise to advise the commander and staff on IO.
(2) Understand the use and limitations of IO core, supporting, and related capabilities.
(3) Understand issues related to the global and military information environments.
(4) Understand Army, Joint, and multinational information systems architectures.
(5) Possess specific marketing and international media skills to familiarize IO staff officers on how civilian entities
plan, prepare, and execute influence activities.
(6) Understand cross–cultural communications and cultural awareness.
c. Unique attributes. Information Operations officers must be warfighters who possess the highest standards of
discretion, integrity, and professional ethics. In addition, they must possess—
(1) The ability to apply decisionmaking theory in military organizations to optimize the decisionmaking process.
(2) Creative thinking and critical reasoning skills.
(3) The ability to translate complex technical information into operational applications.

408

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

the information environment and the impact the information environment can have on the battles pace and their
operations.
(5) Face-to-face engagements skills using translators and enabled to understand, and prepared to apply human
factors and cultural awareness throughout the full spectrum of operations, strategic to tactical levels
40–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
CPTs submit their FA preference through HRCs Web–based preference system for FA 30 before being selected for
promotion to MAJ and career field designated in the IO career field by a Career Field Designation Board. The FA 30
proponent will canvas FA preference requests in order to identify, recruit, select and assess officers who meet the
criteria and possess the required skills and experience to serve in an FA 30 assignment. Officers interested in FA 30 are
encouraged to contact the IO proponent office through the Army AKO TRADOC, IO Web site for additional
information on career opportunities. Officers may serve in an FA 30 assignment prior to designation by a Career Field
Designation Board by filling additional skill identifier position on an IO staff. However, the FA 30 personnel
assignments officer at Army Human Resource Command does not have direct management responsibility for IO
officers until they have been career field designated into the IO career field.
a. Information Operations functional area qualification and development. Generally, FA 30 officers will receive
initial IO training before they begin a FA 30 assignment. After career field designation, officers will attend the FA 30
qualification course at Fort Leavenworth, KS. After completion of the FA 30 qualification course, officers are initially
qualified in their FA. As officers progress through their careers, they may be afforded other FA 30 and Army
educational opportunities based on their duty performance and Army needs. For example, some officers may attend a
fully funded advanced civil schooling program. Although it is not required for promotion consideration, a graduate
degree should be a goal of every field grade FA 30 officer. All IO officers, as members of the IO career field, will be
eligible for assignment into branch and/or functional area generalist (formerly branch immaterial) positions.
(1) Captain. Functional area 30 experience as a CPT is not a requirement for promotion to MAJ, but the experience
may enhance selection to the IO career field as an FA 30. CPTs may serve in an FA 30 assignment and receive IO
training by ASI. CPTs selected for fully funded advanced civil schooling with a follow–on FA 30 assignment are
candidates for career field designation into IO upon their selection to MAJ. They normally serve as a member of a
BCT, UEx, UEy, or Field Support Team (FST) staff.
(2) Major. After selection to MAJ, officers will be designated into a branch or FA in 1 of the 4 OPMS career fields
by a Career Field Designation Board. Officers designated into the IO career field as an FA 30 will serve primarily in
their FA in Army or Joint warfighting organizations; for example, UEy, UEx, BCTs and the 1st Information Operations
Command. These billets ensure that IO officers sustain their knowledge and understanding of the operational force. All
IO officers will attend an intermediate level education 12–week common core course at a course location determined
by the IO proponent and AHRC. At the course location site, officers that successfully complete the intermediate level
education 12–week common core course are Joint Professional Military Education 1 (JPME) 1 and Intermediate Staff
College (ISC) qualified. Some officers who volunteer and are then selected will attend the School of Advanced
Military Studies (SAMS) or a fully funded graduate degree program. Some MAJs will receive specialized training to
prepare them for IO assignments requiring additional skills. MAJs who are JPME 1 qualified, have served a total of 24
months in FA 30 (CPT or MAJ) assignments, and have successfully completed the FA 30 QC are FA and intermediate
level education qualified at the grade of MAJ and competitive for promotion to LTC. Information Operations officers
will compete against other officers in their career field for promotion to LTC.
(3) Lieutenant colonel. Functional area 30 LTCs are generally assigned to supervisory positions or to billets on
senior level Army or Joint staffs, where they can fully apply their knowledge of the Army and the FA. Many officers
will serve in warfighting organizations. A large number of positions are also in Table of Distribution and Allowance
(TDA) organizations; for example, the Joint staff, Army staff, a MACOM headquarters staff, and MACOM subordinate
commands. Lieutenant colonels who have completed 48 months cumulative service, and have successfully completed
the FA 30 qualification course are considered FA qualified at the grade of LTC and competitive for promotion to COL.
(4) Colonel. If not selected for resident Senior Service College, all IO officers selected for COL should apply for the
non–resident U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course. Information Operations COLs are the FA’s senior
practitioners. They should have a broad IO background from serving in a variety of field grade FA 30 assignments.
Functional area 30 COLs will serve primarily as the senior IO officer at UEy or echelons above Corps, and as division
chiefs in HQDA, MACOM, Army service component command, or Joint staffs. Some assignments may be to branch/
FA generalist positions.
b. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. CPTs and above can serve in branch/FA generalist assignments.
These billets, such as ROTC, USMA faculty and staff and Inspector General, are not identified with a specific branch
or FA, but are important to the Army.
c. Joint assignments. Functional area 30 positions are on the Joint Duty Assignment List. Officers assigned to those
billets will receive Joint Professional Military Education and may become a Joint Specialty Officer (skill identifier 3L)
upon successful Joint tour completion. Information Operations officers are not generally considered for Joint duty
assignments until selected for MAJ. Even though Joint experience is important to the Army and to individual officers

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

409

for advancement into senior leadership positions, not all IO officers will receive Joint assignments. This will not
preclude their selection to the grade of COL.
40–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
The assignment sequencing in a functional area is not as rigid as that of a branch. An objective of professional
development for FA 30 officers is to expose them to a variety of environments in which IO is performed. After
receiving initial IO training, FA 30 officers should seek different types of jobs within the FA 30 structure to provide
breadth to their IO experiences. As part of their continued development, they should also serve a minimum of 1
assignment in a branch/functional area generalist position.
a. Preferences. The IO FA has diverse opportunities, which allow for numerous career development paths. The goal
of FA 30 professional development is to produce officers skilled in planning and executing information operations.
Officers will attend the FA 30 qualification course prior to initial assignment to an FA 30 position. By exception,
officers may be assigned to an assignment prior to completion the FA 30 qualification course to meet real–world
mission requirements.
b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental FA positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility on the
sequence of assignments. Some FA 30 billets will be designated as requiring advanced civilian education, such as a
master’s degree in IO from the Naval War College. Officers assigned into those jobs must have completed the
necessary courses of instruction. If possible, IO officers should complete an Army information operations assignment
before an FA 30 assignment to a Joint command.
40–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
Most assignments for IO officers will be 24 to 36 months in length. Tours may be longer in areas with a high
concentration of billets, such as the National Capital Region. Outside CONUS locations will continue to require
specific tour lengths. Key IO FA qualification positions. There are no positions that specifically qualify an IO officer.
Completion of MEL 4, the FA 30 qualification course and FA 30 assignment experience— 24 months for MAJ and 48
cumulative months for an LTC— qualify an officer in this FA. IO FA life cycle. Figure 40–1 depicts an IO FA life
cycle for an Active Army officer.

40–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for FA 30 officers. To meet this requirement, the field grade
inventory will be prioritized to fulfill FA 30 authorizations for the current and future operational force requirements.
Functional area 30 officers will be provided sufficient time in assignment for FA qualification prior to consideration for
promotion to LTC and COL.
a. Acquire. The criteria for selecting an officer to an FA include personal preference, needs of the Army, type of
civilian degree and grade point average, foreign language aptitude, and manner of performance. Personnel preference
will be determined using AHRC’s FA Assignment Interactive Module (AIM) webpage. The CFDB results occur
concurrently with selection to MAJ. The criteria for career field designation include the needs of the Army, officer
preference, commanders’ input, undergraduate degree, and graduate degree.
b. Distribute. After designation into the IO career field at the grade of MAJ, the Functional Area Division, OPMD,
HRC, will manage IO officers. Assignment to FA 30 positions, advanced civil schooling or to branch/FA generalist
positions will depend upon Army needs, professional development considerations, officer preference, and officer
qualifications at the time of assignment.
c. Deploy. Information Operations officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to
deploy worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to TO&E units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA
organizations, all FA 30 officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of operations.
Information Operations officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect
national interests; or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian
and peace keeping missions. Functional area 30 officers must prepare themselves and their families for this most
challenging career field.
d. Sustain. Officers designated into the IO career field will compete within their career field for promotion to LTC
and COL. The FA 30 assignment officers in CMD will monitor their careers.
e. Develop. Functional area 30 incorporates a professional officer development plan offering maximum diversity for
assignment and schooling. Functional area 30 officers apply and develop IO skills through a series of progressively
challenging assignments. Branch/functional area generalist jobs further develop the officer. As IO officers progress
through their careers, in addition to advanced military schooling opportunities, they also become eligible for additional
civilian information operations educational training, which likewise prepares them for positions of increased
responsibility.
f. Train. Functional area 30 officers will attend the intermediate level education 12–week common core course in
resident at a course location site determined by the IO proponent and HRC. At a course location site, officers are
Institutional Support Course graduates and credentialed JPME 1 qualification. Full intermediate level education credit
is awarded when the officer has completed the common core and the Civil Affairs Course FA 30 QC before or after the
intermediate level education common core. Full intermediate level education credit is required prior to promotion to
LTC. Reserve component officers will meet the requirements as stipulated by the RC.
g. Separate. Functional area 30 officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
40–7. Information Operations Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. Reserve Component IO officer development objectives and qualifications parallel
those planned for their active duty counterparts. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation through assignments
in their basic branches before specializing in FA 30.
b. Functional area qualification and development opportunities. Reserve Component officers should strive for IO
assignments that yield the same development opportunities as their Active Army counterparts.
(1) Qualification standards at each grade, professional military education, and length of service in FA 30 assignments are the same as for Active Army officers.
(2) Reserve Component officers can expect to shift regularly among TPU, IMA and IRR assignments. They may
also rotate among components. Besides providing officers staff experience in Active Army units, IMA and IRR
assignments with appropriate annual training may help IO officers fulfill professional military education requirements.
These varying assignments will bolster Total Army IO capabilities, develop an IO officer’s leadership skills, and
increase the individual’s knowledge of the RC roles and mission.
(3) Reserve Component officers with civilian acquired skills in information technology and management, communications, marketing, organizational behavior or other IO related fields are a valuable Army resource. Officers who
develop their skills in these areas through employment or civilian education will be competitive for promotion and
selection to positions of increased responsibility.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(4) Active Guard Reserve IO officers will rotate between troop unit and staff positions within the unified commands, the Joint staff, DOD agencies, HQDA and its MACOMs, and the USAR. They should attempt to attend the
same residence education courses as their Active Army counterparts.
c. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for IO officers is the same as Active Army.

Chapter 41
Strategic Intelligence Functional Area
41–1. Unique features of Strategic Intelligence functional area
a. Unique purpose of Strategic Intelligence functional area. The Strategic Intelligence FA (FA 34) provides the
Army with a professional Strategic Intelligence officer educated, trained and repetitively assigned into positions
requiring long–term foundational knowledge and study of particular geographic, political, or demographic areas
worldwide or particular intelligence functions. This officer is familiar with both Army and Joint intelligence and
communications systems and procedures. The FA 34 officer is a world class Strategic Intelligence specialist. The CG,
U.S. Army Intelligence Center is the proponent for FA 34.
b. Unique functions performed by Strategic Intelligence functional area. Strategic Intelligence officers work primarily at echelons above corps worldwide. Functional area 34 positions exist in intelligence units, headquarters, national
agencies, and unified commands. Functional area 34 officers will participate in all phases of the intelligence cycle.
Functional area 34 officer duties include coordinating, supervising, and participating in crisis planning and operations,
all–source current intelligence indications and warnings, threat analysis and other intelligence cycle activities focusing
on the activities, intentions, geography, and military capabilities of foreign nations or threats.
c. Unique features of work in Strategic Intelligence functional area. Work within FA 34 requires the transformation
of raw data into processed intelligence and the application or integration of that intelligence into plans, operations, or
situational awareness. A team effort (Army, DOD, Interagency) is often required to solve long–term or technical
problems. The work requires the ability to interpret patterns in complex situations as well as the ability to synthesize
and analyze both concrete and abstract activities and intentions. An understanding of tactical skills and concepts
applied to both friendly and enemy capabilities is critical for success. Functional area 34 officers could have a
moderate to long time to conduct analysis and make good decisions resulting from in–depth knowledge, analysis and
study; however, they could also be required to react rapidly in providing intelligence to support a crisis action situation.
41–2. Officer characteristics required
a. Possess highly specialized knowledge pertaining to one or all phases of the intelligence cycle; intelligence law
and management; Joint and Army intelligence and communications architectures; Army, Joint and national intelligence
systems; information security principles; national agency functions; and, aspects of intelligence planning which have
been gained through attendance at specialized academic training or over a significant period of time.
b. Understand the organization, structure and doctrine of the Warfighting Army.
c. Understand the organization, structure, and doctrine of the Joint Force. Know how to integrate Army and Joint
intelligence and systems.
d. Understand domestic political context in which the Army seeks to fulfill its Title 10 responsibilities and DOD
seeks to provide for national security.
e. Understand issues related to the international geopolitical arena and their implications for developing the national
security policy and the national military strategy.
f. Understand the organization of the Army, its Title 10 responsibilities and the missions, roles, and functions of its
MACOMs.
g. Understand the organization of the DOD and the national intelligence community; the defense intelligence
programs; development of the national military strategy; and the missions, roles, and functions of its warfighting
commands and various agencies.
41–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. General. Functional area 34 officers are not considered for FA 34 assignment until they have completed the
required FA 34 training. Most officers will not receive FA 34 training and assignments until after selection for MAJ
and career field designation into the IO career field as an FA 34. After their 5th year of active federal commissioned
service, a small number of CPTs may qualify for service in FA 34. First, though, they must acquire release from their
basic branch.
b. Functional area qualification and development. All FA 34 positions are considered key and essential to professional development. There are no specific FA 34 assignments to qualify an officer as a Strategic Intelligence officer.
Functional area qualification will consist of completion of the required training and successful performance in FA 34

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

413

assignments. All FA 34 officers should pursue Joint qualification (Additional Skill Identifier (ASI) 3A) as a professional development goal. Strategic Intelligence officers will be considered qualified at each grade based on their
manner of performance in their assigned FA 34 positions and appropriate schooling as detailed below—
(1) Major. After selection to MAJ, selected officers will be designated into FA 34 and the Information Operations
career field. These officers will then attend FA 34 training and serve in Strategic Intelligence positions. Additional
specialized training may be needed for specific assignments. FA 34 training and assignment requirements are—
(a) Successful completion of the FA 34 Strategic Intelligence Officer Course (SIOC) conducted at the U.S. Army
Intelligence Center, Fort Huachuca, AZ (required for non–MI Branch officers only).
(b) Successful completion of the Post Graduate Intelligence Program (PGIP), or equivalent, conducted by the Joint
Military Intelligence College, Bolling Air Force Base (AFB), Washington, D.C
(c) Attend the ILE Common Core
(d) Serve 24 months in any FA 34 coded position.
(e) Successful completion of Joint Professional Military Education, phase II is desirable.
(2) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Serve 36 months in any FA 34 coded LTC or COL position.
(b) Successful completion of Joint Professional Military Education, phase II is desirable (see chap 3, para 3–8d.).
(3) Colonel.
(a) Serve 24 months in any FA 34 coded COL position.
(b) Successful completion of Senior Service College (resident or non-resident).
(c) Successful completion of Joint Professional Military Education, phase II (see chap 3, para 3–8d).
c. Joint assignments. The vast majority of FA 34 positions are Joint. Many of these Joint positions are on the Joint
Duty Assignment List (JDAL). Officers assigned to JDAL positions may attend the Joint Professional Military
Education (JPME) II course and could qualify for Joint Specialty Officer (JSO) designation (ASI 3L).
41–4. Assignment preferences and precedence.
a. The goal of professional development of FA 34 officers is to provide the intelligence community with an officer
who is technically competent in many aspects of strategic intelligence. Therefore, FA 34 assignments are aimed at
increasing the officer’s specialization in one or several fields. These assignments coupled with selected additional
schooling will provide the Army world–class Strategic Intelligence officers.
b. The preferred assignment pattern is to assign officers to an FA 34 position after they have completed the FA 34
training; however, Army requirements may dictate an officer’s assignment prior to completing training.
41–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Key Strategic Intelligence functional area positions. Ideally, FA 34 officers should serve at least 36 months in
each FA 34 assignment; however, the FA 34 officer may be assigned to different positions during a tour to give him
better all around strategic intelligence experience and expertise. Given the density of assignments in the National
Capital Region, officers could serve back–to–back tours there. Outside continental United States locations will continue
to require specific tour lengths. Examples of FA 34 positions are—
(1) Strategic Intelligence Officer.
(2) Intelligence Staff Officer.
(3) Deputy Director for Intelligence.
(4) Watch Officer.
(5) Warning Officer.
(6) Intelligence Plans Officer.
b. Strategic Intelligence functional area life cycle. Figure 41–1 depicts the FA 34 career life cycle.
41–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for FA 34 officers. To do this, the field grade
inventory must be optimized in order to fulfill functional area and branch/functional area generalist authorization
requirements and provide junior field grade officers sufficient time for FA training and experience prior to promotion
to LTC and COL.
b. Officer Personnel Management System implementation. The number of FA 34 authorizations, by grade, will
fluctuate as force structure decisions are made. Officers desiring information on current FA 34 authorizations and
inventory should contact the FA 34 proponency office or the HRC OPMD FA 34 assignments officer.

41–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Strategic Intelligence
a. Structure. Functional area 34 derives its structure from former Military Intelligence billets at echelons above
corps, with a large majority of the positions at Joint commands and national agencies. The chief of the Military
Intelligence Corps is the proponent for FA 34 and guides its development.
b. Acquire. Officers who have completed or are attending the Postgraduate Intelligence Program and/or the Strategic
Intelligence Officer Course will be likely candidates for career field designation to FA 34. Additionally, officers with a
background in geography, political science, government and social studies should also be considered likely candidates.
All FA 34 personnel must qualify for a top-secret security clearance based on a Single Scope Background Investigation
(SSBI) and for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI). Some FA 34 officers may be selected for special
programs later in their careers.
c. Distribute. The Functional Area Division in Human Resources Command, OPMD will manage all FA 34
assignments. All FA 34 positions are at echelons above corps. Many FA 34 positions are included on the Joint Duty
Assignment List, and many others are on headquarters staffs or within defense agencies. Consequently, many FA 34
positions are high priority either by law or by policy, have prescribed tour lengths, and will receive personnel
replacements when required.
d. Deploy. Functional area 34 officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to deployable TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA
organizations, all FA 34 officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict.
Functional area 34 officers may deploy tomorrow with their units and/or commands to deter potential adversaries and
to protect national interests or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations. Functional area 34 officers
must prepare themselves and their families for this most challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustain. Functional area 34 officers will compete for promotions within the IO career field. Promotion numbers
and percentages will be consistent with both FA 34 requirements and other functional areas within the career field.
f. Develop.
(1) All non–MI officers designated into FA 34 will complete the Strategic Intelligence Officer Course (SIOC) at the
U.S. Army Intelligence Center and Fort Huachuca, Fort Huachuca, AZ. All FA 34 officers will attend the Postgraduate
Intelligence Program (PGIP), conducted by the Joint Military Intelligence College, Bolling Air Force Base, Washington, DC. Functional area 34 officers will receive additional training qualifying them for MEL 4 and JPME 1. Some FA
34 officers will receive further specialized training and professional development opportunities, depending on the
specific requirements of their duty position. Many FA 34 officers serving in Joint positions will attend JPME II
training and could subsequently qualify for JSO designation.
(2) Intermediate level education common core curriculum— FA 34 MAJs will attend the 12–week common core
course in residence at a course location site. At a course location site, officers are intermediate staff college (ISC)
graduates and credentialed Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) 1 qualified. Full intermediate level education
credit is awarded when the officer has completed the common core and the PGIP. Full intermediate level education
credit is required prior to promotion to LTC. Reserve Component officers can attend the Army Schools System (TASS)
classrooms located in CONUS and OCONUS course location sites.
41–8. Strategic Intelligence Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. The FA 34 officer is a world–class strategic intelligence specialist. The majority of
the FA 34 positions are found in TDA echelons above corps units. Functional area 34 officer duties and responsibilities
are fundamentally the same for the Active Army and Reserve Components. The RC Strategic Intelligence officer serves
the same role and missions as his or her counterpart. The unique nature of the RC soldier’s role as a citizen–soldier
poses a significant challenge in the combat support mission of FA 34. An RC officer is expected to follow Active
Army officer development patterns as closely as possible, except in some cases where an RC officer has increased
windows to complete mandatory education requirements (see chap 7 for more guidance on Reserve Component officer
development).
b. Functional area qualification and development. Reserve Component development and qualification will be
equivalent to the Active Army officers (non–MI) must successfully complete the SIOC and the Post Graduate
Intelligence Program (PGIP) for award of FA 34 and assignment to FA 34 coded positions.
c. Functional area 34 Reserve Component assignments. There are 3 phases of professional development for RC FA
34 officers. The following phases relate to military rank and depict broadly based goals and career opportunities at
each rank so that an officer may expand capabilities and optimize performance. FA 34 life cycle development
objectives, RC requirements and an officer’s own strengths, priorities and performance influence his or her professional
development. Functional area professional development standards by grade are as follows:
(1) Major.
(a) For award of FA 34, officers must successfully complete the Post Graduate Intelligence Program (PGIP)

416

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

conducted at the Joint Military Intelligence College at Bolling Air Force Base. Non–MI officers must attend the SIOC
prior to PGIP.
(b) They must successfully complete at least 50 percent of the intermediate level education common core or its
equivalent.
(c) They must complete a tour in any FA 34 coded position.
(2) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) They must successfully complete intermediate level education common core or its equivalent within 3 years after
promotion to LTC.
(b) They must complete a tour in an LTC or higher FA 34 coded position.
(3) Colonel. Functional area 34 COLs serve in both FA 34 and officer generalist (01A) positions.
d. Life cycle development model. The Reserve Component life cycle development model for FA 34 officers is shown
at figure 41–2.

42–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
Officers desiring designation into the space operations career field are encouraged to seek space–related assignments
(FA 40 or requiring the skill identifier (SI), 3Y, space activities) at the earliest opportunity. When CPTs are given the
option to indicate an FA preference, those who indicate Space Operations as an FA of interest can be identified by the
FA 40 personnel proponent office and FA 40 assignment officer for further assistance.
a. Space Operations, 40A, functional area qualification and development. Officers who successfully complete the
educational requirements below and successfully perform in a Space Operations FA assignment are qualified in the FA.
Officers are then afforded other Army, Joint, and civilian space–related educational opportunities based on their
performance of duties and the needs of the Army. Officers in year groups prior to year group 1989 may have
experienced some variance in qualifying factors due to the implementation process for OPMS III (see 42–3c).
(1) Qualifying Education Space Operations officers have certain requirements to ensure they are developed and
well–grounded in Army and Joint operations.
(a) All officers must complete the basic functional qualification training, the Space Operations Officer Qualification
Course (SOOQC) that is the FA 40 phase of intermediate level education. Officers serving in select areas (that is,
NASA) may submit a request for waiver identifying comparable training and/or experience and by completing space
training specified by the proponent office. SPACE OPNS OFF QUAL CR will be entered into Section VI, Military
Education, of the ORB.
(b) Completion of SOOQC is highly desired prior to the initial FA 40 assignment and must be completed prior to
consideration for promotion to LTC.
(2) Professional development officers are encouraged to pursue educational opportunities as part of lifelong learning
and to enhance their professional competence and personal development.
(a) Select Space Operations officers will have the opportunity to attend an advanced military studies program (that
is, SAMS, SASS), participate in advanced civil schooling or training with industry.
(b) All officers are encouraged to pursue a graduate degree in a space–related or other proponent–approved field to
improve performance and contributions in this highly technical field before they reach consideration for promotion to
COL.
(c) To stay highly knowledgeable of up-to-date developments in space, all Space Operations officers are encouraged
to attend the periodic space operations training conference and to complete training updates as announced by the FA 40
personnel proponent office.
(3) Qualifying experience to achieve and maintain FA qualification, officers should serve at least 24 months in an
FA 40 or space–related position (to include space–related schooling or training) at each rank, beginning at MAJ.
Success will depend not on the number or type of positions held, but rather on the quality of duty performance in every
assignment.
(4) Officer generalist (01A) assignments— Space Operations officers can expect to serve in officer generalist
(formerly branch immaterial) assignments. These duty positions require a broad understanding of Army leadership,
doctrine, policy, force structure and management and are not identified with or limited to one specific branch or
functional area. These billets ensure Space Operations officers sustain the knowledge and understanding of the
operational force and include but are not limited to Joint, ROTC, USMA, Army staff, and Inspector General.
(5) Joint assignments— Space Operations FA positions may be on the Joint Duty Assignment List. Officers
assigned to those billets may attend Joint Professional Military Education and will be designated as a Joint specialty
officer (skill identifier 3L) upon successful tour completion. Space operations are inherently Joint. As members of the
Army and DOD Space Cadre, FA 40 MAJs and above can expect to serve in a Joint or combined service position.
Even though Joint experience is important to the Army and to individual officers for advancement into senior
leadership positions, lack of such assignment will not preclude their selection to the grade of COL.
b. Functional area 40C functional area qualification, development, and assignment. After nomination by the U.S.
Army Human Resources Command and upon selection by NASA, Army astronaut candidates are assigned to NASA
Johnson Space Center per the DOD and Army memorandum of understanding with NASA referenced in paragraph
42–1a(2). Astronaut candidates complete 12–18 months of technical NASA–specified training and education. After
completion of the candidate course of instruction, they are automatically career field designated 40C and are eligible
422

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

for assignment to Space Shuttle or ISS missions. As astronauts, they will perform duties as assigned by the chief,
Astronaut Office, and NASA Johnson Space Center. Duties will include flight assignments, training, and collateral
technical assignments. Although most astronaut candidates will enter the program at the grade of MAJ or LTC,
NASA’s selection process is irrespective of military grade. Levels of responsibility in assignments generally increase
with space flight experience and demonstrated performance. Some astronaut COLs will serve in the advanced
capacities listed in paragraph 42–1c(2).
c. Qualification variance for year groups prior to year group 1989. The OPMS implementation process designated
officers at different career timelines. The timing of entrance into the FA and establishment of the functional qualification course resulted in different qualification factors for these year groups.
(1) Qualification education. Officers in year groups prior to year group 1989 may be considered functionally
qualified when they have completed MEL 4 training, been awarded the skill identifier 3Y, and completed any of the
following courses prior to the full implementation of the Space Operations Officer’s Qualification Course or the FA 40
intermediate level education— the Interservice Space Fundamentals Course (or similar course approved by the
proponent office); Training With Industry; advanced civil schooling in a space–related discipline; or the Interim FA 40
Officers Qualifications Course. Notation will be entered in Section VI, Military Education, of the officer record brief
(ORB) for officers found to possess the aforementioned training. Prior to implementation of intermediate level
education, MAJs attending resident CGSC at Fort Leavenworth, KS, must complete the space elective course offered
there.
(2) Qualifying experience. Twenty–four months in an FA 40 coded position is desirable for qualifying experience.
However, officers in the year groups prior to year group 1989 may not have had the opportunity to hold an FA 40
coded position for the 24 months prior to a selection board. In these situations, some months in an FA 40 assignment
can be waived and a greater emphasis given to the successful performance review provided on an OER. Tables of
Organization and Equipment and TDA were in transition during OPMS implementation. Therefore, many officers may
have held jobs qualifying them in the FA by positions that were not yet reflected in the duty code as FA 40. In these
cases, the actual duties of the officers are used to determine FA qualification rather than the coding of the positions at
the time they were held. Each area of concentration had its own unique training and diverse assignment opportunities.
Some of the positions and organizations that may have FA 40A qualifying positions prior to 2001 are—
(a) Principal Space Operations staff officer at Corps level and higher.
(b) Army Space Support Team (ARSST) team leader
(c) Space Operations instructor at TRADOC, SMDC and Joint schools.
(d) Space Operations staff officer at all levels of command, to include MACOM and HQDA staff.
(e) Those covering a broad spectrum of research, planning, and operational assignments in the Space and Missile
Defense Command, Missile Defense Agency, and Joint Program Office
(f) Joint assignments with Joint Staff, USSTRATCOM and other unified commands as well as the National
Reconnaissance Office, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, and the National Security Space Office.
(g) Assignments in combined organizations such as NORAD.
(h) Space Operations Career Manager at U. S. Army Human Resources Command.
(3) Astronauts assigned with NASA are qualified for area of concentration 40C.
42–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. The Space Operations FA has diverse opportunities that allow for numerous career development
paths. Officers should balance assignments in order to gain a breadth and depth of operational and staff experience
across all echelons of command and types of units. Assignments in the Space Operations FA are made to develop the
officer’s ability to achieve that goal and include both operational and staff positions. Since space and space operations
are inherently Joint, officers are encouraged to pursue a career path that develops expertise in support of Joint,
interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational organizations. Astronauts will serve in functions as dictated by
NASA’s needs.
b. Precedence. Officers will serve primarily in the FA, but may serve at least 1 assignment in an officer generalist
(01A) position as part of their continuing development. Assignment to FA positions will have precedence over 01A,
generalist positions. Functional area assignments are all equally important and one does not take precedence over
another.
42–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
Most assignments for Space Operations officers will be 24 to 36 months. Tours could be longer in areas with a high
concentration of space billets such as the National Capital Region or Colorado Springs, CO, but not for excessive
rotations. Outside continental United States locations will continue to require specific tour lengths. Astronauts, FA 40C,
will be assigned to the NASA Army Detachment at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX, per the DOD/Army/
Navy/Air Force, NASA memorandum of understanding referenced in paragraph 42–1a(2).
a. Key Space Operations functional area positions. Assignments are all equally important and one assignment does
not take precedence over another. An officer is expected to design his/her career path to include a variety of

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

423

assignments as discussed in paragraph 42–4. Space Operations officers typically complete an Army functional area
assignment before being assigned to a Joint command. As key members of the Army Space Cadre, FA 40s can expect
to serve either in support of or assigned to various space organizations within the Army and Joint, interagency,
intergovernmental, and multinational organizations.
b. Space Operations functional area life cycle. Figure 42–1 depicts a Space Operations FA life cycle with examples
of some FA assignments.

424

Figure 42–1. Functional area 40 life cycle development and utilization

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

425

42–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for Space Operations officers. The inventory must be
optimized in order to fulfill functional area and officer generalist (01A) authorization requirements and provide officers
sufficient time for functional area qualification prior to promotion.
b. Fluctuation of structure. The number of Space Operations authorizations, by grade, will vary as force structure
decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. As noted in 42–3c, during OPMS III implementation
Space Operations officers may serve in space-related organizations and in positions where duties qualify them as space
operations positions but have not been coded as an FA 40 position. Officers desiring more information on current
authorizations or inventory should contact either the SMDC FA 40 personnel proponent office or the FA 40 assignment
officer at the HRC Information Operations Career Management Division.
42–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Space Operations
a. The sustainment of FA 40s is largely achieved through routine communication within the career field on all space
and professional development issues. To facilitate this, officers are encouraged to subscribe to professional development periodicals such as the Army Space Journal. Additionally, the Space Operations Network (SONET) provides a
web-based, collaborative medium to interface within the FA 40 community. Officers are encouraged to contribute
articles, briefings, and information papers to these initiatives to exchange space related information and ideas.
b. Functional area 40s are authorized to wear a distinctive Air Force skills badge per agreement with U.S. Air Force
Space Command, after completing specified criteria. The FA 40 personnel proponent office approves awarding of the
badge and coordinates changes to badge wear policies.
c. Army Space Cadre— FA 40s are the core of the Army’s Space Cadre, a key element of DOD’s Space Cadre. The
Space Cadre was created per the 2001 DOD Commission to Assess U.S. National Security Space Management and
Organization. The Army Space Cadre, as part of the DOD Cadre, must be managed, trained, and professionally
developed to meet criteria established by the Executive Agent for Space to ensure space professionals across the
Services are trained, experienced, and qualified to the same standards. The Army participates as part of the Space
Human Capital Resource Work Group and the Space Professional Oversight Board to ensure FA 40s are integrated as
part of the Space Cadre.
d. Advanced civil schooling— Select FA 40s are afforded opportunities for full time advanced civil schooling
programs for space related master’s degrees at the Naval Post Graduate School, Air Force Institute of Technology, and
other civilian institutions. Selection for these programs is accomplished by HRC in coordination with the FA 40
personnel proponent office on an annual basis. Additionally, officers receive graduate level credit hours from Websters
University and the American Military University for completing the Space Operations Officers Qualification Course
(SOOQC). Information about additional advanced civil schooling opportunities is available through the FA 40 personnel proponent office or the HRC FA 40 career manager.
e. Training With Industry. Functional area 40s are also afforded limited opportunities for a Space Training With
Industry program. Upon selection through a centralized process at HRC, officers spend a year working at a civilian
company in order to gain knowledge and experience in management and development of space capabilities. Officers
then serve in a designated follow-on assignment related to the experience they gained during that year.
42–8. Space Operations Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. Reserve Component Space Operations officers serve in the same role as their Active
Army counterparts. Therefore, the development objectives and qualifications for the RC Space Operations officer
basically parallel those planned for their Active Army counterparts. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation
through assignments in their basic branches before specializing in FA 40. They may also establish credentials relevant
to Space operations in their civilian careers and should keep their career managers apprised of specific competencies
with potential application to their future as Army Space professionals. The quality and quantity of training that RC
Space Operations officers receive prior to mobilization dictates, to a large extent, their wartime effectiveness (see chap
7 for more guidance on RC officer development).
b. Functional area qualification and development opportunities. Reserve Component officers should strive for Space
Operations assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as their AC counterparts even though they are
limited by geographical considerations. The citizen–soldier’s dual role presents a unique challenge in pursuing such -an
ambitious development program. To meet professional development objectives, RC Space Operations officers may be
required to rotate among ARNG and USAR troop program units, the IRR, the individual mobilization augmentee,
IRR–augmentee, the Army Joint Reserve Element, or AGR programs. The intent is to provide as many officers as
possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions due to the limitations imposed by
geographical considerations, which necessitates these transfers. Additionally, there may be occasions when RC officers
will be transferred to the Trainee, Transient, Holdee Student (TTHS) account while they complete mandatory educational requirements. Such transfers should not be seen as impacting negatively on the officer’s career. The success of

426

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

an RC officer is not measured by the length of service in any one component or control group, but by the officer’s
breadth of experience, duty performance and adherence to the requirements described herein. Every attempt will be
made to assign RC officers to FA 40 or a branch-qualified position. Unlike their Active Army counterparts, geographic
constraints limit the ability of RC officers to stay in FA 40 positions throughout their career. When barriers such as this
deny the opportunity to successfully participate in the USAR, officers are encouraged to seek qualification and
utilization in related FAs (FA 24, FA 30, or FA 34). Reserve Component FA 40 qualification standards are as follows:
(1) Lieutenant. Not applicable.
(2) Captain.
(a) Obtain basic branch qualification.
(b) Complete the CCC.
(3) Major.
(a) Successfully complete intermediate level education common core.
(b) Successfully complete either the resident or reserve version of the Space Operations officer portion of intermediate level education.
(c) Serve in an FA 40 position for a minimum of 24 months (may include some space-related schooling or training
with on the job experience preferred).
(d) Officers are encouraged to obtain a master’s degree from an accredited college or university in a space-related
discipline to reinforce additional skills required for certain Space Operations assignments.
(4) Lieutenant colonel. Serve in an FA 40 position for a minimum of 24 cumulative months (may include some
space–related schooling or training with at least 12 months of job experience) as a field grade officer.
(5) Colonel. All Space Operations officers selected for COL should be enrolled or have applied for the U.S. Army
War College (Distance Education Course, non–resident, if not selected for the resident course). They will primarily
serve as Space Operations officers on MACOM or HQDA staffs as senior practitioners in their FA or may be assigned
to an officer generalist (01A) position.

Chapter 43
Public Affairs Functional Area
43–1. Unique features of Public Affairs functional area
a. Unique purpose of Public Affairs functional area. Public Affairs (PA) is an occupational specialty within the IO
career field in which trained and experienced PA officers (FA 46) work within the 21st century global information
environment to tell the Army story. The DA chief of PA is the proponent for FA 46. The PA officer’s principle
function is to help the commander effectively communicate with internal and external audiences during peacetime,
conflict, and war. Public affairs is a force enhancer and an information operations combat multiplier. Public Affairs
officers provide commanders with the expertise and guidance to conduct public affairs and/or information operations
and enhance the command’s ability to collect, process, and act on information. Because mass media and information
technologies reach audiences immediately, PA officers assist the commander to anticipate and address the media
impact on internal (command information) and external (public information) audiences. Army PA programs play a vital
role in the ability of a command to meet its military objectives.
b. Unique functions performed by Public Affairs functional area. The PA mission is to keep the American people
and the Army informed and to help establish conditions that lead to confidence in America’s Army. This includes
providing information to soldiers and government and contract employees on their roles, keeping family members
informed, explaining to the American public what the Army is doing, maintaining effective relationships with
communities and stakeholder groups, and responding to issues that arise from media coverage or community
interaction.
c. Unique features of work in Public Affairs functional area. Effective Army PA requires the application of
professional and technical skills from the military and civilian sectors. Public Affairs officers are personal staff officers
or principals who supervise PA staffs, lead PA units, or serve as secretary of the General Staff. They serve on the
principal staff at brigade and higher. They serve as instructors at the Defense Information School (DINFOS), Fort
Meade, MD, and other institutions. They provide PA coordination at all levels of command and are responsible for
effective execution of the PA core processes—
(1) Advisor to commander and staff. Public Affairs officers provide the advice and counsel regarding the public
(internal and external) implications of all major decisions and actions. This role includes—
(a) Counseling commander and staff as to strategies to achieve information dominance and reduce misinformation,
rumors, uncertainty, fear and enemy disinformation efforts.
(b) Participating in boards, cells, and advisory groups.
(c) Contributing to the preservation of public support.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

427

(2) Public affairs planning. The process of continuously assessing operational situations for public affairs implications, developing solutions, and monitoring the effects of PA operations. This includes—
(a) Participating in the military decisionmaking process through the preparation of PA estimates. Advising commanders and staff members on global information environment issues likely to impact operations and how military
operations may be perceived globally.
(b) Developing PA courses of action, risk assessments, PA annexes and plans, information strategies and preparation
of PA guidance. Conducting research on audience attitudes and perceptions of policies, programs and information
needs.
(c) Monitoring ongoing PA campaigns and the PA aspects of military operations, assessing their effectiveness and
making adjustments as required.
(d) Supervising and executing the PA planning, policy, research, and resource management functions. This role
involves anticipating PA issues, developing solutions, and conducting follow–up analyses.
(3) Execute information strategies. The development and execution of synchronized campaigns using all available
and appropriate methods of communicating messages to inform internal and external audiences and maintain 2–way
communication with those audiences. This role includes—
(a) Acquisition of information to support message development.
(b) Production of stories, news releases, digital and Web–based media products or other information products from
acquisition source material, which includes all aspects of editing and producing a final product.
(c) Distribution of products to target audiences through an appropriate medium; leveraging all appropriate components of the global information environment to achieve maximum audience penetration.
(d) Protecting information from inadvertent public release, enforcing security procedures at the source and monitoring the operational security of public affairs operations.
(4) Conduct media facilitation. The process of assisting media representatives in covering Army and Joint operations; maximizing their access to soldiers while also maximizing the commander’s access to the media. This process
includes—
(a) Assisting media entry into the area of operations.
(b) Registering media representatives.
(c) Orienting media on coverage ground rules and ensuring they understand security policies.
(d) Arranging interviews and briefings; coordinating unit visits and unit escorts.
(e) Analyzing and providing thorough and timely responses to media queries.
(f) Embedding media in operational units.
(g) Establishing and maintaining liaison with media representatives.
(h) Advising the commander on DOD and/or Army regulatory requirements and policies regarding the timely
release of information.
(i) Serving as a spokesman for the commander to the media.
(5) Conduct public affairs training. This process provides or coordinates PA training for soldiers, government
civilians, contract employees, and family members, as well as specialty training for PA professionals, which includes—
(a) Training conducted at the installation or home station.
(b) Integration of PA training into staff exercises, field exercises, and combat training center rotations.
(c) Management and support of professional development programs and training to support lifetime career progression of PA soldiers and civilians.
(6) Community relations. This process maintains effective community relations that contribute to the morale of
soldiers and their families, directly supports public understanding of America’s Army, enhances the projection and
sustainment capabilities of Army installations and garners hometown support for soldiers and their families. Specific
community relations efforts include—
(a) Evaluating community relations programs and public attitudes through formal, developed feedback mechanisms.
(b) Development and management of community relations programs such as commander’s councils and speakers’
bureaus.
(c) Planning and arranging special events, open houses, tours, speaking engagements, exhibits and demonstrations.
43–2. Public Affairs officer characteristics required
a. General. Public Affairs officers are tactically proficient because of their basic branch training and assignments.
This grounding in the operational Army is vital to success and credibility as PA officers. Because of their roles in IO
and duties that require them to explain the Army and its operations to a wide range of external and internal audiences,
PA officers must maintain a sound grasp of Army doctrine and warfighting knowledge throughout their careers. All PA
officers require security clearances and access to programs to perform their duties at the level to which they are
assigned.
b. Unique skills. Functional area 46 officers form a pool of highly qualified communications and information

428

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

operations officers capable of supporting tactical, operational, and strategic level requirements in peace and war.
Functional area 46 officers are required to display a wide range of skills, knowledge, and attributes.
(1) Interpersonal skills. Public Affairs officers are part of the combined arms and Joint and expeditionary teams.
They must be skilled in building teamwork within their staff organization and recognize they often simultaneously
belong to many teams; facilitating development of those teams. In addition, they must—
(a) Be effective, exemplary communicators with highly developed speaking and listening skills.
(b) Demonstrate outstanding leadership skills in tactical and institutional environments; apply those skills in dealing
with military and civilian personnel.
(c) Have highly developed coaching, mentoring, and facilitating skills.
(2) Conceptual and decisionmaking skills. Public Affairs officers must have sound judgment and be both critical and
creative in their thinking. They routinely operate in high level staff assignments where guidance may be minimal and
close interaction with senior level decisionmakers is frequent. They work in a dynamic, high tempo environment and
must be highly skilled, effective staff officers with the ability to synthesize data and to clearly communicate information. Public Affairs officers work independently and make decisions with little or no immediate supervision. The ability
to work under pressure and deal positively with stress is essential.
(3) Tactical and technical skills. Public Affairs officers must exhibit proficiency in professional knowledge, judgment, and warfighting. They apply skills from the military and private sectors and must—
(a) Master and apply a comprehensive set of communication, public relations, counseling and advising skills to
accomplish PA missions.
(b) Incorporate and apply advanced automation and information management skills to the PA FA.
(c) Be the Army’s experts in all forms of internal, external, interpersonal, organizational, intercultural, and mass
communications, to include training others in communications skills.
c. Unique knowledge. Public Affairs officers are well versed in current Army organization, structure, and doctrine.
In addition, they—
(1) Possess a comprehensive knowledge of public relations, organizational communications, and issue management.
(2) Remain current on developments in the civilian community for possible application to their area of expertise.
d. Unique attributes. Public Affairs officers must exhibit intellectual honesty with superiors and be unafraid to state
and defend their convictions. Public Affairs officers must often deliver unpleasant news and persuade superiors to
approve or accomplish difficult or unattractive courses of action. They must—
(1) Possess a deep respect for the principles of Constitutional democracy. No one can effectively perform as an
Army PA officer without a thorough knowledge of the Constitution and the conviction that the American people have a
right to know.
(2) Realize they represent the Army and the commander first and have a specific mandate to help Army leaders gain
and keep public support for Army leadership goals.
(3) Understand a fundamental tenet of Army PA philosophy is that the best way to gain and maintain public support
is to always tell the truth. Integrity is paramount.
(4) Be warfighters capable of leading change and accommodating ambiguity in the conduct of operations in the
global information environment.
43–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. General. The goal of FA 46 development is to provide a successful career within the IO career field while
providing the Army world–class PA officers. All FA 46 officers begin their careers in one of the Army’s accession
branches and attend branch basic and advanced courses. Officers who have served successfully in company grade
positions are highly desired for designation to the PA FA between their 8th and 12th years of service. Designation is
based upon the needs of the Army, officer preference, military experience and in some cases, civil schooling. Most
officers will not receive an FA 46 assignment until selection to MAJ and career field designation into the IO career
field as a PA officer.
b. Functional area qualification and development. Attendance at the Defense Information School’s Public Affairs
Officer Qualification Course (PAOQC) is mandatory for all FA 46 officers prior to their first FA 46 assignment.
Functional area 46 officers whose first PA assignment is with the American Forces Radio and Television Service
(AFRTS) or a Broadcast Operations Detachment (BOD) attend specialized training in the management and administration of AFRTS networks after attending PAOQC. FA 46 officers assigned to AFRTS or BOD positions later in their
career will attend this training en route to the assignment.
(1) Captain. Experience in the PA FA at the grade of CPT is not a requirement for promotion to MAJ, but could
enhance selection to PA during the career field designation process. The FA 46 CPT positions are key developmental
billets, but in the current OPMS are not crucial to career progression in the FA. At this level, officers can serve as PA
detachment commanders, mobile PA detachment team leaders, or personal staff PA officers.
(2) Major. After selection to MAJ, officers will be designated into one of the 4 OPMS career fields by a career field
designation board. Public Affairs officers in the IO career field serve primarily in operational PA or SGS assignments.
Functional area 46 MAJs should aggressively seek key assignments in which they are the principal spokesperson for
DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

429

operational units or mobile PA detachment commanders. Other qualifying jobs include nominative assignments on
headquarters, DOD, and Joint staffs. MAJs who complete required developmental training and have served successfully
for at least 24 months in a PA assignment are considered qualified for promotion in the FA. They compete against
other officers in the IO career field for promotion to LTC. Completion of the intermediate level education common
core curriculum and the Public Affairs Staff Officers Course (PASOC) are essential for all MAJs to be competitive for
promotion to LTC.
(3) Lieutenant colonel. Officers selected for LTC should seek assignments of greater responsibility as a PA officer
or SGS in operational units. Functional area 46 LTCs are generally assigned to senior staff positions where they can
fully use their knowledge of the Army and their FA. Public Affairs officers who have demonstrated high potential will
be assigned to flag officer level commands and nominative positions on HQDA, DOD, and Joint staffs, and AFRTS
network command slots. LTCs are encouraged to seek PA assignments within Joint commands.
(a) Professional development. A graduate degree in a PA related discipline is highly desired, but not required, for
FA 46 LTCs prior to primary zone consideration for promotion to COL. Additionally, PA officers are encouraged to
seek professional accreditation through organizations such as the Public Relations Society of America or the International Association of Business Communicators.
(b) Functional area qualification. Functional area 46 officers are considered FA qualified and eligible to compete in
the IO career field for promotion to COL if they have 48 months cumulative PA experience. They also must have
served in one of the following positions:
1. Principal PA officer for a 2–star or 3–star level commander for at least 18 months.
2. AFRTS LTC level network commander for 24 months.
3. Director of an Office of the Chief of Public Affairs field operating activity. All FA 46 officers should have served
a minimum of 18 months time in field grade operational or equivalent assignments, preferably as a PA officer, prior to
consideration for promotion to COL.
4. Colonel. All FA 46 COLs should complete resident or non–resident Senior Service College. As the senior
practitioners in their FA, they serve primarily on Joint, MACOM, or HQDA staffs. Key assignments include combatant
commands and MACOM PA officer positions, director of Army Broadcasting Service, director of Army Public Affairs
Center, director of the Defense Information School or division chief billets on the HQDA and DOD PA staffs.
c. Joint assignments. Functional area 46 officers will serve in Joint commands whether they are formally assigned to
a Joint Duty Assignment List position. Officers assigned to Joint Duty Assignment List positions will meet all JPME
requirements and attend the DINFOS taught Joint Public Affairs Operations Workshop. Only officers who meet current
regulatory requirements will be designated as Joint Specialty Officers (skill identifier 3L). Functional area 46 officers
normally will not be considered for assignment to Joint Duty Assignment List positions until they have served an initial
Army FA 46 assignment and been selected for promotion to MAJ. Because not all FA 46 officers will serve in Joint
Duty Assignment List assignments, the absence of a Joint assignment will not preclude their selection to COL.
d. Assignment preference and precedence.
(1) Assignment sequencing. Prior to their first FA 46 assignment, all officers will receive their initial FA training at
DINFOS. All PA officer assignments require incumbents to be graduates of the Public Affairs Officers Qualification
Course (PAOQC). In addition to the PAOQC requirement, an AFRTS or BOD assignment requires successful
completion of the DINFOS Broadcast Management Course (BMC). It is extremely important that an officer’s first FA
46 assignment be a position where he or she is personally supervised or mentored by a senior PA officer and works
with PA NCOs.
(2) Precedence. Some FA 46 billets will be designated as requiring advanced civil schooling or Training With
Industry. Officers assigned to those jobs must complete the required courses prior to reporting to their duty assignments. Officers who have successfully completed Training With Industry programs will be assigned to jobs that
provide the Army maximum benefit from this valuable training.
43–4. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. General. Most PA assignments are 36 months. Tours could be longer in areas with a high concentration of billets
such as the National Capital Region. Outside continental United States locations will continue to require tour lengths
specific to those regions.
b. Key Public Affairs functional area qualification assignments. Public Affairs Detachment commanders will serve
for 18 to 24 months. Mobile Public Affairs Detachment commanders will serve for 24 months. Unless assigned to a
short tour area, PA assignments will be a minimum of 24 months, however the goal is to serve at least 36 months.
AFRTS network commanders serve for 24 to 36 months per theater assignment policies.
c. Public Affairs functional area life cycle. Figure 43–1 depicts the PA life cycle model.

43–5. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is sustain a cadre of highly qualified PA officers while providing a viable career path to COL for
high–potential FA 46 officers. Functional area 46 officer inventory must be optimized to fulfill PA and SGS
requirements while providing sufficient time for FA qualification prior to consideration for promotion to LTC and
COL.
b. Officer Personnel Management System implementation. The number of authorized FA 46 authorizations, by
grade, will vary as force structure decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more
information on current authorizations or inventory should contact the HRC FA 46 assignments officer.
43–6. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Public Affairs
a. Structure. Public Affairs officers serve in all echelons worldwide. Functional area 46 positions exist in Army
operational units, headquarters staffs, Joint commands, and national agencies.
b. Acquire. FA 46 officers comprising a particular year group are designated into the FA between their 8th and 12th
years of service. The criteria for selecting an officer to the PA FA include civilian degree concentration, grade point
average, personal preference, and manner of performance.
c. Distribute. After designation into the IO career field at the grade of MAJ, the HRC Career Management Division
will manage FA 46 officer assignments. Functional area 46 officers will be assigned in accordance with Force
Stabilization strategies.
d. Deploy. Public Affairs is a high demand, low–density career field. Functional area 46 officers are warfighters who
remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide. Whether assigned to TOE units with high levels of
readiness or TDA organizations, all FA 46 officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum
of conflict. Functional area 46 officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to
protect national interests, or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than war, such as
humanitarian and peace keeping missions. Public Affairs officers must prepare themselves and their families for this
challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustain. Officers designated into the IO career field will compete within their career field for promotion to LTC
and COL.
f. Develop. Public Affairs officer development is based upon institutional training, operational assignments, and
self–development. Effective development and sustainment of FA 46 skills and knowledge occurs throughout the FA 46
life cycle.
(1) Training. Functional area 46 institutional training includes the following elements:
(a) Initial specialty training. This training is conducted at DINFOS. All FA 46 officers attend the 8–week Public
Affairs Officer Qualification Course prior to their initial PA assignment. The PAOQC provides the basic knowledge
and skills required to perform entry-level PA officer duties. Officers selected for their first broadcast assignment will
attend the BMC at DINFOS.
(b) Public Affairs Staff Officers Course. The course is taught at Fort Meade, usually following the DINFOS taught
PAOQC. The PASOC teaches subjects unique to Army PA and complements the intermediate level education common
core curriculum. The PASOC must be completed to obtain career field qualification.
(c) Graduate level advanced civil schooling. Some FA 46 officers attend Army-funded graduate school in a PA
related discipline. Selection is competitive and normally occurs after the 8th year of service. Following graduation,
officers are assigned to Army Educational Requirements System (AERS) designated utilization positions.
(d) Training With Industry Program. High-potential officers spend from 10 to 12 months training with leading print,
broadcast or public relations companies. Following graduation, they are assigned to AERS designated positions. The
nomination process for training with industry is similar to the advanced civil schooling program process, but officers
should have completed MEL 4, have 24 months PA experience and be highly competitive for promotion.
(e) Combined advanced civil schooling and/or training with industry program. This highly competitive program
places an officer in a program that combines graduate level schooling with a training with industry assignment. At the
completion of an 18-month program, the officer receives a graduate degree in public communication along with
training with industry experience at a leading international Washington, DC—based public relations firm. The officer
then serves a utilization tour in the Office, Chief of Public Affairs or as the PA assistant to a senior Army leader.
(f) Joint Communications Course. Sponsored by DINFOS, this graduate–level course is taught at a major university
and is geared toward communication theory, research, and evaluation. Credit earned can be applied toward a graduate
communication degree.
(g) Intermediate level education common core curriculum. Functional area 46 MAJs will attend the 12–week
common core course in residence at a course location site. Full intermediate level education credit is awarded when the

432

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

officer has completed the common core course and the PASOC. Reserve Component officers can attend The Army
School System (TASS) classrooms located in CONUS and OCONUS course location sites.
(h) Broadcast Management Course. Taught at Fort Meade for officers who are en route to an AFRTS or a BOD
assignment. The course familiarizes officers with AFRTS broadcast management principles, station management and
broadcast policies.
(i) Joint Public Affairs Operations Workshop. Taught at DINFOS for officers in need of essential information about
PA activities in the Joint environment.
(2) Operational assignments. Public Affairs officers should serve in operational and generating force assignments.
Public Affairs officers should have least 48 months cumulative field grade public affairs experience prior to primary
zone consideration for promotion to COL.
(3) Self–development. Public Affairs officers must pursue an aggressive self–development program. Membership and
accreditation by a relevant professional organization is strongly encouraged. Professional reading and research is key to
maintaining strategic and tactical skills and knowledge. Public Affairs officers must maintain currency with doctrinal
developments, Joint PA policies and procedures, and overall U.S. political, economic and military strategies. All PA
officers must be familiar with HQDA level strategic communications programs and goals.
g. Separate. Public Affairs officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
43–7. Public Affairs Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. Reserve Component (RC) FA 46 officer development objectives and qualifications
parallel those of their Active Army colleagues. Since the majority of tactical Public Affairs assets are in the RC, RC
Public Affairs officers can expect active duty deployments in support of Army and Joint missions. This mandates an
equivalent development program for RC FA 46 officers.
b. Public Affairs Reserve Component functional area qualification and development. Development and qualification
will be equivalent to the AC. Greater use of distance learning approaches will be used to ensure delivery of required
training and education to RC officers. RC Public Affairs officers should seek the same developmental opportunities as
their AC counterparts or equivalent opportunities available in the Army National Guard or U.S. Army Reserve. RC
officers will not be awarded FA 46 until successful completion of the Public Affairs Officer Qualification CourseDistance Learning (PAOQC–DL) (phase II) or the resident PAOQC. RC officers enrolled in PAOQC–DL may serve in
a public affairs billet prior to completion. PAOQC–DL must be completed within 3 years of enrollment. Successful
completion of PAOQC–DL or PAOQC is required prior to assumption of PA TOE unit command. Officers assigned to
Broadcast Operations Detachments should attend BMC following PAOQC–DL or PAOQC completion. Qualification
requirements may be waived only with the concurrence of the Chief, Army Public Affairs. FA 46 exception to policy
requests should be forwarded through the appropriate RC Public Affairs headquarters for review before reaching the
Army Public Affairs Center for a final decision. Contact the appropriate RC Public Affairs headquarters or the Army
Public Affairs Center for current procedures.
c. Public Affairs Reserve Component assignments. RC FA 46 officer assignments parallel those of their AC
colleagues with some inherent component unique differences. These component unique positions include State Area
Command PAO, BOD Commander/Operations Officer and Unified Command Staff IMA. Because the majority of
tactical Public Affairs assets are in the RC, RC Public Affairs officers can expect active duty deployments in positions
of Coalition Press Information Center Staff Officer/Director in support of ongoing Army and Joint missions. Many
positions parallel the AC, to include Public Affairs Operations Center commander, MPAD commander, brigade combat
team PAO, UEx PAO/SGS, TSC PAO/SGS.
d. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model is shown at figure 43–2.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(2) Major. Upon selection for promotion to MAJ, a career field designation board (CFDB) that occurs in conjunction with the MAJs board designates officers into one of the 4 career fields. FA 53 officers are designated into the
Information Operations career field and then serve the remainder of their careers primarily in their FA.
(a) Officers become qualified in FA 53 by completing the Information Systems Operations Leveler (ISOL) course
followed by the Information Systems Management (ISM) course.
(b) Officers who complete a graduate or Ph.D. degree either through the fully funded Advanced Civil Schooling
program or through other means are considered initially qualified in FA 53. Non–branch 25 officers are required to
attend the Information Systems Operators Course (ISOL) upon graduation from an FA 53 directed ACS assignment.
The graduate degree must be in computer science, information technology, information systems management, or related
disciplines.
(c) Selected FA 53 officers may complete graduate school or other civilian training opportunities to prepare them for
FA 53 assignments requiring additional skills. All officers are encouraged to pursue a specialty related graduate degree
or specialty related industry certification program.
(d) Typical developmental assignments include—
1. Information Systems Manager, UEy Theater Network Command (TNC)

13. Information Assurance Officer
(3) Lieutenant colonel. LTCs are generally assigned to senior staff positions where they can fully use their
knowledge of the Army and their information systems management experience. At this grade, FA 53 officers will
mainly serve in their FA. LTCs should concentrate their professional development in information systems management
and try to complete the DOD Chief Information Officer (CIO) course offered by the National Defense University.
Typical developmental assignments at LTC include—
(a) Corps/UEy Automation Management Officer (CAMO)
(b) Corps/UEy/theater CSS AMO
(c) Director/Chief at MACOM/1st IO Command/HQDA/DOD/Joint Activity/Multinational staff level
(d) Staff and Faculty at U.S. Military Academy/Army War College/National Defense University/Command and

(4) Colonel. All FA 53 officers selected for COL should successfully complete Military Education Level (MEL) 1,
Senior Service College. As senior practitioners in their functional area, they will primarily serve as FA 53 officers on
MACOM or HQDA staffs, or may be assigned to branch/functional area generalist positions. Typical developmental
assignments include—
(a) Deputy Chief of Staff for Information Management (DCSIM), sustaining base MACOM
(b) Director/Deputy /Chief at MACOM/HQDA/DOD/Joint Activity/Multinational staff level
(c) Director, School of Information Technology, SIGCEN
(d) Chief Information Officer (CIO)/Chief Technical Officer (CTO)
(e) Staff and Faculty at U.S. Military Academy/Army War College/National Defense University
c. Functional area qualification. All FA 53 positions are key and essential to professional development and
considered FAQ positions. Any time served in a position formerly coded as AOC 24B, Computer System Engineer, is
equivalent to serving in a FA 53 position.
(1) Major.
(a) Complete MEL 4, Command and Staff College or ILE.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

437

(b) Complete initial functional area qualification requirements outlined in paragraphs 44–3b(2)(a) or 44–3b(2)(b),
above.
(c) Serve a total of 24 months in any FA 53 coded MAJ position.
(d) For eligibility for promotion to LTC, FA 53 MAJs must have completed ILE.
(2) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Complete initial functional area qualification requirements outlined in paragraphs 44–3b(2)(a) or 44–3b(2)(b),
above.
(b) Serve 24 months in any FA 53 coded LTC position.
(3) Colonel.
(a) Complete MEL 1, Senior Service College (resident or non–resident)
(b) Serve 24 months in any FA 53 coded COL position
d. Joint assignments. Many FA 53 field grade positions are on the DOD Joint Duty Assignment List. Officers
assigned to Joint Duty Assignment Lists billets may attend Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) II and may be
designated as a Joint Specialty Officer (skill identifier 3L) upon successful tour completion.
44–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
The assignment sequencing in a functional area is not as rigid as that of a branch. However, the professional
development of FA 53 officers does have certain requirements to ensure all are well grounded in information systems
management. Officers must complete initial entry qualification before their first utilization assignment. Once officers
are career field designated FA 53, the focus of all training, education and developmental assignments should be in
information systems management and military operations. As part of lifelong learning and professional development,
FA 53 officers have the responsibility to continuously seek civilian education opportunities, industry certification and
related military training.
a. Preferences. Although not required, FA 53 officers are encouraged and may be offered the opportunity to obtain a
master’s or Ph.D. degree in one of the fields of study listed in paragraph 44–3a and/or obtain certifications from
civilian industry in areas related to information technology. Officers are encouraged to complete the DOD CIO
Certification course at the National Defense University.
b. Precedence. All officers must complete the ISOL course prior to attending the ISM course. All officers must
complete the ISM course or obtain a master’s degree in one of the fields of study listed in paragraph 44–3a prior to
initial assignment in their functional area. Some FA 53 billets will be designated as requiring advanced education,
either military or civilian. Officers assigned to those jobs must complete the required degree program or courses prior
to reporting to their duty assignments.
44–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
The goal under Force Stabilization rules for most FA 53 assignments is 36 months. Tours may be longer in areas with
a high concentration of FA 53 billets such as the National Capital Region. OCONUS locations will continue to require
specific tour lengths. Figure 44–1 depicts the functional area qualification requirements and developmental assignments
by grade.

438

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

439

44–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for FA 53 officers. To do this, the field grade
inventory must be optimized in order to fulfill functional area and generalist authorization requirements and to provide
field grade officers sufficient time for functional area qualification prior to consideration for promotion to LTC and
COL. In order to enhance specialization and development, FA 53 officer participation in generalist (01A) positions
should be minimized.
b. Structure. The number of FA 53 authorizations, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions are made and
actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more information on current authorizations or inventory should
contact the FA 53 Personnel Proponent Office or the FA 53 assignments officer at Human Resources Command.
44–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Information Systems Management
a. Structure. FA 53 officers serve at all echelons worldwide. FA 53 positions exist at all Army levels of command
down to brigades. The majority of FA 53 related billets are on MACOM, Army and Joint staffs. However, in concert
with Army Transformation, the FA 53 officer is also assigned in the Brigade Combat Team, Stryker Brigade, Legacy
Brigade, UEx, and the UEy.
b. Acquire. FA 53 officers are accessed in the following ways:
(1) All CPTs in the Army Competitive Category (ACC) may request FA53 designation at any time between their
5th and 10th years of service. The request is submitted through the HRC Web site, or by contacting the FA 53
assignment officer at HRC. Additionally, the FA 53 proponent will actively recruit quality CPTs into FA 53. Officers
accessed in this manner are dual tracked and are not guaranteed an assignment nor CFD as an FA 53. The pool of
available officers identified in this manner is used to select those officers who will receive training and an assignment
in FA 53. This process replaces the Functional Area Designation Board (FADB).
(2) Select CPTs may receive early career field designation into FA 53 to fill company grade requirements. These
officers will have their CFD as an FA 53 re–validated upon selection for promotion to MAJ.
(3) The majority of officers receive final designation into the MAJ during the CFDB immediately after selection for
promotion to MAJ. They are then single–tracked in FA 53 from MAJ through COL.
(4) Qualified officers in the Operational career field may submit a Request for Personnel Action (DA Form 4187) to
HRC to request transfer to FA 53/IOCF. Request for transfer are approved subject to the officer’s qualifications and the
Army’s requirements in the basic branch and functional area.
c. Distribute. The Career Management Division (CMD), Officer Personnel Management Directorate (OPMD) at
HRC, manages all officers serving in FA 53 assignments. Officers who complete an FA 53 assignment and are not
CFD as an FA 53 will return to the control of their basic branch manager at HRC. All CFD FA 53’s (CPT through
LTC) remain under the control of CMD. The COLs division, OPMD, HRC, manages FA 53 COLs.
d. Compensate. FA 53 officers receive the same pay, entitlements and benefits as all other officers.
e. Deploy. Information Systems Management officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally
prepared to deploy worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed
site TDA organizations, all FA 53 officers are deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of
operations.
f. Sustain. CPTs will compete for promotion to MAJ within the Army Competitive Category. Upon selection to
MAJ, officers career field designated as FA 53 in the IOCF will compete for promotion to LTC and COL against other
officers within the IOCF. Officers who are CFD into the IOCF as FA 53 are eligible to change their regimental
affiliation to the Signal Regiment. This is accomplished in accordance with AR 600–82, through the local military
records personnel office, or by contacting the FA 53 personnel proponent office.
g. Develop. FA 53 incorporates a professional officer development career plan offering significant opportunity for
schooling and assignments. As FA 53 officers progress through their careers, they should seek advanced military
schooling and education opportunities to stay abreast of the rapidly changing information technology field. FA 53
officers should diversify their assignments to broaden their operational experiences and increase their skills, knowledge
and abilities in military information technology. FA 53 officers are encouraged to complete civilian certification
programs related to information systems technology.
(1) Training. FA 53 institutional training includes the following elements:
(a) Information Systems Operations Leveler Course (ISOL), Fort Gordon, GA.
(b) Information Systems Managers Course (ISMC), Fort Gordon, GA.
(c) Intermediate Level Education Common Core Curriculum. The FA 53 senior CPTs and MAJs will attend the ILE
common core in residence at a Course Location (CL) site. Normally, the CL for FA 53 officers is Fort Gordon, GA.
Upon completion of the common core course, FA 53 officers are Intermediate Staff College (ISC) graduates and
credentialed Joint Professional Military Education I (JPME I). Full ILE credit is awarded an FA 53 officer upon
completion of the ILE common core, the Information Systems Operations Leveler Course (ISOL), and the Information

440

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

Systems Managers Course (ISMC). The ILE common core is taken before, after, or in conjunction with the ISOL/
TSEC course sequence. In select cases, an appropriate graduate degree or training with industry program may take the
place of ISOL/TSEC for ILE credit. Full ILE credit is required prior to promotion to LTC. Reserve Component officers
can attend The Army School System (TASS) classes located in CONUS and OCONUS as well as CL sites.
(d) National Defense University. NDU offers several professional development programs which apply to FA 53.
These include the Chief Information Officer (CIO) Certificate Program, Information Assurance Certificate Program,
and Information Assurance Scholarship Program.
(2) Civilian training and education. The programs below are available for FA 53 officers to enhance their skills
within their career field.
(a) Training With Industry. The TWI is a work–experience program to provide an extensive exposure to managerial
techniques and industrial procedures within corporate America to competitively selected officers and NCOs. Training
received is normally not available either through the military school system or civilian university system. An officer is
assigned to a 1–year tour with an approved industry partner, followed by a 2–year utilization assignment. FA 53
officers can apply for TWI by contacting their assignments officer at HRC.
(b) Signal Regiment Graduate Education Program (SRGEP). The U.S. Army Signal Center partners with civilian
universities to provide information technology related graduate degree programs for FA 53 officers. These programs
are available worldwide online. Selected graduate classes are also available in residence at Fort Gordon, GA. Interested
officers should contact the FA 53 Proponent for more information.
(c) Information Assurance Scholarship Program (IASP). The IASP is a competitive, fully funded scholarship
program open to officers and civilians throughout the DOD. Selected officers attend graduate school full–time and earn
a master’s or doctorate degree in the field of Information Assurance. Officers interested in this program should contact
their assignments officer at HRC.
(3) Self–development. FA 53 officers should pursue an aggressive self–development program throughout their
careers that includes such elements as industry certifications, academic certificates, professional licenses, and memberships in professional organizations.
h. Separate. FA 53 officers separated from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
44–8. Information Systems Management Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. Army National Guard and USAR Information Systems Management officers serve
the same role and mission as their Active Army counterparts. The unique nature of the RC soldier’s role as a
citizen–soldier poses a significant challenge for professional development. To fulfill the wartime mission of managing
information systems and providing information systems expertise at all levels of command including multinational and
Joint service, the Information Systems Management officer is dependent upon extensive interaction between the Active
Army and the RC. The quality of the Information Systems Management officers in the ARNG, USAR, and IRR is vital
to support this mission (see chap 7, for RC officer development).
b. Functional area development opportunities.
(1) Information Systems Management officers in the RC have challenging and complex missions. Inherent with
these missions are specific managerial and technical attributes for supervising information management activities,
translating mission needs to computer systems requirements, budgeting for information systems requirements and
developing/managing information systems. FA 53 officers must be tactically and technically proficient and capable of
understanding the scope of an Information Systems Management officer’s duties. A requirement for proficiency in both
peacetime and wartime skills will provide significant educational and experiential challenges. Planned rotation into
progressively challenging FA 53 related positions, while considered essential to producing the best qualified Information Systems Management officer, may be limited due to geographical considerations.
(2) Geographic dispersion of Information Systems Management positions constrains RC career progression. To meet
professional development objectives, RC Information Systems Management officers should be willing to rotate between assignments with USAR TPU, ARNG units, and IMA positions. Often there are insufficient numbers of
positions in a geographic area to continue in Information Systems Management functional area assignments. If
geographic constraints are such that the assignment to an Information Systems Management position is not possible,
officers should seek assignment in their basic branch or a related functional area required in the geographic region.
(3) TDA organizations host most RC Information Systems Management officer assignments and all AGR FA 53
positions. Their duties and responsibilities are fundamentally the same as their AC counterparts except for those
personnel management, administrative and operational requirements unique to the ARNG and USAR.
(4) Officers may be assigned to the IRR when unable to accept a TPU or ARNG unit assignment. Officers in the
IRR may request assignment to a Reinforcement Training Unit (RTU), individual mobilization augmentee position, a
tour of Active Duty for Special Work (ADSW), Annual Training (AT), or Active Duty for Training (ADT). Officers in
the IRR may meet professional military education (PME) requirements by requesting ADT. All RC officers, MAJ and
below with less than 15 years of Active Federal Service (AFS), may request AGR assignment.
(5) Reserve Component FA 53 authorizations will vary as force structure decisions are made and actions to
implement them are taken. USAR Officers desiring more information on current authorizations or positions may

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

441

contact the Combined Functional Area Management Office (CFAMO) at the Human Resources Command, St. Louis,
MO. The ARNG officers desiring more information on current authorizations or positions may contact the National
Guard personnel office of the state or territory in which they reside.
(6) Reserve Component officers (CPT and above) who acquire information systems management skills, knowledge
and attributes in a civilian workplace or through education and training may apply for constructive credit to award FA
53. Awarding constructive credit is based on documented experience in information systems management; professional
certifications, advanced degrees, and civilian workplace experience. Candidates should submit requests for constructive
credit with supporting documents through their ARNG or USAR component chain of command to Commander,
USASC&FG, Office Chief of Signal, ATTN: ATZH–POO, Fort Gordon, GA 30905. Supporting documents include (as
applicable)—
(a) Cover letter outlining qualifications
(b) Resume
(c) DA Form 2–1/officer record brief (ORB) or biographical record brief (BRB)
(d) Transcripts (graduate and/or undergraduate)
(e) OERs/civilian job evaluations
(f) Civilian training certificates
(g) Industry certification certificates (MCSE, MCP, CNA, and so forth)
(h) Letters of recommendation
c. Professional development. There are 4 phases of professional development for RC Information Systems Management officers. The phases relate to military rank and depict broadly based goals and career opportunities at each rank
so that an officer may expand capabilities and optimize performance. Information Systems Management life cycle
development objectives, RC requirements and an officer’s own strengths, priorities, civilian experience, private and
service provided educational level, and performance influence his or her professional development. In addition to the
typical duty assignments found in paragraph 44–3b, RC officers may be assigned to other developmental positions,
some of which are listed within the functional area qualification standards by grade, as follows:
(1) Captain. Initial entry qualification in Information Systems Management requires officers to complete the
Information Systems Management (ISM) course at Fort Gordon or obtain a graduate degree as outlined in paragraph
44–3a above. During this phase, officers are encouraged to pursue a specialty- related graduate degree. Officers should
seek an FA 53 assignment as CPT but it is not required. Additional typical RC CPT positions include Systems
Automation Officer, Automation Management Officer, Software Engineer Officer, and Systems Operations Officer.
(2) Major. The primary professional development objective of Information Systems Management MAJs in the RC is
to continue to strengthen information systems management skills. During this phase, officers must enroll in and
complete Command and Staff College (MEL 4) level military education, ILE, or its equivalent (50 percent completion
required for promotion to LTC). Selected RC officers may attend the ILE common core course at a course location site
such as Fort Gordon, GA. FA 53 MAJs are highly encouraged to pursue a specialty related graduate degree.
Information Systems Management MAJs should serve a minimum of 24 months cumulative service in an Information
Systems Management operations or operational support MAJ position to be considered FA qualified. Additional typical
RC MAJ positions include Information Management Officer and Systems Analyst.
(3) Lieutenant colonel. LTCs can expect assignments to senior staff positions employing them in a variety of diverse
and challenging functional area related positions. FA 53 officers should seek professional military education at the
Senior Service College level. Information Systems Management RC LTCs are eligible for selection to the rank of COL
upon completion of the requisite service requirements listed in chapter 7 of this pamphlet. LTCs remain eligible for
promotion as long as they continue to serve in an active status and meet selection criteria. Information Systems
Management LTCs should serve a minimum of 48 months cumulative service in FA 53 positions to be considered
functional area qualified. Additional typical RC LTC positions include Assistant DCSIM, Automation Support Officer,
and Information Management Plans Officer.
(4) Colonel. RC FA 53 COL positions are limited and reserved for qualified FA 53 officers. The primary objective
for officers during this phase is to use previously developed technical and tactical capabilities, as well as managerial
and executive skills and experience to accomplish the RC information management mission at the Regional Support
Command, State Adjutant General, National Guard Bureau, and DA levels.
d. Reserve Component life cycle model. The RC life cycle development model for FA 53 officers is shown at figure

Simulation Operations Functional Area
45–1. Unique features of Simulation Operations functional area
a. Unique purpose of Simulation Operations functional area. High operational tempo (OPTEMPO), transformation,

442

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

operational requirements, digitization, new weapon systems and emerging threats have increased our reliance on
simulations for force readiness. The Army requires a group of officers who understand the application of modeling and
simulation and can exploit its capability for training and military operations. The Director, Battle Command Simulation
and Experimentation Office is the proponent for Simulation Operations (FA 57).
b. Unique functions performed by Simulation Operations functional area. Simulation Operations (FA 57) functional
area officers apply models and simulations to create the environments that prepare soldiers, leaders and units for
current and future battles. FA 57 officers plan and employ a mix of live, virtual and constructive simulations in support
of training, and military operations. FA 57 officers integrate modeling and simulation with battle command systems.
Additionally, FA 57 officers assist in the development of current and future simulations and battle command systems.
c. Unique features of work in Simulation Operations functional area. FA 57 officers work at all levels, and perform
the following functions and tasks:
(1) Provide simulation operations support to soldiers, leaders and units at all levels of command (Active Army, RC,
and Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational).
(2) Develop doctrine, organizations and equipment for the FA 57 mission area.
(3) Provide simulation operations support at service schools and Combat Training Centers.
(4) Provide subject matter expertise in the acquisition and, development of models and simulations.
(5) Experts who develop, plan, coordinate and execute exercises at all levels of command; Army, Joint, Interagency
and Multi-National
(6) Experts in Battle Command and the integration of simulations for both training and military operations.
(7) Serve in a wide range of activities to include management of training simulation systems, simulation operations
management and the application of simulation within the training exercises and military operations (TEMO).
(8) Serve as advisors to assist research, development and acquisition (RDA), advanced concepts and requirements
(ACR) domains.
45–2. Officer characteristics required
a. General. The Simulation Operations functional area requires officers that understand military operations and
training. An FA 57 is steeped in tactics, techniques and procedures; and is dynamic, competent and possesses the
following characteristics:
b. Competencies and actions common to all. Army officers must be warfighters who can effectively apply the 4 core
dimensions of leadership: values, attributes, skills and actions. (for additional discussion of these leadership dimensions, see FM 22–100) The 4 core leadership dimensions provide the basis for what a leader must be, know and do.
The values and attributes set the basis for the character of the leader - what a leader must be. The skills developed by
leaders establish his or her competence - what a leader must know. The actions that leaders conduct and execute
constitute leadership - what a leader must do. The leadership framework describes a leader of character and competence who acts to achieve excellence across the spectrum of operations from total war, to operations other than war, to
disaster relief and in times of peace.
(1) Leader Values. Values are at the core of everything the Army is and does. The Army is an institution of people
with unique and enduring values. These values must be a part of the men and women—officers, enlisted personnel and
civilians—who are the Army. These values provide the sense of purpose necessary to sustain our soldiers in combat
and help resolve ambiguities in operations other than war. Officers must establish and maintain an environment in the
Army where soldiers and civilians do what is right; where we treat each other as they should be treated; and, where
everyone can be all they can be. There are 7 Army Values (LDRSHIP).
(a) Loyalty. Bear true faith and allegiance to the U.S. Constitution, the Army, your unit and other soldiers.
(b) Duty. Fulfill your obligations.
(c) Respect. Treat people as they should be treated.
(d) Selfless Service. Put the welfare of the Nation, the Army and your subordinates before your own.
(e) Honor. Live up to all the Army Values.
(f) Integrity. Do what’s right, legally and morally.
(g) Personal Courage. Face fear, danger or adversity (physical or moral) with the spirit and determination of a
warfighter.
(2) Leader attributes. Attributes are fundamental qualities and characteristics. Attributes assist in defining what an
officer should be and contribute to leader actions. Army leader attributes are described in 3 categories - mental,
physical and emotional.
(a) Mental attributes describe aptitudes and capacities for learning that leaders should possess and develop. Included
in this category are will, self–discipline, initiative, judgment, confidence, intelligence and cultural awareness.
(b) Physical attributes specify physical dispositions or aptitudes that can be nurtured and developed. Included in this
category are health fitness, physical fitness, stamina, military bearing and professional bearing.
(c) Emotional attributes are those affective aptitudes or capacities that contribute to how one feels and substantially
contribute to leadership. Included in this category are self–control, balance and stability.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

443

(3) Leader skills. Skills are synonymous with competencies. They are abilities or competencies that one develops
and uses with people, with ideas and with things. Competence is of primary importance for all Army officers. The
Army recognizes that officers must develop 4 types of skills.
(a) Interpersonal skills reflect competence in communicating with people.
(b) Conceptual skills refer to competence in handling ideas.
(c) Technical skills reflect competence with things.
(d) Tactical skills refer to the ability to put together technical, interpersonal, and conceptual skills and apply them to
warfighting tasks.
(4) Leader actions. Officers provide purpose, direction and motivation as they influence their subordinates, operate
to accomplish their mission and strive to improve their unit or organization. Leader actions are how Army officers act
to achieve excellence and get the job done. These actions are applicable across all levels of leadership.
(a) Influencing refers to the use of appropriate people skills to guide subordinates or teams toward mission
accomplishment. Influencing subdivides into communicating, decisionmaking and motivating.
(b) Operating or accomplishing the mission refers to the relative short term actions of getting the job done.
Operating subdivides into planning, executing and assessing.
(c) Improving refers to the long–term investment–type actions essential to improving everything the leader influences. Improving subdivides into developing (people), building (teams) and learning.
c. Unique skills.
(1) Conceptual competence. FA 57 officers must possess the ability to synthesize information and to clearly
communicate information required to make timely decisions. The uncertain conditions of military operations will
demand mental endurance and agility, often under severe conditions and time constraints. FA 57 officers must
effectively develop and communicate their vision, purpose and direction.
(2) Interpersonal competence. FA 57 officers are part of a combined arms team. They must be skilled in building
teamwork within their organization and recognize that they often simultaneously belong to many teams. They must
possess the ability to express themselves to their team members clearly, concisely and accurately, both orally and in
writing.
(3) Technical competence. FA 57 officers must possess the necessary expertise to accomplish all tasks and functions
of the functional area. They must be able to apply their technical knowledge and skills to solve problems within the
TEMO domain and assist in both the ACR and RDA domains. They must be able to prepare and present clear and
informative briefings relating to their technical areas of expertise to their peers, subordinates and superiors.
(4) Tactical competence. FA 57 officers must show proficiency in required professional knowledge, judgment and
warfighting. They must apply their doctrinal knowledge and understanding to the solution of tactical problems, and
formulate and defend solutions to problems using current Army and Joint doctrine.
(5) Decisionmaking skills. FA 57 officers often work in an environment where sound and timely decisions must be
made while time available for problem analysis is seriously constrained. Information gained in this environment will
vary in its completeness and ambiguity. An ability to operate under stress and make decisions is critical to success.
(6) Tactical and technical skills. FA 57 officers must be warfighters who are technically proficient with modeling
and simulation tools, command and control systems, collaborative planning and mission rehearsal systems. FA 57
mission success requires that officers understand the capabilities simulations offer and can leverage their capabilities to
enhance unit proficiency. FA 57 officers must leverage their simulation experience to assist in the development of the
Army’s future simulations environments. These skills must be gained and developed through operational assignments
and continuous professional study and self-development.
d. Unique knowledge. FA 57 officers must:
(1) Retain competency in the basic warfighting skills of their basic branch.
(2) Understand the organization, structure and doctrine of the warfighting Army, other DOD simulation organizations, as well as other National, civil commercial and allied simulation activities.
(3) Possess expertise and knowledge to support military units and staffs at all levels in planning and executing
realistic simulation training in dynamic, synthetic environments.
(4) Create a synthetic training environment for commanders, units and staffs to conduct structured, interactive
training sessions linked through technology.
(5) Design and implement unique simulation/C4I system federations to support training, exercises and military
operations.
(6) Possess expert knowledge of battle command systems and their employment.
(7) Possess expert knowledge of various simulation systems and their employment.
(8) Understand how to design and support experimental efforts to test Battle Command configurations, C3I design
concepts, doctrinal techniques, and so forth, through well-designed and properly controlled experiments.
(9) Understand how to integrate technology with training and combat developments.
(10) Understand DOD and Army policies that govern the development and use of simulations.

444

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(11) Possess expert knowledge on Battle Command concepts and procedures. Understand how to leverage mission
planning and rehearsal collaborative systems in an operational environment.
e. Unique attributes. FA 57 officers must:
(1) Display systems management skills and the ability to understand, monitor and improve systems.
(2) Work and excel in a dynamic, complex and high-tempo environment performing functions that are typically not
intuitive to the majority of their contemporaries.
(3) Integrate technology and training principles to accomplish the mission/task.
(4) Be familiar with the overall requirements for comprehensive integration of software, hardware, networks and
communications to support simulation training activities.
(5) Possess the ability to think creatively and have a well-developed ability to reason both critically and intuitively.
(6) Analyze and solve complex technical problems.
(7) Demonstrate intellectual honesty with superiors and be unafraid to state and defend convictions.
45–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. General. Functional area qualification and development.
(1) Captain. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop proficiency as
a company commander and staff officer. An officer selected for FA 57 is eligible for an FA 57 assignment after a
branch experience assignment (usually successful command), one year in an FA 57 job or successful completion of
Advanced Civil Schooling (ACS). Captains designated FA 57 will receive developmental training prior to any FA
assignment. Captains requesting to career field designate FA 57 after their selection to MAJ should have completed an
operations assignment as an S–3, S–3 Air, Assistant S–3, Assistant G–3, FSO, Support Operations Officer, CTC
Observer/Controller or some other equivalent branch experience assignment. FA 57 experience as a CPT is not a
requirement for promotion to MAJ, but could enhance selection for the Simulation Operations Functional Area
designation.
(2) Major.
(a) All Army Competitive Category officers will undergo a career field designation board upon selection for MAJ.
This board of senior officers will decide in which career field each officer is best suited to serve. Majors who receive
the Simulation Operations FA will be designated into the Information Operations career field. Most FA 57 officers will
complete training during this period of their career and then serve primarily in FA assignments.
(b) Functional Area 57 MAJs will attend ILE/AOWC, Simulation Operations Qualification course prior to the
beginning of their initial FA 57 assignment.
(c) Functional area training for FA 57 MAJs is completion of the Simulation Operations Qualification course, ILE/
AOWC completion (MEL4) and one or more of the following branch experience assignments:
1. One year as a UEy, UEx G3, Simulation Officer
2. One year as a SUA/EAD/EAC Brigade/Regiment Assistant S3 (or equivalent), Simulation Operations Officer, or
FA 57 position
3. One year in a Joint duty FA 57 position,
4. Two years in any other FA 57 position,
5. Successful completion of ACS plus one year in a FA 57 position.
(d) A number of FA 57 billets are located within Joint commands. FA 57 officers will be assigned into the Joint
arena as they progress through increasing levels of responsibility.
(e) Typical FA 57 assignments for majors may include: Joint duty FA 57 positions, HQDA Army Model and
Simulation Office, Division and EAD/EAC Brigade/Regimental FA 57 staff officers, ACS utilization and proponent
branch school FA 57 representative.
(f) Majors should continue self-development efforts to become an expert in all aspects of simulation operations.
Self-development should include correspondence courses, civilian education and institutional training. Officers should
devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their technical and warfighting perspective.
(3) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Officers selected for LTC functional area 57 are generally assigned to more senior level positions where they
can fully use their knowledge of the Army and functional area. The objective of LTC professional development is
greater contribution to the functional area and the Army.
(b) FA 57 functional area qualifying assignments for Lieutenant Colonels include one-year assignments as:
1. CTC Simulation Officer
2. Deputy DOS
3. Chief, Battle Simulation Center/ Battle Command Training Center/Mission Support and Training Facility
4. Joint duty position FA 57 staff officers
5. Branch Chiefs at the National Simulation Center.
6. Director of Operations at the Warrior Preparation Center or Deputy Director of Simulations USAREUR Battle
Command Training Center (UBCTC)
DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

445

(c) Functional Area qualification for FA 57 LTCs can also be accomplished by 2 years in any other FA 57 position.
(4) Colonels.
(a) The professional development objective for COLs is greater contribution to the FA and the Army.
(b) Functional Area 57 Functional Area qualification assignments for COLs include 1-year assignments as:
1. Chief Exercises and Training UEy
2. Director, National Simulation Center
3. Commander, Warrior Prep Center
4. Senior Military Fellow, NDU
5. Deputy Director, Aviation Battle Lab
6. Deputy Director, Battle Command, Simulation and Experimentation Directorate (BCSE)
(c) FA 57 Functional Area Qualification for FA 57 COLs can also be accomplished by a 2–year assignment in any
other FA 57 position.
(d) Colonels who have not previously attended the FA qualification course will attend the course at the earliest
opportunity after Functional Area designation. Those selected to attend Senior Service College (SSC) must complete
the Simulation Operations Qualification course prior to SSC attendance.
b. Joint assignments. FA 57 officers can expect to be considered for Joint duty assignments worldwide. Even though
Joint experience is important to the Army and to individual officers for advancement into senior leadership positions,
not all FA 57 officers will receive Joint assignments. This will not preclude their selection to the grade of COL.
c. Other assignments. FA 57 functional area officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those
indicated above. These other assignments may include White House Fellows, duty with the National Security Council,
the United Nations, as well as FA 57 functional area representatives at Allied service schools. The spectrum of possible
assignments is large and these assignments require mature, skilled, and well-grounded officers.
45–4. Assignment preferences and precedence.
a. Preferences. The Simulation Operations functional area has diverse career development path opportunities. The
goal of the professional development of FA 57 officers is to produce a talented group of officers who have developed
both as operational and simulation specialists. Assignments in the functional area will be made to develop the FA 57
officer’s ability to achieve that goal. Requests from FA 57 officers for assignments that do not contribute directly to
this goal must be fully justified.
b. Precedence. All officers will attend the ILE / AOWC prior to their initial FA 57 assignments. Some FA 57 billets
are designated as requiring advanced education. Officers assigned those jobs must have completed the necessary
courses of instruction prior to reporting for duty.
45–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Key Simulation Operations functional area qualification positions. Functional Area Qualification for FA 57
officers is defined by grade as stated above.
b. Simulation Operations functional area life cycle. Figure 45–1 displays a FA 57 functional area timeline with
qualifying developmental and utilization assignments.

446

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

447

45–6. Requirements authorizations and inventory.
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for FA 57 functional area officers. To do this the field
grade inventory must be optimized in order to meet functional area authorizations.
b. OPMS implementation. The numbers of authorized FA 57 billets, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions
are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more information on FA 57 authorizations and
inventory are encouraged to contact the Simulation Operations Proponent Division or the HRC, Career Management
Division (CMDP) FA 57 assignment officer.
45–7. Key life cycle initiatives for Simulation Operations
a. Structure. The FA 57 force structure has gone through some significant changes in the last several years, and will
see modest growth through FY 2009 primarily in the grades of LTC and COL.
b. Acquire. Some CPTs will be FA designated into the Simulation Operations FA between their 5th and 6th years of
service. Majors will receive the FA 57 FA designation and Operational Support career field designations through a
career field designation process immediately after selection for MAJ.
c. Distribute. The Functional Area 57 (Simulation Operations) Assignments Branch, Career Management Division
(CMD) at HRC OPMD.
d. Deploy. Simulation Operations officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to
deploy worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to MTOE units with high levels of readiness or TDA organizations,
all FA 57 officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. FA 57 officers may
deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests; or as individuals to
support Joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping missions.
e. Sustain. OPMS III controls the manner of execution of 2 major actions, which affect FA 57 officer career
development.
(1) Promotion. FA 57 functional area officers compete for promotion only within their career field. Promotion
numbers and percentages should reflect Army and functional area requirements.
(2) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS III.
Starting with CPT, the rater and senior rater will recommend on the officer’s OER the career field which best suits his
or her abilities and interests.
f. Develop. FA 57 will offer some diversity for assignment and professional development. The increasing complexity
of the technical skills required will mandate that some officers attend Advanced Civil Schooling or Training With
Industry. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments. Selfdevelopment continues to be an essential component of officer development.
g. Separate. The officer separation process remains unchanged.
45–8. Simulation Operations Reserve Component (RC) officers
a. General career development. RC Simulation Operations officer development objectives and qualifications basically parallel those planned for their Active Army counterparts. Due to the complexity and detailed understanding of
Army systems and functions required to serve effectively in this functional area, junior officers must develop a strong
foundation through assignments in their branch before functional area specialization begins.
b. Assignment opportunities. RC Simulation Operations officers can expect assignment opportunities that mirror
those of Active Army officers as well as positions applicable exclusively to the Reserve Component. The success of an
RC Simulation Operations officer is not measured by length of service in any one component or control group, but by
the officer’s breadth of experience, duty performance, and adherence to functional area requirements. Simulation
Operations assignments are primarily Troop Program Units (TPU) within training and exercise divisions; there are
limited amount of positions for Active Guard Reserve (AGR) and Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) personnel. Civilian acquired skills, advanced military and civilian education, and demonstrated abilities to function in a
simulation environment are highly desirable for assignment to any RC FA 57 position.
c. Functional area qualification and development opportunities.
(1) The unique nature of the RC soldier’s role as a citizen–soldier poses a challenge for professional development.
However, RC officers are expected to follow AC officer development patterns as closely as possible, except that RC
officers are expected have increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. To meet professional
development objectives, RC officers must be willing to rotate between ARNG and USAR TPU, Individual Ready
Reserve (IRR), (IMA) Program, and the AGR programs. These transfers are necessitated by geographical considerations, as well as the need to provide as many officers as possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and
staff positions. Additionally, there may be occasions when RC officers will be transferred to the IRR while they

448

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

complete mandatory educations requirements. Such transfers will be temporary and should not be seen as impacting
negatively on the officer’s career.
(2) RC FA 57 officers assigned to these -positions must continually develop their knowledge and analytical skills.
RC officers awarded FA 57 will be offered the opportunity to pursue continuing education opportunities (civilian and
military), and government internship programs. Major: Should complete not less than 50% of the Command and
General Staff College or its equivalent. Assignments could include Simulation Training Officer and Operations Officer
positions within Battle Projection Groups. Upon assignments to a Functional Area 57 position, the Simulation
Operations Qualification Course must be completed, if not previously completed and serve in a FA 57 position for
twelve months. In addition, officers should strive to obtain Advanced Civil Schooling compatible with FA 57 position
requirements. Lieutenant Colonel: Must complete Command and General Staff College. Must complete the Simulation
Operations Qualification Course if not previously complete and serve in a FA 57 position for twenty-4 months. Should
strive to complete the Senior Staff College and obtain Advanced Civilian Schooling compatible with FA 57 position
requirements. Assignments include Chief and Scenario Chief, Operations Officer and Deputy Director positions within
Battle Projection Groups. Colonel: The professional development objective for colonels is greater contribution to the
functional area and the Army. Colonels should attend the Simulation Operations Qualification Course. Those selected
to attend Senior Service College should complete the course by resident or correspondence. Currently there is one
assignment available - Simulation Director, Battle Projection Groups.
d. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for Simulation Operations officers will
essentially mirror that for Active Army officers, except that assignments will not be limited to 1 component or control
group within a component (see fig 45–2 for a typical RC FA 57 career).
45–9. Simulation Operations Army National Guard (ARNG) Officers
a. General career development. ARNG officer development qualifications for most Functional Areas normally
parallel those of their Active Army counterparts. However, because there are very limited Functional Area 57 positions
allocated on State/Territory TDAs or MTOEs, there is no clear career path as is established for the Active Army. Also,
because ARNG TDA/MTOE positions are allocated per State/Territory, and because Force Structure and geographical
constraints limit movement within these positions ARNG officers are not career field Designated. ARNG officers may
serve in more than one career field throughout their military service.
b. Functional Area qualification and development opportunities. Officer qualifications and development opportunities for those desiring assignments in Functional Area 57 positions are as follows: Lieutenant: Following commissioning, Lieutenants must complete an Officer Basic Course and complete various company grade assignments. These may
include Platoon Leader, Company Executive Officer, and Battalion Staff Officer. Captain: Must complete Captain’s
Career Course. Officer should strive to serve as a company commander. Other career enhancing assignments for CPTs
include battalion/brigade staff officer, battalion liaison officer, and CTC observer/controller. Upon assignment to a
Functional Area 57 position, completion of the Simulation Operations Qualification Course is required. Major: Should
complete not less than 50% of the Command and General Staff College or its equivalent. Assignments could include
Battalion Executive Officer, Battalion/Brigade Staff Officer, Battalion LNO, and various HQ STARC TDA positions.
Upon assignment to a Functional Area 57 position, the Simulation Operations Qualification Course must be completed,
if not previously completed, and serve in a FA 57 position for twelve months. In addition, Officers should strive to
obtain Advanced Civilian Schooling compatible with FA 57 position requirements. Lieutenant Colonel: Must complete
Command and General Staff College. Must complete the Simulation Operations Qualification Course if not previously
completed and serve in a FA 57 position for twenty-4 months. Should strive to complete the Senior Staff College and
obtain Advanced Civil Schooling compatible with FA 57 position requirements. Desirable assignments include Branch
Chief at the National Simulation Center. Colonel: The professional development objective for colonels is greater
contribution to the functional area and the Army. Colonels should attend the Simulation Operations Qualification
Course. Those selected to attend Senior Service College should complete the course by resident or correspondence.
c. Life cycle development model. The Army National Guard component life cycle development model for Simulation
Operations officers will essentially mirror that for Active Army officers (fig 45–2).

Part Five
Operational Support Career Field
Chapter 46
Introduction to the Operational Support Career Field
46–1. Unique features of Operational Support career field
a. The Operational Support career field (OSCF) supports the evolving U.S. capabilities–based defense strategy. The
OSCF officers are warfighters who perform functions requiring in–depth experience and knowledge in positions
spanning Service, Joint, DOD and National Security level organizations and staffs as well as in national and
international industrial and political environments. The career field coordinator for the OSCF is the CG, AMC.
b. The FAs that comprise the career field have been grouped together, in part, because of similar goals for
experience, development and advancement of these groups is based upon requirements, statute and policy, and because
officers within these 2 FAs work almost exclusively at the strategic level— but often in direct support of operational
leadership. This bridging of the strategic and operational levels of warfare is what distinguishes the OSCF from others.
In general, OSCF officers will be expected to serve in positions of increasing responsibility with distinct and FA
specific development objectives.
46–2. Composition
a. The Foreign Area Officer (FAO) (FA 48) FA provides the Army with a cadre of officers with in–depth
experience and knowledge in political–military operations and regional expertise. Foreign Area officers provide
specialized expertise concerning political–military considerations in support of senior Army, Joint, and national
decisionmakers. These officers use their regional expertise, foreign language proficiency, and foreign contacts to
advance U.S. interests in their specific regional areas of concentration and to enhance the effectiveness of the Army in
working and interacting with foreign armed forces, foreign governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and
other elements of indigenous populations. Unique to FAO is a capability for up to 20 percent of a year group cohort to
develop in the Operations career field and later transfer to the OSCF, where they will serve in FAO positions for the
remainder of their careers (see chap 46).
b. The Army Acquisition Corps (AAC) (FA 51) FA develops, integrates, acquires and fields the systems critical to
decisive victory in the 21st century. The AAC officers work closely with the user or user representative, acquisition
leaders (military and civilian) and industry during the development and acquisition of systems. The AAC officers bring
to the acquisition process a firsthand knowledge of military operations combined with technical and managerial
competence.
46–3. Career options
a. General considerations. Each FA has its own career development pattern. Qualification in each of the 2 OSCF
FAs is addressed in detail in their respective chapters. Acquisition Corps officers have command and project/program
manager opportunities within their FA.
b. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. The OSCF officers may serve in officer generalist (01A) assignments prior to consideration for COL as long as there is a sufficient trained population to support the additional
requirement and these positions are not filled to the detriment of valid 48 and 51 coded requirements. These
assignments are intended to broaden the perspective and, in some cases, renew operational experiences for officers.
These officer generalist positions are found on headquarters staffs to include HQDA, Joint Staffs, multinational
commands, and service school/USMA faculty and staff.
c. Joint assignments. There is considerable opportunity for FAOs to serve in Joint assignments as Defense attaches,
security assistance officers, arms control specialists, or staff officers on Joint Staffs. The AAC officers may serve in
Joint assignments, particularly in contracting and production related billets. There is a limited but important need for
AAC Joint Service officers. Joint Service broadens the knowledge base of individual officers, and the Army perspective that these officers bring to the Joint arena is valuable to the health of the Service.

451

and develops commissioned officers to meet worldwide Army requirements for officers possessing a unique combination of strategic focus, regional expertise, foreign language proficiency, and professional military skills and experience.
Foreign Area Officers possess expert military knowledge of the region, advanced language skills, and a studied cultural
and political understanding, which enable them to increase success and reduce risk across the full spectrum of
operations from major combat to stability operations. They operate decisively in uncertain environments, often
independently, as a valuable force multiplier to commanders and senior leaders from the tactical to the strategic level.
FAOs combine regional expertise, language competency, political-military awareness and professional military skills to
advance U.S. interests. The FAO enhances the effectiveness of the Army in working and interacting with the U.S.
interagency, DOD agencies, other Services, combatant commands, foreign armies and armed forces, foreign governments, NGOs, and non–state representatives of indigenous populations. As an attaché, security assistance officer,
political–military staff officer, arms control specialist, advisor, liaison officer or military instructor, the FAO can best
be described as the Army’s soldier–Statesman. Foreign Area Officers are managed under the Operational Support
career field. The deputy chief of staff for Strategy, Plans, and Policy (DCS, G–3/5/7) is the proponent for FA 48.
b. Unique functions performed by Foreign Area Officer functional area. Work within the FAO functional area
requires the application of learned skills and specialized knowledge in critical positions worldwide. FAOs are often the
sole Army and/or DOD representatives in foreign countries serving as executors of national security policies or as key
advisors to senior level commanders. They:
(1) Serve at embassies worldwide as Defense and Army attachés.
(2) Serve in critical positions, both CONUS and OCONUS, as security assistance officers.
(3) Provide critical advice to senior commanders while serving as political-military advisers in Army Unit of
Employment-operational-level headquarters (UEy), COCOMs, MACOMs and Joint staffs; as well as to senior civilian
leaders within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Defense Agencies, the State Department, and the White House.
(4) Serve around the world as arms control specialists.
(5) Represent Army interests and policies as liaison officers to foreign armies and armed forces.
(6) Serve as Planners at the Joint Staff, Defense Agencies, Combatant Commands, UEy, and the Army Staff.
(7) Serve as analysts at Defense Agencies and Joint staffs.
(8) Train the leaders of the future while serving as instructors at the U.S. Military Academy, Command and General
Staff College, National Defense University, Army War College and other military schools.
c. Unique features of work in Foreign Area Officer functional area.
(1) Foreign Area Officers serve worldwide in critical and sensitive positions requiring extensive regional expertise
and experience. The FAO functional area provides the Army with a cadre of officers with in-depth experience and
knowledge in political-military affairs focused on specific regions of the world.
(2) FAOs provide specialized expertise concerning political-military considerations in support of senior Army, Joint
Force, and national decisionmakers. The FAO’s role combines professional military knowledge, regional and politicalmilitary expertise, and language competency.
(3) FAOs use their regional expertise and cultural awareness to advance U.S. interests in their regional areas of
concentration. A FAO’s knowledge and skills amplify and build on the foundation of professional military knowledge,
experience, and values that an officer gains through basic soldiering. The FAO program provides officers with
opportunities to develop skills required for conducting and analyzing the interrelation between military activities and
potential economic, social, cultural, or political realities within a region or country.
(4) Foreign Area Officer Assignments Branch, Human Resources Command (HRC) does not assign officers below
the grade of MAJ.
(5) FAOs are trained as regional experts in one of the following nine areas of concentration (AOC). In some cases
officers trained in one AOC may be assigned to work in another, based on their language, experience, and/or the needs
of the Army.
(a) Latin America (AOC 48B). Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama,
Venezuela, Colombia, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Guyana, French Guiana,
Suriname, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Cuba and the Caribbean.
(b) Europe (AOC 48C). United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Norway, Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark,
Luxembourg, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Slovak
Republic, Poland, Albania, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro (including Kosovo), Macedonia,
Finland, Romania, Greece, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, Andorra, San Marino, Lichtenstein, Slovenia, Cyprus and
Iceland.
(c) South Asia (AOC 48D). India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives.
(d) Eurasia (AOC 48E). Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
(e) China (AOC 48F). China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Mongolia.

47–2. Officer characteristics required
The FAO functional area requires officers who are skilled in leadership at all levels; who are steeped in Army doctrine
and branch tactics, techniques and procedures; who possess strong Army Values, leader and warrior attributes; and who
fully understand the key leadership actions that must be taken to assure success. FAOs are expected to remain well
rounded in Army and basic branch skills.
a. Unique skills.
(1) Foreign Area Officers must demonstrate an aptitude for learning foreign languages by attaining an acceptable
score on the Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB). The minimum DLAB score for designation as a Foreign
Area Officer is 90. The minimum score for officers designated to study Category (CAT) I and II languages is 90. The
minimum score for officers designated to study CAT III languages is Study of a CAT IV language requires a minimum
DLAB score of 110.
(2) Foreign Area Officers must possess the demonstrated academic aptitude to obtain an advanced degree. The
officer’s undergraduate record and Graduate Record Exam (GRE) scores must be adequate for admission to quality
graduate schools. Effective 1 Oct 02, minimum scores for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) test are 500 points
on the verbal assessment, 500 points on the quantitative assessment, and 4.0 in the analytical writing assessment.
Scores for tests taken before 1 October 2002 are acceptable if taken within the past 5 years, but require a minimum of
500 in each of the 3 academic scored sections (verbal, quantitative and analytical). Additionally, officers must have a
Time in Service (TIS) of less than 17 years AFCS by the start of Advance Civil Schooling (ACS) IAW AR 621–1.
HRC Leader Development Division is the authority for exceptions to policy regarding attendance at a government
funded graduate degree program. Officers will be granted the opportunity to attend advanced civil schooling strictly in
accordance with the needs of the Army, applicable Army policy, and the availability of resources.
(3) Foreign Area Officers are required to possess solid leadership and warrior skills. A Foreign Area Officer must be
well versed on Army organization, structure and doctrine. Every officer starts his or her Foreign Area Officer career
with a solid grounding in the operational Army and its doctrine. No officer is selected for Foreign Area Officer training
without having first successfully completed company grade leader development and having obtained quality experience
in basic branch assignments. Ideally, for officers in most branches this will include company-level command. Throughout their careers, Foreign Area Officers continue to hone their military knowledge and warfighting skills through
completion of the ILE core course (phase I) or accredited MEL–4 equivalent program, and, on a select basis, Joint
Forces Staff College (JFSC) and Senior Service College (SSC). Continuous professional self- study to maintain
currency in Army doctrine and policy and in branch–specific knowledge is the hallmark of the professional FAO.
(4) Foreign Area Officers routinely serve in staff positions in which they provide political-military advice to senior
level military commanders, civilian leadership, and foreign armed forces. A Foreign Area Officer must therefore
possess the exceptional verbal and written communication skills required (in both English and the target language(s)) to
succeed in these environments and to ensure that the Army and its policies are well represented.
(5) Foreign Area Officers routinely serve in positions where little guidance and oversight is provided and must
therefore possess exceptional military expertise and experience, self-discipline, maturity, and moral and ethical
standards.
b. Unique knowledge.
(1) Foreign Area Officers often serve in positions where they are the sole Army and/or DOD representative, whether
in foreign countries, on combined/international staffs, or while serving within other U.S. government agencies. Foreign
Area Officers must therefore be well versed in U.S. foreign policy and in the evolving US capabilities-based defense
strategy. It is imperative that Foreign Area Officers are fully prepared to serve as integral players in the Joint,
interagency and combined operational and strategic environments.
(2) Foreign Area Officers are expected to remain current on the political-military, economic, social and cultural
issues relevant to the Foreign Area Officer’s regional AOC.
(3) Foreign Area Officers must maintain fluency in their regional language. The minimum acceptable level of
proficiency upon completion of initial language training is defined as achieving "limited working proficiency" on the
listening, reading, and speaking portions of the Defense Language Proficiency Test (2/2/1+) with a goal of attaining
"general professional proficiency" (3/3/3) in all 3 areas upon completion of all FAO training. Once trained, Foreign
Area Officers should maintain general professional proficiency in a language appropriate for the assigned region. If

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

453

they do not achieve general professional working proficiency after one year following completion of training or
previous substandard test score, or fail to test or certify annually, their qualification as a FAO may be in jeopardy and
their future assignment options may be adversely impacted. In the most serious cases, such officers may be reclassified
into another career field.
(4) A comparison between old and new language proficiency rating systems is found in Table 47–1.

4 ORB Example: 30 30 20040411 - shows officer with General Prificiency and last date of examination. The date is used to manage assignment requirements by HRC personnel.

c. Unique attributes.
(1) The vast majority of Foreign Area Officers serve in nominative/Joint positions. Therefore, Foreign Area Officers
must possess the standards of integrity, conduct, professional ethics, and security discipline necessary to be eligible for
these sensitive positions.
(2) The Foreign Area Officer functional area is unique among the specialized functional areas in that some of its
officers can and do serve in positions coded 01A (generalist) or 02A (combat arms generalist). Many of these positions
require the unique combination of operational war-fighting competency, foreign language proficiency, and regional
expertise that select Foreign Area Officers possess.
(3) All officers must be eligible for a Top Secret security clearance based upon a Special Background Investigation
(SBI) under Army Regulation 604–5.
(4) The officer’s spouse and other dependent family members must be U.S. citizens.
(5) The officer’s spouse and other dependent family members must be free of serious or chronic medical problems
that would preclude worldwide assignment. If a family member is enrolled in the Exceptional Family Member Program
(EFMP) with a condition that prevents him/her from living overseas, the officer must be prepared to serve repetitive,
unaccompanied overseas tours.
(6) Given the nature of Foreign Area Officer assignments, Joint domicile needs can be extremely difficult to
accommodate. Officers with military spouses should carefully consider the potential personal costs in terms of family
hardship prior to choosing a Foreign Area Officer career.
47–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
CPTs who are interested in becoming FAOs must make their preference selection using the HRC–established link on
AKO. The FAO proponent will select candidates from among the CPTs who indicate a preference in becoming FAOs
or who may already possess FAO–required skills, knowledge, and attributes. Beginning with COHORT year group
1995, a DA board will subsequently select those officers who will begin FAO training and assign each a regional
AOC. Officers who successfully complete FAO training will be career field Designated in FA 48 without their files
going through a separate CFD board. Their CFD designation will be announced concurrently with the other CFD

454

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

officers in their year group. This process will ensure officers selected to begin FAO training are not removed from
training and designated into another functional area or returned to basic branch by subsequent CFD boards.
a. Functional area qualification and development. The life cycle of the FA 48 functional area is based on the 3
domains of leader development - institutional training, operational assignments and self-development. These 3 leader
development concepts focus and shape FAO management in terms of accession, training, utilization and professional
development. The program begins with a lengthy education and training period to develop officers who will serve as
regional specialists in the grades of MAJ, LTC, and COL. The Army makes a considerable investment in training
FAOs, investing 2 1⁄2 to 4 years in the process. FAO skills, once obtained, must be continually maintained and
improved upon throughout the officer’s career.
(1) Training requirements. All Foreign Area Officers must complete the following training unless granted a waiver
or constructive credit by the Foreign Area Officer Proponent. Officers selected for FAO training who do not
satisfactorily complete or receive constructive credit for language training, ICT, and/or ACS, may be returned to the
Operations career field or re-designated into another functional area.
(a) Language training. Foreign Area Officers are provided with basic language training in an appropriate target
Language. This training is normally conducted at the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center (DLIFLC)
or the Defense Language Institute Washington (DLI–W). The duration of these courses ranges between 6 to 18 months,
depending on the level of difficulty of the language. The Foreign Area Officer must achieve minimum language
proficiency during entry-level training in order to continue in the program. Minimum language proficiencies are listed
in paragraph 47–2b(3). The language assigned in training is dependent upon the in–country training site and the needs
of the Army. If additional language training is required such as for attaché duty, the relevant parent agency will fund
the training. Foreign Area Officers are required to take the Defense Language Proficiency Test in at least 1 of their
control languages annually, and are expected to maintain the minimum required standards to remain qualified in grade.
Failure to maintain minimum language proficiency with a current Defense Language Proficiency Test may be a
discriminator in DA boards and in HRC consideration for FAO assignments.
(b) Advanced Civil Schooling. A fully funded graduate education is a privilege made available only to officers with
demonstrated potential for continued service. ACS may be denied or deferred if an officer cannot meet requirements of
AR 621–1 (or gain a waiver from those requirements), or if an officer is deemed to have limited potential. Officers
attending graduate schooling via the Army’s ACS program will obtain a master’s degree in Area Studies or International Affairs/Relations with a strong regional focus. Foreign Area Officers attend graduate schools approved by the
Foreign Area Officer Proponent as published in the list of approved graduate degree programs. To ensure a robust and
high quality graduate education base for the Foreign Area Officer Corps, Proponent supports the goal that at least one
third of Army Foreign Area Officers will attend medium cost graduate programs. In some years this is not feasible due
to Army–wide resource limitations. For the majority of low-density areas of concentration, the only appropriate
graduate programs are with medium cost schools. Those officers entering the Foreign Area Officer program who have
already completed a graduate degree in a Foreign Area Officer related discipline may apply for constructive credit from
HQDA, DAMO–SSF, and if approved, will not attend further graduate schooling at Army expense as part of the formal
FAO training process. Appropriate Foreign Area Officer related disciplines include: international economics, foreign/
international affairs, international security studies, geography, geopolitics, government, regional history, Master of
Military Arts and Science (MMAS) (from a CSC with a Foreign Area Officer–related concentration), national security
studies, political science, social science and strategic intelligence (from the Joint Military Intelligence College (JMIC)).
(c) In–country training. In-country training is designed to immerse the Foreign Area Officer in a foreign cultural
and linguistic environment, provide advanced language studies, and develop in–depth knowledge of the region through
a program of travel, research and study. Foreign Area Officers are expected to conduct extensive familiarization travel
throughout the region and attain firsthand knowledge of the culture, geography, political–military environment, economy, and societal influences. In many cases, ICT includes Foreign Area Officer attendance at a foreign military or
civilian course of instruction. Officers who attend foreign military schools are recognized as performing an Army
mission as well as training for future assignments. Contacts developed during ICT at a foreign military school and/or
via other contact with host nation military professionals are frequently maintained for years and enhance effectiveness
in future assignments. The duration of ICT varies, but is generally no longer than 1 year. During ICT, a Foreign Area
Officer must continue to improve language capability with the goal of attaining general professional level (level 3)
proficiency. Most Eurasian Foreign Area Officers (48E) conduct ICT via an 18–month program at the George C.
Marshall Center for Security Studies in Garmisch, Germany. Foreign Area Officer internships in the 48E region are
key elements of the curriculum of the Marshall Center. During these internships, officers will have the opportunity to
work and travel throughout the former Soviet Union. Proponent is also working to establish more conventional ICT
opportunities within the 48E–specific region.
(d) Foreign Area Officer Orientation Course. The FAOOC is a 1–week introductory course normally conducted
semi–annually at the DLIFLC designed to provide the Foreign Area Officers in training with an overview of duties,
roles and responsibilities, and to focus the officer’s efforts during subsequent Foreign Area Officer developmental
phases. Proponent endeavors to afford officers conducting their language studies in the Washington, DC area the
opportunity to attend an abbreviated FAOOC. Since some Foreign Area Officers may not be able to attend the
FAOOC, it is not a mandatory training requirement.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

455

(e) MEL–4 Professional Military Education. When fully implemented MEL–4 PME for Foreign Area Officers will
consist of the 3 phase training program (language, ICT, and ACS) in addition to the ILE Common Core block of
instruction conducted at any of the approved ILE sites. Additionally, an officer may attend one of the approved Schools
of Other Nations (SON) programs as outlined in AR 350–1, however, current policy requires that all officers still must
attend ILE in addition to the SON.
(2) Captain. Foreign Area Officers do not serve in utilization tours as CPTs. Rather, this period of an officer’s
career is spent both in honing operational skills and starting/completing FAO training.
(3) Major.
(a) After selection to MAJ, officers in year group 1995 and later who were DA board–selected to begin FAO
training and who have successfully completed FAO training will be given career field designation in FA 48 at their
regularly scheduled CFD board. Most Foreign Area Officers will complete training during this period of their career
and then serve primarily in FA 48 assignments, with the occasional opportunity for assignment to an O1A or O2A
position, as appropriate. All officers must complete a resident MEL–4 program, with some Foreign Area Officers
having the opportunity to attend a foreign school under the SON Program (as outlined in AR 350–1) in addition to the
ILE core course. However, FAOs still must attend the ILE course in addition to attending a foreign school. MAJs who
have successfully completed all training, achieved at a minimum “limited working proficiency” in a target language,
and who have either completed or are serving in a Foreign Area Officer utilization tour are considered functional area
qualified. (As noted in paragraph 47–2b(3), failure to achieve and maintain general professional proficiency in an
appropriate target language may jeopardize an officer’s qualification as a FAO.) Typical positions for majors include
serving as Defense/Army/Assistant Army attaché, security assistance officer, political–military staff officer on a senior
level staff, liaison officer to foreign armed forces, arms control specialist, or as an instructor at a service school.
Foreign Area Officers compete only against other officers in the Operational Support career field for promotion to
LTC.
(b) Prior to OPMS revisions, some officers with a functional area designation of FA 48 who had completed some or
all FAO training elected to continue to serve in their basic branch and compete for battalion and brigade command.
Those officers served in branch qualifying positions within their basic branch upon completion of some or all phases of
Foreign Area Officer training and competed for promotion and command within the Operations career field. Additionally, with the advent of a revised OPMS many officers who began FAO training were involuntarily career field
designated back into their basic branches (or, on a very limited basis, into another functional area). Such OPCF officers
retained the potential to serve as operational FAOs sometime later in their careers, dependent on the needs of the Army
and the concurrence of the officer’s basic branch and FAO Assignments. However, with recent and projected changes
to OPMS, the number of "operational FAOs" will decrease markedly. Those officers with FAO training who were
designated back into their basic branch may request to be re-designated as FAOs. However, such cases will be by rare
exception only, as determined by the needs of FA 48.
(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) LTCs are generally assigned to more senior level positions where their knowledge and experience can be fully
utilized. To be best prepared for promotion to COL, an officer should have at least one or more overseas FAO tours in
his area of regional expertise as a MAJ or LTC, at least 2 FAO tours overall, and maintained at a minimum limited
working proficiency in a target language. (As noted in paragraph 47–2b(3), failure to achieve and maintain general
professional proficiency in an appropriate target language may jeopardize an officer’s qualification as a FAO.) Foreign
Area Officer LTCs can expect challenging assignments as Defense/Army/Assistant Army attaché, security assistance
officer, political- military staff officer, advisor, arms control specialist, liaison officer and service school instructor.
They may also be assigned to fill O1A/O2A positions, as appropriate. Foreign Area Officer LTCs are expected to seek
assignments in several of the FA 48 core competency areas (attaché/security assistance/political-military staff officer/
arms control specialist/liaison officer) throughout their careers.
(b) Officers who have been trained as Foreign Area Officers or who have the unique skills and experiences similar
to a Foreign Area Officer may request a CFD transfer into FA 48. However, such actions will be approved strictly in
accordance with the needs of FA 48.
(5) Colonel. As the Army’s most experienced Foreign Area Officers, COLs fill critical positions as Defense/Army
attaché, security assistance officer, political–military officer on COCOM, MACOM and Joint staffs and within the U.S.
Interagency, advisor, liaison officer, arms control specialist, and as instructors at institutions like the Army War
College and the National Defense University. All promotable FAO LTCs should apply for the USAWC Distance
Education Course if not selected for the resident SSC course. COLs are expected to maintain at a minimum limited
working proficiency in a target language.
b. Branch generalist/combat arms generalist assignments (O1A/O2A). Foreign Area Officers may serve in a branch
generalist (formerly branch immaterial) position or combat arms generalist position, depending upon the strength of the
Foreign Area Officer Corps available for assignment to valid Foreign Area Officer positions. These assignments
include a host of billets, such as liaison and security assistance positions, which although potentially coded 01A or
02A, conform well to the Foreign Area Officer development model, require skills that are identified with Foreign Area
Officers, and are therefore assigned to Foreign Area Officer Assignments to fill. Other generalist billets, to include
ROTC, USMA faculty and staff and Inspector General, are not identified with a specific branch or skill, but are
456

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

important to the Army and provide an opportunity to expand the understanding and appreciation of the unique set of
skills and experience that Foreign Area Officers can bring to any organization.
c. Joint assignments. Joint Foreign Area Officer positions are on the Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL). Officers
assigned to those billets may attend Joint Professional Military Education (JPME). They may be eligible for designation as a Joint Specialty Officer upon successful completion of the Joint tour and JPME Phases I and II.
47–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. The Army benefits most from Foreign Area Officers who have broad experience. Therefore, the Foreign Area
Officer résumé should include security assistance, attaché, political–military staff officer, liaison, and other assignments
that lead the officer to tours in Washington, DC, the appropriate COCOM, MACOM, UEy, and the region of interest.
The sequencing of the type and location of assignments is not critical. Foreign Area Officers should avoid homesteading, and alternate between overseas and CONUS tours as much as possible. Repetitive assignments to any one type of
work or in any one location typically reduce an officer’s utility as a Foreign Area Officer. All FAOs need to seek at
least 1 Army assignment (Army Staff, MACOM staff, UEy, Army Service Component Command (ASCC) staff
positions) after their first Joint assignment in order to maintain their Army credentials.
b. FAO assignments will primarily consider skills and experience and needs of the Army when assigning officers.
FAO Assignments will also consider timing, geographic rotation, job rotation, language, strength of performance file,
officer’s preference, and special considerations (exceptional family members, retirement, and so forth).
c. Foreign Area Officer assignments will be made with the goal of developing the officer’s professional competence
while meeting the Army’s officer personnel requirements. Requests from officers for assignments that do not contribute
to achieving that goal will be rejected.
47–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
Most assignments for Foreign Area Officers will be 24 to 36 months in length. OCONUS locations will continue to
require specific tour lengths. Officers desiring to become Foreign Area Officers must recognize that a large portion of
Foreign Area Officers positions are located OCONUS.
a. Key Foreign Area Officer functional area qualification positions. Completion of training as listed in paragraph
47–3, current language proficiency, and successful completion of, or assignment in a FA 48 tour for at least 12 months
are the prerequisites for functional area qualification at each grade.
b. Foreign Area Officer functional area life cycle. Figure 47–1 depicts a FA 48 life cycle. Additionally, it identifies
development assignments within the functional area.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

Figure 47–1. Functional area 48 life cycle development and utilization

458

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

47–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for Foreign Area Officers. To do this, the field grade
inventory must be optimized in order to fulfill functional area and generalist requirements and to provide field grade
officers sufficient time for functional area qualification prior to promotion to the next grade.
b. Officer Personnel Management System implementation. The number of Foreign Area Officer authorizations, by
grade, will vary as force structure decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more
information on current authorizations or inventory should contact either the FA 48 Proponent at DAMO–SSF, G–35 or
the FA 48 assignment officers at HRC OPMD.
47–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Foreign Area Officer
a. Structure. Foreign Area Officer positions exist at corps and echelons above corps level. Current plans envision a
robust FAO presence down to the UEy (and, as required, the Unit of Employment- higher tactical headquarters (UEx)
level. The majority of Foreign Area Officer billets are on COCOM, MACOM and Joint staffs, and within the Defense
Intelligence Agency.
b. Acquire. Officers in the grade of CPT are recruited by the FAO proponent using the functional area preference
tool via AKO and from information annotated on their ORBs. Considerations for accessing an officer into the Foreign
Area Officer functional area include; manner of performance, nature of civilian degree, undergraduate grade point
average, personal preference, language aptitude (DLAB) and, when applicable, demonstrated language capability, and
regional experience. Based on needs of the Army, personal preferences and pre-existing abilities or training (such as a
documented language skill), officers will be designated for training into an AOC by a DA board at approximately the
seven-year mark. The board selected officer will be automatically career field Designated into FA 48 during the
normally scheduled cohort YG CFD board.
c. Distribute. Foreign Area Officer Assignments, Functional Area Division (FAD) at HRC OPMD manages Foreign
Area Officer assignments. Distribution of FAO–coded billets throughout the Army, the Joint force, and the interagency
is the responsibility of FAO Proponent.
d. Deploy. Foreign Area Officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times to support combatant commanders and in support of other ad hoc requirements. All Foreign
Area Officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. Foreign Area Officers
may deploy with their units or as individuals as the mission demands. Foreign Area Officers must prepare themselves
and their families for this reality, made all the more acute given the ongoing war on terror.
e. Sustain. Officers designated into the Operational Support career field will compete within their career field for
promotion to LTC and COL.
f. Develop. Throughout the professional career of a FAO, officers will have the opportunity for training and further
professional development. This starts with a FAOs initial training, followed by continued development through
assignments and required courses and lastly by the officer’s self - development efforts.
(1) Initial raining. All FAOs will generally conduct the 3 phases of training as addressed above.
(2) Continued development. Officers may receive further education through training required for positions they may
fill. Some examples include language training, JPME II, and so forth, In addition, officers will be assigned to positions
that will further their professional development.
(3) Self-development. All FAOs will carry the burden of self–development as they serve in positions of increased
responsibility. This includes the fact that a FAO is expected to remain a resident expert not only regarding basic branch
specific subjects, but also regarding U.S. Army, Joint, interagency, and multinational topics of relevance.
g. Separate. Foreign Area Officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
47–8. Foreign Area Officer Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. Reserve Component Foreign Area Officer development objectives and qualifications
essentially parallel those of the Active Army. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation through assignments in
their basic branches before specializing in the functional area. For specific information about the process and
pre–requisites for designation as a Reserve Component Foreign Area Officer, refer to AR 135–11.
b. Functional area qualification and developmental opportunities. Even though Reserve Component officers are
limited by geographical considerations, they should strive for FA 48 assignments that yield the same developmental
opportunities as their Active Army counterparts.
c. Life cycle development model. The Reserve Component life cycle development model for Foreign Area Officers is
shown at figure 47–2. It depicts functional area qualification requirements and key developmental assignments.

Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology Functional Area 51
48–1. Unique features of Army Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology functional area
a. Unique purpose of Army Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology functional area 51 (ALT FA 51). The Army
Acquisition Corps (AAC) is a professional corps of acquisition officers and civilians who develop, integrate, acquire,
field and support systems and service solutions across the entire spectrum of military operations from Major Theater
Wars through counter terrorism to Homeland Security, enabling decisive victory for the 21st Century. The Army ALT
FA 51 capitalizes on the leadership and operational experience of Army officers (both Active Army, ARNG, and
USAR components). The Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) and DODD 5000.52, and DODI
5000.58 are the governing policies for conduct of the AAC. The Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the
Army for Acquisitions, Logistics, and Technology is also the Director of Acquisition Career Management (DACM)
providing executive guidance and approval on military proponency initiatives and civilian acquisition career management initiatives for the AAC. Military proponency responsibilities (development of concepts, doctrine, tactics, techniques, procedures, organization designs, materiel requirements, training programs, training support requirements, and
manpower requirements for the Army ALT FA 51 military members and civilian functional acquisition career
management support are executed by the Acquisition Support Center (ASC), Fort Belvoir, VA—the responsible
agency. The ASC Director also serves as the Deputy Director of Acquisition Career Management (DDACM). The
Acquisition Management Branch, Human Resources Command (AMB, HRC) provides management and oversight for
all military ALT FA 51 assignments, competitive boards and related functions.
b. Unique functions performed by Army Acquisition Corps functional area. The AAC Officers pursue a diverse array
of experiences, education, and training to prepare to lead and manage large, complex acquisition organizations,
supported by an expert, relevant, and ready work force. The AAC also partners with the warfighter during every stage
of the acquisition process, and integrates itself along side the warfighter during the military decisionmaking process
while providing full spectrum acquisition support across the entire spectrum of military operations at the strategic,
operational, and tactical level:
(1) The strategic level. At the strategic level, the AAC provides the "M" in DTLOMS–PF, that is, materiel and
service solutions for the Army. Our unique contribution to the Army is central to successful implementation of the
Army current and Future Force. In addition to the "M" mission, the AAC enters into all planning cycles as a core
capability synchronized for effect and provide ALT planners on the UEy staff for total synchronization of ALT in
Army and Joint war planning. The AAC projects forward a presence at every UEy as part of Army Materiel
Command’s Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology Support Brigades (ALTSB) and provides full spectrum acquisition
support in the form of systems liaisons armed with engineering and techno–industrial reach–back, contingency
contracting life support, and leading contractor’s on the battlefield. The AAC provides rapid fielding of real–time
strategic technological advantage for the combatant commanders. The AAC also provide strategic homeland security
acquisition support in the form of Joint considerations within the developmental processes; ultimately, ensuring
seamless communication and synchronization of military and civilian homeland security technological solutions.
(2) The operational level. At the operational level, the AAC provides integration agents for acquisition support
within the Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational teams. For land campaigning, the AAC provides
operational level acquisition support and superiority to the Joint Force Commanders (JFCs), enabling them to gain and
maintain operational initiative. Acquisition superiority enables JFCs to see first, understand first and act first at the
operational level. In multinational operations, the AAC core capability facilitates the integration of allies and partners
into coalition operations. Acquisition strategic and operational responsibilities include increased emphasis on interoperability with Joint, interagency and multinational elements across the entire range of military operations. At the
operational warfighting level, the AAC operates as part of the AMC–ALTSB and provides combat and operational
support to the maneuvering force to include systems support, rapid fielding technological solutions, and contracting and
contract stewardship facilitating the full doctrinal utilization of contractors on the battlefield.
(3) The tactical level. At the tactical level, the AAC provides life support to the warfighter; enables the warfighter to
execute seamless transitions and develop situations out of contact; maneuver to positions of advantage; engage the
enemy forces beyond the range of their weapons; and, destroy them with precision fires to include tactical assault at
times and places of their choosing. The AAC also provides the operating and Institutional Army with programmatic
and contracting support on a daily basis, CONUS and OCONUS.
c. Unique features of work in ALT FA 51. The ALT FA 51 officers are diversified, well–rounded acquisition leaders
who have the opportunity to develop their acquisition leadership skills in 4 areas of concentration. Beginning with year
group 1999, each new AAC officer can expect to have ample opportunities to serve in diversified assignments and each
will be required to pursue at least 18–24 months of experience in Contracting and Program Management. Officers will
be required to become level 2 certified in at least 2 areas of concentration within their first 6 years in the AAC in order
to compete for 05 command and encouraged to pursue certification in the other areas of concentration. Currently the

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

461

AAC maintains 5 areas of concentration: 51A—Program Management; 51C—Contracting and Production Management;
51S—Research, Development, and Engineering; 51R—Information Technology and Program Management; and 51T—
Test and Evaluation. These 5 areas will be reworked and compressed into 4 areas of concentration. Those will be—
(1) Area of concentration 51A will include current assignments within the 51R and 51T areas, to include positions
in life cycle management commands (LCMCs) and a variety of acquisition operational assignments.
(2) Area of concentration 51C will include current contracting positions and systems procurement positions within
LCMCs, PEOs, and AMC and a variety of acquisition operational assignments in ALT planning and contingency
contracting organizations.
(3) Area of concentration 51S will include a variety of acquisition operational assignments and positions focused on
science and/or engineering within AMC, to include LCMCs.
(4) Area of concentration 51L, which is life cycle logistics, will include a variety of acquisition operational life
cycle logistics related assignments, and life cycle logistics positions in PEOs, LCMC, AMC, and DLA. Officers in year
group 1999 and beyond who wish to command a program management or acquisition command position at the 05 and
06 level are encouraged to pursue level III in either A or C and level 2 in the other (A or C). For example, one such
officer would be level III in "A" and level II in "C" and could compete for all PM commands and acquisition
commands, as can an officer who is level III in "C" and level II in "P". For purposes of this edition of DA Pam 600–3,
only the 4 areas of concentration described below will be addressed—
(a) Program management (51A). This area encompasses the full spectrum of challenging assignments that include
program management, information technology, and test and evaluation. Area of concentration 51A is one of 4 areas
within the AAC that is designed to prepare officers to become successful acquisition leaders. Positions within 51A
involves the following acquisition leadership opportunities and duties: Within specific program management assignments, officers will focus on reviewing requirements and development of system solutions; life cycle cost analysis,
force structure implications, battlefield systems integration; and associated doctrine, training, logistics, organizational
and materiel implications of materiel requirements; partnering with the warfighter during the entire acquisition process
and during actual implementation of materiel solutions. Assignments include— ALT plans officer on the UEy staff;
ALTSB systems coordinator; program office positions in LCMCs, PEOs, AMC, and DLA. Some of the positions offer
opportunities to gain logistics experience that may count toward "L" credentials that are required for top leadership
positions in LCMCs. Assignments with an information and technology focus will center on the research, engineering
and systems integration of information technology; participation in mission analysis and concept development; evaluation of competing technological approached to battlefield systems integration; and post-deployment software support.
Officers provide leadership and management of software engineering solutions, simulations and modeling, information
network projects, computer systems, technical and systems architectures, and systems integration projects. Officers are
expected to maintain awareness of advances in emerging information technologies, evaluate and assess competing
technological approaches that may affect Army systems and capabilities, and manage the drivers for cost, schedule, and
performance of such projects. As a test and evaluation officer, 51A’s will lead test teams, as well as design, document
and execute experiments and tests under conditions ranging from highly controlled scientific experiments to realistic
free-play exercises in an operational environment. Officers will coordinate with the warfighter and program offices,
schedule all resources for the test, design automated data processing support plans and instrumentation, and conduct or
control the test to achieve the objectives. They produce the test report, evaluate test data and assess the performance,
utility, military suitability and effectiveness of systems under test. Officers can expect to perform all of these duties
CONUS and OCONUS, at installations, systems commands, program offices, and during deployments while providing
acquisition support across the entire spectrum of military operations. Typical assignments within the 51A area include,
but is not limited to the following:
1. Assistant TRADOC Systems Manager (ATSM).
2. Assistant Project/Product Manager (APM).
3. ALT Plans Officer.
4. ALTSB Systems Plans/Operations Officer.
5. Software Systems Staff Officer.
6. Acquisition Staff/Project Officer.
7. Instructor in science or engineering.
8. Proponency Officer.
9. Product/Project Manager.
10. Program Manager/Commander.
11. Test & Evaluation Director.
12. Test & Evaluation Pilot.
(b) Contracting and Production Management (51C). Assignments within the Contracting and Production Management area of concentration involves the following acquisition leadership duties and opportunities. Assignments with a
contracting focus may include— life–support contingency contracting support to the warfighter; ALT planner at the
strategic or operational level on the UEy or ALTSB staff; systems and service contracting in major buying commands,
PEOs, and LCMCs. Some assignments offer the opportunity to accrue "L" time to develop "L" credentials required for

462

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

top leadership positions in LCMCs. Assignments with a production management may offer the opportunity to accrue
"A" time and the focus may include— full spectrum contract surveillance CONUS and OCONUS; front–line
programatics as in–plant assistant product and/or project manager; and executive plant manager liaison to contractor
Lead System Integrators. Duties may include working these specific developmental duties or leading teams that execute
them— acquisition strategic planning; advising warfighters, program managers, and industry; determining best agreement or contract type; performing risk analysis; forming contractual instruments; negotiating terms and conditions;
obligating funds; awarding contracts; leading contractual action post award; monitoring performance and production;
and program management front–line support in plant. Officers can expect to perform these duties, CONUS and
OCONUS, at installations, system commands, contract commands; at Defense Contract Management Agency regional
offices, plants and headquarters; and during deployments while providing full spectrum acquisition support across the
entire spectrum of military operations. Typical assignments include—
1. Contracting staff officer.
2. Contracting officer or Other Transaction Authority (OTA) Agreements officer Team Chief.
3. Contingency contracting Team Chief.
4. Branch Chief for Contracting.
5. Assistant project/product manager (APM) for systems contracting and program integration (A and/or C time).
6. Assistant TRADOC Systems Manager (ATSM).
7. Division Chief for Contracting.
8. Production and industrial manager.
9. Instructor.
10. Proponency Officer.
11. ALTSB Contingency Contracting Battalion Commander.
12. ALT Theater Plans Officer.
13. DCMA Plant Commander).
14. Contract Command Commander.
15. DCMA Regional DCMA Commander.
(c) Research, Development, and Engineering (51S). Assignments in this area of concentration involves the following
acquisition leadership duties and opportunities: Serving as Combatant Commander’s Science Advisors; performing
systems planning, research and development; and managing research activities within acquisition programs, projects or
activities; expediting materiel and technological responses from Army and Joint laboratories to no–notice, operational
situations; manage the conduct of basic research to develop new technologies, and applied research focused on using
existing technologies to solve operational problems; supervising formulation, justification and execution of the research
and development portion of the budget; coordinating the efforts of combined military and commercial research and
development programs; and working with industry on matters of policy and project planning. Assignments may also
include position in the UEy staff as Science Advisors and ALTSB plans/operations officer, and some positions may
offer the opportunity to accrue "L" time to develop credentials that are required for top leadership positions in LCMCs.
Officers who work in this area of concentration are expected to maintain awareness of advances in emerging
technologies from Army and Joint labs, academia, and the worldwide industrial base; evaluate such technologies for
applicability to solving warfighting problems; and inform combatant commanders of technological issues in operational
terms. Officers must be capable translating the operational requirements of warfighters into the technical language of
the scientists and engineers working in the labs, and vice–versa. The 51S area of concentration was constituted to
generate members of the Uniformed Army Scientist and Engineer (UAS&E) Program, who are 51Ss with an advanced
degree in science or engineering and the operational experience necessary to understand the unique environment,
operational characteristic, and technological needs of the Army. While membership in the UAS&E program requires a
masters or Ph.D. in a hard science or engineering discipline, it is the UAS&E officer’s operational experience and
quick deployability to combat zones that gives him/her different skills and duties from the civilians who make up
approximately 95 percent of the acquisition science and engineering work force. Some 51S officers may get the
opportunity to attend the academic portion of a Ph.D. program in a fully funded advanced civil schooling program,
with follow–on assignment to a laboratory with Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) to
finish the dissertation portion and earn their Ph.D., which results in UAS&E membership, followed by an assignment
to a deployable position utilizing the advanced degree to find technological solutions to warfighting problems in nearreal-time. The discipline of Systems Engineering is particularly useful to the UAS&E program as it provides skills
applicable to the widest possible array of technologies. Examples of duty positions include—
1. Research engineer or scientist; research, development, and engineering coordinator, branch chief, or division
chief.
2. Assistant product/project manager (APM) for Advanced Technology Demonstration programs or other RD&E
program.
3. ALT Plans Officer.
4. Science Advisors on UEyG4 Staff.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

5. Instructor in science or engineering.
6. Proponency Officer.
7. Experimental Test Pilot.
8. Director/deputy director of Research, Development, Engineering Centers.
9. Product/project manager for Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ACTDs) or other RD&E Programs.
(d) Acquisition Life Cycle Logistics (51L). This is a new area of concentration for AAC military members. A 51L
area of concentration is being added to the variety of acquisition experiences to put the "L" back into Acquisition. The
51L area of concentration is designed primarily as a means to prepare FA 51 ALT acquisition officers to compete for
key leadership positions and/or critical acquisition positions in the new life cycle management commands. An
acquisition "L" Additional Skill Identifier (ASI) is also being developed to address the acquisition developmental
requirements of FA 90 and single–track CSS officers who wish to compete for top leadership positions in the LCMCs.
In accordance with the Defense Workforce Improvement Act, an officer or civilian cannot fill a critical acquisition
position unless certified level 2 (new draft language raises that to level 3) in an acquisition area of concentration. For
any area of concentration, there are 3 levels of certification; each level of certification has 3 types of requirements—
education, training, and experience. Experience has historically been the primary limiting factor for late entry (those
who surpassed CPT or MAJ) into the AAC. The 51L work experience in logistics and acquisition will be carefully
examined for duties that can be granted certifiable acquisition "L" experience, and the officer will be afforded the
necessary education and training to certify them at the appropriate level. The population of officers with 51L
credentials will grow over time to where "L" is seated at the core of the ALT areas of concentration as is "A" and "C".
Leadership duties and opportunities in the 51L AOC may include—
1. Assistant Program Manager for Logistics.
2. Acquisition Staff Officer in an LCMC.
3. SBCT Team Chief ALTSB Systems Plans/Operations Officer.
(e) Logistics division chief within a Product/Program Management Office positions for the FA 90 and single track
CSS officers pursuing the ASI in “L” may include—.
1. Depot commander.
2. Arsenal commander.
3. Ammunitions commander.
4. ALTSB sustainment plans/operations officer.
5. UEy plans/operations officer on UEy staff.
(f) ALTSB S3/S4.
(g) Life cycle logistics staff officer ALT FA 51, FA 90, and single track CSS officers (pursuing the ASI) may
expect to perform these duties and assignments in LCMCs, PEOS, AMC, and DLA..
(5) After several developmental, multidisciplinary acquisition assignments, AAC ALT officers possess a thorough
understanding of how the life cycle management systems’ management model interrelates with the concept based
requirements system and the planning, programming, budgeting, contracting and execution systems. They will have
deployed and provided acquisition support directly to the warfighter in context of military operations. The height of an
officer’s career in the AAC is the assumption of command of any one of the large, complex, dynamic acquisition
organizations responsible for the "M" in DTLOMS–PF, which provides direct support to the warfighter. Officers in the
AAC lead a work force consisting of military, government service (GS) employees, and industry personnel from
multiple acquisition career fields, disciplines, and organizations. Assignments at the COL and General Officer (GO)
include—
(a) Director of contracting.
(b) Director of ASA (ALT) or OSD acquisition related staff.
(c) Program Manager.
(d) Contracting Command Commander for Systems Contracting.
(e) Contingency Contracting Commander/PARC.
(f) DCMA Regional Commander.
(g) RD&E Commander.
(h) Test Command Commander.
(i) Program Executive Officer (PEO).
(j) Defense Contract Management Activity Commander.
(k) Life Cycle Management Command (LCMC) Commander.
(l) Joint Acquisition Primary Staff Coordinator for the Joint Forces Commander (JFC).
d. Army Acquisition Corps officer certifications. The ALT FA 51 provides the leadership, operational expertise and
management ability necessary to provide the best systems and services to the warfighter to win the Nations battles. The
AAC (ALT FA 51) specialty concentrates on developing AAC officers to fill critical acquisition positions. Occupying
these positions requires training, education and experience as stated in the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act and DOD 5000.52–M, Acquisition Career Development Program. Only ALT FA 51 officers and civilians
464

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

certified as meeting the DAWIA and DOD 5000.52–M requirements may obtain assignment to these critical positions
(this chapter outlines the leader development model for officers). Army regulation 690–950, chapter 5 shows AAC
career development for each civilian career path. The ALT FA 51 officer must be fully qualified at all grades to lead a
team of government (military and civilian) and industry personnel to accomplish program objectives within the
designated time, cost and performance constraints, as well as provide systems and service solutions across the entire
range of military operations.
(1) Certification requirements for the AAC officer.
(a) Currently, an ALT FA 51 officer may be certified in any and all of these 4 areas of concentration— Program
management (51A), Contracting and Production Management (51C); Life Cycle Logistics (51L); and Systems Planning, Research, Development and Engineering (51S). In the future, officers will be certified in Program Management,
Contracting, Life Cycle Logistics and RD&E. Three certification levels are used for the purpose of characterizing an
acquisition officer’s qualifications within the ALT FA 51, Acquisitions (Level 1, 2, and 3).
(b) The DOD has established experience, education, and training requirements for each AOC. In general, the ALT
FA 51 officer must attend the Army Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ALT) Qualification Course (formally the
Army Acquisition Basic Course) and work 12 months in each AOC to achieve Level 1; 24 months for Level 2; and 48
months for Level 3. The appendices to DOD 5000.52–M prescribe the specific requirements for each AOC (referred to
as career field).
(c) Up to a maximum of 2 to 4 years experience credit is given for acquisition experience prior to accession into the
AAC depending on duties and area of concentration (see table 48–2). Service in wholesale logistics positions and field
positions that deal with the wholesale level (such as maintenance control officer and logistics staff officer) can usually
be credited against the experience requirement. The Acquisition Management Branch (AMB), U.S. Army Human
Resources Command (HRC), will make final determination. Also, not more than 12 months spent pursuing a program
of academic education or training may be counted toward fulfillment of the acquisition experience requirement.
(d) Each acquisition position (Active Army, USAR, and ARNG) on the Military Acquisition Position List (MAPL)
has a career field and career level requirement associated with it. Officers should meet position requirements prior to
assignment; however, when this is not possible, CPTs and MAJs have 18 months in which to meet position
requirements, and LTCs and above have 6 months in which to meet position requirements. In general, CPT positions
are level 1; MAJ positions are level 2; and LTC and above positions are level 3.
(2) Critical Acquisition Position qualifications, per DAWIA, Title 10.
(a) The purpose of AAC career field level–3 certification and qualification requirement is to identify those officers
who have achieved the requisite level of education, training and experience to serve in acquisition critical positions.
Certification supports implementation of the requirements contained in 10 USC and DOD 5000.52–M. As stipulated in
DAWIA, only an AAC members may fill a critical acquisition position (CAP). An ALT FA 51 officer achieves Corps
"Membership" status after 4 years experience and level–2 certification. Select O5 and O6 AAC positions are considered critical acquisition positions.
(b) The DAWIA Title 10 breaks out specific parameters that must be met to accept a program management CAP.
DAWIA stipulates that prior to obtaining assignment to duty as a program or deputy program manager of a major
defense acquisition program, an officer must—
1. Have successfully achieved level–3 certification and completed both PMT 401 and 402, the Program Managers
and Executive Program Managers courses, respectively.
2. Execute a written agreement to remain on active duty in that position at least until completion of the first major
milestone that occurs closest in time to the date on which the person has served in the position for 4 years.
3. Have at least 8 years of experience in acquisition, at least 2 of which were performed in a systems program office
or similar organization.
(c) The DAWIA stipulates that prior to obtaining assignment to duty as a program manager or deputy program
manager of a significant non–major, ACAT 2, defense acquisition program, an officer must—
1. Have successfully achieved level–3 certification and completed PMT 401 and 402.
2. Have at least 6 years of experience in acquisition.
(d) All eligible AAC promotable MAJs and LTCs are considered for the LTC level of product or project manager,
life cycle logistics command positions, and acquisition command positions. All eligible promotable LTCs and COLs
are considered for the COL level product or project manager and acquisition command positions. The following is a
list of product or project manager and acquisition commander qualification standards:
e. Accessions and applications requirements. The AAC has a unique accession process in place to build a corps of
the finest officers with the necessary profile to lead and execute the mission of the AAC. ALT FA 51 officers are
primarily assessed between their 4th and 10th year of Active Federal Commissioned Service and may be assessed on a
limited basis as late as their 12th year of AFCS. Officers with science or engineering Ph.D. may branch transfer to
ALT FA 51S and become UAS&E members later than 12 years of AFCS on a case-by-case basis to fulfill needs of the
Army for RD&E leadership expertise, and Logistics Officers with a Life cycle Logistics ASI may become Acquisition
Corp members later on a case-by-case basis to fulfill the needs of the Army for LCMC commands.
(1) The AAC program is requirements driven. Officers are selected based on both validated and projected total

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

465

Army requirements by year group, grade, and branch within ALT FA 51. Officers who meet the following criteria may
apply:
(a) In the grade of CPT or MAJ (LTC and COL and GO for purposes of building the 51L and 51S experience
inventory over the next 3 years).
(b) All basic branch requirements completed
(c) Graduated from the branch Officer Advanced Course and completed the appropriate CCC (MEL N).
(d) All CPT and MAJ grades, able to meet area of concentration certification criteria (DOD 5000.52–M) for initial
entry position within 18 months after accession and assignment.
(e) Have at least 8 years active federal commissioned service (AFCS) remaining (except for the ALT FA 51S and
selected Logistics Officers on a case-by-case basis.).
(f) Possess MEL appropriate to grade.
(g) Have demonstrated outstanding performance and potential.
(2) Basic branch officers should apply for accession into the AAC within their 4th and 10th year of service
(ensuring that all basic branch requirements will be met before potential assessment into the AAC). Applications
should be submitted through the Acquisition Management Branch (AMB), at Human Resource Command (HRC).
Board schedule information can be found on the AMB HRC web page. The acquisition accession board reviews the
applications. Officers receive notification by letter regarding their selection status. Non-selection does not preclude
reapplying in the future. Interested USAR and ARNG officers, in the grades of CPT through COL, may be qualified to
receive the ALT FA. Individuals must have previous experience or currently hold civilian employment in this field.
This includes those who hold program management, software development and systems engineering positions at their
companies. Qualified guardsman and reservists receive specialized training and unique assignments to help them
develop their skills as acquisition professionals. The USAR and ARNG are currently being integrated within the HRC
personnel systems. Future updates to DA Pam 600–3 will reflect this integration. Current processes remain in place for
FA designation of both USAR and ARNG.
(3) Upon acceptance, an ALT officer’s career is dedicated to diverse developmental acquisition assignments and
common education experiences, to include: Initially, all officers will attend the Army ALT FA 51 Qualification Course
(formerly the Army Acquisition Basic Course (AABC)). The ALT FA 51 Qualification Course is a multidisciplinary,
basic and intermediate level qualification course specifically designed to transition newly accessed acquisition officers
by providing levels 1 and 2 certification training in a variety of areas of concentration. The AAC interns and AAC GS
7–9 new hires may attend the basic portion of the ALT FA 51Q Course. All ALT FA 51Q course graduates receive the
level–2 certification training requirements for Program Management (51A), level–1 certification training for contracting
(51C), to include the contingency contracting requirement, life cycle Logistics (51L) and Systems Planning, Research
Development, and Engineering - Systems Engineering (51S). ALT FA 51 Q Course Students will then take 1 of 2
concentration courses providing all the Level 2 training requirements in either Logistics (51L) and SPRDE–SE (51S) or
Contracting (51C), depending on their next assignment. Depending on the concentration, every graduate will receive
the training required to be level 2 certified in 2 or 3 AOCs and Level 1 in the remaining AOC or AOCs. ? When
officers enter the Acquisition Corps he/she obtains acquisition experience in several AOCs to achieve a multidisciplined breadth of acquisition leadership experience in preparation for command of the Army’s large, complex
acquisition organizations, programs and executive agencies. To facilitate "diversity" of experience, AAC offers regional
assignments that manage developmental assignments below the HRC central management level. These regional
assignments allow officers the opportunity to rotate to 3 or more regionally managed assignments within one tour of
duty. In addition to achieving this diversified developmental experience, the officer works toward level 3 certification
in 2 or more AOCs. Some officers may also be offered the opportunity to attend advanced civil schooling at their
initial accession point. Other officers whose manner of performance warrant advanced civil schooling will be afforded
that opportunity after their initial acquisition assignment.
(4) Promotable MAJs and above applying for entry into the AAC are expected to meet general entry criteria as well
as possess appropriate AAC military education and previous acquisition assignment experience. This will enable them
to qualify for assignment to critical acquisition positions under the certification criteria of paragraph 48–1e within 6
months after accession and assignment, and meet DAWIA certifications within 18–24 months. Officers accessed late
into the AAC may find fewer opportunities are available to them due to the limits on their developmental timelines.
These officers may not develop into the best candidate for selection to critical acquisition positions, many of which
require a varied and multidisciplinary background.
(5) An AAC officer’s career development consists of the following 3 phases: basic branch requirements, developmental assignments, and senior leadership positions. Successful progress through all phases provides the Army with
technically competent, well-rounded, and experienced leaders to serve at the highest levels of the material acquisition
management profession.
48–2. Officer characteristics required
a. Competencies and actions common to all. Army officers must be premier warfighters who can effectively apply
the 4 core dimensions of leadership— values, attributes, skills, and actions (see FM 22–100 for leadership dimensions).

466

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

These core leadership dimensions provide the basis for what a leader must be, know, and do. The values and attributes
set the basis for the character of the leader— what a leader must be. The skills developed by leaders establish his or
her competence— what a leader must know. The actions that leaders conduct and execute constitute leadership— what
a leader must do. The leadership framework describes a leader of character and competence who acts to achieve
excellence across the spectrum of operations from total war, to operations other than war, to disaster relief and in times
of peace.
(1) Values. Values are at the core of everything the Army is and does. The Army is an institution of people with
unique and enduring values. These values must be a part of the men and women— officers, enlisted personnel, and
civilians— who are the Army. These values provide the sense of purpose necessary to sustain our soldiers in combat
and help resolve ambiguities in operations other than war. Officers must establish and maintain an environment in the
Army where soldiers and civilians do what is right; where we treat each other as they should be treated; and, where
everyone can be all they can be.
(2) Leader attributes. Attributes are fundamental qualities and characteristics. Attributes assist in defining what an
officer should be and contribute to leader actions. Army leader attributes are described in 3 categories— mental,
physical, and emotional.
(a) Mental attributes describe aptitudes and capacities for learning that leaders should possess and develop. Included
in this category are will, self–discipline, initiative, judgment, confidence, intelligence and cultural awareness.
(b) Physical attributes specify physical dispositions or aptitudes that can be nurtured and developed. Included in this
category are health fitness, physical fitness, stamina, military bearing, and professional bearing.
(c) Emotional attributes are those affective aptitudes or capacities that contribute to how one feels and substantially
contribute to leadership. Included in this category are self–control, balance, and stability.
(3) Leader skills. Skills are synonymous with competencies. They are abilities or competencies that one develops
and uses with people, with ideas, and with things. Competence is of primary importance for all Army officers. The
Army recognizes that officers must develop 4 types of skills.
(a) Interpersonal skills reflect competence in communicating with people.
(b) Conceptual skills refer to competence in handling ideas.
(c) Technical skills reflect competence with things.
(d) Tactical skills refer to the ability to put together technical, interpersonal, and conceptual skills and apply them to
warfighting tasks.
(4) Leader actions. Officers provide purpose, direction, and motivation as they influence their subordinates, operate
to accomplish their mission, and strive to improve their unit or organization. Leader actions are how Army officers act
to achieve excellence and get the job done. These actions are applicable across all levels of leadership.
(a) Influencing refers to the use of appropriate people skills to guide subordinates or teams toward mission
accomplishment. Influencing subdivides into communicating, decisionmaking, and motivating.
(b) Operating or accomplishing the mission refers to the relative short–term actions of getting the job done.
Operating divides into planning, executing, and assessing.
(c) Improving refers to the long–term investment–type actions essential to improving everything the leader influences. Improving subdivides into developing (people), building (teams), and learning.
b. Unique skills. Functional area 51 officers must possess highly developed leadership and enabling skills inherent to
the mission of the AAC. These skills are obtained through a combination of military and civilian schooling and
experience, which lead to full development as an AAC officer. Further grade specific information is contained within
the professional development section of this chapter (see para 48–7). The AAC unique skills include leadership and
assimilation and/or analytical skills—
(1) Leadership skills. Officers transition to the AAC with a well-developed leadership toolbox. The AAC seeks to
add to that toolbox. Some acquisition specific leadership training includes topics, such as, ethics and acquisitions,
leading negotiations, alternate dispute resolution, leading general service civilians, change leadership, acquisition
strategy, leading and integrated product and/or project team, risk management, best-value trade-offs, congressional
considerations, and commercial best business practices.
(2) Assimilation and/or analytical skills. Given the rapid advances in technology and the ever–changing nature of
the threat to our National defense, AAC officers must be warfighters, steeped in the Warrior Ethos, operating with the
traditional officer attributes of duty, honor, integrity, discretion and professional ethic, and a consciousness of national
policy and the state of technology affecting our forces. Army Acquisition Corps officers must be able to partner with
the warfighter and analyze and distill successful outcomes for operational requirements and real-time combat acquisition support solutions.
c. Unique knowledge. The ALT FA 51 officers must thoroughly understand the relationship of doctrine, training,
leadership, organizations, materiel and soldiers when viewing any issue. They must understand Army doctrine, develop
strong partnerships with their supported warfighters, and understand the technology with which they work. ALT FA 51
officers will progress through a series of developmental assignments in all supporting functions and phases of
acquisition in preparation to lead the Army’s most complex, multifunctional acquisition organizations, as well as
provide acquisition support across the full range of military operations. The ALT FA 51 officer must stay abreast of

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

467

emerging technical innovations and best practices within sister Services, industry and among governmental and
nongovernmental organizations worldwide.
48–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. The military component of the AAC consists of a single FA (ALT FA 51, Acquisition) that grows well-rounded,
flexible officers through assignments within 4 developmental AOCs: 51A, Program Management; 51C, Contracting and
Productions Management; 51L, Life Cycle Logistics; and 51S, Systems Planning, Research, Development and Engineering (descriptions of the 4 developmental ALT FA 51 areas of concentration are provided in paragraph 48–1.
b. An officer accessed into the AAC at usually between the 4th and 10th year of service is designated as an
Acquisition work force member working in the 4 developmental areas of concentration. The officer can apply for
Corps Membership when the officer is level 2 certified in at least one area of concentration, is in the grade of MAJ or
higher, and has at least 24 business-hour from an accredited institution. DAWIA connects certification and level of
experience to bonafide Corps Membership. Corps membership is a requirement for placement in a critical acquisition
position.
c. The 20–30 year leader development career path for AAC officers is divided into 3 phases— basic branch
requirements, developmental assignments, and senior leadership positions.
(1) The basic branch phase normally consists of the first 6 years of AFCS. During this phase, officers develop basic
branch skills, meet company grade requirements, attend both phases of the Captain’s Career Course, and develop a firm
base of warfighting knowledge. It is important for officers to have experience with soldiers and systems, and with
equipment they will eventually develop and acquire for the Army. This phase precedes development of AAC skills and
is fundamental to the success of Acquisition officers.
(2) The AAC developmental phase runs from approximately the 7th year through the 16th year of AFCS or from
CPT through MAJ. The AAC program goals in the developmental phase are to provide the necessary educational,
training, and experiential assignments to grow diversified, well-rounded ALT leaders. Officers receive acquisition basic
training and education in the Army Acquisition Basic Course (AABC) at the U.S. Army Logistics Management College
(ALMC) Huntsville, AL campus. The officer pursues a master’s degree if one has not been completed. Beginning in
FY 2006 for year group 1994 and subsequent officers, the ALT FA 51 officer attends the Army core ILE course
between the 8th and 12th year of AFCS at one of 4 locations: Fort Belvoir, Fort Lee, Fort Gordon, or the Naval
Postgraduate School. According to the G–3 ILE implementation message, the officer is credentialed as Joint Professional Military Education level 1 (JPME 1) after graduation from the core ILE; the message is not clear whether the
core ILE in addition to the branch specific qualification course is required to credential the officer as MEL 4.
Following graduation from the core ILE, the officer will attend the Army Acquisition Leadership Qualification Course
(ALT FA 51 Leadership Q Course) (currently under development). The Army’s core ILE and the ALT FA 51
Leadership Q Course will replace Command and General Staff College (CGSC) at Fort Leavenworth, KS for AAC
officers. Army Reserve and National Guard officers will enroll in resident ILE or utilize distributive learning
courseware or distance learning courses, as they are made available. The course will be evaluated for graduate credit
and degree completion opportunities. The Acquisition Corp will consider the officer credentialed as MEL–4 education
upon completion of the core ILE and the ALT FA 51 Leadership Q Course. Until implementation of the ALT FA 51 Q
Course (formerly AABC), officers are to individually obtain level–2, level–3 certifications, and pursue advanced civil
schooling throughout their developmental years with a goal of meeting all certification and qualification requirements
to successfully perform their leadership and management tasks and to prepare for command at the LTC grade.
(3) The critical acquisition position incumbency phase runs from approximately the 17th year of Active Federal
Commissioned Service or from promotion to LTC through the remainder of the officer’s career. It specifically begins
when an officer has completed at least 1 regional diversified assignment, has completed ILE phase 1 and 2, is Corps
certified, becomes career level–3 qualified in one or more AOC, level–2 qualified in the other AOCs, has completed at
least one 2–year acquisition operational assignment, and is promotable to LTC. During this phase, AAC officers
receive varied and demanding assignments requiring broad AAC skills. The DAWIA mandates that officers filling
critical AAC positions shall be assigned to positions for not less than 3 years unless the Director of Acquisition Career
Management waives the assignment period.
(4) Once officers meet the level–3 Corps certification, experience, and education requirements in 1 or more areas of
concentration, they are certified to hold a CAPs and may compete for top leadership positions (equivalent to Battalion
Command), to include: Plant Commander, Contingency Contracting Battalion Commander, Systems or Buying Contracting Commander, Test Commander, Product Manager, and Project Manager. Clearly, the best candidates for these
competitive positions will be officers with a diverse background of experience in acquisition. Upon selection for
acquisition command, product or project command officers complete Pre-command educational requirements and serve
a minimum of 3 years. All officers continue to serve in critical acquisition positions; those selected for Senior Service
College attend in residence or complete the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course. Officers then compete
for command at the O–6 level, serve for a minimum of 3 years within those commands, and then continue on to serve
in CAP positions as the senior consultants within the Army on Acquisition on major staffs.
d. Professional development objectives for AAC officers.

e. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. ALT FA 51 active, reserve and National Guard officers are

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

469

assigned only to positions on an approved Military Acquisition Position List (MAPL). Therefore, they do not receive
assignments to branch/functional area generalist positions after accession into the Corps.
f. Joint assignments. Army Acquisition Corps officers can expect to be considered for Joint duty assignments since
over twenty percent of AAC billets are Joint duty authorizations. However, ALT FA 51 officers are exempt under the
Secretary of Defense Scientific and Technical waiver category from the Joint duty requirement in Title IV of the DOD
Reorganization Act of 1986 for eligibility for promotion to BG. (This policy may be considered for change once the
AAC is aligned with mainstream Army and Joint warfighting staff structures, per the AAC transformation initiatives).
48–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. ALT FA 51 has a diverse array of opportunities. The ALT FA 51 specialty concentrates on
developing AAC officers to fill critical Acquisition positions, which require diverse, well-rounded incumbents. Occupying these positions requires training, education and experience as stated in the Defense Acquisition Workforce
Improvement Act and, DOD 5000.52–M. Only AAC officers and civilian leaders certified as meeting the DAWIA and
DOD 5000.52-M requirements may be assigned to these critical positions. Requests from officers for assignments that
do not contribute to achieving that goal will likely be rejected. Officers with a diversified developmental history are
more flexible and are more capable, by skill set and statute, to fill a wider range of critical acquisition positions.
Therefore, officers should strive to achieve a variety of experiences within each assignment, consistent with certification requirements, experience requirements, and pursuit of multidisciplinary development (to facilitate "diversity" of
experience, AAC offers regional assignments that manage developmental assignments below the HRC central management level and within oversight of HRC. These regional assignments allow officers the opportunity to rotate to 3 or
more regionally managed assignments within one tour of duty). Officers should ensure that their experiences are
properly recorded on their Officer Record Brief (ORB). A close dialogue with their HRC assignment officer is
encouraged.
b. Precedence. Due to the constraints of statute and policy, and the close correlation between critical Acquisition
positions and ALT FA 51 officer inventory, the assignment sequencing required for multiple AOC certifications and
AAC level–3 certification at the O–5 level require careful planning and attention to an officer’s qualifications and
expertise. Accordingly, the assignment sequencing in ALT FA 51 is more fluid than a basic branch. Use of the AAC
life cycle model (see fig 48–1) and close communication with the officer’s regional (if applicable during a regional
assignment) and their Acquisition Management Branch assignments officer at U.S. Army Human Resources Command
will assist the officer in career and assignment planning. Officers will be aligned to critical acquisition positions in
which they have achieved the prerequisite certifications and qualifications. Some ALT FA 51 billets are designated as
requiring advanced education, either military or civilian. Officers assigned to those positions must possess the requisite
skills or education.
48–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Regionalization of Army Acquisition Corps assignments. Regionalization applies to CPTs and MAJs and non–CSL LTCs and COLs. This concept provides the senior regional acquisition official within each identified region the
opportunity to standardize professional development and increase the diversification of the officers within that region
by allowing the officer the ability and time to grow into positions of increased responsibility and positively support the
Global War on Terrorism, America’s Homeland Security, and the Army’s Campaign Plan. Most assignments for Active
Army, USAR, and ARNG Acquisition Corps officers will be between 24–48 months in length. Outside continental
United States locations will continue to require specific tour lengths. Although many acquisition officers will find
themselves assigned to regional assignments, many acquisition experiences may result from non–regional tours. These
tours are typically 12–24 months. It is important to ensure that the OER and the ORB are properly annotated with all
education, certification, and assignment information.
b. Army Acquisition Corps life cycle model. Figure 48–1 displays an FA 51 life cycle with standard education
experiences and number and type of developmental and critical acquisition positions.

48–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to provide relevant and ready acquisition leaders with the required certifications, education, and
experience to manage our most critical defense acquisition programs and to lead full spectrum acquisition support
across the entire spectrum of military operations. Concurrently, we must maintain a healthy, viable career path for ALT
FA 51 officers in order to fulfill critical AAC positions. To do this, developmental assignments must produce certified,
well-rounded ALT FA 51 officers capable of operating independently on intent in the AAC environment; capable of
leading multifunctional teams that include acquisition functional experts, war-fighters, and industry partners; and
capable of conducting the business of the Army in a full-spectrum, continually changing environment.
b. Officer Personnel Management System implementation. Acquisition Corps officers serve in acquisition positions
identified on the Military Acquisition Position List (MAPL). Membership in the AAC closely correlates with the
number of authorized positions on the MAPL, by grade. Officers desiring more information on current authorizations
or inventory should contact either the Acquisition Support Center Proponency or their AAC Assignment Manager at
Acquisition Management Branch, U.S. Army Human Resources Command.
48–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Army Acquisition Corps
a. Structure. Army Acquisition Corps officers serve within all acquisition, combat development and research
facilities worldwide. ALT FA 51 positions exist in TRADOC, Army Materiel Command, Defense Logistics Agency;
EAC headquarters staffs, Joint commands and national agencies projecting a Joint, interagency, multinational footprint.
b. Acquire. Since the AAC ALT FA 51 functional area is requirements driven, officers are selected based upon their
year group, grade, and branch. ALT FA51 AOCs are selected by validated and projected Army requirements.
Applications and accession processes are covered in paragraph 48–2.
c. Distribute. Following accession into FA 51, all ALT FA 51 officer assignments will be managed by AMB, HRC.
In this functional area, a single office centrally manages all AAC officers, active and reserve, and civilians under
common executive direction, policy, procedure and oversight. The goal is to collocate reserve management functions
within this command and division. This concept further enhances an integrated, flexible community of officers and
civilians leaders who have undergone professional development within the AAC. The program ensures that AAC
candidates are selected through a common set of criteria addressing competencies and leadership skills strongly linked
to success in an Army Acquisition career. Furthermore, it develops all AAC leadership candidates, both military and
civilian, to the same level of certification and education. The AMB Career Management Division (CMD) at HRC
Officer Personnel Management Directorate (OPMD) manages Acquisition Officer Assignments.
d. Deploy. AAC officers are warfighters who may deploy worldwide at any time. Whether assigned to AAC
positions in CONUS or OCONUS in Army or Joint services organizations, all AAC officers must be able to deploy to
accomplish missions across the full range of military operations. AAC officers may deploy tomorrow as a member of
an AAC team; or more likely they may deploy as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than
war such as humanitarian and peace keeping missions. ALT FA 51 officers must prepare themselves and their families
for this most challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustain. Officers accessed into the Army Acquisition Corps will compete within the Operational career field for
promotion to LTC and COL, per the OPMS III changes, as of December 2004.
f. Develop. Diversification is the key feature of an AAC officer’s development. A diversity of assignments and
rotations with regional assignments helps to achieve true diversity of experience. The point is to expose officers to all
support functions and phases of acquisition to grow the most well-rounded and aware leaders the Army can possibly
grow in order to produce leaders prepared to lead highly complex, multifunctional organizations and acquisition
support to full range military operations on behalf of the current and Future Force. An additional goal for AAC officers
is a master’s degree in an appropriate scientific, technical, engineering, business or management field. After their first
acquisition assignment, officers may be offered the opportunity for fully funded Advanced Civil Schooling (ACS).
Attendance at a graduate school, however, is contingent on potential for academic success and whether the career
timeline supports the advanced civil schooling. Approximately 30 percent of all AAC positions are in scientific,
technical or engineering fields. Therefore, opportunities for scientific, technical or engineering master’s degrees are
offered to those with appropriate undergraduate backgrounds.
(1) Although officers selected to pursue MBA degrees are directed to apply and attend only business schools
accredited by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, the AAC has an established master of science
(MS) degree program to study systems acquisition management at the Naval Post-graduate School (NPS); and Masters
of Science in Procurement Management at the ALMC Ft. Lee VA Florida Institute of Technology extension campus,
and a combination masters/TWI program at the University of Texas, Austin TX. All non–technical advanced degree
programs attended by AAC officers will be nominally 12 to 18 months in length.
(2) Officers selected to pursue science and engineering degrees are directed to attend only accredited institutions that
offer full-time programs. Masters level science and engineering courses of study normally require 18 to 24 months to
complete, depending upon undergraduate background. Army regulation 621–1, paragraph 2–11f states that Ph.D.

472

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

candidates may complete the Ph.D. in 2 phases— phase 1 is up to 36 months in a fully funded schooling earning
Academic Evaluation Reports to complete all requirements but dissertation (ABD), and phase 2 is up to an additional
24 months to complete the dissertation phase in addition to normal duties such as instructing or other Academic
Education Requirement System validated position; the officer may be earn both and AER and an OER producing
during phase 2. The officer should be aware that spending 36 months in a full time school environment may put the
officer at a disadvantage for promotion boards. Officers seeking a Ph.D. must work with their academic advisor to earn
their Ph.D. in as little time as possible; the recommended time to complete phase 1 is 18–24 months if possible.
(3) Officers in all areas of concentration should keep in mind that a bachelor’s degree in any discipline and 24
business hours from an accredited institution are required by DAWIA to become an Acquisition Corp member. The
business officers can be part of the bachelor’s degree or in addition to the bachelor’s degree. The term “business hours”
applies to Accounting, Business, Finance, Contracts, Economics, Industrial Management, Law, Marketing, Organizational Management, Purchasing, and Quantitative Methods. Officers who wish to pursue an assignment in the 51S area
should seek a masters or Ph.D. in a hard science or engineering discipline; UAS&E membership requires the officer to
have a hard science or engineering masters or Ph.D.
(4) Application packets for advanced schooling at a civilian institution routinely require undergraduate transcripts,
Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) or Graduate Record Exam (GRE) scores and an endorsed DA Form
1618, (Application for Detail as Student Officer at a Civilian Educational Institution or at Training With Industry). The
minimum undergraduate grade point average (GPA) normally accepted is 2.5. Officers must individually arrange to
take the GMAT or GRE. Applications for these exams can be obtained from the local Army Education Center or
directly from the Education Testing Service, P.O. Box 6104, Princeton, NJ 98541–6104. Most Army Education Centers
administer the GRE and GMAT free of charge the first time it is taken by an eligible soldier. Individual officers are
responsible for arranging for this free testing through their Army Education Center. Specific application procedures are
outlined in AR 621–1
(5) Table 48–1 shows the preferred advanced degrees for AAC officers.
(6) On 7 August 1996, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Reform issued an interim policy on
the continuing Acquisition education and training for Acquisition work force members. This policy establishes a
requirement for 40 hours (minimum) of continuing education per certified Acquisition professional per year. Army
Acquisition Corps officers are highly encouraged to continue their acquisition education and training by taking courses
offered by numerous DOD and civilian institutions. Many of these courses can be found in the Defense Acquisition
University (DAU) catalog.
(7) Army Acquisition Corps officers are strongly encouraged to establish and maintain dialogue with the Acquisition
Support Center for professional development advice and information as well as for opportunities to impact the AAC
through the ASC’s proponent mission, that is, to develop concepts, doctrine, tactics, techniques, procedures, organization designs, materiel requirements, training programs, training support requirements, manpower requirements, education requirements, and related matters. Officers are also encouraged to maintain a dialogue with their assignment
officers at AMB, HRC. Each officer is his or her own best career manager. Maintaining an open dialogue optimizes the
opportunities for enhanced professional development training, education and experience.
g. Separate. ALT FA 51 officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
48–8. Army Acquisition Corps Reserve and National Guard component officers
a. Reserve and National Guard component ALT FA 51 Officer specific information has been integrated within this
chapter to reflect the current changes in the Army HRC systems. Current rewrites of this chapter will reflect continued
integration of the Reserve and National Guard AAC components.
b. The ultimate integration goal is to create an Army Acquisition Corps of one ensuring the standardization of
education, training and experiences to better integrate all components across the full spectrum of military operations.

Part Six
The Special Branches
Chapter 49
The Judge Advocate General’s Corps
49–1. Unique features of The Judge Advocate General’s Corps
a. Mission. The mission of the JAGC is to provide professional legal support to all echelons of command throughout
the range of military operations. This support encompasses the 6 core legal disciplines: administrative law, civil law
(including contract, fiscal, and environmental law), claims, international law, legal assistance, and military justice, that
collectively, are referred to as operational law.
b. Unique functions performed by The Judge Advocate General’s Corps. The JAGC is a special branch of the Army
(10 USC 3064) whose duties and functions are discussed in AR 27–1 and FM 27–100.
c. Unique features of work in The Judge Advocate General’s Corps.
(1) The JAGC consists of the following:
(a) General officers serving as TJAG; The Assistant Judge Advocate General (TAJAG); Assistant Judge Advocate
General for Military Law and Operations (AJAG/MIL); the Commander, U.S. Army Legal Services Agency (USALSA); and the commander and/or commandant, The Judge Advocate General’s Legal Center and School (TJAGLCS).
(b) Commissioned officers of the RA appointed in the JAGC.
(c) Commissioned warrant officers who are appointed to the JAGC and certified as legal administrators.
(d) Other members of the Army assigned to the JAGC.
(2) The Judge Advocate General is the military legal advisor to the Secretary of the Army and all officers and
agencies of the DA. Under TJAG’s authority to direct members of the JAGC in the performance of their duties (10
USC 3037 and AR 27–1) and to assign Judge Advocates (Article 6, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ),
codified at 10 USC 806 and AR 614–100), TJAG recruits, selects, determines qualifications, assigns, and provides
legal education for members of the JAGC. In the Office of The Judge Advocate General (OTJAG), the Personnel,
Plans, and Training Office (HQDA (DAJA–PT)) manages the JAGC under the supervision of TJAG, and represents
TJAG in all Judge Advocate personnel proponent matters in coordination with The Judge Advocate General’s Legal
Center and School. The Warrant Officer of the Corps represents TJAG in all WO personnel proponent matters in
coordination with The Judge Advocate General’s Legal Center and School. Personnel policies are published annually
by TJAG in publication JAG Pub 1–1.
(3) Judge Advocates are attorneys who perform their duties under commanders of their assigned or attached
commands or under other supervisory Judge Advocates, such as the SJA; chief, Trial Judiciary; or the chief, Trial
Defense Service.
(a) The JAGC officers include both Judge Advocates and WO legal administrators. All JAGC officers receive
technical legal supervision from TJAG and from the SJAs from their higher headquarters.
(b) Only Judge Advocates assigned to the U.S. Army Trial Defense Service authorized to perform the functions of
defense counsel, or made available as an individual defense counsel, may provide advice and assistance to soldiers
suspected, accused, or convicted of violations of the UCMJ on matters relating to those violations or suspected
violations.
(4) As much as possible, Judge Advocates perform only professional legal duties for which they are trained. They
should not perform any non–legal duties, such as officer of the day, inventory officer, range officer, casualty
notification officer, casualty assistance officer, or any other duties that would interfere with or pose a conflict of
interest with their primary assigned legal duties.
(5) The JAGC branch consists of 2 areas of concentration with 4 JAGC specific skill identifiers and one WO MOS.
Judge Advocates are classified as either 27A (Judge Advocate) or 27B (Military Judge). The 4 JAGC specific skill
identifiers are as follows: 3D (Government Contract Law Specialist), 3F (Patent Law Specialist), 3G (Claims/Litigation
Specialist), and 3N (International Law Specialist). Warrant officers in the JAGC are officers classified as 270A (Legal
Administrators). These officers may hold skill identifiers as follows: 3R (Force Management), 6M (Mobilization/
Demobilization Operations), 6P (Master Fitness Trainer), and 7Q (Training Development).
(6) In support of the skill identifier 3D (Government Contract Law Specialist), the JAGC has established the
Acquisition Law Specialty Program. This program formally recognizes officers who are qualified acquisition attorneys,
although they may not meet the criteria for the skill identifier. These officers support the acquisition process but are not
members of the Army Acquisition Corps or the acquisition work force.
49–2. Officer characteristics required
a. Competencies and actions common to all. The Army must have officers who can effectively apply the 4 core
dimensions of leadership: values, attributes, skills, and actions (see FM 22–100 for additional discussion). The 4 core
leadership dimensions provide the basis for what a leader must be, know, and do. The values and attributes set the

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

475

basis for the character of the leader—what a leader must be. The skills developed by leaders establish his or her
competence—what a leader must know. The actions that leaders conduct and execute constitute leadership—what a
leader must do. The leadership framework describes a leader of character and competence who acts to achieve
excellence across the spectrum of operations from total war to operations other than war to disaster relief and in times
of peace.
(1) Leadership. All JAGC officers must be focused on leadership, not only within the legal offices, but also the
impact of legal operations on the command. Leadership training is required to be integrated into courses of instruction
at The Judge Advocate General’s Legal Center and School (AR 600–100).
(2) Values. All Army officers are expected to live by the Army core values. The JAGC officers are held to an even
higher standard because of their legal duty to advise commanders on violations of legal and ethical rules. All Judge
Advocates are bound by the Professional Rules of Conduct for Lawyers (AR 27–26). Attorney conduct is further bound
by the state rules of conduct in the state in which they are licensed to practice law.
b. Unique skills.
(1) Judge Advocates must have the education, training, and experience equal or similar to that required of other
members of the legal profession (10 USC 3065(e)). Under the provisions of AR 27–1, Judge Advocates must be
admitted to practice and have membership in good standing (as defined by the pertinent bar) of the bar of the highest
court of a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a Federal court
located in the districts of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or the Northern Mariana Islands.
(2) Legal administrators are warrant officers and must have military education and experience in military legal and
operational procedures, and demonstrate expertise in legal technology. Legal administrators must be highly motivated,
possessing tact, initiative, integrity, and mature judgment. In both garrison and tactical environments, legal administrators are leaders, mentors, trainers, and technical and warfighting experts within their organizations. Legal administrators are an SJA’s operational law technologist. Legal administrators play a key role in assisting the SJA and the chief
of military justice with managing and executing the pre–trial processing, case management, production of expert
witnesses, post–trial processing and budgets of courts–martial. Legal administrators assist the SJA and chief of
operational law with planning, organizing, and executing office participation in contingency operations including
training all attorneys, paralegal specialists, and NCOs in the execution of operational law missions. At legal offices
within headquarters exercising general court–martial jurisdiction, or at a MACOM, a legal administrator serves as the
chief of the Administration Division. In this capacity, they supervise office personnel and manage office budgets,
facilities, and equipment required to support legal services. As strategic and tactical planners, legal administrators
anticipate changes in the military climate, instituting changes to ensure the JAGC can support the Army’s continually
evolving missions. Within Information Management Systems, legal administrators are responsible for the protection of
attorney–client information. Legal administrators must have extensive training in military justice, and the other core
legal disciplines (administrative law, claims, civil law, and legal assistance) and apply their knowledge in any
environment. Legal administrators are also responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the Judge Advocate
Warfighter System (JAWS) and provide the primary realistic training for Judge Advocates and paralegals in hardware
and software applications necessary for remote operations or deployment.
c. Unique knowledge and attributes. Officers in the JAGC develop themselves through progressively challenging
assignments and by continuing their military and professional education. Judge Advocates are individually responsible
for their professional competence.
49–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. Judge Advocate assignments and development.
(1) Pre–graduate course assignments. The first JAGC assignment is not normally in the state in which a Judge
Advocates is licensed, attended law school or performed on–the–job training (if a Funded Legal Education Program
(FLEP) officer). New Judge Advocates are rotated through a variety of duties in many of the legal specialties in which
Judge Advocates are expected to practice. This produces a flexible Judge Advocates who can deploy in support of
combat operations and provides the Judge Advocates with a foundation for the ensuing graduate course. In these early
assignments, some officers will have the opportunity to supervise other attorneys, soldiers, and civilians. Many officers
serve as defense counsel before the graduate course, although first assignment Judge Advocates are not normally
assigned to the U.S. Army Trial Defense Service directly from the Judge Advocate Officer Basic Course.
(2) Post–graduate course assignments. Judge Advocates are usually selected to attend the Judge Advocate Graduate
Course upon selection to MAJ. Following the graduate course officers are assigned to field grade positions. The JAGC
provides opportunities for specialization at this point. Some Judge Advocates partially specialize but continue to be
generalists. Some, like many Acquisition Law Specialty officers, focus on their specialties. Judge Advocates also get
significant opportunities for leadership and management. Judge Advocate MAJs can expect to serve as senior defense
counsels; branch, and division chiefs in large legal offices; deputy, SJA; instructors at TJAGLCS, Command and
General Staff College or at West Point; or as staff and trial attorneys in the litigating divisions in Washington, DC,
other defense and Government agencies, or in the Office of The Judge Advocate General.
(3) Senior field grade assignments.LTCs have the opportunity to serve in more specialized assignments and in
senior leadership positions. Judge Advocate LTCs have their first opportunity to serve as military judges, regional
476

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

defense counsel, or SJAs. They also serve as branch and division chiefs in the largest offices; the Office of the Judge
Advocate, U.S. Army Europe; or the National Capital Region. Judge Advocate COLs are senior trial and appellate
military judges, SJAs to major installations, Corps, and echelons above Corps; and division chiefs in the Office of The
Judge Advocate General and the U.S. Army Legal Services Agency.
(4) Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Judge Advocates do not serve in branch/functional area
generalist assignments.
(5) Joint assignments. After selection for MAJ, Judge Advocates may be considered for Joint duty assignments in
Joint organizations worldwide, including the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Joint staff and the
combatant commands. Joint experience is important to the Army. Due to the limited number of Joint assignments
available, Judge Advocates are not precluded from advancing into senior leadership positions because they lack Joint
experience (see 10 USC 619a(b)(3)(C)).
(6) Other assignments. Judge Advocates may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated above.
These assignments may include duty with the Department of Justice, the Department of State, and the White House.
The spectrum of possible assignments is large and these assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and
important, and requiring mature, skilled, and well–grounded officers.
b. Legal administrator qualification and development (Active Army and Reserve Component).
(1) WO1 legal administrators—
(a) Will be assigned in the Mentor Training and Experience Program (MTEP) at the current unit of assignment, or
first legal administrator assignment, after successful completion of the WOCS and before attendance at the Legal
Administrator Warrant Officer Basic Course. This program pairs a newly appointed WO with an experienced legal
administrator preparing the individual for the WOBC and future duty as a legal administrator.
(b) Must successfully complete the legal administrator WOBC.
(2) CW2 legal administrators—
(a) Must successfully complete the Legal Administrator Warrant Officer Basic Course.
(b) Must complete prerequisite studies for the WOAC.
(c) Must complete the Legal Administrator Warrant Officer Advanced Course prior to selection for promotion to
CW3.
(d) Should be assigned as a legal administrator to the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate (OSJA) at installations or
divisions located with a Corps OSJA.
(3) CW3 legal administrators—
(a) Must complete the WOSC prior to selection for promotion to CW4.
(b) Must complete a baccalaureate degree prior to selection to CW4.
(c) Should be assigned as a legal administrator to the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate at divisions not located
with a Corps OSJA or some TRADOC centers and schools.
(4) CW4 legal administrators—
(a) Must complete the WOSSC prior to selection for promotion to CW5.
(b) Should be assigned as a legal administrator to the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate at a Corps or a MACOM.
(5) CW5 legal administrators—Should be assigned to the most senior supervisory, advisory, and staff positions in
the Office of the Judge Advocate General (Chief Warrant Officer of the Corps), the U.S. Army Legal Services Agency,
or The Judge Advocate General’s Legal Center and School.
(6) The USAR and ARNG legal administrators must complete all prerequisite levels of military education applicable
to legal administrators prior to selection to the next higher grade.
(7) For other assignments—legal administrators may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated
above. These assignments include assignments in Joint organizations, Army Staff or secretariat positions, the WOCC,
recruiting positions, and so forth. The assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and important, requiring
mature, skilled, and well–grounded officers.
49–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Judge Advocate preferences and precedence.
(1) Preferences. Under the statutory authority of TJAG to assign Judge Advocates (10 USC 806) and direct them in
their duties (10 USC 3037(c)(2)), TJAG closely monitors Judge Advocates professional development. The Judge
Advocate General’s frequent inspection of military legal offices in accordance with UCMJ, Art. 6 (10 USC 806), offers
a unique opportunity to mentor JAGC leaders directly and to monitor how junior officers are developed.
(a) All assignments are made in the best interests of the Army. The objective of the JAGC assignment policy is to
build an expert, flexible force by balancing the needs of the Army, professional development, personal and family
needs, and personal preferences in every assignment. While personal preferences are considered, circumstances often
require that individual desires or needs must be subordinated to the needs of the Army.
(b) Professional development of the Judge Advocate is accomplished by progressively more challenging assignments
to organizations in the field and at higher headquarters, along with opportunities for schooling. Proven performance and

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

477

potential as reflected in officer evaluation reports are the key factors in deciding who is the best qualified officer for an
assignment. The JAGC’s goal is to develop every officer professionally, ensure diversity of assignments and provide
opportunities for management, leadership, and education.
(2) Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions has precedence, although flexibility exists on the
sequence of assignments. While Judge Advocates participate in other military and legal training, under provisions of
AR 27–1, the TJAG has prescribed the following educational requirements Judge Advocates should use as a guide for
seeking assignments:
(a) Judge Advocate positions authorized the grade of CPT or lower require credit for the Judge Advocate Officer
Basic Course (JAOBC) or the Reserve Component Judge Advocate Officer Basic Course (RCJAOBC).
(b) Judge Advocate positions authorized the grade of MAJ or higher require credit for the Judge Advocate Officer
Graduate Course or Judge Advocate Officer Advanced Course.
(c) Military Judge positions require completion of the Military Judge Course at TJAGLCS in addition to the Judge
Advocate Officer Graduate or Advanced Course. Officers selected for Military Judge positions will be scheduled to
attend the next Military Judge Course, unless already certified as a Military Judge.
(d) Acquisition Law Specialty Judge Advocates positions normally require completion of the Contract Attorneys
Course, the Fiscal Law Course, and one additional contract law-related course within 36 months of first assignment to
a contract law position (whether contract law is a primary or part–time duty). The Contract Attorneys Course should be
completed first and within the first 12 months of assignment to a contract law position.
(e) Staff Judge Advocate positions require completion of Command and General Staff College, or its equivalent, and
attendance at the Staff Judge Advocate Course at TJAGLCS.
b. Legal administrator preferences and precedence.
(1) Legal administrators should serve in positions commensurate with their grade, however, all legal administrators
should be prepared to serve in positions of greater responsibility at all times.
(2) Key positions at the Office of The Judge Advocate General, The Judge Advocate General’s Legal Center and
School, and the U.S. Army Legal Services Agency, provide assignments for acquiring and utilizing additional skills in
legal automation, Force Management, and training development.
49–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Judge Advocate positions. Assignments in the CONUS are normally a maximum of 3 years; however, the need to
staff all legal offices properly and to develop the careers of all Judge Advocates effectively can require shorter or
longer tours. Tour lengths for overseas assignments are outlined in AR 614–30.
(1) Trial defense counsels (TDS) will normally be assigned to TDS positions for 18 months. A senior defense
counsel will normally be assigned for a 2–year tour.
(2) A regional defense counsel will normally serve a 2–year tour.
(3) LTC SJAs and COLs serving as Corps SJAs will normally be assigned for a 2–year tour. COLs otherwise
serving as SJAs will normally be assigned for a 2 or 3–year tour. Judge Advocates serving in nominative positions as
either legal advisors or Staff Judge Advocates will normally be assigned for a 3–year tour.
(4) Figure 49–1 displays a Judge Advocates life cycle.
b. Legal administrator military occupational specialty life cycle. Figure 49–2 displays a legal administrator life
cycle with branch qualifying and other developmental positions. Figure 49–3 displays the same for RC.

49–6. Requirements, authorization, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, upwardly mobile career path for JAGC officers. Fair, candid, and open
personnel management is critical to meeting the JAGC’s mission. Personnel management will be effective only when
interest in professional development is shared among the JAGC leadership, supervisors, and individual members of the
corps.
b. Officer Personnel Management System III implementation. The JAGC is not directly affected by OPMS III. The
numbers of authorized JAGC billets, by grade, will be sufficient to meet the JAGC’s mission to provide quality legal
services to the Army. Officers desiring more information on the JAGC authorizations or inventory should contact the
Personnel, Plans, and Training Office, Office of The Judge Advocate General, 1777 North Kent Street, Rossyln, VA
22209–2194
49–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for The Judge Advocate General’s Corps
a. Structure. Judge Advocates serve at all echelons worldwide.
b. Acquire.
(1) Judge Advocates will continue to be accessed into the branch primarily by direct commissioning.
(a) Applications for appointment as a Judge Advocate come primarily from law school students, ROTC officers
attending law school on an educational delay, active members of the civilian bar and active duty commissioned officers
seeking participation in the Funded Legal Education Program. To be appointed, a person should have already earned a
law degree from a law school accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA), and must be admitted to practice
and have membership in good standing (as defined by the pertinent bar) of the bar of the highest court of a state of the
United States, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a Federal court located in the districts of
Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or the Northern Mariana Islands.
(b) Judge Advocates commissioned directly from civilian life enter active duty as obligated volunteers for a specific
term of service; they are awarded constructive credit for promotion for the time spent in law school. Officers who do
not qualify for appointment as CPTs, U.S. Army Reserve (USAR), are appointed as first lieutenants, USAR, and are
usually eligible for promotion to the grade of CPT within 6 months after entry on active duty. Officers must apply for
and attain conditional voluntary indefinite (CVI) status to remain on active duty past their initial term of obligated
service. Officers must apply for and attain voluntary indefinite (VI) status to remain on active duty past the expiration
of their CVI status.
(c) The Funded Legal Education Program, authorized by 10 USC 2004 and AR 27–1, allows a small number of
active duty officers to attend law school at government expense. The program is available to officers with not less than
2 years nor more than 6 years of total active Federal service at the time school begins. Officers are detailed to the
JAGC but remain in their basic branch until later appointed in or assigned to the JAGC in the grade in which they are
serving.
(2) Legal administrators are accessed from the JAGC enlisted corps. Soldiers with MOS 27D, between 5 and 8 years
of service that have excelled in a variety of JAGC positions are candidates for accession.
c. Distribute. The Judge Advocate General (Personnel, Plans, and Training Office) manages assignments for Judge
Advocates and the Warrant Officer of the Corps manages assignments for legal administrators.
d. Deploy. The JAGC officers must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all times.
Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA organizations, all JAGC officers
must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. The JAGC officers may deploy
tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests; or as individuals to support
Joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peacekeeping missions. Judge Advocate
General’s Corps officers must prepare themselves and their families for this challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustain. Judge Advocates will compete within their career field for promotion to all grades. Warrant Officers One
(WO1) will be promoted to CW2 after 2 years in grade on the recommendation of the first LTC in the chain of
command. All other warrant officers, CW2 through CW5, will normally be considered for promotion to the next higher
grade by a DA promotion board, first below–the–zone after 3 years in grade and then in–the–zone after 4 years in
grade. The DA publishes zones of consideration prior to each promotion board. Warrant officers upon promotion to
CW2 must accept Voluntary Indefinite (VI) status within 90 days of promotion.
f. Develop. The Judge Advocate General’s Corps officer development is as follows:
(1) Development objective. The Judge Advocate General’s Corps objective is to build an expert, flexible force
through a comprehensive professional development system that links challenging developmental assignments with
institutional training and self–development (see figs 49–8 and 49–2). The Judge Advocate General’s Corps expects
each officer to seek and have diversity in assignments and opportunities for specialization, management, leadership and

482

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

education. Balanced professional development yields an officer who can deploy in support of combat forces and
provide comprehensive legal service in the field.
(2) Institutional training. Institutional training is comprised of both military training and legal education.
(a) The Judge Advocate General’s Legal Center and School. The Judge Advocate General’s Legal Center and
School (LCS) is the home of the Regiment and is the cornerstone of the JAGC’s training and education. Because the
health of JAGC is contingent on an intellectually vibrant educational institution that is in touch with the field’s needs,
the assignment of quality, experienced officers and noncommissioned officers to the LCS faculty and staff is a high
priority.
(b) Judge Advocate Officer Basic and Graduate Courses. New Judge Advocates attend the 14–week basic course en
route to their first duty stations, although a few are assigned in a delayed schooling status to installations before the
course. The centerpiece of junior officer professional development is attendance at the 10–month Judge Advocate
Graduate Course. It educates career Judge Advocates in all areas of military law, legal communications, and management. The course prepares officers for middle and senior grade positions and also provides an opportunity to develop
specialized knowledge and skills. The Judge Advocate Graduate Course is accredited by the American Bar Association
as a graduate legal education program and is statutorily empowered to award the only graduate law degree in military
law in the United States. Officers completing this schooling incur a 2–year active duty service obligation and normally
serve a 2–year utilization tour.
(c) Advanced civil schooling. The Judge Advocate General selects a limited number of Judge Advocates annually to
attend civilian institutions for one year at Government expense to obtain advanced legal education in specialized areas.
This schooling supplements TJAGLCS graduate course training. Legal administrators may be selected by the TJAG for
degree completion programs.
(d) Judge Advocate continuing professional education. All Judge Advocates participate in continuing legal education
throughout their careers. This training is required by many licensing states; it also keeps officers abreast of current
legal developments. Continuing legal education consists of training conducted by SJAs, military judges, and regional
and senior defense counsel; civilian training; and training provided at TJAGLCS. As Judge Advocates, develop
professionally and become eligible for more senior assignments as military Judges, SJAs, and deputy, SJA, they attend
specialized training, which is part of their overall development. Senior Judge Advocates may also be offered the
opportunity for specialized management training.
(e) Other Army training. Judge Advocates are both officers and lawyers. Therefore, they participate in officer
training programs including CAS3, Command and General Staff College (CGSC), and Senior Service College (SSC).
All Judge Advocates attend CAS3. Few resident CGSC spaces are allotted to the JAGC; accordingly, the JAGC
encourages Judge Advocates to complete CGSC by correspondence if they are not selected to attend in residence. The
JAGC officers often attend other specialized military training such as airborne and air assault training.
g. Seperation. The JAGC officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
49–8. Reserve Component Judge Advocates
a. General. The Judge Advocate General exercises technical supervision of RC JAGC officers not on the ADL. The
Mobilization and Integration Division of OTJAG assists TJAG by developing policy and providing technical assistance
in the career management of USAR Judge Advocate officers. The TJAG, with the assistance of the National Guard
Special Advisor to the Judge Advocate General, through the chief, National Guard Bureau, also provide technical
assistance to the respective State Adjutants General for the career management of Army National Guard (ARNG) Judge
Advocates. In general, qualifications and professional development are similar to ADL Judge Advocates.
b. Reserve Component Judge Advocate career development.
(1) The RC, USAR, professional development objectives regarding Judge Advocates are as follows:
(a) Development of the professional attributes and capabilities of USAR officers to meet the mobilization needs of
the Army.
(b) Development of the officers in the numbers and skills to meet the functional requirements of the Army in partial
or total mobilization.
(c) Development of officers with technical, managerial and administrative skills to serve in positions of increasing
responsibility in the JAGC.
(2) Assignments of Judge Advocates are made upon the recommendation of TJAG (UCMJ, Art. 6 and 10 USC 806).
Specific policies on JAGC assignments are contained in AR 140–10, section VI. This discussion is directed toward
assignment patterns that prepare RC Judge Advocates for senior troop program unit and individual mobilization
augmentee positions.
c. Company grade assignments. Company grade JAGC assignments should allow the officer an opportunity to learn
to be both a military lawyer and an officer. An officer at this stage of his or her career should be exposed to a wide
variety of experiences. The Army understands that, at the same time the Judge Advocate is learning his or her military
craft, he or she is beginning a full–time civilian career; however, high standards of participation and performance are
still demanded.
(1) Troop program unit Judge Advocates should be assigned to junior Judge Advocate General Service Organization

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

483

(JAGSO) and SJA section positions. Assignment of Judge Advocates with less than 4 years of experience to SJA
sections where they are the sole or senior Judge Advocates is not advised. During this period of the JAGC officer’s
career, there are a number of professional development educational requirements; however, the individual should be
required to attend annual training with the unit at least 3 out of 5 years.
(2) Individual mobilization augmentee Judge Advocates should be assigned to junior individual mobilization augmentee positions, which are with active duty division or garrison units when possible. Individual mobilization
augmentee supervisors should not only provide training in military legal requirements of the position, but they should
ensure that junior officers are exposed to soldier experiences. When possible, SJAs should arrange to pair up new
Judge Advocates with a platoon leader of a local line unit for a 1 or 2 day orientation on life as a soldier. Supervisors
should counsel junior officers on both their legal abilities and their soldier abilities. Junior Judge Advocates in
individual mobilization augmentee positions should be encouraged to drill, for points only, at least part of the year with
a troop program unit in their home area.
(3) Non–JAGC TPU assignments for company grade officers are discouraged until the individual has at least 8 years
commissioned service. These assignments are beneficial to both the JAGC and the soldier. The assignments broaden
the individual’s perspective concerning the mission of the Army and enhance an officer’s ability to perform at
higher–level position later in his or her career. Assignments to non-JAGC positions are approved by TJAG (according
to AR 140–10) and are for a period not to exceed 3 years.
(4) Company grade officers should not be assigned to the IRR except in unusual circumstances. Appointment of
new Judge Advocates should be for a TPU or individual mobilization augmentee position; however, if Judge Advocates
are assigned to the IRR, they should complete their annual training requirements in JAGC–related assignments. It is
highly undesirable for company grade Judge Advocates to spend 2 or more years in the IRR.
d. Major assignments. Reserve Component Judge Advocates usually have at least 9 years commissioned service
when promoted to MAJ. This is a mid–level grade with opportunities to supervise other Judge Advocates. This is also
a time to develop more specific skills and experiences to qualify for senior JAGC positions. Troop program unit JAGC
officers should seek assignments as JAGSO team directors and general officer command (GOCOM) SJAs. These
assignments should follow developmental TPU or individual mobilization augmentee experiences relating to the type of
law practices by the unit. Examples of developmental assignments for JAGC position qualification for a USAR
GOCOM SJA position at the MAJ level are as follows:
(1) Troop program unit. Member of an SJA section, Judge Advocate for a small unit, or member of courts martial
or defense team.
(2) Individual mobilization augmentee. Member of an SJA section, counsel for Trial Defense Service; or TJAGLCS
instructor in criminal law, administrative and civil law, contract law, or international and operational law.
e. Lieutenant colonel assignments. Reserve Component Judge Advocates usually have at least 15 years of commissioned service when promoted to LTC. This is the beginning of senior level assignment and performance expectations.
Officers at this level should have the legal expertise, soldier skills, and confidence to deal effectively with Army
commanders. The LTC JAGC officer should serve as role models and mentors for junior officers, counseling and
assisting them in developing their skills and careers. Troop program unit JAGC officers should be competing for
principal tenured JAGC positions such as division SJA, GOCOM SJA (LTC), or Military Judge (LTC). The degree to
which a Judge Advocate is competitive for these assignments is a function of prior developmental assignments.
Examples of developmental assignments for these 2 positions are listed below—
(1) Developmental assignments for division SJA and GOCOM SJA (LTC) include the following:
(a) Troop program unit. Member SJA section, team director JAGSO detachment and Military Judge (LTC).
(b) Individual mobilization augmentee. Staff Judge Advocate or deputy SJA and TJAGLCS instructor.
(2) Developmental assignments for Military Judge (LTC) include the following:
(a) Troop program unit. Team director (trial/defense), division SJA and GOCOM SJA.
(b) Individual mobilization augmentee. U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals (USACCA) (LTC) and TJAGLCS
instructor in criminal law.
f. Colonel assignments. Reserve Component Judge Advocates usually have at least 20 years of commissioned
service when promoted to COL. For all but a handful of JAGC officers, this is their most senior level of service to the
Army. Development of the officer is no longer a major professional objective. This is a period of full utilization of the
officer’s talents, experience, and training. At this level, officers should perform effectively with senior Army commanders. COLs lead, discipline, teach, and develop the field grade JAGC officers under their technical and command
supervision. Troop program unit JAGC officers, through training and experience, have prepared themselves for
maximum use of their skills, abilities, and talents as Reserve Readiness Command (RRC) SJAs, Legal Service
Organization/Mobilization Support Organization (LSO/MSO) commanders and senior military judges. Prior assignments that offer the experience necessary to succeed at these assignments are listed below.
(1) To succeed as an RRC SJA, officers should serve in the following:
(a) Troop program unit. Division SJA, GOCOM SJA, LSO commander or Military Judge.
(b) Individual mobilization augmentee. Major command SJA (LTC or COL) or deputy SJA (LTC), or TJAGLCS
instructor (LTC).

484

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

(2) To succeed as an LSO/MSO commander, officers should serve in the following:
(a) Troop program unit. Division SJA, GOCOM SJA, RRC SJA, chief, LSO section, or Military Judge.
(b) Individual mobilization augmentee. Staff Judge Advocate or deputy SJA of a major command.
(3) To succeed as a senior Military Judge, officers should serve in the following:
(a) Troop program unit. Military Judge (LTC), LSO commander or RRC SJA.
(b) Individual mobilization augmentee. Military Judge (COL), USACCA (LTC or COL), TDS (LTC or COL), or
TJAGLCS instructor in criminal law (LTC or COL).
g. Professional development education for Reserve Component Judge Advocates. The following describes the
various professional courses available:
(1) The Judge Advocate General’s Corps Officer Basic Course.
(a) This course is designed to provide basic branch orientation and training for RC officers who are receiving a
commission in the JAGC without concurrent orders to active duty. This course serves as a branch qualification course
for RC company grade officers. Completion of the course is required as a prerequisite for promotion to CPT.
(b) The RC JAGC officers who have not attended a resident officer basic course must attend phase I–Required
Military Subjects in residence at Fort Lee, VA (4 weeks). Phase II–Required Legal Subjects may be taken by
correspondence (89 hours) within the first 2 years of appointment (60 hours must be completed in the first year).
(2) The Judge Advocate General’s Corps Officer Advanced Course.
(a) This course is designed to provide a working knowledge of the duties and responsibilities of field grade JAGC
officers. This course is the non–resident version of the Judge Advocate Officer Graduate Course. This course serves as
branch qualification for officers to serve in field grade JAGC positions. Completion of the course is a prerequisite for
promotion to MAJ.
(b) The JAOAC consists of 2 legal subject phases. Phase I is a correspondence phase. Phase II is a 2–week resident
phase taught at TJAGLCS. This course should be taken between the 2d and 5th years of commissioned service.
(3) Command and Staff College.
(a) The purpose of CSC is to develop familiarity with employment of multiservice and multinational forces used in
Joint and combined arms operations; to develop basic knowledge of the Joint operations planning process; and to create
awareness of DOD requirements as well as individual service capabilities, problems and needs. Completion of 50
percent of CSC is a prerequisite for promotion to LTC; however, the entire course should be completed in 36 months,
or within 3 years of promotion to LTC, whichever is sooner.
(b) The CSC is composed of 4 phases, each being available either by correspondence from the U.S. Army Reserve
Forces School or through resident training at Fort Leavenworth, KS (the RC course at Fort Leavenworth runs for 19
weeks beginning in August). The CSC should be completed between the 9th and 20th years of commissioned service.
(4) Senior Service College.
(a) The U.S. Army War College (AWC) is a Senior Service College designed to prepare officers for duty as
commanders and staff officers at the highest levels of the Army. The course is not a prerequisite for promotion, but
enhances any officer’s ability to perform at the highest level.
(b) The U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course is a 2–year correspondence program consisting of home
study and two 2–week resident phases at Carlisle Barracks, PA. Selection for this course is by a centralized board
convened by AR–PERSCOM. This is the only correspondence course that the Army recognizes as military education
level 1 (MEL 1) producing. This course should be completed between the 21st and 26th years of service.
(5) Continuing legal education.
(a) Each year TJAGLCS offers specialized continuing legal education courses at Charlottesville, VA, and at over 35
other locations around the world. Taught by TJAGLCS faculty, these courses provide an essential update in a particular
field of law. RC Judge Advocates are required to attend this training to maintain their basic professional competence as
military lawyers.
(b) Individuals may apply for TJAGLCS resident CLE training that varies in length from 3 days to 3 weeks. These
courses provide practice oriented continuing legal education for military attorneys. The TJAGLCS also provides
weekend, on–site CLE training at 20 CONUS Army locations and at selected OCONUS Army sites. Judge Advocates

Chapter 50
Chaplain Corps
50–1. Unique features of Chaplain Corps
a. Unique purpose of Chaplain Corps. The Chaplain Corps is a special branch of the Army whose mission is to
provide for the comprehensive religious support to the Army across the spectrum of operations.
b. Unique functions performed by Chaplain Corps. Chaplains provide the religious, spiritual, moral and ethical
support to the Army in any contingency. As religious leaders, they provide the Army community the opportunity to
participate in worship and religious educational opportunities and to receive the pastoral care and spiritual enrichment it
seeks. Chaplains preserve and perpetuate the faith-based values that often serve as the bedrock of our units and
communities. As special staff officers, they coordinate religious support activities to support the commander’s operational plans and objectives in war and peace. Similarly, they provide commanders with professional advice on the
impact of religion on military operations.
c. Unique features of work in the Chaplain Corps. Chaplains serve on the personal and special staff of the
commander and assist in ensuring that the policies and leadership practices of the command are in keeping with strict
moral, ethical and humanitarian standards. The chaplain advises the commander and staff on matters pertaining to
religion, morals and morale. The senior chaplain assigned to a unit or headquarters is normally designated the staff
chaplain. The chaplain is responsible to the commander for all chaplain related activities within the command. The
chaplain exercises staff and technical supervision of the activities of the other chaplains assigned to the headquarters.
He or she provides staff supervision for the activities of chaplains in subordinate commands and provides commanders
and staff with advice, information, recommendations, programming, funding data and plans concerning religious
activities, morale, chaplain and chaplain assistant personnel matters.
(1) The Chaplain Branch encompasses 2 areas of concentration: Command and Unit Chaplain (56A); and Clinical
Ministries Supervisor (56D).
(a) The Command and Unit Chaplain (56A) serves as a religious leader with staff functions for unit of assignment
and to units requiring area religious coverage. The duties of chaplains are those, which normally pertain to the clergy
profession and those, which are prescribed by law, regulations and distinctive conditions and circumstances of DA.
(b) The Clinical Ministries Supervisor (56D) applies to 2 types of supervisors who offer specialized supervision in
the areas of Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) and Approved Supervisors for Family Life Chaplaincy.
(2) The Chaplain Branch incorporates 7 skill identifiers—
(a) Chaplaincy Resources Manager (corps and installation) (7F).
(b) Marriage and Family Specialist (7K).
(c) Chaplaincy Resource Manager (HQDA, HQ IMA, Region, MACOM, USACHCS) (7M).
(d) Chaplain Service School Instructor (7N).
(e) Hospital Ministries Chaplain (7R).
(f) Combat Medical Ministry (7S)
(g) Force Management (3R).
50–2. Officer characteristics required
Chaplain officers are fully qualified members of the clergy of a religious faith group. Entry–level requirements are
established by public law, DOD directives and Army regulations. Chaplains are required to possess a baccalaureate
degree of not less than 120 semester hours; have completed a master’s degree consisting of 72 semester hours
(minimum) of graduate professional study from an accredited institution in theology or approved subjects (normally
validated by the possession of a Master of Divinity degree, an equivalent degree or 72 semester hours); and be certified
by a qualified religious organization which has met all the administrative requirements established by the Armed
Forces Chaplains Board.
a. Competencies and actions common to all. The Army must have officers who can effectively apply the 4 core
dimensions of leadership: values, attributes, skills, and actions (see FM 22–100 for additional discussion of these
leadership dimensions). The 4 core leadership dimensions provide the basis for what a leader must be, know, and do.
The values and attributes set the basis for the character of the leader— what a leader must be. The skills developed by
leaders establishes his or her competence— what a leader must know. The actions that leaders conduct and execute
constitute leadership— what a leader must do. The leadership framework describes a leader of character and competence who acts to achieve excellence across the spectrum of operations from total war, to operations other than war, to
disaster relief and in times of peace.
(1) Army Values. Values are at the core of everything the Army is and does. The Army is an institution of people
with unique and enduring values. These values must be a part of the men and women— officers, enlisted personnel,
and civilians— who are the Army. These values provide the sense of purpose necessary to sustain our soldiers in

488

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

combat and help resolve ambiguities in operations other than war. Officers must establish and maintain an environment
in the Army where soldiers and civilians do what is right; where individuals treat each other as they should be treated;
and, where everyone can be all they can be. There are 7 Army Values (LDRSHIP).
(a) Loyalty. Bear true faith and allegiance to the U.S. Constitution, the Army, your unit, and other soldiers.
(b) Duty. Fulfill your obligations.
(c) Respect. Treat people as they should be treated.
(d) Selfless Service. Put the welfare of the Nation, the Army, and your subordinates before your own.
(e) Honor. Live up to all the Army Values.
(f) Integrity. Do what’s right, legally and morally.
(g) Personal Courage. Face fear, danger or adversity (physical or moral).
(2) There are 6 chaplaincy values (SACRED).
(a) Spirituality. Seek to know God and yourself at the deepest level.
(b) Accountability. Hold yourself and others to the moral and spiritual high ground in every area of life.
(c) Compassion. Love in word and deed.
(d) Religious Leadership. Model spiritual truths wisely and courageously.
(e) Excellence. Do your best for God’s glory.
(f) Diversity. Respect the differences of others.
(3) Leader attributes. Attributes are fundamental qualities and characteristics. Attributes assist in defining what an
officer should be and contribute to leader actions. Army leader attributes are described in 3 categories— mental,
physical, and emotional.
(a) Mental attributes describe aptitudes and capacities for learning that leaders should possess and develop. Included
in this category are will, self–discipline, initiative, judgment, confidence, intelligence, and cultural awareness.
(b) Physical attributes specify physical dispositions or aptitudes that can be nurtured and developed. Included in this
category are health fitness, physical fitness, stamina, military bearing, and professional bearing.
(c) Emotional attributes are those affective aptitudes or capacities that contribute to how one feels and substantially
contribute to leadership. Included in this category are self–control, balance, and stability.
(4) Leader skills. Skills are synonymous with competencies. They are abilities or competencies that one develops
and uses with people, with ideas, and with things. Competence is of primary importance for all Army officers. The
Army recognizes that officers must develop 4 types of skills—
(a) Interpersonal skills reflect competence in communicating with people.
(b) Conceptual skills refer to competence in handling ideas.
(c) Technical skills reflect competence with things.
(d) Tactical skills refer to the ability to put together technical, interpersonal, and conceptual skills and apply them to
warfighting tasks.
(5) Leader actions. Officers provide purpose, direction, and motivation as they influence their subordinates to
operate to accomplish their mission and strive to improve their unit or organization. Leader actions are how Army
officers act to achieve excellence and get the job done. These actions are applicable across all levels of leadership.
(a) Influencing refers to the use of appropriate people skills to guide subordinates or teams toward mission
accomplishment. Influencing subdivides into communicating, decisionmaking, and motivating.
(b) Operating or accomplishing the mission refers to the relative short–term actions of getting the job done.
Operating divides into planning, executing, and assessing.
(c) Improving refers to the long–term investment type actions essential to improving everything the leader influences. Improving subdivides into developing people, building teams, and learning.
b. Unique skills. Chaplains must fully comprehend the organization, structure, and doctrine of the warfighting Army
as it evolves in the 21st century. Chaplains must—
(1) Plan and execute the commander’s master religious plan and/or commander’s religious program in support of the
unit’s mission.
(2) Assess the impact of indigenous religious beliefs and practices on the unit’s mission.
(3) Provide religious services of worship, including funerals and memorial services that occur in field and garrison.
(4) Provide specific essential elements of religious services that normally take place apart from formal religious
services.
(5) Provide ministry to marriages and families.
(6) Offer pastoral care through counseling and advising.
(7) Teach classes on moral leadership, suicide awareness, and religious education.
(8) Render pastoral care in a hospital setting.
(9) Render pastoral care in a confinement facility.
(10) Design and implement unit ministry team training.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

489

c. Unique knowledge. Chaplains must remain up–to–date on Army organization, structure, and doctrine. Chaplains
must—
(1) Possess expert knowledge of distinctive faith groups in order to perform and provide for the religious needs of
the Army’s soldiers and families.
(2) Remain current on developments in the civilian religious community for possible application to their area of
expertise.
(3) Understand the elements of suicide awareness and prevention.
(4) Know the characteristics of healthily marriage and family relationships.
(5) Possess the knowledge of the dynamics of ethical decisionmaking.
(6) Assess the religious needs, prepare the commander’s master religious plan, implement and evaluate the commander’s religious program
d. Unique attributes. Chaplains must possess the highest standards of discretion, integrity, and professional ethics.
Chaplains will—
(1) Provide religious support in a religiously pluralistic setting.
(2) Ensure the free exercise of religion.
50–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
Chaplain professional development provides skills, knowledge, and experience enabling them to provide religious,
spiritual, and moral leadership and to perform staff officer functions in the Army. This is a comprehensive system that
assigns chaplains according to the needs of the Army, and identifies and provides the training required to prepare and
sustain chaplains for serving in these assignments.
a. Branch qualification. Upon completion of the Chaplain Officer Basic Course (CHOBC), chaplain officers are
eligible for worldwide deployment in their specialty. There are no by–grade standards for Active Army chaplains.
b. Chaplain Officer Education System (OES) and Branch development.
(1) Newly commissioned chaplain. The Chaplain Officer Basic Course, provides initial entry military training for
newly commissioned chaplains. CHOBC consists of 12– weeks of military training divided into 4 modules: Chaplain’s
Initial Military Training (CIMT), Phase I (Staff Officer Introduction), Phase II (Pastoral Care Training), and Phase III
(Ministry in a Combat Environment). Designed for First Lieutenants, CHOBC builds on the professional ministerial
knowledge and skills acquired in civilian institutions prior to commissioning as a chaplain. The CHOBC equips
chaplains with the knowledge and skills about the military necessary to perform their duties as staff officers and to
provide religious support at the battalion level. A non–combatant course, CHOBC trains chaplains how to conduct or
provide religious support in today’s multiethnic, multicultural, and pluralistic Army, across the full spectrum of
military operations.
(2) Captain. Chaplain CPTs are normally assigned to battalions. They may also serve as hospital chaplains,
confinement facility chaplains, and installation chaplain resource managers. Chaplains attend their branch CCC to
acquire professional development in the Officer Education System. CPTs selected for promotion are eligible to enroll
in the ILE course, which further prepares them to serve as staff officers at the brigade and division level of
competency. A select number of chaplain officers will be selected annually to attend Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE)
in order to prepare for ministry in the hospital setting. Chaplains become eligible once they are selected for Conditional
Voluntary Indefinite (CVI) status. A select number of Chaplain CPTs may be offered to participate in the Degree
Completion Program to prepare for specialized assignments.
(3) Major.
(a) Chaplain MAJs generally serve as brigade or group chaplains; assistant division chaplains; depot chaplains;
service school instructors (or staff); family life directors; hospital chaplains; installation and region chaplain resource
managers; installation chaplain training managers; and Corps staff action officers.
(b) All chaplain MAJs attend Intermediate Leader Education and complete the course within their first 2 years in
grade. Completion of ILE qualifies chaplain officers to serve in MEL 4 coded positions.
(c) Some chaplain MAJs will attend fully funded civilian schooling and CPE to prepare them for chaplain
assignments requiring additional skills.
(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Chaplain LTCs serve as division staff chaplains, HQDA , MACOM, and region staff action officers, installation
staff chaplains, CPE and family life supervisors, and hospital chaplains.
(b) A select number of chaplain LTCs and COLs will either attend Senior Service College in residence, or complete
it through the US Army War College Distance Education Program.
(5) Colonel. Chaplain COLs serve primarily as Corps and MACOM staff chaplains, CONUS Army staff chaplains,
Joint or unified command staff chaplains, installation staff chaplains, HQDA directors, region, and medical center staff
chaplains. Army Reserve chaplain COLs serve at the division and Regional Readiness Command levels. Army National
Guard chaplain COLs serve as Joint Force HQ (formerly known as STARC) chaplains. Reserve Component chaplains
of all grades (1LT through COL) may serve in positions similar to Active Army.

490

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

c. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Chaplain officers do not normally serve in branch/FA generalist
(formerly branch immaterial) assignments. These assignments will be made only as an exception to policy.
d. Joint assignments. Joint experience is important to the Army and valuable to the officers who serve in those
billets. Few chaplains will have the opportunity to serve in Joint billets, and it is not a requirement for advancement to
senior leadership.
50–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. The Chaplain Branch has diverse assignment opportunities, which allow for varied career development paths. The goal of the professional development of Chaplain Branch officers is to produce and sustain highly
qualified clergy and staff officers. Assignments in the Chaplain Branch, which meet the needs of the Army, will be
made to develop the chaplain’s ability to achieve that goal. Requests from officers for assignments that do not
contribute to achieving that goal will likely be rejected.
b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility on the
sequence of assignments. Some chaplain officer billets will be designated as requiring advanced education, either
military or civilian. Officers assigned to those jobs must complete the required courses prior to reporting to their duty
assignments.
c. Reserve Component. Reserve Component Assignments are managed on a volunteer and position vacancy basis
under the guidance of senior supervisory chaplains at all echelons.
50–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
Assignment duration. Most assignments for chaplain officers will be 24 to 36 months in length. Outside continental
United States locations will continue to require specific tour lengths.
50–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for chaplain officers.
b. Officer Personnel Management System III implementation. The number of authorized chaplain billets, by grade,
will vary as force structure decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more
information on Chaplain Branch authorizations or inventory are encouraged to contact the branch office.
50–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Chaplain Corps
a. Structure. Chaplain officers serve at all echelons worldwide.
b. Acquire. Direct commissioning is the primary means of accessioning chaplain officers.
c. Distribute. The Chief of Chaplains manages all chaplain officer personnel assignments.
d. Deploy. Chaplain Branch officers must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all
times. Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA organizations, all
Chaplain Corps officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. Chaplains may
deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests; or as individuals to
support Joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping missions. Chaplain
Corps officers must prepare themselves and their families for this most challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustain. Chaplain officers will compete within the Chaplain Corps for promotion to all grades.
f. Develop. Chaplain Branch incorporates a professional officer development career plan offering diversity for
schooling and assignment. As Chaplain officers progress through their careers, in addition to advanced military
schooling opportunities, they become eligible for additional civilian training, which prepares them for specialty
positions.
g. Separate. Chaplain officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
50–8. Chaplain Corps Reserve Component officers
The Chaplain Reserve Component officer is an integral part of the Army chaplaincy. The RC, the Army National
Guard, and the U. S. Army Reserve, provide one–half of the uniformed force structure in the Total Army Chaplaincy.
Branch qualifications and standards are the same for the ARNG and USAR chaplains as they are for the Active Army
chaplains.
a. General career development. Developmental patterns and objectives are the same for the RC with the following
exceptions:
(1) Chaplain candidates are RC officers of the Staff Specialist Branch with the 00A56 (Chaplain Candidate
Program) designation. Chaplain candidates are seminary students who are working to establish their academic and
ecclesiastical credentials, in order to seek an appointment as an Army chaplain. Their training parallels much of the
Chaplain Officer Basic Course, while providing ministry practicum experiences and unit training. These ministry
practicums include ministry at various installations, in Army medical centers, and in the disciplinary barracks.
Candidates can enter RC or Active Army chaplain assignments upon completing their academic and ecclesiastical
credentials and receiving an endorsement from their church bodies.

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

491

(2) The Chaplain Officer Basic Course for Reserve Chaplains is the same as the course provided Active Army
chaplains, except CHOBC Phase II instruction may be taken through a correspondence method for RC officers.
Reserve Component promotion to CPT requires completion of all phases of CHOBC.
(3) The Chaplain Officer Education System for RC chaplains following CHOBC is discussed in 50–3b.
b. Branch qualification and development opportunities. Even though RC officers are limited by geographical
considerations, they should strive for chaplain assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as their
Active Army counterparts.

Chapter 51
Army Medical Department
51–1. The Army Medical Department description
The Army Medical Department (AMEDD) is a special branch of the Army whose mission is to provide health services
for the Army and, as directed, for other agencies, organizations and military Services. Six separate officer corps or
branches provide the leadership and professional expertise necessary to accomplish the broad soldier support functions
implicit to the mission. Specific information on AMEDD officer professional and career development may be found in
detail in DA Pam 600–4.
51–2. Personnel management
The key to the distinctive personnel management system of the AMEDD is the 6 individual corps, each with a defined
mission; some with missions provided for by statute. The separate nature of the many disciplines that combine to make
the total health care delivery system dictates some diversity in approach to the management of the personnel within that
system. The AMEDD capitalizes upon the diversity of its Corps and is committed to developing and selecting the very
best qualified officers from its entire Corps for key leadership positions. The Surgeon General is responsible for
AMEDD officer career management within the general policies established by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G–1. The
director of personnel, the Office of The Surgeon General, and the commander, AHRC manage AMEDD officers with
the advice and assistance of the 6 AMEDD corps chiefs and professional consultants.

Section II
Terms
Area of concentration
Identifies a requirement and an officer possessing a requisite area of expertise (subdivision) within a branch or
functional area. An officer may possess and serve in more than one area of concentration.
Branch
A branch is a grouping of officers that comprises an arm or service of the Army in which, as a minimum, officers are
commissioned, assigned, developed and promoted through their company grade years. Officers are accessed into a
single basic branch and will hold that branch designation, which is later augmented between the 5th and 6th years of
service with a functional area. An accession branch admits officers upon commissioning; a nonaccession branch admits
experienced officers from the accession branches. With the exception of Special Forces, all other branches are
accession branches. Special Forces recruits officers with a minimum of 3 years experience (see chap 15 for further
discussion). Officers will serve their first 8 to 12 years developing the leadership and tactical skills associated with
their branch. They will continue to wear their branch insignia throughout their military service. All career branches are
in the Operations career field.
Branch/Functional Area Generalist position
An 01A or 02A-coded position that may be filled by any officer, regardless of branch or functional area designation.
This is an umbrella term used to collectively describe 2 subset categories defined as officer generalist and combat arms
generalist positions. (NOTE: Previously termed immaterial positions.)
Captains Career Course
This course is the second major branch school officers attend before company-level command. It combines the
instruction formerly taught in the branch Officer Advanced Course (OAC) and the Combined Arms and Services Staff
School (CAS3). The branch phase consists of 18-weeks of branch specific technical and tactical training with

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

527

integrated common core instruction. The 6-week TDY staff process phase at Fort Leavenworth prepares officers to
function as staff officers at battalion, brigade and division level.
career field
A specific grouping of functionally related officer, WO, enlisted and civilian positions into management categories
having a common mission area. career fields consist of officer branches and functional areas, WO and enlisted military
occupational specialties and civilian occupational series. There are 4 career fields: Operations, Information Operations,
Institutional Support and Operational Support. (The term career field in lower case is also a generic term commonly
used by military and civilian personnel when referring to their branch, functional area, MOS, or civilian occupational
series.)
career field Coordinators
The senior Army leaders responsible for the oversight of the branch and functional area proponents who collectively
comprise their career fields. career field Coordinators are responsible to integrate, consolidate and report professional
development, force structure and personnel policy issues to HQDA.
career field designation
The process whereby officers are assigned a career field. Immediately after selection for promotion to MAJ, a formal
career field Designation Board (CFDB) reviews an officer’s file. Designation is based on factors including officer
preference, rater and senior rater recommendations, education, training and unique skills or attributes.
Combat Arms Generalist position
A duty position requiring a broad understanding of combined arms doctrine, training and force structure. A combat
arms generalist position is not identified with one specific branch or functional area, but is limited to officers whose
branches are Infantry, Armor, Field Artillery, Air Defense Artillery, Aviation, Special Forces and Corps of Engineers;
and who are currently managed in the Operations career field. These positions are documented in TAADS with code
02A. (NOTE: Previously termed combat arms immaterial positions.)
Functional area
A functional area is a grouping of officers by technical specialty or skill, which usually requires significant education,
training and experience. An officer receives his or her functional area between the 5th and 6th years of service.
Individual preference, academic background, manner of performance, training and experience, and needs of the Army
are all considered during the designation process.
Officer Generalist position
A duty position requiring a broad understanding of Army leadership, doctrine, policy, force structure and management.
An officer generalist position is not identified with or limited to one specific branch or functional area, but indicates
that any officer may be assigned to the position. For example, both Armor branch officers in the Operations career
field and FA 45 Comptrollers in the Institutional Support career field are eligible to serve in officer generalist
positions. These positions are documented in The Army Authorization Documents System (TAADS) with code 01A.
(NOTE: Previously termed branch immaterial positions.)
Skill
Identifies a requirement and an officer possessing specialized skills to perform duties of a specific position that may
require significant education, training, and experience. A skill can be related to more than one branch or functional
area. An officer may have more than one skill.
Special branches
A grouping of branches and officers primarily concerned with providing combat service support and/or administration
to the Army as a whole but managed separately from combat service support branches. Special branches include Army
Medical Department, Chaplain Corps and The Judge Advocate General’s Corps.
Strategic Human Resource Management (SHRM)
A broader, more holistic perspective on personnel management that extends beyond the fundamental life cycle
functions. The SHRM focuses on the long–term vision of OPMS and links fundamental personnel management
decisions to the desired end state. SHRM links character and leader development, the new Officer Evaluation Reporting
System (DA Form 67–9) and the personnel life cycle management functions addressed in OPMS XXI. While the initial

528

DA PAM 600–3 • 28 December 2005

focus of SHRM is on officer personnel, SHRM will encompass the total force of officers, warrant officers, enlisted and
civilian personnel.
