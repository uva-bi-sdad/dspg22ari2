Part One
Philosophy and Management
Chapter 1
Introduction
1–1. Purpose
a. This pamphlet serves primarily as a professional development guide for all officers. It does not prescribe the path
of assignments or educational requirements that will guarantee success, but rather describes the full spectrum of
developmental opportunities an officer can expect for a successful career. This document also serves as a mentoring
tool for leaders at all levels and is an important personnel management guide for assignment officers, proponents, and
Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) selection board members. Its focus is the development and career
management of all officers of the United States Army. officer development for the future force should effectively
balance breadth and depth of experience. All assignments are important to sustain a trained and ready Army. The out
dated philosophy of "checking the block" in certain positions at every grade has encouraged officers to be more
concerned about holding the "right" jobs in order to achieve "branch qualification" than about the quality of the
experience gained in each job. The focus of every officer should be on bringing the Warrior Ethos to every job and
every facet of their development. Officers are charged with fighting and winning America’s wars. Regardless of branch
or functional area (FA), they use challenging assignments at all levels to help them hone through experience what they
have learned through their formal education about leading and training Soldiers. Operational factors (the constraints of
time, Army requirements, positions available, and readiness) all influence the amount of time an officer will need to
acquire appropriate leadership skills. Success will depend not on the number or type of positions held, but rather on the
quality of duty performance in every assignment. It is tied to individual contribution, and related to the individual
officer’s definition of success in the profession of arms. Previously accepted conventions regarding personnel management and “branch qualification” no longer apply. Not all officers will be afforded opportunities to perform all types of
duty. The types and extent of duties and assignments are articulated in the following chapters. For this publication, the
term "officers" encompasses warrant officers (WOs), company grade officers and field grade officers. A warrant officer
one (WO1) is commissioned upon promotion to chief warrant officer two (CW2). All officers are direct representatives
of the President of the United States. Chapters relating to officer education, general promotion policies, and officer
evaluation apply to all special branches as well. Specific policies applicable to the Judge Advocate General’s Corps,
the Chaplain Corps, and the U.S. Army Medical Department are found in chapters 39, 40, and 41, respectively. The
governing regulation for this pamphlet is AR 600–3 and AR 350–1.
b. Officers are encouraged to read all branch and FA chapters, regardless of branch FA, military occupational
specialty (MOS), or career field (CF) held, because unique and valuable lessons in Army culture and officer
professional development are found in every chapter.
c. This pamphlet documents the second revision since the officer Personnel Management System (OPMS) XXI
study of 1998 and Warrant officer Personnel Management Study (WOPMS) XXI of 2000, as well as recommendations
from the Army Training and Leader Development Panel studies from 2000 to 2003. It also incorporates the changing
philosophies of the Army leadership and is a continuation of the previous pamphlet rewrite. These comprehensive
efforts are essential because fundamental change is required for the Army officer Corps to lead forces in the early 21st
Century across the range of military operations. Current Army personnel management practices were shaped by both
OPMS XXI and WOPMS XXI efforts, and are now referred to simply as OPMS. OPMS enhances the warfighting
capability of the Army; provides all officers with a reasonable opportunity for success; and fulfills Army requirements
with an officer corps balanced with the right grades and skills. Although a WO personnel management system has been
in place since the 1970’s and was further defined by the Total Warrant officer Study (TWOS) of 1986, the subsequent
studies mentioned above reinforced the need for a development and career management system that provides for the
career development needs of the WO segment of the officer corps. The change to better integrate WOs into the officer
corps recommended in the comprehensive studies enhances the effectiveness and professionalism of the WO corps
through improvements in training, development, assignment, promotion, and retention practices.

1–4. Warrior Ethos and Army Values
Everything begins with the Warrior Ethos, which compels Soldiers to fight through all conditions to victory no matter
how much effort is required. It is the Soldiers selfless commitment to the nation, mission, unit, and fellow Soldiers. It
is the professional attitude that inspires every American Soldier. Warrior Ethos is grounded in refusal to accept failure.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

It is developed and sustained through discipline, commitment to Army Values, and pride in the Army’s heritage.
Warrior Ethos is the foundation for our total commitment to victory in peace and war. It is the conviction that military
Service is much more than just another job. It defines who officers are and what officers do. It is linked to our long
standing Army Values, and the determination to do what is right and do it with pride. Soldiers enter the Army with
their own values, developed in childhood and nurtured through experience. People are all shaped by what they have
seen, what they have learned, and whom they have met. But once Soldiers put on the uniform and take the oath, they
have opted to accept a Warrior Ethos and have promised to live by Army Values. Army Values form the very identity
of the Army. They are non-negotiable and apply to everyone at all times in all situations. The trust that Soldiers have
for one another and the trust the American people put in the Army demands that they live up to these values. These
values are interdependent; that is, they support one another. You cannot follow one value and ignore another. The
seven values that guide all leaders and the rest of the Army are loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity,
and personal courage. Leaders must believe in them, model them in personal actions, and teach others to accept them.
Officers require a demonstrated mastery of branch, FA, or MOS specific skills, and grounding in these seven values to
successfully lead Soldiers in the 21st Century. Officer leaders who adopt a Warrior Ethos and a Joint, expeditionary
mindset will be confident that they are organized, trained, and equipped to operate anywhere in the world, at any time,
in any environment, against any adversary to accomplish the assigned mission.
1–5. Leader development overview
a. Leader development is the means for growing competent, confident, self-aware leaders who are prepared for the
challenges of the future in combined arms Joint, interagency, inter-Governmental, and multinational (JIIM) operations.
Future force leaders must be multifunctional, capable of supporting the range of military operations within the JIIM
environment, comfortable with ambiguity, information systems literate, and capable of intuitive assessments of situations for rapid conceptualization of friendly courses of action. Through the leader development process, the Army
develops leaders with character and competence for today and tomorrow to be trainers, role models, and standard
bearers. Leader development through progressive, sequential, and continuous education and experience throughout
one’s career benefits the Army and the leader.
b. The Army’s leader development and education system trains, educates, and grows Army leaders that are the
centerpiece of a campaign quality Army with a Joint expeditionary mindset. Leader development is accomplished in
three domains; operational, institutional, and self-development.
c. In the operational domain, leader development is principally gained through firsthand combat and contingency
operational experience, from lessons learned, and from individual and collective training, assessment, and feedback;
from superiors, peers, and subordinates. Operational experience is the linchpin component of leader development from
which officers learn "what right looks like."
d. The institutional domain provides standards based training and education that develop Army leaders who are
grounded in an ideal of Service to the nation, instilled with a Warrior Ethos, have a common doctrinal foundation, are
self-aware, innovative, adaptive, and are capable of taking initiative and successfully operating as part of a Joint team
in the range of military operations within the contemporary operational environment. This domain provides training on
common Soldier tasks and selected critical tasks, and leverages education and information technologies to develop,
maintain, and distribute training and educational materials for individual Soldier and unit use. Institutional leader
development builds on leaders’ operational experiences and enables lifelong learning through resident and non-resident
schooling at Army, Joint, and civilian schools using live-virtual-constructive training as a foundation for experiential
learning.
e. Self-development is the third domain of leader development and an essential component of lifelong learning. Selfdevelopment is a goals-based, feedback driven program of activities and learning that contributes to professional
competence, organizational effectiveness, and professional development. Individual and organizational assessment and
feedback programs in the operational and institutional domains, linked to developmental actions, grow competent and
confident leaders, and result in trained and ready organizations and units. Developing Army leaders to meet the needs
of the Army and the nation requires agile and innovative leader development and education systems.
f. DA Pam 350–58 describes the Army’s approach to leader development. The Army G–3 is the proponent for DA
Pam 350–58 and is the single DA staff proponent for Army Training and Leader Development. As such, the G–3 is
responsible for approval and management of the Army Training and Leader Development Program. To accomplish this,
the G–3 conducts a Training and Leader Development General officer Steering Committee (TLGOSC) semiannually to
identify deficiencies and recommend improvements in training policy, strategy, and capabilities.
1–6. Mentoring, counseling, and coaching
a. Today’s leaders have the critical responsibility to develop future leaders who are prepared to meet tomorrow’s
challenges. An essential component of this development is mentoring. The term mentorship refers to the voluntary,
developmental relationship between a person of greater experience and a person of lesser experience that is characterized by mutual trust and respect.
b. Mentorship impacts both personal development (maturity, interpersonal and communication skills) as well as
professional development (technical and tactical knowledge and career path knowledge).

2

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

c. The goal of mentorship is to assist the lesser-experienced person in reaching his/her personal and professional
potential. It is critical to understand that mentorship is not any one behavior or set of behaviors, but rather includes all
of the leader development behaviors (that is, counseling, teaching, coaching, and role modeling) that are displayed by a
trusted advisor.
d. The strength of the mentorship relationship is the fact that it is based on mutual trust and respect. Assessment,
feedback and guidance accelerate the developmental process and enhance performance. When this occurs within a
mentoring relationship, even higher performance results.
e. Mentoring requires taking advantage of any opportunity to teach, counsel, or coach to build skills and confidence
in the mentored. Mentoring is not limited to formal sessions but can include every event from quarterly training briefs
to after-action reviews to casual, recreational activities.
f. One of the most important legacies that today’s senior leaders can leave on the Army is to mentor junior leaders
to fight and win future conflicts. Mentoring develops great leaders to lead great Soldiers.
1–7. Officer Personnel Management System overview
a. Historical perspective. Officer personnel management reviews and analysis have been on a continuum of
constructive change for many years. The officer Personnel Management System (OPMS) was instituted in 1972 as a
result of The U.S. Army War College (AWC) Study on Military Professionalism and a follow-on analysis directed by
the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel. Numerous changes in personnel management policy were incorporated into
OPMS between its implementation in 1975 and 1981. After passage of the Defense officer Personnel Management Act
(DOPMA) by Congress in 1981, the Chief of Staff, Army, ordered a major review to examine the impact of the
legislation on OPMS policies. As a result, OPMS II was developed in 1984 to accommodate the changes brought about
by DOPMA, including the creation of FAs, dual tracking and Active Army integration. These and other mostly
evolutionary proposals were implemented beginning in 1985. Two years later, the Chief of Staff, Army, directed a
review of officer leader development to account for the changes in law, policy, and procedures that had occurred since
the creation of OPMS II. As a result of the study, the Leader Development Action Plan was approved for implementation in 1989. Over 50 recommendations representing the latest revisions to the officer personnel system were
incorporated into OPMS. The Army has undergone significant changes with widespread affect on the officer personnel
system, brought about by the draw down at the end of the Cold War and by major legislative initiatives. The
Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, also known as the Department of Defense (DOD) Reorganization Act, required the
Services to improve interoperability and provided the statutory requirements for Joint duty assignments, Joint tour
credit, and Joint military education. In 1986, Congress also passed Public Law 99–145, which specified the acquisition
experiences and education necessary for an officer to be the project manager of a major weapons system. This law later
led to the creation in 1990 of the Army Acquisition Corps. The Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvements Act
(DAWIA) of 1990 placed additional requirements on Acquisition Corps officers and directed them to single track in
their FA. Congressional Title XI (1993) Legislation placed additional officer requirements on the Active Army in their
support of The Army National Guard and Army Reserve. The Reserve officer Personnel Management Act (ROPMA) in
1996 brought the RC officer promotion systems in synchronization with the Active Army. This legislation established a
best-qualified promotion system for RC officers, thereby replacing the fully qualified system previously used and
allowing full integration into OPMS. With an 8-year span since the last formal OPMS review, the Deputy Chief of
Staff, G–1 (DCS, G–1) assembled a team of senior field grade officers to examine a series of OPMS-specific issues
and determine whether a general review of the entire officer system was warranted. This OPMS XXI Precursor Study
Group, under the direction of CG, Army Human Resource Command (AHRC) ultimately reviewed more than 60
individual issues. Based on the collective body of these issues, the DCS, G–1 recommended to the Chief of Staff,
Army that a comprehensive review of the officer Personnel Management System was necessary. As a result, the OPMS
XXI Task Force convened in July 1996 to review and recommend changes to the officer personnel management
system. Consistent with the task of developing capabilities to meet the challenges of the next century, the Chief of
Staff, Army, instructed the task force to link their work with other ongoing Army planning efforts. In designing the
personnel system for the future, the Chief of Staff, Army, directed that the task force also create a conceptual
framework integrating OPMS with the Leader Development System, ongoing character development initiatives, and a
new officer evaluation report. The focus was to take the Army in a direction to meet its vision of the future instead of
simply solving individual problems. The task force concluded that OPMS should incorporate a holistic, strategic human
resource management (SHRM) approach to officer development and personnel management. In addition, the task force
called for the creation of an officer CF-based management system composed of four CFs; operations, operational
support, institutional support, and information operations. Under OPMS, officers are designated into a single CF after
selection for major and serve and compete for promotion in their designated CF from that point on in their career. The
results of these strategic recommendations, approved by the Chief of Staff, Army, in December 1997, formed the basis
for the changes to the OPMS.
b. Current perspective. The Army continues to transform, this transformation process is ongoing and continuous in
nature. The OPMS working group has been tasked by the Chief of Staff to continue to modernize the Army’s
assignment and professional management systems to meet the Army’s needs, now and as the Army transforms to the
future force.

c. Purpose. The purpose of OPMS is to enhance the effectiveness and professionalism of the officer corps. OPMS
encompasses all policies and procedures by which Army field grade, company grade, and WOs are trained, educated,
developed, assigned, evaluated, promoted, and separated from Active Duty. OPMS consists of personnel management
policies and procedures that assure a deployable, professional officer corps capable of meeting the challenges of the
future force as embodied in joint operations concepts.
d. Coordination. The personnel proponents provide guidelines concerning career patterns and leader development, as
listed in AR 600–3. The coordinating agency for officers on the Active Duty list (ADL) is the AHRC, Officer
Personnel Management Directorate (OPMD) (AHRC–OPB), 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria VA 22332–0411; for Army
National Guard officers, Chief, National Guard Bureau, HQDA (NGB–ARP–PO), 111 South George Mason Drive,
Arlington VA 22204–1382; and, for Army Reserve officers not on the ADL, AHRC (ARPC–OP), 1 Reserve Way St.
Louis, Missouri 63132–5200.
1–8. Warrant officer personnel management overview
a. Historical perspective. Personnel management of WOs is the product of a number of dynamic yet disparate
systems and events. This publication outlined utilization policies, criteria for selection of WO positions, and instructions for conversion to the current WO MOS system. However, the conception of a WOPMS can only be traced back
to 1966, when a study group was formed at the Department of the Army (DA)-level. The group’s mission was to
develop a formal Warrant officer Career Program, which would be responsive to future Army requirements while
concurrently offering sufficient career opportunities to attract high quality personnel. The study group examined all
aspects of the Warrant Officer Corps and made a number of recommendations in areas such as pay, promotion,
utilization, and education. As a result of these recommendations, actions were initiated to provide more attractive
career opportunities for WOs. A tri-level education system was established by the end of 1972 which provided formal
training at the basic or entry level for WOs in 59 occupational specialties, at the intermediate or mid-career level for 53
specialties, and at the advanced level for 27 specialties. By the close of 1975, the Army’s capability for professionally
developing the Warrant Officer Corps had been significantly expanded and WOs were being offered developmental
opportunities not available to their predecessors. In 1974, Warrant officer division was created at AHRC to provide
centralized career management for all but Judge Advocate General and U.S. Army Medical Department (AMEDD)
WOs. In the 1981 DOPMA, officer career management was codified, but DOPMA specifically excluded WOs. To fill
that void, the Chief of Staff, Army chartered a TWOS in 1984. TWOS introduced a number of substantial changes
including a new definition of the WO. TWOS also resulted in requirements-based position coding in authorization
documents and a training philosophy of "select, train, and utilize". The Warrant officer Management Act (WOMA) was
introduced in Congress shortly after the publication of TWOS, signed into law in December 1991 and is the current
basis for the management of WOs on the ADL. WOMA is the WO counterpart of DOPMA. It provided for
management of WOs by years of WO Service rather than total Service, automatic Active Army integration at the CW3
level, created the rank of CW5, permitted selective retention and retirement, and eliminated the dual promotion system.
In February 1992, the Chief of Staff of the Army approved the Warrant Officer Leader Development Action Plan
(WOLDAP). WOLDAP expanded upon the foundation of TWOS and WOMA and provided a blueprint for the leader
development of WOs in the Army of the future. The plan contained specific recommendations on issues dealing with
training, assignments, civil education, and other subjects for both active and reserve WOs. In 2000, the Chief of Staff
chartered the Army Training and Leader Development Panel (ATLDP) to conduct a series of studies to recommend
changes to leader development education for all segments of The Army. The Warrant Officer Study by this panel
developed a further revision of the TWOS definition of WOs for the future force as:
“The warrant officer of the Future Force is a self aware and adaptive technical expert, combat leader, trainer, and
advisor. Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the WO administers,
manages, maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment across the full range of Army
operations. Warrant officers are innovative integrators of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident
warfighters, and developers of specialized teams of Soldiers. They support a wide range of Army missions
throughout their careers."
This new definition is relevant today and will remain so for the future force. The WO specific component of OPMS
features—
(1) A structure that optimizes WO utilization and provides sustainable inventories.
(2) An acquisition program to access quality candidates in sufficient numbers, with appropriate requisite background
and skills, and at the appropriate time in the candidates’ careers.
(3) A clearly defined WO personnel policies and professional development requirements.
(4) A means to maintain WOs’ technical expertise on current and new systems in their units.
(5) A distribution of the right WO to the right place at the right time. Building on the long history of WO Service to
the country, the WO component of OPMS provides the mechanisms for professional development and appropriate
personnel management for WOs throughout their careers.
b. Current perspective. The current perspective has not changed significantly from the previous pamphlet.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

c. Purpose. The purpose of the WO component of OPMS is to enhance the effectiveness and professionalism of the
WO corps while thoroughly integrating management practices and leader development education within the larger field
and company grade officer corps. OPMS encompasses all policies and procedures by which Army WOs are procured,
trained, educated, developed, assigned, evaluated, promoted and separated from Active Duty. OPMS assures a deployable, professional WO corps capable of meeting the challenges of the future force.
d. Coordination. The personnel proponents provide guidelines concerning career patterns and leader development.
The coordinating agency for the Active Army WOs is the AHRC, OPMD (AHRC–LOPW), 200 Stovall Street,
Alexandria VA 22332–0411; for Army National Guard WOs, Chief, National Guard Bureau, HQDA (NGB–ARH),
1411 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington VA 22202–3231; and, for Reserve WOs, AHRC (ARPC–OPS–WO), 1
Reserve Way, St. Louis, Missouri 63132–5200.
1–9. Force stabilization and career development
a. General. The goal of the Army Force Stabilization System is to provide increased levels of readiness and combat
effectiveness for Army units by implementing an array of turbulence-reducing staffing methods. Implementation will
reduce moves, increase the period of stabilization for Soldiers and provide predictability for Soldiers and Families.
Furthermore, stabilization provides the basis for synchronizing Soldier assignments to unit operational cycles. As force
stabilization is implemented, it is critical that life cycle managed/cyclic managed units be staffed with Soldiers who
train and remain together so that they can deploy and meet operational requirements with minimal added preparation.
b. Strategies. The force stabilization process will be based on two primary manning strategies; unit focused stability
(UFS) (including life cycle and cyclic methods) and stabilization (includes individual replacement system). The
individual replacement system will continue to exist, to some extent, to meet Army transformation personnel goals, and
retain flexibility and sustainability for units with a constant mission requirement.
(1) UFS. This consists of two stabilization methods; life cycle and cyclic. Cyclic management is a combination of
the advantages of the individual replacement system and life cycle management.
(2) Life cycle management. Units will initiate life cycle management as designated by Army G–3 implementation
time line. Life cycle manning synchronizes Soldier assignments with the unit’s operational cycle. Goals of this
manning method are to build better-trained and cohesive units and to maximize a unit’s readiness and deployability
during its ready phase. Total optimal cycle length is 36 months.
(a) There are three phases in a life cycle; reset/train, ready, and available. The reset phase is the conclusion of the
current life cycle and initiation of a subsequent iteration. It will last approximately 2 months. During the reset/train
phase incoming and outgoing personnel simultaneously conduct transition activities (HHG, CIF, in/out process,
property and equipment transfer, and so on). The ready force phase consists of units assessed as “ready” at designated
capability levels (from training and readiness “gates”) to conduct mission preparation and higher level collective
training with other operational headquarters. They are eligible for sourcing and can be trained, equipped, resourced, and
committed, if necessary, to meet operational (surge) requirements. The available phase consists of units assessed as
“available” at designated capability levels (from training and readiness “gates”) to conduct mission execution under any
regional combatant commander (RCC). Life cycle management units pass through the available force pool window of
time (one year). The unit is deployed against an operational requirement or available for immediate deployment against
a contingency requirement.
1. Officers assigned to a life cycle management unit will be synchronized to arrive during the reset phase of the unit
operational cycle. For the remainder of the unit’s operational cycle, officers will remain in the unit, training and
preparing for war, deployment, or any expeditionary requirement. The unit commander is responsible for repositioning
officers to appropriate leadership positions, as required.
2. In life cycle units, most losses are replaced in an annual replacement package. Critical losses are replaced using
individual replacements in a specific grade and MOS to cover the loss of personnel in unique positions limited to 10
percent of the authorizations.
3. Promotions will not automatically alter positions. For example, there is nothing inherently wrong with a captain
who performs as a company executive officer (XO). If promotion causes the officer to be excess to authorized
positions of the unit, the officer will remain in the assignment until the conclusion of the unit life cycle. Such action
will not be considered negatively when determining the officer’s future potential for promotion. The unit commander
may reassign the officer anywhere inside the unit to best accomplish the unit’s missions.
4. Junior officers who are branch detailed and assigned to a life cycle managed unit are not eligible to transition to
their controlling branch or attend the transition course until the reset phase of that unit.
(b) Battalion/brigade command tour length will coincide with the length of assignment in life cycle managed units.
(c) Officer attendance at military leader development courses is preferred to occur during the reset phase. Commanders may send officers to these courses in a TDY and return status during the ready phase when it does not conflict
with operational requirements.
c. Cyclic management. Cyclic management is focused on headquarters elements above brigade level and low
density/high impact units where continuity of operations is paramount. The goals of cyclic management are to
synchronize the Soldier’s assignment to the operational cycle of the unit increasing unit readiness and enhancing

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

5

cohesion while retaining flexibility in personnel management. Cyclic management consists of two phases, a sustain
phase and a ready phase. During the 1-2 month duration of the sustain phase, leader and Soldier assignments are
organized into personnel replacement packages synchronized to arrive within this short phase. The ready phase begins
at the end of one sustain phase and continues approximately 10 months to the beginning of the subsequent sustain
phase. New personnel are rapidly integrated into the team as this integration only occurs once per cycle. Total cycle
optimum length is 12 months.
(1) Officers assigned to a cyclic managed unit are synchronized to arrive at the beginning of the sustain phase of the
unit operational cycle. Each officer assigned to this unit remains in the unit for their stabilized tour which is a multiple
of the cycle lengths. Officers will depart during the sustain phase at completion of their 36 month tour but prior to the
unit preparing for its next ready phase. In a cyclic managed unit, losses are replaced using individual replacements in a
specific grade and MOS to replace the loss of personnel in critical positions. Promotion eligibility windows will be
considered in assignments to cyclic managed units. If promotion timing causes officers to be excess to the authorized
positions of the unit, the officer will remain in the unit until the next sustain phase. Officers will not be penalized for
working temporarily in a position below their current rank. Movement of personnel within the cyclic managed unit is at
the discretion of the unit commander.
(2) Junior officers who are branch detailed and assigned to a cyclic managed unit are not eligible to transition to
their controlling branch or attend the transition course until the sustain phase of that unit.
(3) Battalion/brigade command tour length policy does not require adjustment for cyclic managed units. Changes of
command will be synchronized to occur during a sustain phase.
(4) Officer attendance at military professional development courses is preferred during the sustain phase. Commanders may send officers to these courses in a TDY and return at anytime except during an operational deployment.
d. Stabilization. The stabilization strategy is a set of policy and regulatory constraints, overlaid on the existing
personnel system, that provide for longer initial tours at selected major continental United States (CONUS) locations.
The goal is to stabilize Soldiers and Families for as long as possible, moving them only to support requirements based
upon needs of the Army, leader development, and Soldier preference. Stabilization through company level assignments
would optimize cohesion within the units. For commissioned officers stabilization must be balanced with the need to
broaden their developmental experience. For example, when captains complete professional development courses, such
as the Captain’s Career Course (CCC), they should be assigned to a brigade combat team (BCT) other than the type
they previously served in. If the officer served in a heavy BCT as a lieutenant, it is important that the officer serve in
either a Stryker or Light BCT or training brigade. This very often means the officer will be assigned to a different
location than where the officer served at as a lieutenant.
(1) Stabilization will initially begin at CONUS installations which house table of organization and equipment (TOE)
maneuver combat brigades. Expansion to other installations will be based on those installation’s capabilities to sustain
junior officers for a complete extended initial tour. A majority of the junior officers initially assigned to a CONUS
installation will be stabilized at this first installation for an extended period of time that allows for branch development
at the rank of captain. This initial extended tour may include hardship tours or attendance at leader development
schools (TDY or permanent change of station (PCS)), but in each case the officer will return to their stabilization
installation. Filling life cycle units may require officers to attend leader development schools and PCS to a different
installation.
(2) The length of battalion/brigade command tours is under review.
(3) The commander, in consultation with AHRC, will have greater influence over procedures in selection and
attendance for officer personnel at military schools. However, officers will not normally attend military schools under
conditions that will permanently remove them from their stabilization unit prior to branch development assignments as
a captain.
(4) Stabilization supports transition to UFS and will generally be established first. A unit designated for management under either concept of UFS will still fall under the stabilization of the parent installation.
e. Manning. The Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) system sets conditions for commanders to teams that are
ready to meet the Combatant Commander’s needs, build highly cohesive combat teams for the combatant commander’s
use. ARFORGEN is a readiness initiative and not a personnel stabilization initiative. While it is true that Soldier will
have more predictability with ARFORGEN, it is not a means to stabilize the force. It is a readiness issue to ensure the
U.S. Army has trained and ready forces to provide the combatant commander.
1–10. Officer Evaluation System overview
The Officer Evaluation Reporting System (OERS) is a subsystem of officer evaluations. The primary function of OERS
is to provide information from the organizational chain of command to be used by HQDA for officer personnel
decisions. This critical information is documented on the DA Form 67–9 (Officer Evaluation Report) (OER)) and the
DA Form 1059 (Service School Academic Evaluation Report) (AER)). The information contained on these evaluation
reports is correlated with the Army’s needs and individual officer qualifications to provide the basis for officer
personnel actions such as promotion, CF designation, retention in grade, elimination, retention on Active Duty,
reduction in force, command and project manager designation, school selection, and assignment. An equally important

6

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

function of OERS is to encourage the professional development of the officer corps through structured performance
and developmental assessment and counseling. The OERS is an important tool for leaders and mentors to counsel
officers on the values, attributes, skills, and actions necessary to improve performance.

Chapter 2
Officer Leader Development
2–1. Leader development process
The three domains of leader development are institutional training, operational assignments, and self-development.
These domains define and engage a continuous cycle of education, training, selection, experience, assessment, feedback, reinforcement, and evaluation. Learning, experience, and feedback provide the basis for professional growth.
Overall, the leader development process enhances leader capabilities so leaders can assume positions of greater
responsibility. The over-arching priority of the leader development process is to develop self-aware and adaptive
leaders of character and competence who act to achieve decisive results and who understand and are able to exploit the
full potential of current and future Army doctrine.
2–2. Domains of leader development
a. Institutional training. The institutional Army (schools and training centers) is the foundation for lifelong learning.
During institutional training, leaders learn the knowledge, skills and attributes essential to high-quality leadership while
training to perform critical tasks. When these leadership dimensions are tested, reinforced, and strengthened by followon operational assignments and meaningful self-development programs, leaders attain and sustain true competency in
the profession of arms. Institutional training provides the solid foundation upon which all future development rests.
Institutional training supports the progressive, sequential education and training required to develop branch/FA technical and tactical competencies as well as the core dimensions of leadership. The bedrock of institutional training at all
levels among company grade, field grade, and WOs is taught in the small group instructional (SGI) format where
greater emphasis is placed on an individual student officer’s contribution to and participation in the learning process.
b. Operational assignments. Operational assignments constitute the second domain of leader development. Upon
completion of institutional training, leaders are ideally assigned to operational positions. This operational experience
provides them the opportunity to use, hone, and build on what they learned through the formal education process.
Experience gained through on-the-job training in a variety of challenging assignments and additional duties prepares
officers to lead and train Soldiers, both in garrison and ultimately in combat. The commander or leader in the unit
plays a significant and instrumental role in this area. Commanders and other senior leaders are particularly responsible
for mentoring which is vital to the development of junior officers. They introduce the officer to their unit and establish
leader development programs. They explain both unit and individual performance standards and provide periodic
assessments and continual feedback to develop the officer. Beyond accomplishing the mission on a daily basis,
developing subordinate leaders is a professional responsibility, which must be carried out to guarantee the quality of
our future leaders.
c. Self-development. Learning is a lifelong process. Institutional training and operational assignments alone do not
ensure that Army officers attain and sustain the degree of competency needed to perform their varied missions. The
profession of arms requires comprehensive self-study and training. Leaders must commit to a lifetime of professional
and personal growth to stay at the cutting edge of their profession. They must keep pace with changing operational
requirements, new technologies, common weapons platforms, and evolving doctrines. Every officer is responsible for
his or her own self-development. Self-assessment and taking appropriate remedial or reinforcing action is critical to a
leader’s success. Self-development programs include activities that stretch the individual beyond the demands of onthe-job or institutional training. Self-development, consisting of individual study, research, professional reading,
practice, and self-assessment, is accomplished via numerous means (that is, studying, observing, and experiencing) and
is consistent with an officer’s personal self-development action plan and professional goals. Self-development is the
key aspect of individual officer qualification that solidifies the Army leader development process.
2–3. Leader principles
a. Six principles are inherent in officer development and career management. These principles serve as a frame of
reference for the individual officer, commander, mentor, and branch and FA proponents.
b. Leader development is doctrinally based with FM 1–0 providing the foundation for warfighting doctrine. It
articulates the constitutional and legal basis for being, the national security objectives, the spectrum of warfare, and the
beliefs concerning the profession of arms, to include the professional Army ethic and values. FM 3–0 is the keystone
warfighting doctrine for subordinate and tactical level doctrine, professional education, and individual and unit training.
FM 7–0 is about how to train, including the senior leader’s role. FM 6–22 outlines the core dimensions of leadership
and the basis for leadership excellence. Together, these references provide the foundation needed to develop competent,

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

7

confident leaders capable of assuming positions of greater responsibility, and create the conditions for sustained
organizational success.
c. Leader development programs should be responsive to the environment, including such factors as law, policy,
resources, force structure, world situation, technology, and professional development.
d. An officer’s success should be measured in terms of contribution. An officer’s professional goals are directly
related to his or her own definition of success in the profession of arms.
e. High-quality Soldiers deserve high-quality leaders. This principle is the heart of leader development and breathes
life into all aspects of the seven Army fundamental imperatives; training, force mix, doctrine, modern equipment,
quality people, leader development, and facilities.
f. We recognize as a philosophy that leaders can be developed. While a principle in itself, it is inextricably linked to
the philosophy of shared responsibilities among the individual leaders; the schoolhouses, branches, and FA proponents
throughout the Army; and the commanders in the field.
g. Leader development is cooperative and holistic. The individual officer, unit commanders, mentors, and Army
educational institutions all share in the responsibility for developing leaders at every level.
2–4. Leader development and the Officer Education System
a. Company and field grade officers. The Officer Education System (OES) provides the formal military educational
foundation to company and field grade officers for increased responsibilities and successful performance at the next
higher level. Its goal is to produce a broad-based corps of leaders who possess the necessary values, attributes, and
skills to perform their duties and serve the nation. These leaders must know how the Army runs and demonstrate
confidence, integrity, critical judgment, and responsibility while operating in an environment of complexity, ambiguity,
and rapid change. To build effective teams capable of supporting Joint and multinational operations in this environment, they must be adaptable, creative, and bold amid continuous organizational and technological change. The
evolution of OES for the future force and changes on the near horizon are discussed in chapter 4. The following
paragraphs highlight key aspects of officer development:
(1) Common core. Common core is the consolidation of common skills training and training subjects prescribed by
law, Army regulations or other higher authority. These subjects comprise the tasks all officers are expected to perform
successfully, regardless of branch. Common core instruction begins at pre-commissioning and continues at each
educational level. The instruction is progressive and sequential, building upon the skills and knowledge acquired
through previous training and operational assignments.
(2) Entry level officer training. To address shortcomings identified by the ATLDP (Officer) study, the Army
implemented Basic officer Leader Course (BOLC). The objective of BOLC is to develop technically competent and
confident platoon leaders, regardless of branch, who are grounded in leadership and basic technical and tactical skill
proficiency, are physically and mentally strong, and embody the Warrior Ethos. To achieve this objective, BOLC
capitalizes on experience-based training, logically structured to build upon and reinforce previous lessons. BOLC
occurs in three phases. BOLC I is pre-commissioning training conducted by the traditional pre-commissioning sources.
It provides the foundation of common core skills, knowledge, and attributes desired of all newly commissioned
lieutenants. BOLC II is a common block of instruction designed to further develop all new Army lieutenants into
competent small unit leaders with a common warfighting focus and Warrior Ethos. BOLC III consists of branchspecific technical and tactical training conducted at branch school locations. BOLC–DCO is a course designed to give
direct commission officers, who do not have the benefit of BOLC I pre-commissioning training, the necessary skills to
achieve success at BOLC II. See chapter 4, paragraph 4–7a for further discussion on BOLC.
(3) Captains’ OES. The branch CCC prepares company grade officers to command Soldiers at the company, troop,
or battery level and to serve as staff officers at battalion and brigade levels. Active Army officers incur a one-year
Active Duty Service obligation for attendance at a branch CCC upon completion or termination of the course. Officers
attend CCC following selection for promotion to the grade of captain, normally before company level command. Select
captains who have demonstrated superior performance in their basic branches may be selected to receive this training at
other than their branch schools. (For example, a Field Artillery officer might attend the CCC for Armor officers.) This
cross training benefits officers of both branches. Officers seeking accession into Special Forces will normally attend the
infantry CCC. The captains Professional Military Education (PME) centers on the technical, tactical and leadership
competencies needed for success in follow-on assignments. See chapter 4, paragraph 4–7d for further discussion on
CCC.
(4) Intermediate level education (ILE). ILE is the Army’s formal education program for majors. It is a tailored
resident education program designed to prepare new field-grade officers for their next 10 years of Service. It produces
field-grade officers with a Warrior Ethos and Joint, expeditionary mindset, who are grounded in warfighting doctrine,
and who have the technical, tactical, and leadership competencies to be successful at more senior levels in their
respective branch or FA. ILE consists of a common core phase of operational instruction offered to all officers and
tailored education phase (qualification course) tied to the technical requirements of the officer’s branch or FA. See
chapter 4, paragraph 4–7e for further discussion of ILE.

8

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(5) Senior Service College (SSC). The SSC provides senior level professional military education and leader development training. The Army’s SSC, the AWC, prepares military, civilian, and international leaders to assume strategic
leadership responsibilities in military or national security organizations. It educates students about employment of the
U.S. Army as part of a unified, Joint, or multinational force in support of the national military strategy; researches
operational and strategic issues; and conducts outreach programs that benefit the nation. See chapter 4, paragraph 4–7f
for further discussion of SSC.
b. WOs.
(1) The ATLDP Warrant Officer Study recommended that the Army make a fuller integration of WOs into the
larger officer corps. In recognition of expanding leadership roles for WOs in the future force, the study called for a
single world-class leader development education system that would have distinct components for WO, company-grade,
and field-grade officers. The study also called for combining WO, company grade and field grade officer training, as
appropriate, wherever required common officer skills are taught.
(2) The goal of WO training and education within OES is to produce highly specialized expert officers, leaders, and
trainers who are fully competent in technical, tactical, and leadership skills; creative problem solvers able to function in
highly complex and dynamic environments and proficient operators, maintainers, administrators, and managers of the
Army’s equipment, support activities, and technical systems. Warrant officer leader development is a continuous
lifelong learning process beginning with pre-appointment training and education. OES prepares WOs to successfully
perform in increasing levels of responsibility throughout an entire career. OES provides the pre-appointment, branch
MOS-specific, and leader development training needed to produce technically and tactically competent WO leaders for
assignment to platoon, detachment, company, battalion, and higher-level organizations.
(3) Common core is the consolidation of common skills training and training prescribed by law, Army regulations,
or other higher authority. It comprises the tasks all officers are expected to perform successfully regardless of branch.
Common core instruction begins at pre-appointment and continues at each educational level. The instruction is
progressive and sequential and builds upon the skills and knowledge acquired through previous training and operational
assignments
(4) Pre-appointment training qualifies individuals to serve as officers. The purposes of pre-appointment training are
to educate and train candidates, assess their readiness and potential for appointment to WO, and to prepare them for
progressive and continuing development. All Active Army and USAR WO candidates must attend the resident Warrant
officer Candidate School (WOCS) at Fort Rucker, AL. ARNG WO candidates can attend various states’ two-phased
WOCS at Regional Training Institutes (RTIs) in lieu of WOCS at Fort Rucker. WOCS graduates are appointed to
WO1. The appointment is contingent upon certification by the MOS proponent that the WO is technically and tactically
qualified to serve in the authorized WO MOS.
(5) Warrant officer Basic Course (WOBC) is a branch-specific qualification course that ensure newly appointed
WOs receive the MOS-specific training and technical certification needed to perform in the MOS at the platoon
through brigade levels. Training is performance oriented and focuses on technical skills, leadership, effective communication, unit training, maintenance operations, security, property accountability, tactics, and development of
subordinates.
(6) Warrant officer Advanced Course (WOAC) is a combination of common core and MOS proponent training that
prepares the officer to serve in senior positions at the CW3 level. The WOAC includes two phases: a non-resident
common core module and a resident phase, which includes a common core module and MOS specific module. See
chapter 4, paragraph 4–7i for further discussion of WOAC.
(7) Warrant officer Staff Course (WOSC) is a branch-immaterial resident course which focuses on staff officer and
leadership skills needed to prepare them for duty in W4 grade technician and staff officer positions at battalion and
higher levels. Instruction includes decisionmaking, staff roles and functions, organizational theory, structure of the
Army, budget formation and execution, communication, training management, personnel management, the contemporary operational environment (COE), and special leadership issues. It is designed to produce officers with a Warrior
Ethos who are grounded in warfighting doctrine and possess the technical, tactical, and leadership competencies to be
successful at more senior levels. See chapter 4, paragraph 4–7i for further discussion of WOSC.
(8) Warrant officer Senior Staff Course (WOSSC) is currently the capstone course for WO professional military
education. It is a branch-immaterial resident course which provides master-level professional WOs with a broader
Army level perspective required for assignment to WO5 grade level positions as technical, functional, and branch
systems integrators, trainers, and leaders at the highest organizational levels. See chapter 4, paragraph 4–7i for further
discussion of WOSSC.

Chapter 3
Officer Personnel Management System and Career Management
3–1. Purpose
The OPMS is executed by the AHRC OPMD. The purpose of OPMS is to—
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

9

a. Acquire. Identify, recruit, select, and prepare individuals for Service as officers in our Army.
b. Develop. Maximize officer performance and potential through training, education, assignment, self-development,
and certification of officers to build multi-skilled leaders.
c. Utilize. Assign officers with the appropriate skills, experience, and competencies to meet Army requirements and
promote continued professional development.
d. Sustain. Retaining officers with the appropriate skills, experience, competencies, and manner of performance to
meet Army requirements and promote continued professional development.
e. Promote. Identify and advance officers with the appropriate skills, experience, competencies, manner of performance, and demonstrated potential to meet Army requirements.
f. Transition. Separate officers from the Army in a manner that promotes a lifetime of support to the Service.
3–2. Factors affecting the Officer Personnel Management System
Various factors continuously influence the environment in which OPMS operates. In turn, changes in that environment
necessitate continuous adjustments and alterations of policy by the DCS, G–1. Factors that influence OPMS policy
are—
a. Law. Congress passes legislation that impacts on officer professional development through required changes in
related Army policy.
(1) The DOPMA created Active Duty strength limits for officers in grades above chief WO, promotion flow and
timing points and the integration of Active Army and other than Active Army into common patterns.
(2) The DOD Reorganization Act of 1986 (Goldwater-Nichols Act) instituted Joint officer management provisions
requiring a number of officers in the Army to serve in Joint duty assignments as field grade officers.
(3) Public Law 99–145 specified the acquisition experiences and education necessary for an officer to be the project
manager of major weapon systems. This law later led to the creation of the Army Acquisition Corps.
(4) WO professional development is influenced directly by laws limiting the size of the Army and budgetary
concerns. The 1986 law also aligned Army WOs to those of the other services in that all appointments to chief WO
(WO2 through WO5) would be by commissioning. In 1991, the WOMA created a uniform system for WO grade
management and control similar to the one used to manage company and field grade officers (DOPMA).
(5) The 1995 Defense Authorization Act included the ROPMA to align reserve forces with DOPMA. It was
intended to standardize personnel management for reserve officers of all services by providing flexibility in personnel
management for reserve officers.
b. Policy. New laws often create changes in policy. The provisions of this document are in accordance with current
law and policy. Changes to those laws and policies will affect future versions of this document.
c. Budget. The size and composition of the officer corps, accessions, strength management, promotion rates and pinon-points, schooling, education programs, and PCS timing are but a few areas affected by budget decisions and
subsequent policies.
d. Army vision. The Army vision includes the overarching concept of growing adaptive leaders, focused on the idea
of the pentathlete; multi-skilled with multiple attributes. Multi-skilled leaders must be—
(1) Strategic and creative thinkers.
(2) Builders of leaders and teams.
(3) Competent full spectrum warfighters or accomplished professionals who support the Soldier and the warfighting
effort.
(4) Effective in managing, leading, and changing organizations.
(5) Skilled in governance, statesmanship, and diplomacy.
(6) Knowledgeable in cultural context with the ability to work across it.
e. Proponent strategy. The duties of the proponent (as outlined in AR 600–3) are executed, in part, by the
publication of this pamphlet. Each proponent has responsibility for designated branches and/or FAs and coordinating
the development for its officer population. Proponents project future requirements for officer skills and sustain or
modify elements of force structure and inventory to meet future needs. They define the three domains of leader
development: institutional, operational, and self-development balanced between the specific requirements for their
particular skill and specialty and the broader developmental requirements defined by the respective functional category
proponents and the Army. Proponents articulate competencies required for specific branches, FAs or area of concentration (AOC)/MOS by grade and provide general guidance on TOE/table of distribution and allowance (TDA) positions,
educational and training opportunities that enable development of those competencies. The resulting generic patterns of
officer development are embodied in branch and FA officer development models. Development models provided in this
pamphlet are used by OPMD assignment branches to execute the proponent professional development programs, but
are not intended as prescriptions for a path to success in the Army. As proponents modify officer skill requirements or
development models to meet changing conditions, OPMS, and this pamphlet will be modified.

10

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

f. Officer needs. OPMS responds to the mission and requirements of the Army and attempts to balance force
structure requirements, officer professional development, and individual needs and preferences of the officer.
3–3. Officer Personnel Management System
a. The OPMS is an evolutionary system that balances the needs of the Army with the aspirations and developmental
requirements of the entire officer corps; warrant, company, and field grade. Inherently flexible, the system is designed
to respond to a variety of doctrinal, proponent, commander, and individual initiatives to meet emerging needs.
Additionally, a biannual review process monitored by the Chief of Staff, Army ensures that OPMS continues to adapt
to changing Army requirements. Flexibility is embedded in OPMS subsystems, which are interrelated and affected by
each other’s changes (see fig 3–1). These subsystems are—
(1) Strength management. The number of officers, by grade and specialty, are defined by Army requirements, law,
budget, and policy. The combination of these factors results in the determination of the numbers of officers to access,
promote, develop, assign, and separate. Since each of these factors is dynamic, the number, grade, and branch of
officers within the inventory are also dynamic. As Army requirements for force structure change, the officer inventory
will also change and be realigned to meet the needs of the resulting force structure.
(2) Assignments. Officers are assigned to fulfill current and future Army requirements while meeting the professional development needs of the various branches, FAs, and functional categories. This is balanced with the best
interests of the officers against the Army requirements.
(3) Professional development. Each branch, FA, or officer skill proponent defines the appropriate mix of education,
training, and assignments needed by the officer corps at each grade level within the context of the overarching
requirement to develop multi-skilled leaders. The demands of each specialty balanced with broadening opportunities
are reflected in subsequent branch or proponent chapters as life cycle development models. AHRC must develop each
officer, both Active Army and RCs, by using these models while balancing Army requirements. To ensure the
professional development of all officers, AHRC operates in concert with various responsible agents to include the
individual officer; the personnel proponents; commanders in the field and the senior Army leadership. Officer
professional development is a responsibility shared by all. Life cycle development models portray the full range of
training, education, and experiences for the development of our future leaders.
(4) Evaluation. The Army officer structure is pyramidal. The apex contains very few senior grades in relation to the
wider base. Advancement to increasingly responsible positions is based on relative measures of performance and
potential. The mechanism to judge the value of an individual’s performance and potential is the OER described in
detail in chapter 6. All OPMS subsystems are affected by the evaluation report. Promotion, school selection, functional
designation and command and key billet selection, retention in Service, and development opportunities are all based on
the information contained in the OER.
(5) Centralized selection. The hub around which all the subsystems revolve is centralized selection. Strength
management, professional development and evaluation of individual contribution occur in the series of centralized DA
and AHRC selection boards for retention, career status, schooling, promotion, field grade command designation, and
selective early retirement. These boards employ evaluation reports, competency guidance, and strength requirements to
advance individuals to the next stage of professional development. Officers generally flow through the centralized
selection subsystem by groupings based on date of rank (DOR). Company and field grade officer groupings are termed
cohort year groups. WO groupings are called the inclusive zone of eligibility. Each board is preceded by a zone
announcement that specifies the makeup of the cohort or inclusive zone. Centralized selection perpetuates the ideals,
cultural values, ethics, and professional standards of the Army by advancing and retaining only those individuals best
qualified to assume positions of greater responsibility. Centralized selection has evolved over time to account for the
impact of law, policy, budget, Army and officer needs, and proponent vision.
(6) Review process. The officer personnel management system was designed to be reviewed periodically. At the
discretion of the Chief of Staff of the Army, the DCS, G–1 and the Commander, AHRC, will conduct a review of
OPMS to determine the health of the system and to recommend changes.
b. The OPMS model is a developmental system focused more on the quality and range of experience, rather than the
specific gates or assignments required to progress.
(1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a Warrior Ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
(2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
(3) Functional designation at the 4th or 7th year develops both specific and broad functional competencies.
(4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation it is then that they should strive to get training and
assignments that will give them the additional skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These training and
assignments are outside one’s normal career path and are JIIM in nature.
(5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both Joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expeditionary force - regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so on.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

11

(6) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
(7) The functionally aligned design is the heart of OPMS and is intended to align branches and FAs, consistent with
Joint doctrine, focusing on development of multi-skilled leaders with broader, functionally relevant competencies.
(8) Officers will be managed by categories and groups with similar functions to facilitate the development of officer
functional competencies required on the future battlefield. The design is not intended to reflect where officers serve on
the battlefield, but to align the functions and skills required. The three functional categories and associated functional
groups are—
(a) Maneuver, fires & effects (MF&E). This functional category gathers maneuver branches and FAs that have
similar battlefield application or complementary roles. This grouping is comprised of the following functional groups,
with the branches and FAs listed:
1. Maneuver. Armor (19), Infantry (11), and Aviation (15).
2. Fires. Field Artillery (13) and Air Defense Artillery (14).
3. Maneuver support. Engineer (21), Chemical (74), and Military police (31).
4. Special operations forces (SOF). Special Forces (18), Psychological Operations (37) and Civil Affairs (38).
5. Effects. Public Affairs (46) and Information Operations (30).
(b) Operations support. This functional category gathers two currently existing branches, Military Intelligence and
Signal, with FAs that have similar battlefield applications or complementary roles. Also included in this functional
category are the functions associated with force training, development, and education that design, build, and train the
force. The category is comprised of the following:
1. Network & Space Operations. Signal Corps (25), Information Systems Management (53), Telecommunication
Systems Engineer (24), and Space Operations (40).
2. Intelligence, Surveillance, & Reconnaissance (ISR) & Area Expertise. Military Intelligence (35), Strategic Intelligence (34), and Foreign Area Officer (FAO) (48).
3. Plans Development. Strategic Plans and Policy (59) and Nuclear and Counterproliferation (52).
4. Forces Development. Force Management (50) and Operations Research and Systems Analysis (ORSA) (49).
5. Education and Training. Permanent Academy Professor (47) and Simulation Operations (57).
(c) Force sustainment. This functional category highlights the formation of a Logistics Corps (previously approved
by the CSA and in development by the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC)). This category is
comprised of all the following branches and FAs associated with logistics, resource, and Soldier support functions:
1. Integrated Logistics Corps. Transportation Corps (88), Ordnance (91), and Quartermaster (92), plus Multifunctional Logisticians (90).
2. Soldier support. Adjutant General Corps (42) and Human Resources (43/AOC 42H), and Finance Corps (44) and
Comptroller (45).
3. Acquisition Corps (51). Remains as currently organized.
4. Special Branches. Chaplain, Judge Advocate General (JAG), and the six AMEDD Corps (Medical, Dental,
Veterinary, Nurse, Medical Specialist, and Medical Services).

Figure 3–1. Officer Developmental Model

3–4. Officer development
a. Under OPMS, company grade officers are accessed into the Army’s basic branches and through a series of
educational and developmental assignments are given the opportunity to hold branch developmental assignments
outlined by their proponent. During their company grade years, captains are designated into one of three officer
functional categories in which they continue their development either in their basic branch or in a FA. Officers in the
RCs will also undergo functional designation with their Active Army counterparts, but modification to the process is
necessary to accommodate personnel management considerations unique to the Army National Guard (ARNG)/U.S.
Army Reserve (USAR). Accessioning policies for the Army Acquisition Corps and SOF are unique and are addressed
in their respective chapters.
b. Following functional designation, officers are assigned to positions requiring expertise in the particular specialty
associated with each officer’s designated functional category, either branch skills or FA skills. In addition, these
officers may be assigned to branch/FA developmental positions throughout the Army that require those leadership and
managerial skills common to all officers. Assignments of field grade officers to branch/FA developmental positions are
made with the same professional development considerations afforded branch and FA assignments. See the glossary for
a discussion of branch/FA developmental assignment criteria.
c. One of the major objectives of OPMS is to professionally develop officers through the interactions of the
individual, the proponent, OPMD, and the field commander. These interactions are embodied in the process of officer
development—
(1) Development in a designated specialty. In the Army competitive category, there are 34 branch and FA specialties
in OPMS. The differences between a branch and FA are—
(a) Branch. A branch is a grouping of officers that comprises an arm or Service of the Army and is the specialty in
which all officers are commissioned or transferred, trained and developed. Company grade officers hold a single branch
designation and may serve in repetitive and progressive assignments associated with the branch. They may not be
assigned to more than one branch. See chapter 8, paragraph 8–2 for further discussion of officer branches.
(b) FA. A FA is a grouping of officers by technical specialty or skills other than an arm, Service, or branch that

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

13

usually requires unique education, training, and experience. After functional designation, FA officers may serve
repetitive and progressive assignments within their FA. An officer may not be assigned to more than one FA at a time.
See chapter 8 for further discussion of FAs.
(2) Officer professional education. This includes resident and nonresident instruction, on-the-job training, individual
study and when appropriate, civilian education.
(3) Progressive operational assignments. Assignments made by OPMD assignment branches using the life cycle
development models.
(4) Professional development counseling and mentoring. Conducted by commanders at all levels as well as by
AHRC career managers.
(5) Designation and election of branches, FAs, and functional categories.
(a) Branch designation. Upon commissioning, lieutenants are designated in a basic branch for entry on Active Duty,
training, and initial assignment. When required, some lieutenants are branch detailed to a combat arms branch for 2 or
4 years, or until their life cycle or cyclic units are in a reset period. Under the branch detail program, officers attend the
company grade level education at the school of the branch to which they are detailed. On completing the 2-year detail,
they attend a branch transition course before they return to their designated branch. Company grade officers in the 4year detail program receive transition branch training in conjunction with their enrollment in the Captain’s level
education. During the early years of Service, professional development within the branch follows the proponent’s life
cycle model. Generally, the first 8 years of Service are devoted to branch developmental assignments and training that
prepares the company grade officer for further advancement. Company grade officers may request, in writing, a
voluntary branch transfer in accordance with AR 614–100, paragraph 4–2. Detailed officers must be approved for
branch transfer by their detail branch, basic branch and AHRC (AHRC–OPD–C), in addition to meeting the requirements of AR 614–100. Prior to selection for promotion to captain, officers may volunteer for SOF (Special Forces,
Psychological Operations, or Civil Affairs) training and, upon successful completion of training, will receive a branch
transfer into their respective branch. Selection for SOF training is made by cohort year group and upon selection for
promotion to captain. The USAREC Special Operations Recruiting Battalion recruits SOF officer volunteers in
accordance with the force stabilization procedures outlined in AR 600–35. SOF officers are expected to have served a
successful initial tour as a lieutenant in a small unit leadership position in one of the Army’s other basic branches. As a
result, they are expected to have knowledge of conventional Army operations and be experienced in Army leadership.
Lieutenants who volunteer in the targeted year group are selected by a DA centralized SOF accession board at
approximately three years of commissioned Service and then go to a designated CCC to qualify for continued special
operations officer training.
(b) Functional designation. The Army competitive category groups interrelated branches and FAs into officer
management categories called functional categories and functional groups. The functional designation process determines in which specialty they will continue their development; either in their branch or in their FA. Management of
officer development in functional categories recognizes the need to balance specialization of the officer corps and the
inherent requirement for officers to gain more breadth in an increasingly complex environment. Officers will have two
opportunities for FD during their company grade years: at their 4th year of Service (YOS), and then at their 7th YOS.
The four-year Functional Designation Board (FDB) will allow a small number of officers to be designated into select
FAs that have critical modified table of organization and equipment (MTOE) positions to fill. It is designed to identify
and target officers with critical skills early, allowing them to get trained and bring their skills to bear as quickly as
possible. The seven-year FDB is designed to distribute the remainder of the force into the three functional categories.
The intent of this board is to fill requirements and provide the FAs enough time to send their officers to school and
training prior to utilization. The functional designation process is carried out by a HQDA centralized board. As in
centralized selection, these boards consider officer education, training, and experience; evaluation reports; life cycle
development models; officer preferences; and strength requirements to ensure that the needs of the Army are met for
future field grade officer requirements in each functional category. Each functional category has its own unique
characteristics and development model for officers, which reflects the readiness requirements of the Army today and
into the 21st Century. Officers in all functional categories are assigned across the Army in TOE and TDA
organizations.
(c) Joint duty assignment (JDA). The Joint duty assignment list (JDAL), and its subset, the Joint critical billets,
award Joint credit to officers. Assignments are usually preceded by JPME I, completed at ILE (Command and Staff
College). The Joint critical billets are typically filled by Joint specialty officers (JSO), those with a previously
completed Joint tour, plus JPME II, completed at JFSC or in SSC. All of these positions, plus numerous others involve
assignments/experiences in the JIIM environment, but are not subject to the control measures of the JDAL (tour length,
JPME, promotion monitoring). Paragraph 3–13 goes into greater detail on this subject.
d. Some positions in the Army are independent of branch or FA coding and are designated as branch/FA generalist,
combat arms generalist positions, or JIIM positions. Some company and field grade officers should expect to serve in
these assignments at various times during their careers, regardless of their functional designation. Officers are selected
for these and other similar positions based on overall manner of performance, previous experience, military, and
civilian education and estimated potential for further Service.
e. Both branches and FAs may require more specific job skills and qualifications to further prepare their officers to
14

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

meet highly specialized position requirements. These specific skills are called AOCs. AOCs are described in the
branch/FA chapters of this pamphlet.
f. Branch/FA development fosters a mastery of skills, knowledge, and attributes for an officer’s grade in a specific
branch or FA. Branch development enables captains to achieve mastery of common core and branch skills, knowledge,
and attributes that assures the strong professional development foundation essential for success in the field grades.
Generally speaking branch development for captains equates to completion of an appropriate company grade level
education followed by successful performance as a company grade officer. Branch development for majors results from
completion of an approved field grade intermediate level education and successful performance in a branch or FA
assignment. During an officers field grade years, OPMS allows for the broadening of an officers development from
mastery of branch skills to more multifunctional skills. Branch officers have the opportunity and are encouraged to
expand their knowledge and skills beyond their specific branch through multiple avenues. These opportunities;
advanced civil schooling (ACS), assignments in cross-branch/FA, and the use of JIIM assignments will enhance the
development of officers for the increasingly demanding requirements required to lead Soldiers today and in the future.
FA officers will also be provided the opportunity for broadening their development through the use of cross-branch/FA
and JIIM assignments.
g. Under OPMS, majors and lieutenant colonels compete for promotion from within their respective functional
categories. Selection for promotion is based on the fundamentals of performance and potential for further Service.
These are measured by the officer’s relative standing with his peers as indicated in the evaluation reports, assignment
history and branch, FA, and JIIM development opportunities afforded. The selection boards are instructed as to the
number of field grade officers to select based on Army needs, law, policy, and budget. Additionally, the boards receive
guidance on the officer qualities expected for promotion. All of this information is contained in the Secretary of the
Army’s memorandum of instruction (MOI) issued to the board. Members of the board use this pamphlet to determine
branch and FA qualifications. Congress and the Secretary of the Army approve promotion selection lists prior to
publication.
3–5. Company grade development
a. Branch-specific development. This phase commences upon entry on Active Duty and generally lasts through the
10th YOS (see fig 3–1). Currently, officers begin the development process by attending the Officer Basic Course
(OBC), now termed BOLC of their assigned branch. Under a transformed OES based on changes recommended by the
Army Training and Leader Development Panel - Officer (ATLDP–O), officers will begin their professional development by attending the Basic officer Leader Course, Phase II (BOLC II), followed by the Basic officer Leader Course,
Phase III (BOLC III). For additional information on BOLC II and III refer to chapter 4, paragraph 4–7d.
(1) Basic education. BOLC marks the beginning of a company grade officer’s formal military professional development training following commissioning. The branch BOLC prepares officers for their first duty assignment and
provides instruction on methods for training and leading individuals, teams, squads, and platoons. Additionally, the
course provides officers with a detailed understanding of equipment, tactics, organization, and administration at the
company, battery, or troop level.
(2) Initial assignments. After officers graduate from BOLC or BOLC III, branch assignment officers in OPMD will
assign the majority of officers to a branch duty position. Included in these assignments are CONUS or overseas troop
units where officers begin to develop their leadership skills. All junior officers should seek leadership positions in troop
units whenever possible. Troop leadership is the best means to become educated in Army operations and builds a solid
foundation for future Service.
(3) Before promotion. Prior to promotion to captain, officers must complete their baccalaureate degree. This
requirement is from Title 10 United States Code (10 USC).
(4) Captains OES. Officers normally attend their branch CCC following selection for promotion to the grade of
captain. This is the second major branch school officers attend before company level command. Selected captains
deemed to have demonstrated superior performance in their basic branch may be selected to receive this training at
schools other than their basic branch. A Field Artillery officer, for example, may attend the Armor CCC. This cross
training benefits officers of both branches. Officers seeking accession into special forces will attend the Infantry CCC.
Officers seeking accession into the Psychological Operations or Civil Affairs branches will attend a designated CCC.
For additional information about Captains OES, refer to chapter 4, paragraph 4–7d.
(5) Branch opportunities. All company grade officers must focus their efforts during the company grade years on
mastering the basic skills of their specific branch, regardless of the FA and functional category they will later enter.
Much of the value an officer brings to a specialized FA is dependent on experience gained by leading Soldiers and
mastering basic branch skills. Leading Soldiers is the essence of leadership development at this stage of an officer’s
career. Officers who have demonstrated the potential and desire to command Soldiers fill command positions. The
number of company commands within a specific branch may not afford all officers the opportunity to command at the
captain level. Command opportunities for captains are found in traditional TOE line units or TDA units in training,
garrison and headquarters organizations. Note: (This paragraph discusses branch opportunities in general. For information unique to a particular branch, refer to that branch’s chapter in part two of this pamphlet.)
b. Post-initial branch development. Between the 4th and 7th YOS and after a company grade officer has been an
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

15

afforded branch development opportunity, a number of options become available for continued professional development. At this time, career managers at OPMD assess the officer’s developmental objectives for the post-branch
development phase based on assignment patterns completed, relative manner of performance achieved, individual
preferences and Army requirements available for the next developmental stage (see fig 3–1). The types of assignments
and developmental patterns for this phase are as follows:
(1) Branch assignments. The range of further assignments to branch-coded positions is a function of the Army’s
requirements and officer availability. These assignments may include staff and faculty positions at Service schools,
Combat Training Center (CTC) duty or staff positions in tactical or training units. Branch assignments further develop
the basic branch skills and employ the officer’s accumulated skills, knowledge, and attributes.
(2) Branch/FA generalist assignments. Some company grade officers may serve in positions coded 01A (officer
generalist) or 02A (combat arms generalist). These branch/FA generalist positions do not require an officer from a
specific branch or FA but may be performed by an officer with certain experiences, manner of performance and
demonstrated potential. Such assignments include U.S. Army Recruiting Command (USAREC) staff and command
positions, Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC), or U.S. Military Academy (USMA) faculty and staff, and Army
Command (ACOM) staff positions.
(3) Officers designated into FAs. Officers designated into FAs should expect training and education opportunities to
focus on their areas of specialization and include progressive and repetitive assignments of increasing responsibility.
Each of the FA chapters in this pamphlet outlines developmental positions.
(4) ACOM)/Expanded Graduate School Program (EGSP). Each year some officers will be provided the opportunity
to attend civilian academic institutions to obtain graduate level degrees in designated disciplines. The final number
varies based on budget, policy, and Army requirements. These positions are annually assessed to determine how many
officers should be entered into each academic discipline. The criteria for selection are based on the branch or FA skill
required, academic proficiency measured by undergraduate performance and scores from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), ability to be accepted by an accredited college and
manner of performance to indicate strong potential for future Service. Proponents must forecast the education and
utilization of ACS graduates to meet projected needs since the degrees typically take 12 to 22 months to complete. The
specific follow-on assignment or utilization is often determined about 6 to 9 months prior to graduation. See branch
and FA chapters for discussion of ACS/EGSP requirements. AR 621–1 is the governing regulation and specifies the
method by which officers may apply for ACS.
(5) JIIM training opportunities. This program provides short-term (90 to 180 days) training for officers providing
them the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future.
(6) Training with industry (TWI). Some branches and FAs participate in TWI, where officers are assigned to a
civilian industry to observe and learn the technical and managerial aspects of that field. The total number of training
quotas varies annually from 50 to 70 based on budget, policy, and requirements. Officers selected for this program
must be proficient in their branch, have a manner of performance that reflects a strong potential for future Service and
be able to serve a utilization tour upon completion of training. The TWI program is outlined in AR 621–1 and in the
specific branch and FA chapters later in this pamphlet.
(7) Army Acquisition Corps. Between their 7th and 8th YOS, about 75 captains are accessed into the Army
Acquisition Corps (FA 51) to be professionally developed in this FA. AHRC hosts an Acquisition Accession Board
annually to select branch-qualified captains for FA 51. Army Acquisition Corps officers may receive a fully-funded
master’s degree (if not already at civilian education level 2), attend the Materiel Acquisition Management Course and
other FA related training, and serve repetitive assignments in their acquisition specialties to prepare them for critical
acquisition positions at field grade level. The Army Acquisition Corps, created in early 1990, is described in detail in
chapter 42 of this pamphlet.
(8) Selection for promotion to major. Normally an officer within a cohort year group enters the primary zone of
consideration for major around the 9th YOS. Below-the-zone (BZ) consideration occurs a year earlier.
3–6. Major development
a. This phase, which generally encompasses the 10th to 17th YOS, begins with selection for promotion to major.
This is a critical period in an officer’s career life cycle that demands an acute awareness of important HQDA
centralized boards and the preparations they require. The junior field grade years serve to develop the officer cohort in
a variety of branch or FA assignments within their functional category.
b. The general development goals are to complete military education level (MEL) l 4 (ILE), and successfully
complete other branch, FA, or broadening assignments prior to consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel. ILE
will provide a quality education for all field-grade officers and prepare them for their next ten YOS. See chapter 4,
paragraph 4–7e for further discussion of ILE.
c. Cohort year group officers are considered for promotion to lieutenant colonel in their 16th YOS as they enter the
primary zone of consideration.

16

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

3–7. Lieutenant colonel development
a. This phase generally occurs between the 17th and 22d YOS. Those selected for promotion to lieutenant colonel
now begin the senior field grade years, where they make the maximum contribution to the Army as commanders and
senior staff officers. Attaining the grade of lieutenant colonel is often considered to be the hallmark of a successful
career, although each officer defines success differently. Officers in the grade of lieutenant colonel serve as senior
leaders and managers throughout the Army providing wisdom, experience, vision, and mentorship mastered over many
years in uniform.
b. The professional development goals for a lieutenant colonel are to broaden their branch, FA, and skill proficiency
at the senior levels through assignments and schooling. Most of these officers will serve in high visibility billets in
their branch, FA or JIIM positions, and a possible assignment to a cross-branch/FA developmental position.
(1) Branch assignments. Lieutenant colonels can expect branch-coded assignments to both TDA and TOE positions.
These billets can range from positions within a battalion through echelons above corps. However, the TDA structure
requires the greater portion (almost 70 percent) of the senior field grade expertise and experience. Here, the officer’s
development over the years is used to fulfill the doctrinal, instructional, policy making and planning needs of the
Army. Branch proponents have outlined developmental standards in their respective chapters of this pamphlet.
(2) FA assignments. OPMS recognizes the need for balanced specialization to meet the Army’s challenges in the
21st Century. The system design allows officers to serve in repetitive assignments within a FA to gain a high degree of
expertise. FA proponents have outlined developmental standards in their respective chapters of this pamphlet.
(3) JDAs. The JDAL contains approximately 1,350 lieutenant colonel authorizations and officers will continue to
have the opportunity for assignment to Joint duty positions as an integral part of their development. See paragraph
3–13 for additional details on the Joint Officer Program.
(4) Branch/FA generalist assignments. Some officers will serve outside their branch or FA in billets coded as
branch/FA generalist. Such assignments are found throughout the Army in troop and staff organizations from the
installation to DA level.
(5) Centralized selection. A centralized board at HQDA selects a limited number of officers for command and key
billets. The lieutenant colonel centralized selection list (CSL) command and key billet contains both TOE and TDA
positions. The command board meets annually to select commanders from the eligible cohort year groups. Command
opportunity varies based on force structure and the command categories for which an officer competes. On average,
lieutenant colonels serve in their command tours during their 18th through 20th YOS. Once the board makes its
selections and conducts a preliminary slating for category, OPMD conducts a slating process. AHRC coordinates this
slating process with the ACOMs; and the Chief of Staff, Army, reviews and approves the slate. The Army Acquisition
Corps conducts a similar HQDA level board to select lieutenant colonel commanders and product managers. Only
certified Army Acquisition Corps officers can compete for these positions.
(6) SSC. The annual SSC (MEL 1) selection board reviews the files of lieutenant colonels after their 16th YOS. The
SSC is the final major military educational program available to prepare officers for the positions of greatest
responsibility in the DOD. There are about 350 resident seats available each academic year within the SSC network.
These include attendance at the AWC, the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF), the National War College
(NWC), other Service colleges and resident fellowships at governmental agencies and academic institutions. Approximately 30 to 35 percent of a cohort year group is selected to attend during their years of eligibility that runs between
the 16th and 23d YOS. The SSC selection board examines the eligible population and produces an order of merit list
containing 1,300 names. The top 350 officers are activated for resident attendance while the remainder are contacted by
their branch or FA managers and encouraged to apply for the 150 annual Active Duty seats in the AWC Distance
Education Course. Only the resident SSC courses and nonresident AWC course award MEL 1 upon completion. SSC
graduates are assigned to organizations based on guidance from the Chief of Staff, Army. Tours following graduation
are to the Army Staff (ARSTAF), Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), Secretary of Defense, ACOMs, Army Service
Component Commands (ASCCs) and Direct Reporting Units (DRUs), and combatant command staffs in branch, FA,
branch/FA generalist, or Joint coded positions.
c. Cohort year group officers are normally considered for promotion to colonel in the primary zone in their 21st
YOS. BZ selection is possible, and officers will only be considered once prior to their primary zone consideration.
3–8. Colonel development
a. Those officers selected for promotion to colonel continue their senior field grade phase that concludes with their
separation or retirement from Active Duty or selection for promotion to brigadier general. Attaining the grade of
colonel is realized by a select few and truly constitutes the elite of the officer corps. As colonels, their maximum
contribution to the Army is made as commanders and senior staff officers.
b. The general professional development goals for colonels are to further enhance branch or FA skill proficiency
through additional senior level assignments and schooling.
(1) Branch assignments. Many colonels can expect to receive assignments to branch coded positions at the brigade,
division, corps, and echelons above corps in the TOE environment. TDA organizations throughout the Army also need
the expertise of senior field grade officers. Almost 70 percent of the colonel authorizations are in the TDA structure.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

17

(2) FA assignments. Under OPMS, FA officers work predominantly in their specialties after selection for promotion
to major. Having risen above their peers at the grade of major and lieutenant colonel, those promoted to colonel are
truly the world-class specialists in their respective fields. These officers will serve primarily in senior managerial billets
across the Army coded for their specialty.
(3) JDA. The JDAL contains a number of colonel billets in branch and FA positions. Officers who did not serve as
majors or lieutenant colonels in a JDAL billet should continue to seek Joint development. Colonels’, who completed
the requirements for JSO designation, may serve second and third tours in positions coded Joint critical. (For more
information, read para 3–13, which details the Joint Duty Program.)
(4) SSC. The annual SSC selection board reviews the files of colonels until their 23d YOS. The majority of colonels
will either attend the resident training or be awarded MEL 1 certification from the AWC Distance Education Course
during the latter three years of their eligibility window. See paragraph 3–7b(6), above, for more information on the
available SSC-level courses.
(5) Centralized command selection. Some officers are selected for command at the colonel level. Most positions are
branch coded and branch officers compete within designated categories for these positions. An HQDA level board also
selects Army Acquisition Corps program managers. Officers are eligible for colonel command selection until their 26th
YOS. HQDA command boards meet annually to select promotable lieutenant colonels and serving colonels for
assignment to command positions during the following fiscal year. The opportunity varies by branch and ranges from
16 percent to 50 percent. The command board prepares a slate to category and an initial slate to units. The final slate to
unit is prepared by OPMD. Slates are approved by the Chief of Staff, Army, and are coordinated with the ACOMs,
ASCCs, and DRUs. The majority of officers in a cohort year group do not command; they make their maximum
contribution to the Army in other important branch or FA senior staff assignments.
(6) Former brigade commander assignments. Colonels completing brigade command are assigned to positions
designated by the Chief of Staff, Army, as requiring the skills of former commanders. These post-command assignments may be to branch, branch/FA generalist assignments, or Joint coded positions. Emphasis is placed on Joint duty
assignments for those officers without a Joint qualifying tour.
3–9. Warrant officer definitions
The Army WO is a self aware and adaptive technical expert, combat leader, trainer, and advisor. Through progressive
levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the WO administers, manages, maintains, operates, and
integrates Army systems and equipment across the full spectrum of Army operations. WOs are innovative integrators
of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident warfighters, and developers of specialized teams of Soldiers.
They support a wide range of Army missions throughout their career. WOs in the Army are accessed with specific
levels of technical ability. They refine their technical expertise and develop their leadership and management skills
through tiered progressive assignment and education. The following are specific characteristics and responsibilities of
the separate, successive WO grades:
a. A WO1 is an officer appointed by warrant with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position
given by the Secretary of the Army. CW2s and above are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant
to assignment level and position as given by the President of the United States. WO1’s and CW2’s primary focus is
becoming proficient and working on those systems linked directly to their AOC/MOS. As they become experts on the
systems they operate and maintain, their focus migrates to integrating their systems with other branch systems.
b. CW3s are advanced-level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader,
trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other branch-related
duties assigned to them. As they become more senior, their focus becomes integrating branch systems into larger Army
systems.
c. CW4s are senior-level technical and tactical experts who perform the duties of technical leader, manager,
maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor and serve in a wide variety of branch level positions. As they become
more senior they focus on integrating branch and Army systems into Joint and national level systems.
d. CW5s are master-level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, manager,
integrator, and advisor. They are the senior technical expert in their branch and serve at brigade and higher levels.
3–10. Warrant officer career patterns
a. The development of the professional attributes and technical capabilities of Army WOs to meet the needs of the
Army is accomplished through proponent-designed professional development models for each AOC/MOS. These
professional development models describe schooling, operational assignments, and self-development goals for WOs in
each grade. Professional development models are based on Army requirements, indicating the numbers and types of
WOs to be accessed, retained, promoted, schooled, and assigned by AOC/MOS. Proponents monitor the Army
documents pertinent to their AOC/MOSs since any change to the force structure may require a change to the WO
inventory.
b. The size of the WO inventory is limited by various factors. As requirements change, strength and professional
development goals of each CF AOC/MOS are aligned accordingly. WOs are accessed into a specific AOC/MOS and

18

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

can normally expect to spend their entire career in that field. Branch, FA, and AOC/MOS are defined in the glossary.
These terms as they pertain to WOs are further explained below.
(1) Branches are the officially designated categories within the Service that separate personnel and functions.
Examples of branches are Field Artillery, Infantry, Quartermaster, Aviation, and so on. WOs are appointed in the
United States Army at large but contribute directly to the success and missions of the specific branches. WOs wear the
insignia of the branches they support. Branch proponents play a significant role in the management of WO CFs,
development of life cycle development models, and providing proponent based training for WOs.
(2) FAs for WOs are groupings of AOCs/MOSs within branches. Examples are electronic maintenance and ammunition AOCs/MOSs that are a part of the Ordnance Branch but are grouped in a separate FA within the Ordnance Branch.
(3) An AOC/MOS is an assigned specialty that most WOs hold, with variations, for their entire career. Most WOs
hold and work their AOC/MOS for their entire career. Some AOCs/MOSs, notably in Aviation, Ordnance, and Signal
branches merge or capstone at the grades of CW3 thru CW5. The list of specialties, with general description of duties,
by grade, is contained in DA Pam 611–21.
c. Not all assignments within an officer’s career will directly relate to the WO’s FA/branch or AOC/MOS. Some
WO positions are AOC/MOS immaterial but FA/branch specific; that is, any qualified WO within a specific branch FA
(aviation, artillery, ordnance, and so on) may be assigned to the position. Others are designated AOC/MOS as well as
FA/branch immaterial (that is, any qualified WO, regardless of AOC/MOS and FA/branch, may be assigned to the
position). Some positions in leader development, professional development, personnel management, training, and
training development require the assignment of the best qualified WO, regardless of AOC/MOS or FA/branch.
3–11. Warrant officer development
In subsequent chapters, professional development models are detailed by FA/branch and AOC/MOS. As WO1s and
CW2s, primarily focus on their primary MOS/AOC. As they gain more experience and training, their focus and
expertise shifts from their primary MOS/AOC to integrating other systems within their branch/FAs to Army, Joint and
national level systems. A generic professional development model, depicted in Figure 3–2, consists of the four primary
levels of WO utilization:
a. Entry level. WOs are accessed according to the needs of the Army. Once accepted, the applicant must attend the
Warrant Officer Candidate School (WOCS), conducted by the Warrant Officer Career Center (WOCC) at Fort Rucker,
Alabama or two-phased RTIs run by state ARNG. (SF WOs, 180A, will attend their candidate school at Fort Bragg,
NC.) This course that tests the mental, emotional, and physical stamina of candidates to determine their acceptability
into the WO corps. The focus of the course is common material provides the skills, knowledge, and behaviors required
of all WOs, regardless of specialty. Upon course completion, the candidate is eligible for appointment to the grade of
WO1 but is not yet AOC/MOS-qualified.
b. WO1/CW2. After graduating from WOCS, the new WO1 must attend a WOBC conducted by his/her proponent
school. WOBC provides functional training in the applicable AOC/MOS and reinforces the leadership training provided
in WOCS. Upon successful completion of WOBC, the WO is awarded an AOC/MOS and given an initial operational
assignment. Operational assignments continue for the next several years. Throughout this period, WOs should continue
their self-development, to include the pursuit of civil education goals. The civil education goal at this career point is an
associate’s degree or equivalent in a discipline related to their AOC/MOS prior to eligibility for selection to CW3.
After promotion to CW2, at approximately the third year of WO Service, WOs can enroll in prerequisite studies for the
WOAC, an AOC/MOS immaterial course administered by the Distributive Education Section of the WOCC. Completion of this course renders the officer eligible to attend his/her resident WOAC. Officers are eligible to attend the
resident portion of their proponent-controlled WOAC after serving for 1 year as a CW2 and should attend not later
than 1 year after their promotion to CW3.
c. CW3/CW4. At this point, WOs should actively pursue the next civil education goal, a baccalaureate degree in a
discipline related to their AOC/MOS, prior to eligibility for selection to CW4. WOs will attend the WOSC conducted
at the WOCC after serving one year as a CW3 but not later than one year after their promotion to CW4. Some
proponents may provide follow-on functional training at this point.
d. CW5. Upon completion of one year time in grade as a CW4 but not later than one year after promotion to CW5,
WOs should attend the WOSSC at the WOCC. Again, proponent schools may provide a follow-on portion of this
course. Upon completion of the WOSSC and promotion to CW5, the WO will serve the remainder of his career in
positions designated for that grade.
3–12. Introduction to officer skills
A skill identifier identifies specific skills that are required to perform the duties of a particular position and are not
related to any one branch, FA, or CF. There are over 250 skills in the current Army regulation, many of which require
special schooling, training, and experiences in which qualification is maintained.
3–13. Joint officer professional development
a. JDAs.
(1) The provisions of 10 USC specify that officers on the active-duty list may not be appointed to the grade of
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

19

brigadier general unless they have completed a full tour of duty in a JDA. Additionally, effective 30 September 2008,
officers must have the ASI of 3L (Joint specialty officer) to be considered for promotion to brigadier general. The
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy (ASD(FMP)) may waive that JDA requirement on a caseby-case basis for scientific and/or technical qualifications for Corps of Engineers, Military Police Corps, Military
Intelligence, Finance Corps, Chemical Corps, Ordnance Corps, Army Acquisition Corps and Public Affairs officers;
Comptrollers; Nurses and Medical, Dental, Veterinary and Medical Service officers; Chaplains; Judge Advocate
officers; officers serving in a JDA for at least 12 months that began before 1 January 1987; officers serving in a JDA at
least 180 days on the date the board convenes; and lastly, for the "good of the Service." A JDA is a designated position
in a multi-Service or multinational command or activity involved in the integrated employment or support of the land,
sea or air forces of at least two of the three military services. The preponderance of an officer’s duties involves
producing or promulgating National Military Strategy, Joint doctrine and policy, strategic and contingency planning,
and command and control of combat operations under a unified command. The Goldwater-Nichols Department of
Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 provides statutory requirements as set forth in Title 10 USC for JDAs, Joint tour
credit, and Joint military education.
(2) The JDAL is a consolidated list of JDAs approved for Joint credit by the ASD (FMP). Presently, the JDAL has
approximately 3,200 billets for Army majors through colonels.
b. Joint duty credit. The statutory tour length for a JDA is three years for field grade officers and two years for
general officers. After completing a full tour of duty in a JDA, they will be awarded the 3A (Joint duty qualified) skill
identifier. An officer begins to accrue Joint duty credit upon assignment to a Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL) billet
and stops accruing Joint duty credit on departure. critical occupational specialty (COS) officers (major to colonel) who
meet the early release criteria may receive full tour credit for serving at least 2 years in their initial JDA. Officers
possessing a COS may be released early from a JDA with the approval of the Joint activity if they meet all of the
criteria in paragraph 3–13d(4)(a), below.
(1) Must be serving in their initial JDA and must serve at least 2 years in that JDA. If eligible, up to 60 days of
constructive credit may be applied toward this assignment. If maximum constructive credit is authorized, the officer
may be released early after completion of 22 months in the assignment.
(2) Designated as a “Joint specialty officer nominee.” (Officers with a COS who were designated as “Joint specialty
officers” under the transition rules before October 1, 1989, based solely on completion of the Program for Joint
Education, may be released early from a JDA.)
c. Joint specialty officers. Joint specialty officers are educated and experienced in the employment, deployment and
support of unified and multinational forces to achieve national security objectives. Joint specialty officers provide
continuity for Joint matters that are critical to strategic and operational planning and serve within the Joint arena and
their Service. Field grade officers eligible for the JSO designation must meet the highest standards of performance,
complete both Phase I and II of a Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) program and successfully complete a
full tour of duty in a JDA. The Secretary of Defense may waive the education requirement provided the officer has
successfully completed two full tours of duty in a JDA. Officers approved by the Secretary of Defense will be awarded
the 3L (Joint specialty officer) skill identifier.
d. JPME. Professional military education (PME) is the systematic instruction of professionals in subjects that
enhance their knowledge of the science and art of war. JPME is that portion of PME concentrating on instruction of
Joint matters. Program for Joint Education is a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff-approved body of objectives,
policies, procedures, and standards supporting JPME requirements for JSO nomination. PJE is a shared responsibility
of the military Service colleges and the National Defense University (NDU). The NWC, ICAF, and the Joint Forces
Staff College (JFSC) curricula encompass the entire Program for Joint Education (Phase I and Phase II). Other
educational institutions approved by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, (for example, ILE), conduct JPME
Phase I, while the JFSC conducts JPME Phase II. Field grade officers who complete both JPME Phase I and JPME
Phase II satisfy the educational requirements for Joint specialty officer nomination.
(1) JPME Phase I. JPME Phase I is that portion of the PJE that is incorporated into the curricula of intermediate and
senior-level military Service JPME schools and other appropriate educational programs that meet JPME criteria and are
accredited by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
(2) JPME Phase II. JPME Phase II is that portion of PJE that complements JPME Phase I. JPME Phase II is taught
at JFSC to both intermediate and senior-level students. Field grade officers must complete JPME Phase I to be eligible
to attend JPME Phase II. Under exceptional conditions, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff may approve a directentry waiver to permit an officer to complete JPME II without having completed JPME Phase I. JPME Phase II is
integrated, along with JPME Phase I, into the curricula at the NWC and ICAF.
(3) Other programs. Other programs, as approved by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, may satisfy the
JPME Phase I requirement.
(4) JPME Phase II graduates. The Army must ensure that the following requirements are met by officers who
graduate from each of the NDU schools (for example, the NWC, the ICAF, or the JFSC) for each fiscal year:
(a) All JSOs must be assigned to a JDA as their next duty assignment following graduation, unless waived on a
case-by-case basis by the ASD (FMP).

20

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(b) More than 50 percent (defined as 50 percent plus one) of all non-JSO graduates from each of those schools must
be assigned to a JDA as their next duty assignment following graduation. One half of the officers subject to that
requirement (for each school) may be assigned to a JDA as their second (rather than first) assignment following
graduation, if necessary for efficient officer management. The Army will coordinate with the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff to document compliance.
3–14. Assignment process and considerations
a. The life cycle of a cohort year group spans 30 YOS. Some officers from a cohort may attain general officer status
and be retained in Service beyond that point. WOs may serve up to 30 years of WO Service.
b. The assignment process throughout an officer’s career is based on several factors and considerations. The
environmental factors in which OPMS operates can affect the assignments an officer may receive. The assignment
process has these elements—
(1) Army requirements. The central engine that drives OPMS and the assignment process is Army requirements.
Army requirements are those positions that must be filled by officers to accomplish our wartime and peacetime
missions. When an officer leaves a position, the losing agency generates a requisition for a replacement. Army
requirements for officers are specified on the various TOE and TDA structures. Grade, branch, FA, skill, and special
remarks are documented for each position within The Army Authorization Documents System (TAADS), which is
maintained by the DCS, G–3/5/7. Annually, the Army projects positions to be filled and places officers on PCS orders
to occupy the vacancies. Within OPMD, requisition cycles are opened quarterly, and the assignment branches
determine which officers meet the position requirements and are available for the assignment.
(2) Availability for assignment. Officers are considered available for assignment when they complete the required
tour length as specified in AR 614–100 for CONUS and outside the continental United States (OCONUS) locations.
DOD and Army policies for tour length are changed based on a variety of external factors, to include budget
limitations. Force stabilization is an important factor in future assignment decisions.
(3) Professional development needs. Professional development in the officer’s designated branch, FA, or AOC/MOS
is important to the assignment manager; however, force stabilization will be an equally important consideration. Each
branch and FA has a life cycle development model. The officer’s career needs are examined in light of these models to
ensure the next assignment is progressive, sequential, and achieves the professional development goal for that grade.
(4) Other assignment considerations. Besides Army requirements, availability and professional development, the
assignment managers scrutinize other considerations in arriving at an appropriate assignment.
(a) Preference. Officers should frequently update their preference statement for location, type of assignments,
personal data, professional development goals, and education and training needs. Assignment managers may not be
able to satisfy all preferences because of dynamic requirements, but they do attempt to satisfy as many as possible.
(b) Training and education. Whenever possible, assignment managers provide schooling en route to the officer’s
next assignment to meet the special requirements of the position. Civilian educational goals that are specific requirements of positions or professional development will also be considered during the assignment process.
(c) Personal and compassionate factors. Personal crises occur in every officer’s career. OPMD assignment managers attempt to assist in such circumstances by adjusting the assignment. However, officers should apprise their
assignment manager of such personal or compassionate considerations at the time they occur and not wait until an
assignment action is pending. In some cases, formal requests for compassionate deferment from assignment or request
for reassignment are needed. Officers should coordinate with local Soldier support activity for processing such
documents. Officers with dependents having special needs should enroll in the Exceptional Family Member Program
(EFMP).
(d) Overseas equity. Overseas equity must be a consideration when selecting officers for assignments. With the
Army serving in a variety of overseas locations, the equitable distribution of OCONUS, and unaccompanied tours
among all officers is a morale concern as well as a developmental experience in many branches and FAs. Overseas
tours broaden the professionalism of the officer corps and assignment managers consider this element of tour equity in
each assignment action.
3–15. Individual career management
The OPMS provides leader and technical training for company grade, field grade, and WOs. Negotiating through this
multitude of possibilities to meet the needs of the Army and the important needs of the individual is the result of
interaction among the individual officer, the commander, the proponent, and the OPMD assignment manager. Each has
an important part to play in the professional development of not only individual officers, but of the officer corps as a
whole.
a. The individual. In many respects, officers are ultimately their own career managers. While Army requirements
dictate the final outcome of all development actions, in every case the officer must participate in such decisions.
Participation in the officer development process is possible at the basic branching/career management field designation
point, volunteering for training and education programs, selection of FA, preferences for functional category, application for entry into special programs, and long-range planning of career goals. The key is to be involved in professional

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

21

development by making informed and logical decisions and acting on them. One important element of an officer’s
involvement is the accurate reflection of capabilities in the official personnel management files maintained by HQDA.
The official military personnel file (OMPF), the DA Form 4037 (Officer Record Brief) (ORB), and the career
management individual file (CMIF) contain the data from which important professional development decisions are
made for selection, advancement, assignment, and retention. Officers should review, update, and maintain these records
throughout their careers. Officers should also request periodic advice and counseling from commanders, supervisors,
senior officers, and AHRC career managers to remain informed of career opportunities and to assess progress achieving
career goals.
b. The commander. Commanders play a critical part in development by understanding the roles of all their officers,
their education and development needs and incorporating them into a unit officer professional development (OPD)
process. All officers look to their rater, senior rater, and mentors for advice and career counseling. Some counseling is
official, such as the preparation and submission of DA Form 67–9 (Officer Evaluation Report) and DA Form 67–9–1
(Officer Evaluation Report Support Form). Other forms of counseling are often unofficial and relate to career patterns,
advice about assignments, and duty positions. Regardless of the type of counseling, commanders should be factually
informed before rendering advice. This pamphlet contains many of the professional development facts that commanders
need to give wise counsel.
c. The proponents. Proponents design life cycle development models for their branches, FAs, and AOC/MOS and
monitor the overall professional development of officer populations. Logical and realistic career patterns, qualifying
objectives, and an accurate understanding of attrition and promotion flows are vital ingredients in each branch or FA.
Leader development action plans and life cycle development models should be constructed to meet overall Army
requirements as well as branch, FA, and functional category objectives. Constant contact with the officer population
and the OPMD assignment branches should be sustained to communicate goals and objectives of the branch and FA.
d. OPMD assignment managers. Assignment and career managers at AHRC OPMD are responsible for fulfilling
current and future Army requirements while meeting the professional development needs of the various branches, FAs,
and functional categories. Additionally, they balance the best interests of the individual officers against the Army
requirements. Career managers can provide candid, realistic advice to officers about their developmental needs. As the
executors of Army and proponent programs, they operate within the existing policy, budget, and legal framework to
make decisions concerning assignments, schooling, manner of performance, and subjective evaluations of competitiveness for selection and retention. All officers should stay in touch with their assignment managers to receive guidance
and advice on professional development.

Chapter 4
Officer Education
4–1. Scope
a. Training and education requirements. Common training requirements apply to all officers and specify the skills,
knowledge, and attributes required of every officer. Other training and education requirements for branch, FA, or skill
codes apply to officers in a particular specialty.
b. Training and education methods. Officer education occurs in institutional training, in operational assignments,
and through self-development. Institutional training represents the resident training an officer receives in military and/
or civilian institutions. Self-development encompasses nonresident schooling including individual study, advanced
distributive learning, research, professional reading, practice, and self-assessment.
4–2. The officer Education System
a. Strategic objective. The strategic objective of the OES is to create an education and training system operationally
relevant to the current force, but structured to support the Future Force by producing more capable, adaptable, and
confident leaders through continuous investment in personal growth and professional development throughout their
careers. To achieve this objective, the Army has embraced an experiential and competency-based education and
training model in its education system. This model integrates current technological capabilities to rapidly advance
learning in both individual and collective training requirements while providing Army leaders the right training and
education in the right medium, at the right time and place for success in their next duty. This model supports the
Service culture and Warrior Ethos and produce leaders who can resolve dilemmas under stress, make decisions, and
lead formations. The institutional side of the Army will become a series of leadership laboratories focused on learning,
growing, achieving competency, and getting better training into units.
b. OES focus. The OES is based on a documented rationale for change, including findings and recommendations
from the Army Training and Leader Development Panel (ATLDP) officer studies, as well as the Review of Training,
Assignments for Leaders (RETAL) Task Force, and the Secretary of the Army and Chief of Staff, Army guidance on
developing well rounded, broadly educated officers who are able to operate effectively in the JIIM environment.

22

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

4–3. Current paths to officer education
Current force educational models will be followed in parallel with future force models. Currently officers enter Active
Duty with diverse educational backgrounds and civilian experience. This diversity is amplified by the great variety of
Service experiences among officers with different branches and FAs. The current OES permits officers to build upon
achievements and experience and progress to a higher level of learning. Opportunities exist for resident and nonresident
instruction. There are multiple paths to obtaining a professional education. Officers may follow different paths to
achieve success, even where they share the same branch, FA, or MOS.
4–4. Guides for branch, military occupational specialty, or functional area development courses
a. Education requirements are satisfied by both the Army’s military schools and by civilian institutions. The BOLC
and the branch CCC includes training specific to junior officers (WO1, O1–O3). The ILE CSC and SSC provide
opportunities for advanced military and leader development training. The Warrant officer Basic Course (WOBC) and
WOAC include training appropriate to the officer’s specialty. The WOSC and WOSSC provide opportunity to enhance
functional specialty education. Specialized courses offered by military and civilian institutions provide additional
opportunities for assignment oriented FA and functional category education. Other Services and elements of the Federal
Government offer courses that support officer professional development. Advanced education may consist of resident
and/or nonresident courses.
b. Numerous courses support both Army requirements and the professional needs of individual officers. It is difficult
to anticipate and specify the many combinations of courses that apply to both Army and individual needs. However,
representative courses particularly suitable for various branches, MOS, and FAs are discussed in detail in paragraphs
4–7, 4–16, and 4–17. (Also see branch and FA specific chapters in this pamphlet.)
c. FA training is discussed below.
(1) FA training develops in an officer the necessary skills and technical qualifications to perform the duties required
of a FA. Courses of study leading to graduate degrees at civilian colleges and universities can meet these needs.
(2) The Army’s objective is to have all officers receive instruction qualifying them in their FA. This is accomplished
through either TDY and return or TDY en route during an officer’s PCS.
d. The system of record for training is now the Army Training Requirements and Resources Web site at https://
www.atrrs.army.mil. This system allows officers to research information regarding different schools and courses. The
system is also used to track enrollment and interfaces with personnel systems to record the completion of courses.
Procedures for obtaining separate logon ID and password for access are available on this site. The following references
can assist officers in planning their FA development:
(1) AR 350–1.
(2) AR 611–101.
(3) AR 621–1.
(4) AR 621–7.
e. Detailed information, including enrollment procedures for correspondence courses, is found at the ATRRS Web
site. In many cases, correspondence courses paralleling the numbered resident courses listed there are available. The
correspondence courses represent an important alternative means of CF development to many of the resident courses
because of their flexibility and convenience.
f. Joint Advanced Distributed Learning provides an interservice distance learning catalog that can be accessed at
https://catalog.jointadlcolab.org/index.asp.
g. While the Army recognizes the value of all nonresidence courses, the only nonresident courses that qualify for
award of an MEL designation for Active Army officers on the ADL are the AWC Distance Education Course for MEL
1, the USAR ILE nonresident course for MEL 4, and the Army Distance Learning ILE Course for MEL 4.
h. Active Army Soldiers are encouraged to attend Total Army Training Study (TATS) courses taught at Total Army
School System (TASS) battalions. These courses are resident courses. These are different from RC configured courses,
which are not treated as resident courses.
4–5. Nonresident schools and instruction
a. All officers are encouraged to further their branch or FA education through appropriate courses of nonresident
instruction. The successful completion of a given level of nonresident instruction is considered on an equivalent level
of attainment to, but does not rule out, future attendance at a resident course of instruction. An exception is enrollment
in the AWC Distance Education Course, which does rule out attendance at a resident SSC.
b. Equivalent level of attainment means that an officer who has reached a specific military education level through
nonresident instruction receives the same consideration in assignment, promotion, and future schooling as an officer
whose military education level was reached through resident instruction. Officers who do not have the opportunity to
attend a resident course should complete the level of PME appropriate to their grade through nonresident instruction.
There is no equivalent level of attainment for the BOLC II, BOLC III where resident participation is required.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

23

c. Nonresident instruction allows officers to advance their professional education and their careers, thereby enhancing their overall performance and potential. Military school courses available through correspondence, with and without
a resident phase, are listed in the TRADOC online library.
4–6. Educational counseling
The numerous educational opportunities and frequent moves in the Army often make it difficult to plan educational
programs. Officers frequently need professional educational counseling and should turn to their mentor, rater, and
assignment officer in OPMD, their local Army Education Center or an education counselor at the appropriate Service
school. The WOCC at Fort Rucker, Alabama is another excellent source for WO education counseling. Another
excellent resource for all officers is their individual commanders and supervisors. In addition, many civilian institutions
provide counseling services.
4–7. Military schools
a. BOLC. Upon commissioning an officer is assigned to a branch. The first training the officer attends is BOLC II.
BOLC II is a rigorous, branch-immaterial course, physically and mentally challenging, with the majority of the training
conducted via hands-on in a tactical or field environment. Focusing on training at the platoon level, a cadre of officers
and NCOs will continuously evaluate each student’s performance in a series of leadership positions, under various
conditions/situations. The student officers also participate in several peer reviews and self-assessments. The curriculum
includes advanced land navigation training, rifle marksmanship, weapons familiarization, practical exercises in leadership, urban operations, convoy operations, and use of night vision equipment. It culminates in squad and platoon
situational-training exercises using COE scenarios. Additionally, students must negotiate confidence courses that
challenge them to overcome personal fears. Junior officers depart BOLC II with a confidence in their ability to lead
small units, an appreciation for the branches of the combined arms team, and a clear understanding of their personal
strengths and weaknesses. There is no Active Duty Service obligation for BOLC II attendance. Direct Commission
Officers may attend BOLC–DCO, a BOLC II prep course for officers who did not have the benefit of participating in
BOLC I pre-commissioning training.
b. Branch detail program. Upon commissioning, selected lieutenants branched Signal, Quartermaster, Ordnance,
Transportation, and Finance may be detailed to a combat arms branch for a minimum of 2 years or longer if assigned
to a life cycle unit. Selected Military Intelligence and adjutant general officers are detailed for 4 years. Lieutenants
under the branch detail program attend the BOLC and participate in branch specific training for the branch to which
they are detailed. On completing the detail, officers attend a 4-week branch transition course, as prescribed by their
branch chief, before they return to their designated branch. Officers in the 4-year program receive transition branch
training in conjunction with their enrollment in the CCC. All officers continue to participate in branch specific training
once they are reassigned back to their designated branches.
c. BOLC III. Branch-specific training is conducted at the branch schools, officers receive specific branch training
(specialized skills, doctrine, tactics, and techniques). Upon graduation, officers attend additional assignment-oriented
training (Airborne, Ranger, Language School, and so on) or proceed to their first unit assignments.
d. CCC. The branch CCC prepares company grade officers to command and train at the company, battery, or troop
level and to serve as staff officers at battalion and brigade levels. There is a 1-year Active Duty Service obligation for
attendance at a branch CCC. Captains learn how to think critically and creatively; they learn how to think as opposed
to merely being thought what to think. Instruction focuses around combined arms operations at company, battalion, and
brigade levels within the COE. Students plan and conduct a variety of operations against an array of opposing forces.
Training includes planning and executing offensive and defensive operations against a conventionally trained,
equipped, and structured threat as well stability and reconstructive operations against unconventional forces possessing
a mixture of capabilities. The training scenarios present the student with constantly changing situations against a
learning, cunning, and adaptive enemy. Instruction also includes an introduction to Joint, interagency, and multinational
operations. Classes include an emphasis on urban operations and cultural awareness as an aspect of modern conflict.
Captains also receive training on how to leverage learning technologies and the importance of lifelong learning and
self-development. The instruction is a realistic, hands-on experience that stimulates effective recall in combat and
training environments following graduation. The program of instruction (POI) aims to develop well rounded, multiskilled officers who have the competencies and confidence to lead Soldiers in the COE. There are two ways RC
captains may fulfill their PME requirements: Attend the Active Army version of CCC, or attend a CCC (RC) which
consists of two, two-week ADTs spaced one year apart, plus up to 295 hours of advanced distributed learning.
e. Command and General Staff College (CGSC). ILE is the Army’s formal education program for senior captains
and majors. ILE consists of a common core of operational instruction offered to all officers, and additional education
opportunities tied to the requirements of the officer’s branch or FA. Eligibility to attend resident ILE common core and
the Advanced Operations and Warfighintg Course (AOWC) is determined by the Army. Additionally, officers must
have graduated from or have credit for completing a branch CCC.
(1) Select branch and FA officers will receive the common core course at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas during the first
16 weeks of ILE and follow on attendance at AOWC for 24 weeks. The remaining officers who do not attend resident
ILE at Fort Leavenworth will receive the common core course from CGSC instructors at one of the satellite campuses

24

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

and as prescribed through ADL and the TASS. Following the common core FA officers attend individual qualification
course ranging from two to 178 weeks in length. Qualification courses provide officers the technical preparation for
assignments in their respective FAs. Completion of the ILE common core and the respective branch or FA qualification
course qualifies the officers for award of MEL 4 and JPME I.
(2) Some officers may attend the Navy, Marine, or Air Command and Staff Colleges, the Western Hemisphere
Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC), or a foreign school that has been granted ILE equivalency. School
selections result from a comparative appraisal of all eligible officers, including a careful review of these elements: the
scope and variety of tasks performed and how well they were performed, the degree or level of responsibility, the trend
of efficiency up or down, intelligence and independent judgment in implementing decisions, and an estimate of
potential. Officers selected for attendance at other than the Army Intermediate Staff College may attend the ILE
common core at a satellite site, TDY en route.
(3) The Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP) is a yearlong resident course taught by the School of
Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College. The purpose of the AMSP
is to provide the Army and the other services with specially educated officers for command and general staff positions
at tactical and operational echelons. The program provides its graduates an advanced education in the military arts and
sciences focused at the operational level. Additionally, the program provides training in the practical skills needed to
plan and conduct battles, major operations, and campaigns and in adapting doctrine and techniques to the changing
realities of war. Applicants must be ILE qualified or resident students in ILE or sister Service resident programs. There
are 84 (60 Army, 24 RC, other Service, and international officers) students selected for attendance each year. The
Director, SAMS, accepts applications from August through October of each year.
f. SSC. The SSCs are at the apex of the military schools system and award MEL 1 credit. SSCs prepare officers for
senior command and staff positions within the Army and DOD. These colleges include the AWC, the NWC, the ICAF,
the Naval War College, the Air War College, the Inter-American Defense College (IADC), other accredited international senior military Service colleges, or any one of approximately 20 civilian and military fellowship programs. The
SSC in accordance with National Defense Appropriation Act of 2005 teaches JPME II.
(1) Officers who have completed 16 years AFCS, have credit for ILE schooling, do not have more than 23 years
AFCS as of 1 October of the year of entry into the college, and are serving as lieutenant colonels or colonels as of the
board’s convening date are eligible to attend an SSC. The annual Army SSC Selection Board selects officers on a bestqualified basis. Branch and FA floors, based on Army requirements, are considered during the SSC selection process.
There is a 2-year Active Duty Service obligation for attendance at resident MEL 1 schooling.
(2) The AWC Distance Education Course provides an alternate means of attaining MEL 1 schooling. Eligible
officers who apply are compared against the most current promotion list to colonel and most current SSC Selection
Board Order of Merit List (approximately 1,300 names) to determine the final slate. AR 350–1 describes the details of
the selection and application processes. The course is the only nonresident program that results in the awarding of
MEL 1 upon completion. Once officers have enrolled in the correspondence course, they are no longer eligible for
resident SSC attendance.
(3) Only resident attendance at SSCs or completion of the AWC Distance Education Course awards MEL 1 credit.
g. Advanced Operational Art Studies Fellowship. Each year the Army sends six or seven senior Service college
selectees to the Advanced Operational Art Studies Fellowship at the Army CGSC’s School for Advanced Military
Studies to be trained for subsequent assignment as theater level planners. The Air Force and Navy Departments send
one officer each to provide a Joint perspective to the student body. Allied officers are also enrolled to provide a
multinational perspective. Army and Marine Corps officers stay at SAMS for two years; Air Force, Navy, and allied
officers stay for only one year. Advanced Operational Art Studies Fellowship focuses on the skills and knowledge
required for campaign planning in and between theaters of war across the entire spectrum of conflict.
(1) The focus of the first academic year is on planning and operations at the theater strategic level at unified,
component, and Joint task force level headquarters. Students follow a rigorous set curriculum, with emphasis on
national security strategy, military theory, strategic studies, military history, and campaign planning.
(2) Second year fellows serve as seminar leaders for the AMSP seminars, coordinate operational level Exercise
Prairie Warrior planning, and perform other duties such as the revision of FM 3–13. Upon completion of the
fellowship, fellows are normally assigned to multinational, Joint, and component staff positions associated with
operational level planning.
h. JPME.
(1) The JPME program is a JCS) approved body of principles and conditions that prescribe, at both the Intermediate
Level Colleges (ILCs) and SSC levels, the educational requirements for Joint specialty officer nomination. The ILCs
incorporate JPME Phase I into their curricula. The SSCs incorporate JPME II into their curricula. JPME I is awarded
on completion of ILE common core and AOWC or the appropriate credentialing course. In the National Defense
Appropriations Act of 2005, the AWC now teaches JPME II
(2) The JPME program prepares field grade officers to work effectively with other members of the Armed Forces
and other Federal agencies and is designed to accomplish the following objectives:
(a) Provide officers a broad base of Joint professional knowledge.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

25

(b) Develop officers whose professional backgrounds and military education improve the operational excellence of
Joint military forces throughout the spectrum of war.
(c) Improve the quality of military strategic thought.
(d) Develop officers skilled in attaining unity of effort across Service, agency, and national lines.
(3) The majority of officers attending NWC and ICAF can expect to have follow-on Joint assignments.
i. Warrant officer Schools.
(1) WOCS. All WO candidates (Active Army and RC) must attend the resident WOCS. WOCS graduates are
conditionally appointed to WO1. Appointment is contingent upon certification by the MOS proponent that the WO is
technically and tactically qualified to serve in the authorized WO MOS.
(2) WOBC. Upon graduation from WOCS and appointment to WO1, each officer will attend functional specialty
training. The WOBC is a functional specialty development course taught at various proponent schools that prepares
newly appointed officers for their assignments as WO1. Training is performance oriented and focuses on technical
skills, leadership, effective communication, unit training, maintenance operations, security, property accountability,
tactics, and development of subordinates. WOBC graduates are recognized of WOBC grad. Branch proponents are
responsible for developing and updating WOBC training and technical certification standards.
(3) WOAC. The WOAC is MOS-specific and builds upon the skills, knowledge, and attributes developed through
previous training and experience. The course provides officers the leader, tactical, and technical training needed to
serve in company and higher-level positions. WOAC training consists of two of the following components:
(a) Prerequisite studies. A nonresident phase administered by the WOCC. This phase includes training in common
skills needed by all WOs regardless of MOS. It includes instruction in staff skills and roles, communicative arts,
decisionmaking, quantitative skills, personnel Service support, staff leadership and management, training management,
mobilization, and tactical sustainment. The course objective is to enhance and sharpen communicative and staff skills,
which help prepare the officer for the resident WOAC and subsequent CW3 assignments. Army RC WOs will be
scheduled for attendance shortly after promotion to CW2.
(b) Resident course. CW2s are eligible to attend their MOS WOAC. ADL) WOs will attend the advanced course at
their respective proponent school not later than one year after promotion to CW3. National Guard WOs complete this
training prior to promotion to CW3. USAR WOs not on the ADL must complete this training prior to selection for
CW3. The branch phase varies in length depending on the branch. Primary focus is directed toward leadership skill
reinforcement, staff skills, and advanced MOS-specific training. The course consists of in-depth training in MOSspecific and branch-immaterial tasks. Graduates of the WOAC receive the designation of MEL code 6.
(4) WOSC. The WOSC is a resident course conducted at the WOCC. This course focuses on the staff officer and
leadership skills needed to serve in the grade of CW4 at battalion and higher levels. The course which includes
instruction in communication skills, staff skills, relationships, problem solving, and decisionmaking educates and trains
officers in the values and attitudes of the profession of arms and in the conduct of military operations in peace and in
war. CW3s are eligible to attend the WOSC. ADL WOs will complete this course not later than one year after
promotion to CW4. National Guard WOs will complete this course prior to promotion to CW4. USAR WOs will
complete this course prior to selection to CW4. WOSC graduates are recognized by MEL code 4.
(5) WOSSC. The WOSSC is the capstone for WO PME. It is a branch immaterial two-week resident course
conducted at the WOCC. WOSSC provides a master level professional WO with a broader Army level perspective
required for assignment to CW5 level positions as technical, functional, and branch systems integrators and trainers at
the highest organizational levels. Instruction focuses on "How the Army Runs" and provides up-to-date information on
Army level policy, programs, and special items of interest. CW4s are eligible to attend the WOSSC. ADL WOs will
complete this course not later than one year after promotion to CW5. National Guard WOs must complete this course
prior to promotion to CW5. USAR WOs will complete this course prior to promotion to CW5. Graduates are
recognized by MEL code 1.
4–8. Department of Defense and Department of State schools
Based on Army requirements, OPMD may designate officers to attend courses at schools operated by the DOD,
Department of State, and Foreign Service Institute.
4–9. Foreign schools
Each year, based on quotas received by the U.S. Government, approximately 30 qualified officers are selected to attend
26 foreign schools in 15 different countries as students. AR 350–1 contains a list of the foreign schools that U.S.
officers attend. Foreign Area Officers receive preference for most of these schools.
4–10. Language training
More than 50 language courses are offered to meet Army requirements for officer linguists. The majority of these
courses are longer than 20 weeks, requiring the officer to PCS to a Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California,
or Washington, D.C. Officers are language trained only if being assigned to a language coded position. Officers trained

26

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

at Government expense test in that language every year and are expected to maintain their proficiency at a 2/2 level as
measured by the Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT).
4–11. Aviation training
All aviation officers attend initial entry flight training in conjunction with their officer basic course (WOBC/BOLC).
Company grade officers may volunteer for initial entry flight training in rotary wing aircraft under the provisions of
AR 611–110. Aviation qualification and transition training is based on worldwide aviation requirements. Aviators
requiring additional skills normally receive training during a PCS move. All officers may volunteer for aircraft specific
or MOS specific training. Course descriptions and prerequisites are in ATRRS.
4–12. Pre-command course
The pre-command course (PCC) is the Chief of Staff, Army’s program. It prepares selectees for command by providing
a common understanding of current doctrine and by providing both new and refresher training in selected functions and
duties. PCC attendance is mandatory for all centrally selected battalion and brigade commanders. The PCC program
goal is to ingrain warfighting and combined arms thinking into commanders. Branch and specialty schools focus on
tactical and technical proficiency, system proficiency, and hands-on training. The Fort Leavenworth PCC focus has a
broader base that provides up-to-date information on the Army wide level of policy, programs and special items of
interest. Combat arms brigade and battalion commanders and selected combat Service support commanders attend the
Tactical Commanders Development Course (TCDC), designed to improve their ability to synchronize combat power on
the battlefield. Combat arms brigade and battalion commanders and direct support Field Artillery and engineer battalion
commanders also attend the Battle Commanders Development Course (BCDC) following TCDC. The focus of BCDC
is battle command: the art of battle decisionmaking, leading, and motivating Soldiers and their organizations into action
to accomplish missions at least cost to Soldiers. Army Special Operations Forces (ARSOF) officers attend the ARSOF
PCC and the Joint Special Operations Forces Pre-Command Course (JSOFPCC) to train command selectees in current
doctrine, organizations and capabilities, training management, leader development, and command responsibilities.
Selected officers are also scheduled for language training and the Senior officer Legal Orientation (SOLO) Course.
Officers are scheduled by OPMD for PCC training as dates and locations for command are determined.
4–13. Other military schooling
Many military school courses provide the knowledge or skills necessary for a specific assignment. Officers may apply
for these courses or are scheduled by OPMD, AHRC for such courses to qualify for a specific assignment. Complete
information on such courses is found in the ATRRS online system.
4–14. Application for military schools
Officers do not apply as students to centrally selected military schools. They receive automatic consideration for
centrally selected schools when they enter the appropriate zone of eligibility (except those officers who have completed
the AWC Distance Education Course). Officers may apply for training through their assignment officers if they desire
training en route to the next assignment or through their command channels if TDY and return to the installation is
appropriate. OPMD, AHRC may automatically schedule such training if necessary for the position.
4–15. Service obligation
a. Attendance at military courses of instruction or civilian education programs at Government expense will incur a
Service obligation. AR 350–100 governs all Service obligations to include which courses of instruction result in an
Active Duty Service obligation, what the policies and procedures are for computing Service obligations and how
Service obligations are fulfilled. Policies in AR 350–100 take precedence over other Army publications if there is a
conflict.
b. An Active Duty Service obligation differs from a requirement to be assigned to an Army Educational Requirements System (AERS) position. An Active Duty Service obligation is a specific period of Active Duty that an officer
serves before eligible for voluntary separation. Assignment to an AERS position may be required in addition to the
ADSO for the Army to derive the greatest benefit from Government sponsored civilian education. AR 621–108
specifies the types of education that require assignment to an AERS position.
4–16. Civilian education
a. The Army ACS program has two objectives: to meet Army requirements for advanced education and to provide
selected officers the opportunity to satisfy their educational aspirations.
b. Company grade officers are required to obtain a baccalaureate degree from a qualifying educational institution
prior to attending the CCC. CCC attendance is not before their 3rd year of commissioning.
c. Officers should take advantage of opportunities for advanced education and should consider their civilian
education background when determining their qualifications for study in a given discipline. Officers who want to
pursue advanced degrees should do so in an academic discipline that supports their designated branch, FA, or MOS.
On completion of schooling, officers are assigned by grade, branch, FA, MOS, civilian education level (CEL), and,

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

27

when possible, academic discipline (or related discipline set) for initial utilization in an AERS validated position. In
this manner, specific Army requirements are satisfied while simultaneously contributing to the professional development of the officer corps and the satisfaction of an officer’s educational aspirations.
d. The appropriate proponent determines academic disciplines that support each branch, FA, or MOS.
4–17. Education programs
Officers may pursue full-time studies toward a master’s or doctoral degree through either fully-funded or partially
funded programs or a bachelor’s degree through the Degree Completion Program (DCP). Officers are encouraged to
pursue advanced degrees particularly when there is an opportunity to do so in coordination with resident training such
as CSC and SSC. Officers with liberal arts undergraduate degrees should not be dissuaded from their pursuit of
graduate education in the sciences. Available education programs are discussed in general below (AR 621–1 governs
specific civil school programs).
a. Fully funded programs. Under these programs, the Army pays all tuition costs and reimburses officers up to $600
per fiscal year for textbooks and supplies. In addition, the Army provides officers with full pay and allowances and
moves officers and their Families to the college or university of study. Normally, the period of schooling does not
exceed 18 months. Officers may not draw veterans’ benefits concurrent with fully-funded education.
(1) Advanced degree program. Selected officers attend graduate school to meet specific Army requirements established by the AERS. On completing graduate studies, officers are assigned to AERS positions according to branch or
FA, grade, and appropriate academic skills. Utilization assignments are for 3 years. Officers can also expect future
utilization assignments to capitalize on the knowledge gained through participation in this program. Primary zone of
consideration to attend graduate school normally occurs on completion of the CCC, with sufficient basic branch or
MOS experience, and 6 to 8 years of active Federal commissioned Service (AFCS); but no later than the 17th YOS.
(2) Short course training. Tuition funds allocated to organizations are available for unprogrammed training that is
needed for current job performance when the training is less than 20 weeks and is in subjects for which the Army has
no in-house training capability.
(3) Fully Funded Legal Education Program. The Judge Advocate General’s (TJAG) Funded Legal Education
Program provides instruction leading to a law degree at an approved civilian school at Government expense (normally
3 academic years) for up to 25 selected company grade officers each fiscal year. Upon completion, the officer accepts
an appointment in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps for the period of the Active Duty obligation incurred under the
provisions of AR 27–1, chapter 14, and AR 350–100. The FLEP is the only approved program currently available for
Army officers to study the legal profession. Program participants perform on-the-job-training duties under the supervision of a staff judge advocate or legal officer designated by TJAG when school is not in session for 5 days or longer.
Program participants who do not finish school or fail to pass the bar exam after two attempts return to Service in their
basic branch.
(4) TWI. This program provides training in industrial procedures and practices not available through military Service
schools or civilian education. TWI provides officers with vital knowledge, experience and perspective in management
and operational techniques to fill responsible positions in ACOMs and activities that normally interface with civilian
industry. It provides the trainee an opportunity to grapple with real problems inherent to the business environment.
Currently, these programs are concentrated in the areas of transportation, procurement, logistics management, research
and development, public affairs, banking, communication-electronics, advertising and marketing, physical security,
artificial intelligence, and automation systems. The programs are normally 10 months with a predetermined follow-on
assignment focusing on the experience gained. AR 621–1 provides information on application procedures.
b. Partially funded programs. Under these programs, the officer bears the cost of all tuition, fees, and textbooks.
Many officers elect to use their in-Service veterans benefits (if applicable) to help defray educational costs. The Army
provides officers with full pay and allowances and moves officers and their Families to the school location if the
schooling is 20 weeks or more. Participants attending schools for less than 20 weeks attend in a permissive TDY
status. After their branch notifies officers that they are accepted into the program, it is their responsibility to select and
be accepted by an accredited college or university.
(1) DCP. This program authorizes officers up to 18 months of full-time civilian education to complete undergraduate or graduate degree requirements. Officers who lack an undergraduate degree are encouraged to pursue studies on
their own; however, the Army can assist by providing up to 1 year to allow completion of the degree. Company and
field grade officers pursuing an advanced degree must agree to study in an academic discipline that supports their
branch or FA (or, in some cases, a designated skill). The primary zone of consideration for the graduate level is the 5th
through the 17th YOS.
(2) Cooperative degree programs. Selected students attending schools such as the CGSC, the Logistics Executive
Development Course (LEDC) at the Army Logistic Management College, and certain SSCs are offered the opportunity
to participate in various courses conducted by cooperating civilian institutions. Attendance at these courses is concurrent with the military schooling. After graduation, officers are authorized up to 12 months to complete graduate degree
requirements as full-time resident students at the civilian institution. Those attending SSC normally pursue studies

28

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

during the summer school sessions immediately before and after the military course. In all cooperative degree
programs, officers pay for educational costs.
c. Fellowships, scholarships, or grants. According to AR 621–7 eligible officers may apply for permission to accept
fellowships, scholarships, or grants offered by corporations, foundations, funds, or educational institutions. Participation
in such programs normally does not exceed 1 year and incurs an Active Duty Service obligation.
4–18. Tuition assistance
Eligible officers pursuing off duty undergraduate or graduate civilian education courses may apply for tuition assistance
under the provisions of AR 621–5. If approved, the Army pays up to 100 percent of tuition costs. Individual officers
pay all other amounts, such as fees for registration and matriculation and the cost of books and supplies. Participants
agree, in writing, to remain on Active Duty for a minimum of 2 years after completing the course or courses (see AR
621–5, para 2–9b(1)).
4–19. Eligibility criteria and application procedures
a. Since many elements of the programs discussed in this chapter differ, officers should consult the governing Army
regulations for the specific eligibility criteria and application procedures.
b. Selection for full-time civil schooling is governed by the needs of the Army; the officer’s demonstrated
performance, and his or her academic background. Officers pursuing a graduate degree should choose a discipline that
fulfills the professional development requirements of the officer’s designated branch, FA, or MOS. In addition,
applicants must have completed the CCC. Since selection for full-time schooling programs is based in part on the
availability of the officer, OPMD retains schooling applications until the applicant withdraws from further consideration or becomes ineligible by virtue of military performance or YOS. Officers selected for ACS should expect a
utilization assignment immediately after graduation. Officers who attend fully-funded educational programs are normally subject to recoupment if, prior to completing their required Service obligation, they separate from the Army
voluntarily or involuntarily.

Chapter 5
Officer Promotions
5–1. General
This chapter covers the Active Duty promotion system for officers through the grade of colonel. This system
constitutes a vital aspect of military personnel management affecting each officer and, therefore, must be legally correct
and logically sound. Further, it must be administered fairly and equitably; to do otherwise would jeopardize the
effectiveness of the officer corps.
5–2. Promotion process objectives
Though the specific procedures for selecting officers for grade advancement have varied over time, the objectives of
this process have remained constant.
a. Ensure advancement to the higher grades of the best-qualified officers.
b. Meet Army branch/MOS/FA and grade requirements.
c. Provide career incentive.
d. To promote officers based on the whole person concept and potential to serve in the next higher grade.
e. Although not an objective, identifying and eliminating ineffective officers is another result of the promotion
process.
5–3. Statutory requisites
The objectives of the promotion system are consistent with statutory requisites and the realities of the Army structure
and authorizations.
a. The legal basis for the officer promotion system is contained in 10 USC. This law prescribes strength and grade
authorizations, promotion list components, promotion procedures, and separation procedures resulting from nonselection. The statutory requirements of 10 USC have been promulgated through regulatory, directive, and policy
means in the establishment and administration of the promotion system.
b. The DOPMA became effective 15 September 1981. DOPMA was a major revision to 10 USC and is now the
basis for the management of the company/field grade officer corps. In 1984, the DOPMA provisions of 10 USC were
amended to overcome certain unintended consequences of the original act and to give the Service secretaries more
flexibility in limiting eligibility for promotion consideration. The current law:
(1) Establishes statutory limitations on the number of officers who may serve in senior grades.
(2) Provides common law for the appointment of Active Army officers and for the ADL Service of RC officers.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

29

(3) Provides uniform promotion procedures for officers in the separate Services.
(4) Provides common provisions governing career expectation in the various grades.
(5) Establishes common mandatory separation and retirement points for regular commissioned officers.
(6) Increases the amount of separation pay for officers separated involuntarily short of retirement.
(7) Provides related authorities to manage the officer force under the revised personnel system.
(8) Increases the flexibility of Presidential authority under mobilization in times of declared crisis.
c. The Warrant officer Management Act (WOMA) was passed into law as part of the fiscal year 1992/1993 National
Defense Authorization Act and went into effect on 5 December 1991. WOMA is a major revision to 10 of the USC
and has become the basis for the management of the Active Duty WO corps. The current law established—
(1) Single promotion systems for WOs.
(2) Tenure requirements based upon years of WO Service.
(3) The grade of CW5.
(4) Authorization for the Secretary of the Army to convene boards to recommend, retirement-eligible WOs, for
selective mandatory retirement.
5–4. Active duty list
a. Background. DOPMA and WOMA revised the laws providing for the establishment of separate Active Army
(permanent) and Army of the United States (temporary) lists and established a single, consolidated ADL. DOPMA and
WOMA, as revised, provide for the following:
(1) Establishment of an initial ADL. No later than 6 months after 15 September 1981, all officers of the Army
serving under chapter 36 of Title 10 USC as amended by DOPMA (except for those identified in 10 USC 641) will be
placed on the ADL in the same relative seniority that they held on 14 September 1981. Pre-WOMA relative seniority
was determined according to seniority criteria outlined in AR 600–8–29, chapter 1, and was primarily based on the
Army of the United States DOR a WO held on 4 December 1991.
(2) Adjustment to the ADL. Adjustments to the ADL are made to maintain the relative seniority among officers of
the Army as it existed on the day before the effective date of the law. Under provisions of 10 USC 741, the Secretary
of the Army did establish and/or adjust the ADL DOR of any company/field grade officer who was serving on Active
Duty on 14 September 1981. Any Active Army or U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) officer, who on the effective date of
DOPMA (15 September 1981) was serving on Active Duty in a temporary (Army of the United States) grade that was
equal to their permanent (Active Army or USAR) grade, was awarded an ADL date of rank equal to that held in their
AUS grade. WOMA provided for the establishment of an initial ADL that placed all WOs of the Army serving under
10 USC in the same relative seniority, which they held on 4 December 1991.
b. Current law. As required by 10 USC, the Army maintains a single ADL on which officers are to be carried in
order of seniority. They are considered for promotion, each time a selection board is convened to consider officers in
an established DOR zone of consideration for their competitive category. The provisions of 10 USC 741 and 10 USC
742 relate to rank among officers of the same grade as follows:
(1) Establishes relative rank of the various officer grades.
(2) Provides that rank among officers of the same grade or equivalent grade is initially determined by date of rank.
An officer with an earlier DOR is senior to an officer with a later DOR.
(3) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army have prescribed rules for breaking DOR ties and
general rules for establishing DORs when breaks in Service, Service credit, and placement on the ADL determinations
must be made. DOR and rank/precedence criteria have been published in AR 600–8–29, chapter 2.
(4) To maintain the relative seniority among WOs of the Army as it existed on the day before the effective date of
the law, the Secretary of the Army established/adjusted the ADL on 4 December 1991. Any Active Army or USAR
WO who, on the effective date of WOMA, was serving on Active Duty was awarded an ADL DOR equal to the
highest grade, temporary (Army of the United States) or permanent (USAR or Active Army), he or she had achieved.
5–5. Promotion process
a. Title 10 USC provides for a single promotion process of all officers on Active Duty and on the ADL, regardless
of their component. Active duty RC officers serving on the ADL are no longer considered by RC boards.
b. The effect of the 10 USC/DOPMA/WOMA on the tenure and retirement opportunity for officers is shown in table
5–1, below.
c. The WOMA mandated a single promotion process for all WOs on Active Duty and the ADL, regardless of their
component. The requirement for WOs to be recommended by two different selection boards (temporary and permanent)
for promotion to the next higher grade was eliminated. On 5 December 1991, WOs serving on Active Duty assumed as
their permanent grade the highest grade, temporary (Army of the United States) or permanent (USAR or Active Army),
they had held. Active duty reserve officers serving on the ADL are no longer considered by a reserve board.

5–6. Army grade structure
a. The distribution of grades at major and above is controlled by 10 USC and may be further constrained by
Congress, the Office of the Secretary of the Army, or the Chief of Staff, Army. Although 10 USC is subject to revision
and modification, the basic concept remains unchanged. In effect, the by-grade number of field grade officers allowed
depends on total officer authorized strength levels, which are based on the total size of the Army and prescribed by the
Secretary of the Army.
b. The distribution of grade CW5 is established and controlled by 10 USC and may be further constrained by
Congress, the Office of the Secretary of the Army, or the Chief of Staff of the Army. Although 10 is subject to revision
and modification, the basic concept remains unchanged. In effect, the number of CW5 positions depends on the total
WO authorized strength level. The total number of WO authorizations is based on the size of the Army and is
prescribed by the Secretary of the Army.
5–7. Promotion flow
a. Changes in authorizations, losses, and promotions to the next higher grade create fluctuations in both the time in
Service (TIS) and time in grade (TIG) at which promotions occur. Under ideal circumstances, each qualified officer
would advance through the grade structure with some degree of predictability. However, a relatively standardized
promotion flow does not occur consistently due to expansion and contraction of the Army, changes in promotion
policies and variations in officer losses each year.
b. Title 10 USC establishes minimum TIG requirements for promotion to the next higher grade as shown in table
5–2, below.
c. The promotion timings, as stated in Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 1320.13 are expressed in terms of
the years of AFCS at which promotion occurs. The promotion opportunity (DOPMA rate), as stated in DODI 1320.13,
is the percentage of total selects over the eligible in-the-zone population. Promotion timing and opportunity objectives
are shown in table 5–2, below.
d. Changes in authorizations, losses, and promotions to the next higher grade create fluctuations in the point within a
WO’s career at which promotions occur. Under ideal circumstances, each qualified WO should advance through the
grade structure with some degree of predictability. This relatively standardized promotion flow is not consistently
obtainable due to expansion and contraction of the Army, changes in promotion policies, and variations in WO losses
each year.
e. Title 10 establishes minimum TIG requirements for promotion to the next higher grade. The WO promotion flow
objective may be expressed in terms of years at which, WO Service promotions occur. History has consistently
revealed that rapid promotions, in terms of reduced TIG, have occurred during periods of force expansion. Conversely,
promotions have always slowed down when force reductions occur. The current WO promotion flow objectives are
shown in table 5–2, below.

5–8. Below-the-zone promotions
The BZ or secondary zone promotion capability is designed to allow the accelerated promotion of outstanding officers
who have demonstrated performance and indicated potential clearly superior to those who otherwise would be
promoted. BZ promotions apply only to promotion to the ranks of CW3, CW4, CW5, major, lieutenant colonel and
colonel. Officers will receive only one BZ consideration per grade. By law, the number of officers recommended for
promotion from below-the-zone may not exceed 10 percent of the total number recommended; except that the Secretary
of Defense may authorize that percentage to be increased to not more than 15 percent. Army policy sets the ACC BZ
promotion capability at 5.0 to 7.5 percent. Note that AMEDD, Chaplain Corps, and Judge Advocate General’s Corps
are not part of the ACC.
5–9. Competitive categories
Each officer on the ADL is grouped in a competitive category for promotion as authorized in 10 USC and prescribed in
DODI 1320.12. Competitive categories are established to manage the career development and promotion of certain
groups of officers whose specialized education, training, or experience, and often relatively narrow utilization, make
separate career management desirable. Officers in the same competitive category (see para 8–1b) will compete among
themselves for promotion. There are six competitive categories for company grade officers: the ACC includes all
branches and FAs other than the special branches; Chaplain, and Judge Advocates are in separate categories; and the
Army Medical Department has a category for the Medical and Dental Corps and a category for all other Medical
Department branches. There are 8 competitive categories for field grade officers; 2 additional due to FA designation
There are two competitive categories for the WO corps, Technical, and Aviation warrants.
5–10. Impact of Officer Personnel Management System evolution
With the implementation of OPMS revisions, changes have occurred in company grade, field grade, and WO personnel
management. These changes affect only ACC officers and WOs.
a. Promotion plan. As part of OPMS, the Army defines primary and secondary zones of consideration for field
grade promotions by basic year groups. The in-the-zone population, or primary zone, is usually established by the dates
the first and last due course officer was promoted from a specific year group. A due course officer is one who has been
on continuous Active Duty since commissioning as a second lieutenant and who has neither failed selection for
promotion nor been selected for promotion from BZ. This primary zone is accessed into the Army, and at times
shaped, to achieve a promotion opportunity (see table 5–2, above) that is relatively similar over a period of the next 5
years. This procedure has become known as the five-year Field Grade Promotion Plan. OPMS revisions have not
changed this policy.
b. Decentralized selections. The officer’s local commander approves promotion to first lieutenant and CW2. Normally, the battalion commander promotes with the recommendation of the company commander. Although the
promotion is thought of as being automatic upon completion of a specific period of Active Duty, the promotion is
32

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

based on an officer’s demonstrated performance. Officers who fail promotion to first lieutenant and CW2 are generally
released from Active Duty or discharged.
c. Centralized selections. Officers promoted from captain through colonel and CW3 to CW5 are selected by HQDA
centralized boards. Selection boards are asked to recommend fully or best qualified (as appropriate) officers from an
inclusive zone of consideration (ZOC). The ZOC includes officers from above, in, and below the promotion zone.
When the number of officers being considered exceeds the maximum number to promote, the boards operate under
best-qualified criteria. Centralized boards, except captain, are provided minimum promotion requirements (floors) by
branch, FA or AOC to ensure the Army’s skill and grade mix balances with its needs. Recommendations are based
upon branch, MOS, and FA competency, the potential to serve in the higher grade and the whole person concept.
Factors considered include—
(1) Performance.
(2) Embodiment of Army Values.
(3) Professional attributes and ethics.
(4) Integrity and character.
(5) Assignment history and professional development.
(6) Military bearing and physical fitness.
(7) Attitude, dedication, and Service.
(8) Military and civilian education and training.
(9) Concern for Soldiers and Families.
d. Special branches. Promotion within Special Branches (AMEDD, Chaplain Corps, and JAG Corps). The officer
promotion system reinforces all other personnel management programs to acquire and retain the right number of
officers, with the proper skills, to meet the Army’s needs. The objective of promotion within the special branches is to
maintain an orderly promotion flow that replaces losses, meets changing requirements, and recognizes uneven attrition
rates within these competitive categories. Provisions of the system include mandated floors by branch, FA, or AOC and
the optional employment of selection ceilings. Selection opportunity may vary among competitive categories based
upon projected requirements in the higher grades
e. Instructions to promotion boards. Each board receives a MOI from the Secretary of the Army providing guidance
for the selection process. Copies of these memorandums are released to the officer corps following approval and public
release of the board results. That portion pertaining to specialization has been expanded significantly to indicate that, in
today’s Army, the specialist has a significant role and responsibility. The instructions highlight the need for the
different officer professional development patterns required for accomplishing the Army’s total mission. Instead of a
single traditionally accepted career pattern through various grades, multiple paths for advancement exist as the Army
recognizes divergent Service needs, and individual capabilities. Further, instructions to promotion boards prescribe that
promotion potential will be determined, for the most part, based on an officer’s record of performance in their
designated branch or FA and the officer’s overall performance.
f. Promotion board membership. Personal qualifications, experience, and performance determine promotion board
membership. Active Army, ASCC, and DRU commanders recommend board members (colonel and below) from lists
provided by the HQDA Secretariat for Selection Boards of eligible candidates who meet qualifications in a broad
spectrum of military fields. Following policy guidance from the Secretary of the Army, membership is designed to
adequately reflect the skills, commands and diversity of the competitive category under consideration. The Director of
Military Personnel Management, DCS, G–1 approves the final slate of members on behalf of the Secretary of the
Army. The Chief of Staff, Army, approves general officer membership.
g. Special selection boards. Special selection boards are convened as required to consider officers with DOR above
or in the promotion zone that were erroneously omitted from consideration or whose official records contained material
errors seen by the original board. Erroneous entries or omissions on the ORB generally do not justify reconsideration
by a special selection board. The officer’s responsibility to review his or her ORB at least annually and the provision of
AR 600–8–29 entitling officers in the ZOC to submit a letter to the president of the board are considered sufficient
opportunity to overcome minor administrative deficiencies.

Chapter 6
Officer Evaluation System
6–1. Overview
a. The OES identifies those officers most qualified for advancement and assignment to positions of increased
responsibility. Under this system officers are evaluated on their performance and potential through duty evaluations,
school evaluations, and HQDA evaluations (both central selection boards and AHRC officer management assessments).
b. The assessment of an officer’s potential is a subjective judgment of the officer’s capability to perform at a
specified level of responsibility, authority, or sensitivity. Potential is normally associated with the capability to perform

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

33

at a higher grade. However, the Army also assesses the officer’s potential for retention and increased responsibility
within a specified grade.
c. Officer qualifications provide the real link between the needs of the Army and individual officer performance.
They focus on an officer’s background in terms of experience and expertise and include such items as specialty
qualification, successful performance in demanding positions, civil and military schooling, and physical profile.
Performance is the execution of tasks in support of the organization or Army missions. While results or accomplishment of a series of tasks is the primary focus, the manner in which tasks are approached and a general adherence to
officer corps professional values are also important. The performance assessment by HQDA differs significantly from
that accomplished in the organizational duty environment. The organizational duty assessment involves personal
knowledge of the situations surrounding a specific performance for a specified period of time. The HQDA assessment
is accomplished by an after-the-fact assessment of a series of reports on performance over a variety of duty positions
and covering the officer’s entire career.
6–2. Officer Evaluation Reporting System
a. The Officer Evaluation Reporting System is a subsystem of the OES. It includes the methods and procedures for
organizational evaluation and assessment of an officer’s performance and an estimation of potential for future Service
based on the manner of that performance.
b. The official documents of these assessments are the OER and the AER.
(1) The performance evaluation contained on the OER is for a specific rating period only. It focuses on comparing
the officer’s performance with the duty position requirements and the standards of the rating officials. Performance
includes the methods or means of effort used by an officer in accomplishing tasks assigned by superiors or implied by
the duty position. The results of his or her efforts or degree of task accomplishment and the degree of compliance with
the professional norms or values that apply to all officers regardless of duty position, grade, or specialty.
(2) The potential evaluation contained on the OER is a projection of the performance accomplished during the rating
period into future circumstances that encompass greater responsibilities. The primary focus of this assessment is the
capability of the officer to meet increasing levels of responsibility in relation to his or her peers.
(3) The AER is prepared for officers who take part in resident and nonresident training at Service schools and
civilian educational institutions. It explains the accomplishments, potential, and limitations of students while attending
courses. Only one AER is authorized for each reporting period.
c. The OERS is directly linked to the OPMS. Raters and senior raters are required to record a FA and branch
recommendation in Parts Vc and VIId respectively on each OER rendered for an ACC captain. These rating chain
recommendations, given by rating officials over a series of OERs, will provide pertinent information for FDBs.
6–3. Relationship with Officer Personnel Management System, leader development, and character
development process
a. The primary function of the OERS is to provide information from the organizational chain of command to be
used by HQDA for officer personnel decisions. The information contained in the OER is correlated with the Army’s
needs and individual officer qualifications. It provides the basis for OPMS personnel actions such as promotion,
branch, and FA designation, elimination, retention in grade, retention on Active Duty, reduction in force, command and
project manager designation, school selection, assignment, and specialty designation.
b. An equally important function of the OERS is to encourage the professional development of the officer corps. To
accomplish this, the system uses the Army’s leadership doctrine to relate teaching, coaching, counseling and assessing
values, attributes, skills and actions to performance, and professional development. The OER also requires rater and
senior rater input regarding FAs and, unique/special qualifications and future positions (Parts Vc and VIId) that
strongly support OPMS indoctrination throughout the officer corps. Particularly valuable is the developmental counseling fostered through senior officers linking the Army’s evaluation system to its leader development and personnel
management systems. Developmental counseling is the responsibility of senior officers to provide feedback concerning
professional growth, potential, and career pathways to success. While these aspects of developmental counseling
through mentorship have always been a major element of the evaluation process, they must be continually emphasized.
c. Raters will conduct periodic follow-up performance counseling with rated officer to make needed adjustments to
objectives utilizing the DA Form 67–9–1 (Officer Evaluation Support Form). For lieutenants/WO1s quarterly counseling is mandatory; for captain/CW2, goal is once around midpoint (3–6 months); field grade and CW3/CW4/CW5
follow-up counseling is on an as needed basis.
d. Raters will conduct mandatory, quarterly follow-up performance/developmental counseling with their lieutenants/
WO1s utilizing the DA Form 67–91A, Officer Developmental Support Form (ODSF), to adjust/update performance
objectives and developmental tasks on both the support form and the ODSF. The requirement of the box check Part
IVd, ODSF, is for the rater to evaluate the rated officer’s compliance with the ODSF requirements if the rated officer
rates lieutenants/WO1s. If the rated officer does not rate lieutenants/WO1s, the "NA" block should be checked.
e. The OERS support form process provides further impetus to continual two-way communication so that the rated
officer is made aware of the specific nature of his or her duties and is provided an opportunity to participate in the

34

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

organizational planning process. The rater uses the communication to give direction and development to subordinates,
to obtain information about the status and progress of the organization, and to systematically plan for accomplishing
the mission. The senior/subordinate communication process also facilitates the discussion of career guidance with the
rated officer, to include the decision process for his or her future OPMS branch or FA. This enables the rated officer to
take advantage of the superior’s experience when making FA, or assignment related decisions.
f. All access to WO1 OERS is restricted after selection to CW3. Restricted access will be accomplished by moving
all WO1 OERS (DA Forms 67–8 and 67–9) and associated documents from the ’performance’ ("P") section to the
’restricted’ ("R") section of the OMPF. Simultaneously, the WO1 hard copy OERS and associated documents will be
removed from the CMIF. This will effectively remove from a WO’s performance file, information which, may simply
be a reflection of an initial learning curve, and thereby preclude its use for personnel management decisions later in an
officer’s career. These functions will occur during the month following the release of the CW3 promotion list.
g. All access to second lieutenant OERs is restricted upon promotion to the rank of captain. All second lieutenant
OERs are moved from the performance ("P") section to the restricted ("R") section of an officer’s OMPF. Simultaneously, second lieutenant OERS are also removed from each officer’s CMIF, the file managed by career managers
at AHRC.
h. Completion of Part VIIb, of the OERS, (DA Form 67–9) is not required for CW5s being evaluated under the
provisions of AR 623–3. Complete guidance for CW5 evaluation reports may be found in AR 623–3, chapter 3.
i. Part VIIb of the OER (DA Form 67–9) will not be completed for company grade officers (lieutenant and captain)
and CW5, WO1, CW2. The Army’s focus for company grade branch commissioned officers and junior grade WOs is
on developing leadership skills, technical management competency and fostering closer unit cohesion. At the grade of
CW5, developmental guidance is considered unnecessary. Commanders will employ expanded developmental plans and
counseling tools for all their officers below the major and CW3 levels as part of a more flexible officer development
process documented through the ODSF (DA From 67–9–1a). Senior rater profiling will still be an important tool for
use in rating officers at the grades of majors and CW3 and higher.
j. For further information on the OES, see AR 623–3.

Chapter 7
Reserve Component officer Development and Career Management
7–1. Introduction
a. This chapter discusses the unique aspects of leader development, professional development and career management of ARNG and USAR officers. It also details how Army RC officers are affected by OPMS revisions.
b. The RCs of the Army include the ARNG and the USAR. When not in a Federalized status (under Federal
control), the ARNG comes under control of the states, the territories of Guam and the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or the District of Columbia. The USAR is a Federal force within the DA.
c. The ARNG and the USAR operate under separate and distinct systems according to specific laws and regulations.
However, since the purpose of the RC is to augment the Active Army in times of need, it is imperative that the
implementation of these laws and regulations allow for the seamless integration of RC units and individuals into the
active force.
7–2. General description of the Reserve Components
a. The RC consists of three categories; the Ready Reserve, the Standby Reserve, and the Retired Reserve. All
Reserve and Guard manpower is assigned to one of these three categories. This chapter focuses on the Ready Reserve.
b. The Ready Reserve is the largest category in the RC and contains the overwhelming majority of pre-trained
military manpower to augment the Active Army in time of war or national emergency. The Ready Reserve consists of
the Selected Reserve, the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) and the Inactive National Guard (ING).
(1) The Selected Reserve consists of the following:
(a) Units manned and equipped to serve and/or train either as operational or as augmentation units. Operational units
train and serve as units; augmentation units train together, but when mobilized, lose their unit identity, being subsumed
into an active unit or activity. Soldiers assigned to Army Reserve and ARNG units fall into this category, which is
divided into two subgroups:
1. TPU reservists. Trained unit members who participate in unit training activities on part time basis. These Soldiers
are required to perform (drill) 48 unit training assemblies (UTAs) per year and 14 days (15 days for ARNG) per year
in annual training (AT) status. These members are in a paid status while performing these duties.
2. Active Guard Reserve (AGR). AGR status is defined as officers serving in an Active Duty status for at least 180
days, performing administrative and training duties in direct support of the ARNG and USAR. These are Guard or
Reserve members of the Selected Reserve who are ordered to Active Duty or full-time National Guard duty for the

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

35

purpose of organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the RC units. The primary objective of the
AGR program is to improve the readiness of the RC.
(b) The training pipeline (non-deployable account) consists of selected Reserve enlisted Soldiers who have not yet
completed initial Active Duty for training (IADT), all officers who are in training for professional categories,
undergraduate flying training, chaplain candidates, health profession students, early commissioning program participants, and cadets enrolled in the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP).
(c) Individual Mobilization Augmentation (IMA) (USAR only) are trained individuals assigned to an Active Army,
Selective Service System, or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) organization’s billet that must be filled
on or shortly after mobilization. Officers assigned to this control group perform at least 12 days of AT each year and
are assigned to a specific duty position in an Active Army unit or organization.
(2) The IRR (USAR only) consists of those Army Reserve Ready Reservists who are not in the Selected Reserve.
The IRR is a manpower pool comprised principally of individuals having had training, having served previously on
Active Duty or in the Selected Reserve, and having some period of their military Service obligation remaining or
another contractual commitment. Members voluntarily may participate in training for retirement points and promotions
with or without pay. IRR members may be (but are not presently) required to meet the same training requirements as
Selected Reservists. Required training (involuntary) may not exceed 30 days a year.
(a) Control group—AT. Ready Reserve officers with a training obligation, but who do not belong to an USAR unit.
They must perform AT when so directed.
(b) Control group—Reinforcement. All other non-unit Ready Reserve officers not assigned to another control group.
(c) Control group—Officer Active Duty obligor. Active duty officers who are appointed in the USAR but do not
enter onto Active Duty at the time of their appointment. These officers maintain their obligated status and may be
ordered to Active Duty or duty with an ARNG or USAR unit.
(d) Control group—Dual component. Active Army of the United States enlisted Soldiers or WOs who hold USAR
commissions or warrants.
(3) The ING (ARNG only) consists of ARNG personnel in an inactive status in the Ready Reserve, not in the
Selected Reserve, attached to a specific ARNG unit. To remain ING members, they muster once a year with their
assigned unit, but do not participate in training activities. ING Soldiers are considered mobilization assets of the unit.
Similar to other IRR, some ING members have legal and contractual obligations. ING members muster once a year but
may not participate in training activities for points or pay and are not eligible for promotion.
c. The Retired Reserve is comprised of all Reserve officers and enlisted personnel who receive retired pay on the
basis of Active Duty and/or reserve Service; all Reserve officers and enlisted personnel who are otherwise eligible for
retired pay, but have not reached age 60 and who have not elected discharge and are not voluntary members of the
Ready or Standby Reserve; and other retired reservists. All retired members who have completed at least 20 years
Active Duty (Regular or Reserve), regardless of the retired list to which assigned, may be ordered to Active Duty
involuntarily whenever required as determined by the Secretary of the Army in accordance with 10 USC 688 or
voluntarily under the authority of 10 USC 12301(d).
7–3. Company and field grade Officer Personnel Management System—Army National Guard and U.S.
Army Reserve
a. The purpose of OPMS–ARNG and OPMS–USAR is to effectively and efficiently manage assigned company and
field grade officers through the personnel proponent life cycle development models. The effective implementation of
the RC OPMS increases the effectiveness and professionalism of the USAR and ARNG officer corps by producing
officers who meet the same qualifications as their Active Army counterparts, and who are able to perform effectively
in their branch or FA as a part of the Total Army team. All branches and FAs in the Active Army under OPMS are
open to the RC and are reflected in the RC force structure. One variance from the Active Army implementation of
OPMS is the FA alignment designation process which requires modification to accommodate ARNG and USAR unique
personnel management considerations.
b. RC OPMS is the cornerstone of the professional development and utilization programs for all RC company and
field grade officers. Its goal is to develop RC officers in the right numbers and skills to meet the functional
requirements of the Army in the event of mobilization, as well as to develop officers with technical, managerial,
administrative, and leader skills to serve in positions of increasing responsibility throughout the DOD. While the goals
of OPMS for the RC are the same as those for the officer on the ADL, laws, and regulations specific to the ARNG and
USAR affect its implementation. Accordingly, OPMS is divided into the following two subprograms for RC implementation purposes:
(1) OPMS-ARNG is a function of the state, within the guidance and policies established by HQDA and NGB.
(2) OPMS-USAR is administered by the AHRC–St. Louis in St. Louis, MO. AHRC-St. Louis manages all USAR
officers not serving in the Active Army, regardless of the component or control group to which they are currently
assigned. More specific guidance for OPMS-USAR is addressed in AR 135–175 and AR 140–10, and for the Active
Guard Reserve Program in AR 135–18.
c. Commanders play a significant role in the development of subordinate officers. With the reduction of personnel

36

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

resources, the RCs will select only the best-qualified officers for leadership positions. The RCs will consider officers
for command and high-level staff positions regardless of their component affiliation. Cross component consideration
ensures that the RCs continue to select and train the best-qualified officers for these positions.
7–4. Application of Officer Personnel Management System to Army National Guard and Army reserve
company and field grade officers
a. Implementation. The implementation of the ROPMA in 1996 brought the RC company and field grade officer
promotion systems in synchronization with the Active Army. It established a best-qualified promotion system for RC
officers, replacing the fully qualified system previously used.
b. OPMS–ARNG. This system identifies positions and officers to fill those positions. The essential element of
OPMS–ARNG is to match the qualifications of the officer with the requirements of the position as found in
authorization documents. Constraints in applying the OPMS system to the ARNG include the geographical location of
the state force structure and the limited size of the state officer inventory. OPMS–ARNG, when properly executed,
develops officers in adequate numbers, and assigns officers according to the needs of the ARNG in each state by
considering mission requirements in conjunction with the individual officer’s competence and desires. OPMS–ARNG
provides for the most efficient utilization and maximizes the professional satisfaction of each officer.
c. OPMS–USAR. USAR career management and officer development objectives are to—
(1) Develop USAR officers in the required numbers and grades and with the right skills to satisfy the mobilization
requirements of America’s Army, taking maximum advantage of the inherent abilities, attributes, and skills of the
individual officer.
(2) Assign officers according to the best interests of the USAR’s needs and the officer’s competence and desires.
However, the needs of the Army are primary.
(3) Improve the motivation and professional competence of the USAR officer corps.
7–5. Professional development
a. ARNG.
(1) The significant difference between OPMS–ARNG and similar systems in the USAR and Active Army is in the
decentralization of OPMS responsibility. OPMS–ARNG is a function of the state within the guidance and policies
established by HQDA and the National Guard Bureau (NGB).
(a) Within those guidelines, the objective is to develop officers in adequate numbers and with the right skills to fully
satisfy ARNG requirements while maximizing and taking advantage of each officer’s inherent skills and abilities.
(b) Duty assignments are made at the state level based on the force structure of the state, officers available to fill
vacancies, unit readiness, and geographic considerations.
(c) Appointments, promotions, branch transfers, evaluations, separations, and other similar personnel actions are
administered by the state.
(2) Officers, boards, commanders, and personnel managers should be aware of the uniqueness of the RC environment and the implications of citizen Soldiering. The concepts of equivalent assignment and constructive credit must be
understood. There are numerous leadership positions within the state ARNG structure that do not fall into the
traditional definition of TOE/TDA command. Lieutenant level through general officer level leadership and command
positions should be recognized, desired as potential assignments, and considered in promotion and selection board
procedures. There are also TDA staff positions that equate with battalion and brigade staff positions. These are
considered equivalent positions.
(3) Many ARNG officers are leaders in industry, the community, and in the corporate world. Many positions in
corporations provide training and experience not only useful to the military, but closely related to military specialty
skills officers at all levels should be sensitive to the relationship between civilian occupations and training and military
skills. Being the financial officer for a corporation certainly provides evidence of qualification as a military finance
officer. Leadership in a civilian occupation provides evidence of potential for military leadership positions. These are
examples of constructive credit possibilities that should be considered in determining an officer’s qualification for
branch and FA designation, and award of areas of concentration and skills. AR 611–1, chapter 4 provides guidance for
evaluating civilian education and occupation experience in the classification of ARNG officers. Officers may also apply
for constructive or equivalent credit for military education courses in accordance with AR 135–155.
(4) The Officer Personnel Classification Board (OPCB) can determine an officer to be qualified in his or her duty
position; however, the officer may not be considered fully qualified until meeting other related criteria in this pamphlet
(for example, 12 months Service in an FA assignment or 36 months as a commander). The officer does not have to be
considered fully qualified in his or her BR–AOC or FA–AOC to be considered for favorable personnel actions.
Additional requirements beyond the mandatory military education for award of the AOC will not preclude the officer
from being promoted or reassigned.
b. USAR.
(1) The development of the professional attributes and capabilities of USAR officers to meet the mobilization needs
of the Army is known as officer professional development. While USAR officers share the same mission as their

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

37

Active Army counterparts, the unique nature of the USAR Soldier’s role as a citizen Soldier poses a challenge for
professional development. However, USAR officers are expected to follow Active Army officer development patterns
as closely as possible, except that USAR officers, in some instances, have increased windows to complete mandatory
educational requirements. To meet professional development objectives, USAR officers may need to rotate among
TPUs, the IRR, and the Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) program. These transfers are necessitated by
geographical considerations, as well as the need to provide as many officers as possible the opportunity to serve with
troops in leadership and staff positions. Additionally, there may be occasions when officers should transfer to the IRR
while they complete mandatory educational requirements. Such transfers will be temporary and should not be seen as
impacting negatively on the officer’s career The success of an officer is not measured by length of Service in any one
component or control group, but by the officers breadth of experience, duty performance, and adherence to branch and
functional requirements.
(2) Many USAR officers are leaders in industry, the community, and in the corporate world. Many positions in
corporations provide training and experience not only useful to the military, but closely related to military specialty
skills. Officers at all levels should be sensitive to the relationship between civilian occupations and training and
military skills. Being the financial officer for a corporation certainly provides evidence of qualification as a military
finance officer. Leadership in a civilian occupation provides evidence of potential for military leadership positions.
These are examples of constructive credit possibilities that should be considered in determining an officer’s qualification for branch and FA designation, and award of areas of concentration and skills. AR 611–1, chapter 4 provides
guidance for evaluating civilian education and occupation experience in the classification of USAR officers. Officers
may also apply for constructive or equivalent credit for military education courses in accordance with AR 135–155.
7–6. Professional development processes
The basic processes of officer professional development are as follows:
a. Leader development.
b. Rotation of assignments, to include planned and progressive assignments between components and control
groups.
c. Continuing education (military and civilian).
d. Branch transfers and FA/skill alignment.
e. Civilian acquired skills.
f. Evaluations.
g. Promotions.
7–7. Leader development
a. The RC leader development program develops the values, attributes, skills, and knowledge of ARNG and USAR
Soldiers to meet the mobilization needs of the Army. RC officers must be properly trained in order to perform
effectively in the event of mobilization. The development of RC officers is a continuous, progressive, and sequential
process made up of three pillars: institutional training, operational assignments, and self-development.
(1) Institutional training. There are varieties of schools, both resident and nonresident, that provide the RC officer
with military educational opportunities. These educational programs, which are designed to increase and update the
professional knowledge of each officer, have the secondary goal of satisfying promotion and assignment prerequisites.
officer military education requirements are shown in table 7–1, below. (For exceptions, see AR 135–155 and NGR
600–101.) Operational experience through duty assignments augments what has been learned in the formal education
process. To the maximum extent possible, RC officers receive operational assignments that allow them to apply the
knowledge and leadership skills learned in institutional training. This is especially critical for company grade officers
and junior WOs. Junior officers should be assigned to troop units. This phase in development is critical to developing
leadership competencies and instilling the Army Values necessary in the officer corps. Careful planning and programming by agencies, commanders, and the individual officer is essential to maximize the career potential and efficient use
of officer skills, knowledge, and attributes. Experience gained through challenging and varied assignments enhances
officer development and provides trained officers able to meet the dynamic needs of the RCs.
(2) The assignment and transfer of officers. The assignment and transfer of officers is a collective effort between the
career management officer, the officer, and his or her unit. The applicable TOE or TDA prescribes the grade, branch,
and MOS requirements for positions to which officers may be assigned. In the RC environment, assignment options are
constrained by the force structure and demographic and geographic limitations. For these reasons, RC officers may
need to accept assignments throughout the Selected Reserve. RC officers must also realize the possibility of occasional
and temporary transfers to the IRR, especially in conjunction with the completion of professional development
education (PDE) requirements. These transfers provide the officer an opportunity to complete required studies without
the distraction of a troop assignment and allow other officers the opportunity to gain troop leadership experience.
(3) Self-development. Each officer has a responsibility for professional development from the time of commissioning
or appointment. Individual study, reading, research, and interpersonal skills development and assessment are critical

38

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

parts of leader development. AGR, Active Duty for special work (ADSW), and Key Personnel Upgrade Program
(KPUP) (ARNG only) are ways to enhance that development.
b. Although it is not specifically one of the domains of leader development, mentorship is the foundation upon
which these domains rest. Mentorship is the act of proactively developing each subordinate through observing,
assessing, coaching, counseling, and evaluating which results in treating people as they should be treated with fairness
and equal opportunity. Mentorship is a critical component of leader development since it is a force multiplier. The
domains of leader development (institutional training, operational assignments, and self-development) primarily affect
the officer. Mentorship affects not only the mentored officer; it sets the tone for the relationship that the mentored
officer will have with those he or she will mentor in the future. The importance of mentorship is enhanced by the
limited amount of time that RC officers will spend in units serving under more senior officers who can serve as
mentors.

7–8. Company and field grade officer career management
a. ARNG.
(1) Career management for ARNG officers is conducted in accordance with HQDA and NGB policy and regulations
and is administered at the state level by authority of the adjutant general. Duty assignments are made at the state level
based on the force structure of the state, available officers, unit readiness requirements, and geographic considerations.
Promotions, branch transfers, evaluations, separations, and other personnel actions are administered by the state within
HQDA and NGB policy guidance. Appointments, branch designations, or changes and promotions require Federal
recognition orders issued from NGB on the recommendation of a Federal recognition board conducted at the state.
(2) The NGB is the conduit between HQDA and the states to ensure that the objectives of OPMS III are fully
incorporated in OPMS–ARNG. The personnel directorate at NGB assists the state adjutants general and their staffs in
administering OPMS–ARNG by establishing policy and guidance reflecting America’s Army systems. The personnel
directorate is the proponent for regulations, policy, and procedures governing OPMS–ARNG.
(3) The state adjutants general oversee the direction and effectiveness of the officer career management programs in
their respective states. This includes the designation of branches and FAs and the awarding of AOCs and skills, as well
as the operation of personnel administration. The adjutant general appoints the state officer personnel manager (OPM),
who is the primary representative of the adjutant general in implementing and administering OPMS-ARNG. The OPM
ensures that all aspects of OPMS–ARNG are administered and serves as the principal advisor to the adjutant general.
The OPM maintains the management records, evaluates the requirements within the state, and monitors the career
development of officers available to fill those requirements. The OPM manages the officer inventory.
(4) Leader development should be emphasized as a primary command responsibility. Commanders at all levels assist
in the administration of OPMS–ARNG by—
(a) Coordinating with the state OPM to develop and properly guide the career of officers in their command.
(b) Recommending assignments according to the qualifications, attributes, potential, and desires of their officers.
(c) Serving as mentors and conducting periodic evaluations and counseling.
(d) Recommending professional development schools and training.
(5) Unit personnel officers, especially at the battalion level, play a vital role in career management for ARNG
officers by—
(a) Maintaining liaison with the state OPM.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(b) Assisting officers in maintaining their records.
(c) Counseling officers concerning requirements for designation of branches and FAs.
(d) Maintaining the military personnel records jacket.
(e) Making recommendations to the commander and the OPM for changes to the personnel status of officers.
(6) The OMPF for all ARNG commissioned officers are maintained at NGB. The OMPF is used by DA selection
boards when considering ARNG officers for promotion under AR 135–155. The appropriate state adjutant general
maintains a field military personnel records jacket for each officer.
(7) The individual officer has the final responsibility for ensuring that he or she is progressing to the maximum level
within OPMS–ARNG. The officer establishes goals and evaluates progress, making the adjustments necessary to
achieve personal goals and professional proficiency.
(8) The designation of special branches and the award of AOCs for AMEDD, Chaplain Corps, and Judge Advocate
General’s Corps officers is a function of HQDA. At the time of application for appointment, the state requests
predetermination, through NGB, of qualifications in the branch in which the applicant wishes to serve. Special branch
officers may be awarded skill indicators if qualified and essential to the actual or potential assignment as determined by
the adjutant general (see NGR 351–1).
b. USAR.
(1) Prior to the implementation of OPMS revisions, career management in the USAR was decentralized and
unfocused. Officers assigned to TPUs essentially managed their own careers by establishing relationships with the unit
and command of assignment. Soldiers in the IRR and IMA programs relied upon the Army Reserve Personnel Center
(AR–PERSCOM, the precursor of AHRC–St. Louis) for administrative and personnel action support; but, there was no
concerted effort to actively manage the careers of officers. Under the auspices of OPMS, AHRC–St. Louis is the
centralized career management agency for all USAR officers not assigned to the Active Army. The key individual in
the career management cycle is the career management officer (CMO). The CMO has the duty of developing the most
professionally competent USAR officers possible by consistently providing meaningful training opportunities and
assignments for officers within their areas of management responsibility. Additionally, the CMO provides valuable and
realistic guidance through individual counseling regarding the officer’s educational requirements and prospective
assignments to career enhancing positions relative to his or her professional development goals. OPM ensures that
sufficient numbers of highly qualified USAR officers are available to meet mobilization requirements and to assume
positions of increasing responsibility. To accomplish this, the CMO ensures that the intellectual and professional
growth of all officers meets Army needs.
(2) Although the CMO is a key agent in career management, the officer is primarily responsible for his or her own
career. The successful management of USAR officers requires a full and ongoing partnership between the CMO and
the officers he or she manages. It is essential the lines of communication between the CMO and the officer remain
open and bi-directional at all times. USAR officers must fully understand the requirements to remain highly competitive in the ROPMA environment. Further, officers must take steps to remain mobilization ready at all times. An USAR
officer who is not mobilization ready is not an asset to the Army and will not have a future in America’s Army.
7–9. Warrant officer career management
Career management is of critical importance to the modern RC WO. Most RC WOs have their civilian goals and
projections programmed several years into the future. However, coordinated management of RC WOs’ military careers
is a recent innovation. The modern RC WO is a complex person with numerous skills and disciplines, both civilian and
military. The need for a thorough, professionally designed leader development plan is both obvious and imperative.
The career RC WO must be well trained to fill his or her mobilization role.
a. ARNG.
(1) The ARNG WO career management is the responsibility of the State Adjutants General.
(2) The NGB communicates DA policy to the State Adjutants General in all matters concerning WO career
management.
(3) Leader development is a primary command responsibility. Commanders at all levels assist in the administration
of WOLDAP–ARNG by coordinating with the OPM to develop and properly guide the career of each officer in their
command, recommending assignments according to qualifications, aptitudes, potential and desires of their officers,
serving as mentors, conducting periodic evaluations and counseling, and recommending leader development schools
and training.
(4) Organization personnel officers, especially at battalion level, play a vital role in career management for ARNG
WOs. The responsibilities of the personnel officer include maintaining liaison with the OPM, assisting WOs in
maintaining their records, counseling WOs concerning requirements for designation of MOS and FAs, maintaining the
military personnel records jacket, and making recommendations to the commander and the MPMO for changes to the
personnel status of WOs.
(5) Warrant officers have the final responsibility for ensuring they are progressing satisfactorily in their professional
development. They establish goals and evaluate progress, making necessary adjustments to achieve personal goals and
professional proficiency.

40

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(6) The OMPFs for all ARNG WOs are maintained at NGB. The appropriate State Adjutant General office
maintains a field military personnel record jacket for each WO.
(7) The Adjutant General of the State establishes unit location and stationing.
b. USAR.
(1) Commanders and personnel management officers (PMOs) are charged with the duty of developing the most
professionally competent USAR WOs possible by consistently providing meaningful training opportunities for the WOs
within their area of management responsibility. The PMO has training programs available which are designed to
provide a balance of military experience during each USAR WO’s career.
(2) The TPU is one important training vehicle. In the TPU, WOs gain the operational assignment experience
necessary for leader development. In this area, commanders must be closely involved with the developmental process
of their subordinate WOs by offering progressive and sequential assignments and ensuring that appropriate skills,
knowledge, and attitudes are developed.
(3) A balance must be maintained between assignments to TPUs and assignments within the IRR. Diversity of
assignment reduces the probability of narrow, limited training and assignment experience. Stagnation in any category
of assignment can be counterproductive to the development of the individual officer, as well as improperly utilizing the
availability of assignments to enhance the professional capability of the entire WO corps.
(4) In the IRR, the WO is able to "update" his/her background by training with the Active Army in progressive CF
assignments. This type of assignment is called "counterpart training." IMA assignments may also be available.
c. WO management considerations.
(1) ARNG. To properly plan for the development and assignment of WOs into positions of increasing responsibility,
it is necessary to have an overview of the State force structure and an inventory of WO positions. States develop a
State Master Development Plan (SMDP) as a tool for this purpose. The SMDP allows for analysis of all MOSs
authorized by state force structure documents to determine career progression patterns for WOs within the state. The
SMDP is used to determine how many WOs in each MOS the Adjutant General needs to develop. The proper
selection, training, and utilization of WOs is dependent on each state’s military occupational specialty requirements.
Institutional training must be completed at the appropriate WO career point, the best-qualified WOs must receive
progressive operational assignments in recognition of their demonstrated skills, and all WOs must be aware of their
responsibility to achieve the highest possible goals of self-development.
(a) All WOs are assigned according to individual qualifications that are properly documented.
(b) The professional capabilities of all WOs are developed through planned and progressively responsible assignments. This ensures a sufficient number of qualified WOs at all times to accomplish assigned missions.
(c) All WOs have equal opportunity for promotion selection and for higher assignments on the basis of their
demonstrated abilities.
(d) All WOs are aware of the guidelines and expectations in their career planning.
(2) USAR. Decisions on assignments will be made on the basis of the "whole person" concept and unit requirements.
Military training priorities must be integrated with the officer’s civilian job and personal/community responsibilities.
(a) The PMO will ensure that the background information on each WO is complete. Each record will be reviewed to
determine the extent and quality of activity during Service. Those IRR officers without recent active participation may
be programmed for counterpart training, if available, with an Active Army unit prior to consideration for assignment to
a troop unit.
(b) Warrant officers serving in the IRR will be considered for reassignment to a TPU or an IMA assignment based
on the following factors. The PMO must ensure that officers have the prerequisite and, when appropriate, civilian
schooling required to prepare them for the reassignment.
1. Availability and type of TPUs within a reasonable commuting distance (see AR 140–1), normally within a 50mile radius or a 90 minute travel time. Distance is based on travel by car, one way, under normal traffic, weather, and
road conditions over the most direct route to the WO’s home or current residence.
2. Prior experience, both Active Army and RC, and the level of this experience compared to a typical WO of the
same grade, MOS/FA, and age.
3. CF and level of military schooling or potential to acquire the required skills within 3 years of assignment.
4. Amount of time the WO can make available for military activities and officer’s preferences for types of
assignments.
7–10. Career management life cycle
a. WO1. An officer appointed by warrant with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position
given by the Secretary of the Army. WO1s are basic level, technically and tactically focused officers who perform the
primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, and advisor. They also perform any
other branch-related duties assigned to them. They also provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. WO1s have specific responsibility for accomplishing the
missions and tasks assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility for
how well their command performs its mission. WO1s primarily support levels of operations from team through
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

41

battalion, requiring interaction with all Soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide leader development, mentorship, and counsel to enlisted Soldiers and NCOs. The appropriate WOBC must be completed within 2 years of
appointment to be a mobilization asset and remain in the ARNG and USAR.
b. CW2. A commissioned officer with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by
the Secretary of the Army. CW2s are intermediate level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties
of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, and advisor. They also perform any other branchrelated duties assigned to them. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for
subordinates to perform their duties. They have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions and tasks
assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility for how well their
command performs its mission. CW2s primarily support levels of operations from team through battalion, requiring
interaction with all Soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and
counsel to NCOs, other WOs and company-grade branch officers.
c. CW3. A commissioned officer with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by
the Secretary of the Army. CW3s are advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of
technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other
branch-related duties assigned to them. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision
necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. CW3s have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions
and tasks assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility for how well
their command performs its mission. CW3s primarily support levels of operations from team through brigade, requiring
interaction with all Soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and
counsel to NCOs, other WOs, and branch officers. CW3s advise commanders on WO issues.
d. CW4. A commissioned officer with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by
the Secretary of the Army. CW4s are senior level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of
technical leader, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other branch-related
duties assigned to them. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for
subordinates to perform their duties. CW4s have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions and tasks
assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility for how well their
command performs its mission. They primarily support battalion, brigade, division, corps, and echelons above corps
operations. They must interact with NCOs, other officers, primary staff, and special staff. CW4s primarily provide
leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs, other WOs, and branch officers. They have special
mentorship responsibilities for other WOs and provide essential advice to commanders on WO issues.
e. CW5. A commissioned officer with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by
the Secretary of the Army. CW5s are master level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of
technical leader, manager, integrator, advisor, or any other particular duty prescribed by branch. They provide
direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. CW5s
have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions and tasks assigned to them. CW5s primarily support
brigade, division, corps, echelons above corps, and major command operations. They must interact with NCOs, other
officers, primary staff, and special staff. They provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to WOs
and branch officers. CW5s have special WO leadership and representation responsibilities within their respective
commands. They provide essential advice to commanders on WO issues.
f. Lieutenant. This period of an RC officer’s career is predominantly developmental in nature. The officer is
educated in branch and leadership skills and should acquire maximum practical experience through assignment to troop
units. BOLC all phases must be completed within 2 years of commissioning for an officer to be a mobilization asset
and remain in the USAR and ARNG. A baccalaureate degree from an accredited educational institution is required for
promotion to captain.
g. Captain. RC captains gain advanced leadership experience, be afforded branch development opportunities and
begin development in a FA. The CCC may be completed in residence or in a RC Configured Course (RC3). The
minimum grade requirement for attendance at CCC is first lieutenant. Company command and battalion staff experience are desired during this period. Branch developmental requirements vary from proponent to proponent. Most
proponents require company level command or key staff experience in branches with limited command opportunity and
completion of CCC for branch development.
h. Major. As a major, the RC officer continues to develop in his or her branch and FA. Utilization in the FA may
occur during this period as the officer acquires staff and leadership experience and knowledge appropriate to levels of
higher responsibility. Opportunities exist for officers to serve as a company commander, XO or S3 in an Active Army
unit, USAR, or ARNG unit. These opportunities warrant the same consideration regardless of whether the unit is
Active Army, USAR, or ARNG. A qualified major is one who has completed at least 50 percent of ILE or has
completed the Advanced Logistics Executive Development Course/Logistics Executive Development Course (ALEDC/
LEDC), as appropriate, for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
i. Lieutenant colonel. At the lieutenant colonel level, the RC officer applies the skills in his or her branch or FA in
management and leadership positions of greater responsibility. Senior staff and command experience are desired at this
level. Effective 1 October 1993, lieutenant colonels that have not completed the ILE common core Course within 3
42

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

years of promotion are subject to removal from active status. Completion of the ILE common core Course is necessary
for assignment as brigade executive officer or brigade S3 and for promotion to colonel. Completions of the ILE
common core Course and branch precommand courses (PCC) are also required for assignment at battalion level or
higher command positions. The Chief of Staff, Army, may waive the branch PCC requirements for command. Even
with a waiver, the officer still must complete the ILE common core Course and branch PCC within the first year of
command or be subject to removal from command.
j. Colonel. At the colonel level, the officer applies the skills in his or her branch or FA in management or leadership
positions of greater responsibility. HQDA, DOD, and Joint staff, as well as command experience, are desired at this
level. Effective 1 October 1996, SSC became a prerequisite for promotion to general officer. Officers selected for
brigade command have the same branch PCC requirements as battalion commanders.
7–11. Management considerations
a. ARNG.
(1) General. To properly plan for the development and assignment of officers into positions of increasing responsibility, an overview of the state force structure and an inventory of officer positions is necessary. States develop an
SMDP as a tool for this purpose. The SMDP allows for analysis of all branches authorized by state force structure
documents to determine career progression patterns for officers within the state. The SMDP is used to determine how
many officers in each branch, FA, and AOC the adjutant general needs to develop.
(2) Career planning. Orderly career planning provides for progressive duty assignments and military schooling to
meet current needs and develop officer skills for future assignments. The success of the officer career planning and
management program is dependent upon policies and plans that ensure—
(a) All officers are assigned according to individual qualifications that are properly documented.
(b) The professional capabilities of all officers are developed through planned and progressively responsible assignments. This ensures a sufficient number of qualified officers are available at all times to accomplish assigned missions.
(c) All officers have equal opportunity for promotion selection and for higher assignments based on their demonstrated abilities.
(d) All officers are aware of the guidelines and expectations concerning career planning.
b. USAR.
(1) Previous Active Duty assignments. When evaluating an officer’s Active Duty assignments, consideration should
be given to the duty positions held by the officer, as well as his or her experience level. Active duty experience should
be capitalized upon by assigning these officers to positions in which they can share their experiences and expertise.
(2) Experience. The officer’s record should be reviewed for previous assignments, the level of assignment, command and staff experience, Active Duty for training (ADT) assignments, and other RC oriented training.
(3) Military education. The officer’s record should be reviewed for military schools that have been completed.
Enrollment into resident and nonresident schools should be accomplished in a timely manner to ensure successful
completion of military education requirements. Education that incurs a Service obligation must be fulfilled in either the
unit that sent the officer or in a like-type unit. Although CMOs are not responsible for ensuring that managed officers
complete the requirements, they play an important role in monitoring the officer’s progress until the course is
successfully completed.
(4) Civilian background. CMOs should evaluate the officer’s civilian education and occupational background for
potential skills, knowledge, and attributes that have military applications. Consideration may be given for designation
of a skill identifier for a civilian-acquired skill.
(5) Level of participation. The most critical factor in an officer’s development is his or her willingness to participate
in leader development over an extended period of time. The successful USAR officer keeps his or her CMO informed
of the type of duty, training, and education that best conforms to the officer’s attributes, interests, and professional
development needs. Although statutory and regulatory requirements for participation in education and training exist, the
USAR remains a volunteer organization. Ideally, every officer participates in educational opportunities to the maximum
extent possible within the funding constraints that exist within the USAR environment. It is also realized that USAR
officers are constrained by civilian employment, Family considerations, and community responsibilities. However,
USAR officers must make every attempt to participate consistently in training and education opportunities. Failure to
do so may result in the officer’s administrative elimination from the Service through either voluntary or involuntary
means (board action).
(6) Branch officers serving in command positions. USAR officers must meet branch criteria for the type of unit they
will command. This requirement is fundamental to our America’s Army concept; therefore, requesting a waiver from
this requirement is strongly discouraged. Officers can request a waiver through their chain of command and CMO to
the Chief, Army Reserve. In the absence of compelling reasons, approval of the request is not likely.
(7) Reassignment—IRR. Officers serving in the IRR are considered for placement in a TPU position or an IMA
assignment based upon current position availability and the officer’s career progression needs. The CMO ensures that
officers have the military and civilian schooling necessary for TPU or IMA assignments, while taking the following
factors into consideration:

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

43

(a) Availability and type of TPUs within a reasonable commuting distance. Officers are assigned according to
established procedures using the request vacancy system (see AR 140–1 and applicable directives).
(b) Availability and type of IMA assignments currently available.
(c) Prior experience (both Active Army and RC) and the level of this experience compared to a typical officer of the
same grade, branch, FA, and TIS/TIG.
(d) CF and level of military and civilian schooling or potential to acquire the necessary skills within 3 years of
assignment.
(e) Officer’s AT control group affiliation. (Obligated members of the annual training control group or officer Active
Duty obligor control group may be involuntarily assigned to a TPU or IMA position vacancy.)
(8) Reassignment—TPU officers. A thorough review of an officer’s file will be completed upon transfer to the IRR
and the officer should be prepared to discuss future career development needs and type of assignments desired. An
officer in the IRR should continue to seek training opportunities to remain current in branch and/or FA skills.
7–12. Individual Mobilization Augmentee/Drilling Individual Mobilization Augmentee assignments
(Army Reserve)
a. General. USAR officers fill a number of key positions throughout the DOD and other Governmental agencies.
These positions are used to rapidly expand the agencies during the early phases of mobilization. Pre-selected, specially
qualified officers are assigned to these positions and are trained during peacetime to augment the commands and
agencies to enhance mission accomplishment upon mobilization. These officers are called IMAs/DIMAs and are
assigned to Army Reserve Control Group—IMA in a Selected Reserve status. IMAs are given pre-mobilization
orientation and qualification training for the positions to which they are attached. This is accomplished during 12-day
annual training tours. Officers assigned as DIMA receive an additional 12 days of training per year in an IDT status,
which are performed with their unit or organization of attachment. These tours are coordinated between the unit or
organization, the CMO and the officer. (For further guidance on the IMA program, see AR 140–145.)
b. Training. IMA officers training requirements are coordinated through the gaining agency. All requests for training
in lieu of, or in addition to, annual training tours are submitted on DA Form 1058–R (Application for Active Duty for
Training, Active Duty for Special Work, Temporary Tour of Active Duty, and Annual Training for Soldiers of the
Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve) through the proponent agency to Commander, AHRC–St. Louis,
ATTN: ARPC–PL, 1 Reserve Way, St. Louis, MO 63132. AHRC–St. Louis publishes orders if the unit or organization
concurs and funds are available. Units or organizations should provide IMA/DIMA officers the opportunity to
participate by completing projects for retirement credit throughout the year.
c. Federal employees. Federal employees are declared available for mobilization by their employing command or
agency. As IMA officers, DA civilian employees may not hold IMA positions with the same HQDA general or special
staff element in which they are employed. USAR members should report employment conflicts to their proponent
agencies and AHRC–St. Louis CMOs when they occur.
7–13. Company and field grade officer education
a. Resident courses. RC officers are authorized to attend resident Army Service schools to become qualified in their
present or projected assignments as funds and allocations allow. Attendance at resident Service schools is the preferred
option for all RC officers since it allows for peer-to-peer interaction and an ongoing exchange of ideas and experiences. It also allows RC officers to interact with their Active Army counterparts and provide them with information
about the RC. It is understood, however, that not all RC officers will be able to attend all Service schools in residence
due to budgetary, time or training seat constraints. For this reason, type of school attendance (resident or nonresident)
is not a discriminator for promotion or duty assignment in the RC. Officers may also attend courses that contribute to
the military proficiency of the unit or enhance their specific abilities Directives from the TRADOC and the NGB
provide information concerning courses of instruction offered at Army schools and various agencies in DOD.
b. Nonresident courses. With the exception of the BOLC, military schools may be taken through nonresident
courses, TASS, and through correspondence courses. CCC and ILE are available in both TASS and nonresident
versions. The CMOs at AHRC–St. Louis (for USAR) and the state OPM (for ARNG) should ensure that officers are
enrolled in military education courses in a timely manner to ensure that all RC officers remain fully competitive for
promotion and assignment considerations. Table 7–2, below, discusses the options available for RC officers to
complete their military education and the amount of time that each officer has to complete the nonresident instruction
after enrollment before being dropped from the school.
c. Branch and FA educational requirements. All RC officers are designated a branch upon appointment. Branching
decisions are made based upon the needs of the Army, although officer preference is considered. Branching is usually
determined prior to commissioning, although RC officers can be re-branched at any time based upon the needs of the
Service until they attend BOLC; at which point their branch is fixed. Once an officer has attended BOLC, he or she
cannot be re-branched until they have either attended another BOLC II or completed other branch development courses
(such as CCC).

44

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(1) BOLC. All officers attend BOLC in his or her branch to meet branch development and mobilization requirements; no alternative training method is available. Although attendance at BOLC immediately after commissioning is
preferable, RC officers must complete BOLC within two years of commissioning.
(2) CCC. RC officers will generally attend CCC between their 5th and 12th YOS. There are two ways RC captains
may fulfill their PME requirements; attend the Active Army version of CCC or attend a CCC (RC) which consists of
two, two-week ADTs spaced one year apart, plus up to 295 hours of advanced distributed learning.
(3) FA training. RC officers may apply for FA designation once promoted to captain. Although a FA is not a
branch, it is an area of specialization requiring additional training or experience. Many courses provided through the
DOD and in the civilian community support FA training and qualification, as does civilian work experience. For
example, some officers are qualified as Operations Research/Systems Analysts (ORSA) in their civilian profession; yet
do not possess the ORSA (FA 49) FA. Since this FA is chronically short throughout the Army, these officers will be
strongly encouraged to apply for it based on their civilian experience. FA selection is therefore based on such factors as
the officer’s experience and abilities, geographical requirements, and the needs of the Army. FAs allow RC officers to
broaden the scope of their experience and enhance both their assignment and promotion potential.
d. ILE. ILE is the Army’s formal education program for majors. It is a tailored resident education program designed
to prepare new field-grade officers for their next 10 YOS. It produces field-grade officers with a Warrior Ethos and a
Joint, expeditionary mindset, who are grounded in war fighting doctrine, and who have the technical and leadership
competencies to be successful at more senior levels in their respective CFs. ILE consists of a common core phase of
operational instruction offered to all officers and tailored education phase (qualification course) tied to the technical
requirements of the officer’s branch or FA. This mid-level school prepares majors for assignments at the division and
corps level, as well as Joint assignments. The school is branch non-specific and provides training in the military arts
and sciences, as well as introductory courses in geopolitical issues and on how the Army runs. RC officers also receive
credit for ILE by attending the resident WHINSEC.
e. SSC requirements. SSCs provide field grade officers with advanced professional education in both military and
sociopolitical topics. The SSCs, which include the AWC and university fellowships, prepare officers for senior
leadership positions throughout the DOD.
(1) Field-grade refresher courses. Branch refresher courses are conducted by branch proponent schools to provide
current doctrine in branch matters and special subjects for field grade officers. While no credit for promotion is given
for attendance at these courses, the opportunity to update professional knowledge is of great value to RC officers.
(2) Language training. Where a TOE or TDA position requires language proficiency, officers may apply for
language acquisition or sustainment training at either the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, CA, or the ARNG
Language Center. These resident courses are very lengthy, lasting from 25 to 60 weeks.
f. Civilian education. The standard for civilian education for officers in the U.S. Army is a baccalaureate degree.
Most officers commissioned into the RC already have a baccalaureate degree; however, some officers commissioned
through the state officer candidate school do not. Table 7–3, below, lists the educational requirements applicable to the
appointment and commissioning of officers without baccalaureate degrees. Effective 1 October 1995, in accordance
with the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1995, a baccalaureate degree from an accredited educational institution is required for promotion to any grade above first lieutenant. Army Nurse Corps officers appointed on
or after 1 October 1986 must possess a baccalaureate degree in nursing (accredited by an agency acceptable to HQDA)
prior to promotion to major.
g. Other military education.
(1) TASS. TASS offers CCC and ILE to RC officers. The TASS option offers an excellent opportunity for
completing educational requirements because of the presence of qualified instructors and the interaction with fellow
officers.
(2) The Army Institute for Professional Development (AIPD). The AIPD at Fort Eustis, VA administers the Army
Correspondence Course Program (ACCP) (http://www.atsc.army.mil/accp/aipdnew.asp). The ACCP provides progressive educational opportunities through correspondence for a wide variety of subjects. This type of military education is
particularly well suited for RC officers who cannot take advantage of resident courses. Many courses are targeted at
specific assignments, such as motor officer, personnel officer, or dining facility officer.
7–14. Warrant Officer Education System
a. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to outline the methods available to WOs in completing military education
requirements and civilian education goals as they progress through their military careers.
b. Military education.
(1) The DA military occupational specialty proponents conduct courses in both Active Army and RC configured
versions combining correspondence and ADT phases for most occupational specialties.
(2) WO training under WOES has five levels that provide WOs with performance-based certification and qualification training. WOES trains and develops WOs for progressively more difficult and complex assignments. The new

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

45

course titles align more closely with comparable commissioned officer courses for consistency and ease of understanding by the Army at large. All WOs, supervisors, and commanders must familiarize themselves with the new WOES
and understand the affect on WO leader and professional development. The five levels of WOES are—
(a) WOCS. This course provides candidates with initial WO training. Graduates are appointed to WO1. Completion
of WOBC within 2 years (a 1 year extension may be granted on a case by case basis) of WO appointment is required.
(b) WOBC. This is proponent training that provides MOS specific instruction and certification following WOCS and
is characterized by an increased emphasis on leadership. This course is an ARNG requirement for promotion to CW2
and a USAR requirement for promotion to CW2 and CW3.
(c) WOAC. This training provides additional training for WOs serving at the company and battalion level and is a
two phase course consisting of—
1. WOAC Prerequisite Studies Phase. This is a mandatory non-resident course that must be completed prior to
attending resident WOAC training. Effective 1 October 1998, the Action officer Development Course (AODC)
(ST7000) was adopted as the resource for this distance learning course. It can be completed online via the Internet and
provides WOs serving in CW2 or higher duty positions relevant training in topics such as management techniques,
communication skills, preparing and staffing documents, meetings and interviews, problem solving, writing, coordinating, briefings, and ethics. In keeping with the WOES model, enrollment must occur after promotion to CW2 in order to
qualify for WOAC Prerequisite Studies credit. The course must be completed within one year of enrollment; however,
CW2s now have the flexibility to enroll at any convenient time between 24 and 48 months of total WO Service.
Completion of the AODC is mandatory requirement for promotion of all ARNG WOs to CW3 including those awarded
an MOS that does not have an advanced course. To enroll online, go to http://www.adtdl.army.mil/cgi-bin/atdl.dll/accp/
st7000/top.htm and follow enrollment instructions.
2. The resident phase of the WOAC. This course is administered and conducted by individual proponents and is an
ARNG requirement for promotion to the grade of CW3. For USAR WOs, successful completion is a requirement for
promotion to CW4 and CW5 until 2010 when it will be a requirement for promotion to CW3 and CW4.
(d) WOSC. This common core 4–week resident course prepares WOs to serve in staff positions at the brigade and
higher levels. WOSC is an ARNG requirement for promotion to CW4. (At this time, WOSC is not a prerequisite for
the WOSSC). For USAR WOs, successful completion will be a requirement for promotion to CW4 and CW5
beginning in 2010.
(e) WOSSC. This 2–week resident course is conducted at the WOCC, Fort Rucker, AL and prepares WOs selected
for promotion to CW5, to serve at the highest-level staff positions. (This course is an RC requirement for promotion to
CW5).
(3) Correspondence courses. The AIPD at Fort Eustis, VA is responsible for the administration of the ACCP. The
ACCP provides progressive education opportunities through correspondence for a wide variety of subjects. This type of
military education is particularly suited for RC personnel who cannot take advantage of resident courses. Many courses
are targeted at specific assignments.
(4) Language training. Where the MTOE or TDA position requires language proficiency, WOs may apply for
language training at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, CA or the ARNG Language Center in Puerto Rico.
c. Civilian education. There is a demand for WOs with an education beyond high school level to accommodate the
changing technological environment within the Army. The RC WO corps must keep pace with these changes if it is to
meet the challenges of the future. Applicants for initial appointment must meet all MOS specific additional civilian
education requirements as specified for the particular WO specialty. Applicants whose native language is not English
must be tested and achieve a minimum raw score of 80 on the English Comprehension Level Test (ECLT). Civilian
education goals are as follows:
(1) The ARNG goal for WOs is the attainment of a specialty related associate degree or 60 college semester hours
by the eighth year of WO Service.
(2) The USAR goal for WOs is the attainment of a specialty related associate degree or 60 college semester hours
by the fifth year of WO Service.

7–15. Promotion
Law for promotion automatically considers commissioned officers of the RCs who are on the reserve active status list
(RASL) when they have served the required years in grade. AR 135–155 requires that each USAR WO who is in an
active status be considered for promotion at such time as he or she has served the required number of years in grade.
Promotion consideration occurs whether officers are assigned to an ARNG unit, TPU, or a control group, except for the
Standby Reserve (inactive) and the ING. RC officers assigned to an ARNG unit or USAR TPU have an additional
opportunity for promotion to fill unit position vacancies at such time as they have completed the education and time-ingrade requirements. WOs in the Standby Reserve (inactive) and ING are not considered for promotion. USARe WOs
assigned to TPUs have the additional opportunity to be considered for promotion to fill unit vacancies at such time as
they have completed the required years in grade, without regard to total YOS. ARNG WOs are promoted by the State
Adjutant General to fill vacancies in ARNG units. TIG requirements for vacancy promotions are contained in AR
135–155, table 2–1. USAR WO promotion time lines are shown in AR 135–155, table 2–1. ARNG promotion time
lines are outlined in NGR 600–101, chapter 7.
7–16. Selection eligibility for company and field grade Officers
a. General. To be eligible for selection for promotion, an RC officer, other than a WO, not on extended Active Duty
must—
(1) Be on the RASL.
(2) Be an active member and participating satisfactorily in RC training.
(3) Meet the prescribed military educational requirements shown in table 7–1, paragraph 7–8, above.
(4) Meet the prescribed civilian educational requirements of 10 USC 12205. The code states that no person may be
appointed to a grade above the grade of lieutenant in the USAR or be Federally recognized in a grade above the grade
of first lieutenant as a member of the ARNG unless that person has been awarded a baccalaureate degree by a
qualifying institution. This does not apply to the following:
(a) The appointment to or recognition in a higher grade of a person who is appointed in or assigned for Service in a
health profession for which a baccalaureate degree is not a condition of original appointment or assignment.
(b) The appointment to or recognition in a higher grade of any person who was appointed to, or Federally
recognized in, the grade of captain before 1 October 1995.
(c) Recognition in the grade of captain or major in the Alaska Army National Guard of a person who resides
permanently at a location in Alaska that is more than 50 miles from each of the cities of Anchorage, Fairbanks, and
Juneau by paved road and who is serving in a scout unit or a scout supporting unit.
(5) Meet the prescribed civilian educational requirements of AR 135–155.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

47

(a) Army Nurse Corps officers appointed on or after 1 October 1986 must possess a baccalaureate degree in nursing
from an accredited educational institution prior to promotion to major.
(b) Officers other than Army nurses appointed on or after 1 October 1987 must possess a baccalaureate from an
accredited educational institution prior to promotion to major.
(6) Have served the required time in grade shown in AR 135–155, table 2–1.
b. Reserve appointments. Upon release from Active Duty, officers with Reserve appointments are transferred in the
grade satisfactorily held while on the ADL and, if accepted, may transfer to an ARNG unit or USAR TPU; otherwise,
they are transferred to the IRR. The officer also retains his or her time in grade. Officers on the ADL selected for
promotion, removed from the ADL before being promoted, and transferred to the RASL in the same competitive
category, will be placed on an appropriate promotion list for Reserve of the Army promotion without the need for
further consideration. Active Army officers who leave active Service must apply and be accepted for a first-time
Reserve appointment to enter Reserve duty.
7–17. Promotion selection board
a. The minimum military education requirements shown in table 7–1, paragraph 7–8, are a prerequisite for promotion. Since annual selection boards consider officers for promotion far enough in advance of the date on which the
required time in grade will be completed as prescribed in AR 135–155, table 2–1 educational requirements, both
military and civilian, must be completed no later than the day prior to the date the board considering the officer
convenes. The promotion board schedule is established annually by HQDA and is adjusted as required.
b. After the board reports its findings and the recommendations receive final approval, each officer will be sent a
letter notifying him or her of either selection or non-selection. This promotion action cannot be accomplished unless
the officer has been found physically qualified for retention and possesses a valid, current security clearance.
c. Selection boards consider the promotion of officers for all grades 1st lieutenant to colonel. Officers considered
qualified and selected for promotion to first lieutenant will be promoted when they have completed 2 years Service in
grade. Second lieutenants are not promoted unless they have completed an Army BOLC. Second lieutenants who are
not obligated and not promoted upon completion of 42 months commissioned Service are separated.
d. Warrant officers of the ARNG are appointed and promoted by the states under section 8 of the U.S. Constitution.
In order for an ARNG WO to be concurrently promoted and receive Reserve WO of the Army designation, the State
promotion action must be Federally recognized. To accomplish this process, the promotion action requires the conduct
and examination by a Federal Recognition Board (FRB). The Senior Active Army Advisor (SRAA) of the state for the
numbered Army area (CONUSA) commanders appoints FRBs. Appointments to the FRB are made by authority of the
Secretary of the Army. The Secretary of the Army provides administrative instructions and guidance to be used by the
FRB in a memorandum of instruction to the board. FRBs consist of a total of three commissioned officers of the
Active Army and the ARNG who are senior to the officer being considered. The senior member of the board will serve
as president of the board. A minimum of one member (preferably two) should be in the same branch as the officer to
be considered The board will consist of at least one minority member as a voting member, if possible, when minorities
are being considered. Normally, at least one female officer will be appointed as a voting member whenever there are
females being considered. When feasible, a commissioned aviator will be included as a member of the board when
considering promotion of aviation WOs. Applicants for ARNG promotion are examined in accordance with NGR
600–101.
e. The USAR CW3 and CW4 selection board selects officers for promotion without regard to vacancies in the next
higher grade using a "fully qualified" methodology. The USAR CW5 selection board selects officers for promotion
utilizing a "best qualified" methodology and considers both MOS and promotion ceilings when determining who will
be promoted to fill the projected vacancies in authorized CW5 positions. USAR selection boards will be composed of
at least seven members; a brigadier general as board president, two colonels and four CW5s. At least one-half of all
selection board members will be RC officers not on Active Duty. Each selection board will consist of at least one
minority member as a voting member. Normally, at least one female officer will be appointed as a voting member
whenever there are females being considered. USAR unit vacancy boards, when needed, convene on a date announced
by HQDA Selection boards convene each year as announced by HQDA.

Chapter 8
Introduction to the Officer Functional Alignment
8–1. Introduction
a. Overview. The Army has structured company and field grade officers in the Army Competitive Category by
grouping branches and FAs into personnel management categories called functional alignments. WOs are grouped by
related MOS skills also aligned with the functional groupings associated with company and field grade officers. For
further information, refer to chapter 3, paragraphs 3–10 and 3–11. From this chapter forward, WOs will refer to branch
chapters to find career development and life cycle development models.

48

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

b. Branch and FA designation. Officers are designated into a branch when commissioned or in an FA by a HQDAcentralized selection board during their time as a captain. Some FAs will have officers that are functionally designated
between the 4th and 7th YOS.
8–2. Career branches
a. Definition. A branch is a grouping of officers that comprises an arm or Service of the Army in which, as a
minimum, officers are commissioned, assigned, developed, and promoted through their company grade years. Officers
are accessed into a single basic branch and will hold that branch designation. An accession branch admits officers upon
commissioning; a non-accession branch admits experienced officers from the accession branches. With the exception of
Special Forces, Psychological Operations, and Civil Affairs, all other branches are accession branches. SOF branches
recruit officers with three years experience for qualification and training. See the Special Forces, Psychological
Operations, or Civil Affairs chapters for further information. Officers will serve their company grade time developing
the leadership and tactical skills associated with their branch. They will continue to wear their branch insignia
throughout their military Service
b. Assignments. Through company grade years, most officers will serve predominately in positions from within their
basic branch. Some officers will serve in FA or branch/FA generalist positions (not related to a specific branch or FA)
as a company grade officer.
c. Branch categories. The branches of the Army are categorized in the paragraphs below. Some branches may fall
under more than one category as noted in AR 600–3, paragraph 3–2.
(1) MF&E branches are—
(a) Infantry (11).
(b) Armor (19).
(c) Field Artillery (13).
(d) Air Defense Artillery (14).
(e) Aviation (15).
(f) Special Forces (18).
(g) Corps of Engineers (21).
(h) Chemical (74).
(i) Military Police Corps (31)
(j) Psychological Operations (37).
(k) Civil Affairs (38).
(2) The Operations Support branches are—
(a) Signal Corps (25).
(b) Military Intelligence Corps (35).
(3) The Force Sustainment branches are—
(a) Adjutant General Corps (42).
(b) Finance Corps (44).
(c) Transportation Corps (88).
(d) Ordnance Corps (91).
(e) Quartermaster Corps (92).
(f) Logistics Corps (90).

(j) Dental Corps (63)
(k) Veterinary Corps (64).
(l) Army Medical Specialists (65).
(m) Army Nurse corps (66).
(n) Medical Service Corps (67, 68).
8–3. Functional areas
a. Definition. An FA is a grouping of officers by technical specialty or skill, which usually requires significant
education, training, and experience. An officer receives his or her FA while serving as a company grade officer.
Individual preference, academic background, manner of performance, training and experience, and needs of the Army
are all considered during the designation process.
b. Assignments. Depending on FA educational requirements, professional time lines of the individual officer and
individual preference, officers may serve in a FA assignment during their company grade years after they have

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

49

completed branch development requirements. FA 39, FA 51, and FA 90 are the only FAs that afford command
opportunity. (See their respective chapters for further discussion.)
(1) Human Resource Management (43).
(2) Comptroller (45).
(3) Academy Professor, United States Military Academy (47).
(4) Operations Research/Systems Analysis (49).

Part Two
Maneuver, Fires, and Effects
Chapter 9
Infantry Branch
9–1. Unique features of the Infantry Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Infantry Branch. Infantry Branch is the combat arms branch with the mission to close with
and destroy the enemy by means of fire and movement to defeat or capture him/her, or repel hi/hers assault by fire,
close combat, and counterattack.
b. The way ahead. The Army transformation and the contemporary operating environment will significantly affect
how the Infantry Branch trains, assigns, and develops officers. While the focus of the Infantry Branch has always been
the development of combined arms warriors, the Army’s ongoing transformation institutionalizes this concept through
the transition to combined arms formations. This will drive an increased focus on maneuver operations for company
grade officers, transitioning to a combined and Joint operational focus for field grade officers. The development of
Infantry officers will also focus on the development of agile and adaptive officers and multi-skilled leaders who
collectively embody knowledge of JIIM organizations. While AHRC will make every effort to synchronize the three
priorities, the needs of the Army and the professional development needs of the officer must continue to take
precedence over individual preference. The assignment of Infantry officers will continue to be made based on—
(1) The needs of the Army.
(2) The professional development needs of the officer.
(3) The officer’s preference.
c. Unique functions performed by the Infantry Branch. Infantry leaders are expected to synchronize all elements of
combat power on the battlefield to defeat the enemy. Infantry officers are prepared to train, lead, and employ all types
of Infantry and other combat arms assets on the battlefield in the full spectrum of military operations. The Infantry
arrives on the battlefield by parachute assault, air assault, mechanized vehicle, wheeled vehicle, or on foot. Insertion
means are dependant upon the mission, enemy, terrain and weather, and time available.
d. Unique features of work in the Infantry Branch. Infantry officers work at all levels of command and staff and can
perform the following functions and tasks:
(1) Command and control Infantry and combined arms forces in combat.
(2) Provide coordination for employment of combined arms forces at all levels of Joint, Army, and coalition
commands.
(3) Develop doctrine, organizations, and equipment for Infantry unique missions and formations.
(4) Instruct Infantry skills at Service schools and combat training centers.
(5) Serve in positions requiring general combat skills such as staff officers in all levels of headquarters and activities
requiring combat arms expertise.
(6) Serve as Infantry instructors at pre-commissioning programs, Service schools, and colleges.
(7) Serve as Infantry advisors to foreign military, ARNG, and USAR organizations.
e. Branch detail. Infantry Branch participates in the branch detailing of officers into Infantry for development and
50

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

growth at the grade of lieutenant. Officers detailed Infantry (branch code 11) will lose their Infantry designation once
they reach their branch detail expiration date and they have been reassigned into their new branch.
f. Branch eligibility. Infantry Branch is closed to female officers under the Secretary of Defense direct ground
combat rule. Male officers of other branches who desire a branch transfer to Infantry should submit a request in
accordance with AR 614–100, chapter 4.
9–2. Officer characteristics required
a. General. Infantry Branch requires officers who are, first and foremost, leaders of Soldiers. They should be
mentally and physically disciplined and well versed in Infantry and combined arms tactics, techniques, and procedures.
Infantry leaders will embody the Warrior Ethos. They will place the welfare of their Soldiers ahead of their own and
they will adhere to Army Values without exception. Their example will inspire others to achieve the same level of
commitment and professionalism. The Infantry must produce multi-skilled leaders who are critically reflective, comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty, and agents of change. Infantry officers must be challenged and imbued with
the confidence to be innovative and adaptive while competently performing in a JIIM environment. Infantry officers
must be—
(1) Proficient in the art and science of the profession of arms.
(2) Comfortable employing both lethal and nonlethal means.
(3) Able to confront the uncertain situations of today’s operational environment.
(4) Adept at using ethical decision making to solve complex, dynamic problems.
(5) Team builders, able to confidently lead Soldiers while engendering loyalty and trust. Additionally, there are
several branch unique skills that require professional development. Infantry Branch has proponency for the following
skills (detailed descriptions contained in DA Pam 611–21):
(a) 3X–Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle.
(b) 3Z–Mortar unit officer.
(c) 5P–Parachutist.
(d) 5R–Ranger.
(e) 5S–Ranger/parachutist.
(f) 5Q–Pathfinder.
(g) 6B–Reconnaissance and surveillance leader.
b. Competencies and actions common to all. Infantry officers are valued for their skills as leaders, trainers, and
planners; skills which are acquired and perfected through realistic training, PME, and Service in the most demanding
positions Infantry Branch offers. The Infantry Branch values both critical warfighting operational force assignments
and the generating force assignments. The goal of the branch is to provide each officer with a series of leadership,
staff, and functional assignments; institutional training; and self-development opportunities in order to develop combined arms warriors with well rounded backgrounds and an understanding of JIIM operations.
c. Unique skills. Infantry officers should display consistently outstanding performance across a wide variety of TOE
warfighting and TDA training and staff positions. Infantry officers should demonstrate excellence in their warfighting
skills; technical proficiency; a well developed understanding of Joint and combined arms warfare; and the ability to
lead, train, motivate, and care for Soldiers.
9–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
Branch development.
a. Lieutenant. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop the requisite
Infantry Branch skills, knowledge, and attributes. The focus of the officer at this stage of his career is on development
of Infantry tactical and technical warfighting skills and the utilization of these skills in an operational assignment.
(1) Education. The BOLC must be completed during this phase. Following commissioning, Infantry lieutenants will
attend BOLC II and III. Entry-level officers from all branches will attend BOLC II prior to their branch basic course in
order to be imbued with the Warrior Ethos and provide a common fundamental tactical framework for leader
development. Following BOLC II, Infantry officers will attend the Infantry BOLC III. BOLC III emphasizes leadership, tactics, maintenance, and technical and tactical competence with weapons and equipment common to the Infantry.
Following BOLC III, Infantry Lieutenants have the opportunity to attend airborne and ranger schools. Additionally, any
officer assigned to a mechanized or Stryker unit following BOLC III will attend the Mechanized Leader’s Course
(MLC) or Stryker Leader’s Course (SLC). Some officers will be selected to attend the Infantry Mortar Leader Course.
Regardless of unit of assignment and follow-on schools, the objective is for Infantry lieutenants to serve no longer than
nine months at Fort Benning in order to ensure that they are able to complete the requisite assignments in their first
duty station to provide them with the skills, knowledge, and experience necessary to build a successful foundation. All
Infantry lieutenants are encouraged to volunteer for ranger training due to the intense tactical and leadership training it
provides. Achieving the standards for graduation from ranger school is an indication that an officer possesses the skills
and stamina necessary to effectively lead Soldiers in the Infantry.
(2) Assignments. The typical Infantry Lieutenant will be assigned to a BCT as his/her first unit of assignment. The

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

51

key developmental (KD) assignment during this phase is serving as a platoon leader in a TOE operational unit. Early
experience as a TOE platoon leader is critical, as it provides Infantry lieutenants with the opportunity to gain tactical
and technical expertise in their branch while developing leadership skills. In addition, a limited number of Infantry
lieutenants will serve as TRADOC training company executive officers or staff officers. However, the initial assignment for all Infantry lieutenants should be to a TOE operational unit. Other typical assignments for lieutenants are
battalion specialty platoon leader (recon, mortar, or weapons), company executive officer, or battalion staff officer. An
Infantry officer may also serve in a staff position after promotion to captain, but prior to attendance at the Maneuver
Captain’s Career Course (MC3). A limited number of Infantry lieutenants will serve at the same installation through the
completion of company command as a captain. These officers will attend the MC3 then return to the same installation
to complete their initial assignment as a captain. The ability of an Infantry officer to remain at the same installation for
his initial two assignments will be dependent on the Infantry grade structure at that installation and the needs of the
Army.
(3) Self-development. Self-development during this phase should focus on Infantry tactical fundamentals, troop
leading procedures, leadership skills, organizational maintenance, resupply operations, basic administrative operations,
and other branch technical proficiency skills.
(4) Desired experience. Each Infantry lieutenant must complete all BOLC phases, successfully serve in an operational TOE platoon leader assignment, then supplement his/her technical and tactical abilities through assignment to a
specialty platoon, XO, or staff position. The goal is to develop lieutenants with an understanding of combined arms
maneuver tactics at the platoon level. He/she should have a working knowledge of special operations and close air
support (CAS). A limited number of Infantry lieutenants will also serve in generating force assignments prior to
attending MC3.
b. Captain. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop Infantry
combined arms maneuver officers who have exhibited leadership skills as a company commander and staff officer in
an operational unit, and who have rounded out their knowledge through successfully completing one or more
assignments in the generating force. Infantry captains who have served in both operational and generating force
positions have honed their tactical skills and expanded their capabilities through their functional assignment. The
Infantry Branch wants to develop captains with operational expertise and who are prepared to provide significant
contributions to the generating force.
(1) Education. Completion of a branch CCC is mandatory during this period. The majority of Infantry officers will
attend the MC3 branch training, while a select few will attend other branch CCCs. Specialized training will be
scheduled for officers after MC3 on an as-needed basis. Ideally most, if not all, officers attending MC3 will be assigned
to a different type of Infantry organization (vehicular or non-vehicular) than they served in at their first duty station.
Exceptions may be made based on operational needs. Officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree prior to attending the
CCC. Officers not holding a degree can complete one through the DCP in accordance with AR 621–1, chapter 4. The
Infantry captain should coordinate the DCP with the AHRC Infantry Branch junior captain assignments officer.
(2) Assignments. The KD assignment for a captain is command of a TOE Infantry company for 18 months, plus or
minus 6 months. Second commands should be limited, and total command time should not exceed 26 months (2 x 12
month commands and 2 months for change of command inventories) unless operational needs dictate a different course
of action. Life cycle manning will result in some officers commanding for longer periods of time, and some for less,
depending on where the unit is in the life cycle when the officer takes command. Infantry captains should bear in mind
that they will most likely be assigned to a type of Infantry unit they did not serve with as a Lieutenant (vehicular or
non-vehicular). Officers who command TDA companies encounter significant responsibilities and are therefore, extremely well prepared for MTOE command. TDA company commanders having their first commands at the United
States Army Infantry Center and School will be given the highest consideration to follow-on TOE assignments to
compete for TOE company command. The Infantry encourages officers to seek company command opportunities in the
Infantry training brigade and basic combat training brigade prior to attendance at MC3. There is no time limit
restriction in these commands and officers will still remain eligible for tactical company commands following MC3.
Captains should aggressively seek command and Service in battalion and brigade level staff positions in order to
further their understanding of Infantry leadership and tactics. Some officers will have the opportunity to compete for
selection and assignment to unique units where they may command again, such as the 75th Ranger Regiment, 3rd
Infantry Regiment (Old Guard), or a special missions unit (SMU). The United States Army Infantry Center and School
also has significant second command opportunities to include the Ranger Training Brigade and the 507th Parachute
Infantry Regiment. Upon completion of company command, a full spectrum of assignments is possible. The purpose of
these assignments is to meet critical Army requirements, further develop the officer’s knowledge base and provide him/
her a more well-rounded professional experience. Additionally, officers will have the opportunity serve in one of the
assignments identified as follows:
(a) TDA staff.
(b) Active Army/RC training support brigade trainer and staff.
(c) CTC trainer or observer/controller.
(d) Service school instructor or small group instructor.

52

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(e) Doctrine developer.
(f) Training developer.
(g) ACOM and higher-level DA staff.
(h) United States Military Academy (USMA) faculty and staff.
(i) U.S. Army Recruiting Company Command and Staff.
(j) ROTC Assistant Professor of Military Science.
(k) Multi-National and Coalition Trainer and Staff officer.
(l) Army Sponsored Fellowships and Scholarships.
(m) Other combat arms or branch generalist positions.
(3) Self-development. During this phase, Infantry officers must hone their leadership, tactical and technical skills,
and concentrate on those critical tasks required to accomplish their wartime mission while winning on the battlefield.
The officer should also begin to develop a more thorough understanding of combined arms operations in a Joint
environment.
(4) Army Acquisition Corps. Small numbers of Infantry officers from each year group will be accessed into the
Army Acquisition Corps. The primary look is in year 6 of a captain’s career, and then the officer will be re-looked
during years 7–8. The Acquisition Corps conducts a DA level selection board. All applications for transfer must be
made directly to the Acquisition Manager, OPMD, AHRC. Volunteers make up most of the accession numbers, while a
few officers may be re-branched based on their academic degree. Officers accessed into the Army Acquisition Corps
will be transferred to acquisition corps.
(5) Desired experience. The key and developmental assignment for an Infantry captain is successful Service as a
company commander. There is no substitute for operational company command that develops an Infantry officer’s
leadership and tactical skills and prepares him for future leadership assignments at successively higher levels of
responsibility. The goal is to provide each Infantry captain 18 months (+/- six months) company command time;
however, the key is the quality of the experience rather than time. In some cases unit requirements may require
Infantry captains to serve as company commanders of other organizations in order to meet operational requirements.
Infantry captains should also expand their tactical and technical capabilities through assignment as a battalion staff
officer prior to reassignment away from a BCT. A limited number of Infantry captains will also serve on transition
teams.
(6) FDB. Infantry officers will undergo a FDB at their seven year mark. This HQDA board will decide in which of
the 3 functional categories each officer is best suited to serve. Decisions are based on the needs of the Army, the
officer’s preference, rater and senior rater’s recommendations, and the officer’s skills and training. A limited number of
officers may choose to opt-in to a FDB after 4 YOS. This board is not mandatory and officers must choose to compete
(opt-in) and the functional Categories open each year are based on the needs of the Army The three functional
categories are MF&E; operations support; and force sustainment. After the FDB board convenes, each officer will be
assigned a branch or FA within a functional category. Officers who are selected to serve outside of MF&E will be
managed by their respective Branch or FA manager. Officers who remain in the MF&E functional category will be
managed by Infantry Branch until selection for colonel, when they will be managed by the Army Senior Leader
Development Office. Infantry officers who remain in the MF&E functional category will receive both branch (11Z) and
branch generalist (O1A/O2A/O3A) assignments.
c. Majors. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to expand the officer’s
tactical and technical experience and continue to develop him/her as a combined arms warrior and leader with a
comprehensive understanding of operations in a Joint and expeditionary environment. Additionally, through a series of
operational staff and generating force functional assignments, the Infantry major continues to increase his/her contribution to the institutional Army and his/her understanding of how the Army operates. The key is to provide the Infantry
major with the tools that prepare him/her for future battalion command and for increasingly complex generating force
assignments.
(1) Education. Military education required during this phase is completion of ILE through completion at the U.S.
Army CGSC. ILE is divided into two phases. Phase 1 is a 14-week common core training block of instruction. Phase 2
is the Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course (AOWC) which is the field grade credentialing course that is
required for all Infantry officers. Officers may also compete to be selected for the SAMS, following AOWC. Those
selected must serve a utilization tour as a corps or division plans or operations/assistant G3 staff officer.
(2) Assignments. KD assignments during this phase are—
(a) Battalion operations officer.
(b) Battalion XO.
(c) Brigade operations officer.
(d) Brigade XO.
(e) Operations officer and XO equivalent positions within an SMU.
(f) Division Chief of Plans (SAMS utilization).
(g) Division Chief of Operations (SAMS utilization).

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(h) Senior ranger regimental liaison officer.
(i) Asymmetric warfare group (AWG) operations squadron troop commander.
(j) Troop Commanders within an SMU. Each officer should have sufficient experience and participate in a capstone
event in these KD assignments in order to develop an understanding of Infantry and combined arms operations. There
is no substitute for preparing an Infantry officer for future command and for building his Infantry maneuver and
combined arms skills. The Infantry major may further expand his tactical and technical skills by serving in staff
assignments at division level and higher. The Division Chief of Plans/Chief of Operations positions are only considered
key and developmental for the SAMS graduate Infantry officers and when served in conjunction with a minimum of 12
months Service in a battalion or brigade S3/XO position. The development and exposure at the brigade level and below
KD positions are absolutely essential for the professional growth of the Infantry officer and necessary for success at
future levels of command.
(3) Infantry majors will also meet the Army’s mission requirements and build on their institutional skills through
varied generating force and JIIM assignments. Examples of Infantry major assignments beyond the key and developmental positions are—
(a) Active Army/RC S3/XO.
(b) Doctrine developer.
(c) Training developer.
(d) DA staff officer
(e) Joint staff officer.
(f) Brigade, division, or corps staff.
(g) CTC trainer or staff officer.
(h) ACOM staff (CONUS and OCONUS).
(i) CGSC staff and faculty.
(j) Service school instructor.
(k) USMA faculty and staff.
(l) ROTC assistant professor of military science (APMS).
(m) Multi-national and coalition trainer and staff officer.
(n) Army sponsored fellowships and scholarships.
(4) Self-development. Infantry majors are expected to continue self-development efforts to build intellectual capital,
strategic perspective, and hone operational skills. Infantry majors will be required to develop and use a diverse set of
skills as they move between combined arms leadership positions in TOE and TDA organizations as well as functional
Infantry, branch generalist, and JIIM assignments.
(5) Desired experience. At this stage of the officer’s career, the Infantry major must hone his/her skills in the
planning and execution of combined arms warfare and to develop expertise in the JIIM operational environment. While
12 months is the minimum standard, an officer should serve for as long as possible in KD assignments, with the
general rule being a minimum of two for a total of 24–36 months. In order to be competitive for tactical battalion
command, Infantry officers should serve at least one assignment as battalion or brigade operations officer or XO.
Infantry majors should bear in mind that, if they have not had experience in both vehicular and non-vehicular
formations as lieutenants and captains, they will likely be assigned to a type of infantry they have not served in
following ILE. The officer’s operational expertise should be supplemented by further Service in positions of increasing
responsibility in the generating force.
(6) Additional factors.
(a) The goal of the branch is to develop an inventory of field grade officers who embody a collective knowledge of
JIIM experience While not every officer will receive an assignment in a qualifying Joint assignment or serve a
fellowship in a JIIM agency, the goal is to provide the maximum opportunity for Infantry majors to receive JIIM
experience. However, this will be dependent on Army demands and position/fellowship availability.
(b) A limited number of Infantry field grade officers may be assigned to positions currently coded as FA positions.
A number of FA field grade positions will be coded as open to assignment by non-FA officers. The goal is to expand
position access, especially for JIIM positions. Infantry majors may be assigned to Infantry (11Z), branch generalist
(01A, 02A, 03A), or FA positions coded for access by branch officers.
(c) A limited number of Infantry majors will serve on transition teams. This experience, when combined with time
spent as an S3/XO provides the Infantry major the skills to prepare him/her for future operational and generating force
assignments of increasing responsibility and for command.
d. Lieutenant colonel. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is demonstrated
excellence in tactical skills, technical proficiency, and the ability to lead, train, motivate, and care for Soldiers in both
the staff and command environments. As the Infantry officer increases in rank, his/her opportunity to serve in the
operational force will decrease as the percentage of positions in the generating force increases. The officer’s previous
generating force assignments prepare him/her for his/her expanded role in the generating force serving in positions of
increasing responsibility.

54

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(1) Education. Lieutenant colonels selected for command complete a PCC and may be selected for SSC following
command.
(2) Assignments. Officers selected for lieutenant colonel in Infantry should seek assignments of greater responsibility
in branch and branch generalist positions. The objective in lieutenant colonel assignments is greater contribution to the
branch and the Army. It is important in this phase of an Infantry officer’s career that he/she serves in an assignment
that further develops his/her Joint combined arms skill set and improves warfighting skills. The most critical assignment for Infantry lieutenant colonels in the MF&E functional category is battalion level command. Top performing
Infantry officers who are already highly competitive for colonel and command selection are those most likely to be
selected for lieutenant colonel command Those Infantry lieutenant colonels selected for command will normally serve
two to three years in command at battalion level. Infantry officers are selected for CSL commands in four command
categories; operations, strategic support, training and recruiting, and installation. Typical duty assignments for lieutenant colonels could include—
(a) Battalion command.
(b) CTC task force trainer.
(c) Brigade or regiment XO, and deputy BCT commander.
(d) Division G3 (NOTE: normally a former battalion commander).
(e) Division or corps staff.
(f) Service branch school staff and instructors.
(g) HQDA or Joint staff, NATO staff, combatant commands staff.
(h) TSB battalion commander.
(i) XO/S3 positions in an Active Army/RC training support brigade.
(j) RC support.
(k) ROTC PMS.
(l) ACOM staff.
(m) BCTP O/T. (Note that assignment opportunity for some Infantry lieutenant colonel positions will be limited to
former battalion commanders.)
(3) Self-development. During this phase of an Infantry officer’s career, self-development takes the form of selfassessment, off-duty civil schooling, and perfecting mentoring and managerial skills. The officer should also continue
to hone his/her combined arms warfighting skills and his/her understanding of the Joint operational environment.
(4) Desired experience. The goal of the Infantry Branch development is to prepare every officer for command of a
combined arms warfighting organization at the lieutenant colonel level. Command selection includes only a small
percentage of the total lieutenant colonel population. Thus, many lieutenant colonels will serve for many years at that
grade. This is by design, and promotion to lieutenant colonel is the mark of a successful career. While not every officer
will command and Infantry lieutenant colonels will provide exceptional contributions to the Army in the generating
force, the focus remains the development of officers imbued with technical and tactical knowledge of the Joint,
combined arms, maneuver warfare. The critical assignment for an Infantry lieutenant colonel is command. There is no
substitute for selection and successful Service as a commander for preparing the Infantry officer for Service as a
colonel. While the typical command tour has historically been 24 months, due to ongoing operational deployments, unit
transitions, and the implementation of life cycle managed units, command tours may range from less than 24 months to
36 months in length. Former battalion commanders (FBCs) will be assigned to specific billets coded for FBC and will
be assigned based on needs of the Army. All FBC assignments are vetted through the Director, OPMD. Some
examples of FBC billets include division G3, CTC task force senior O/C, Joint staff, Office of the Secretary of
Defense, Army, corps, or Division staff, TRADOC duty, the Infantry Branch chief in officer or enlisted assignments,
USAREC duty, or 75th Ranger Regiment CSL command.
e. Colonel. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is sustainment of warfighting, training, and staff skill, along with utilization of leadership, managerial, and executive talents. The majority of
strategic level leaders in the Army are colonels. Colonels are expected to be strategic and creative thinkers; builders of
leaders and teams; competent full spectrum warfighters; skilled in governance, statesmanship, and diplomacy; and
understand cultural context and work effectively across it.
(1) Education. The majority of officers selected for promotion to colonel will be selected to attend SSC.
(2) Assignments. Infantry colonels contribute to the Army by serving in crucial assignments in branch and combat
arms branch generalist positions. The critical task during this phase is to fully develop the broad skills and competencies required of a multi-skilled leader, while maintaining branch competency (warfighting skills). Officers should
make maximum use of their talents. Assignments will tend to be utilization tours rather than developmental. Infantry
officers will make full use of their MF&E and JIIM experience, managerial skills, and executive talents to meet the
needs of the Army. A critical assignment for an Infantry colonel in the MF&E functional category is selection for
brigade or regimental command. Infantry officers selected for brigade level command will serve in the same four
command CSL categories as lieutenant colonels. Garrison command tour lengths are 24 months but can be extended to
36 months. All colonel level commands are considered KD assignments. Critical assignments for colonels include—

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

55

(a) Brigade, regiment, or garrison command.
(b) CTC operations group commander/chief of staff.
(c) TRADOC systems manager/TRADOC capabilities manager.
(d) Division or corps chief of staff.
(e) Division, corps, or field Army Assistant Chief of Staff, G–3.
(f) XO to a general officer.
(g) Department Director, U.S. Army Infantry Center.
(h) HQDA or Joint staff.
(3) Self-development. Infantry colonels must maintain their branch skills and keep current on all changes that affect
the Soldiers they command and/or manage. JIIM assignments are important during this phase.
(4) Desired experience. The primary goal at this stage is to fully use the experience and knowledge gained in a
position where the officer can provide a significant contribution to the operational and generating force. The critical
assignment for an Infantry colonel is brigade level command. No other position provides the Infantry officer the
opportunity to fully use his/her depth of experience in Joint and combined arms warfare and to capitalize on his/her
functional generating force assignments in Service to the Army. However, only a limited number of Infantry officers
will have the opportunity to command. Those officers not selected for command will continue to provide exceptional
Service in generating force and JIIM assignments of increasing responsibility. These officers also provide the critical
bridge between the operational and generating force, and serve as the advocate of commanders in key staff elements.
f. Joint assignments. Infantry officers will be considered for Joint duty assignment based on the needs of the Army,
professional development needs of the officer, and availability of a Joint assignment. Infantry officers and units will
continue to be called on to participate in Joint operations around the world. Joint experience, developed through
sequential assignments, will provide the Joint perspective on Army operations to be successful now and in the future.
9–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. The professional development goal of Infantry Branch is to produce and sustain highly qualified
officers who are tactically and operationally oriented to lead Soldiers and command units in combat and perform other
assigned missions. Assignments in combined arms organizations will be made to develop the officer’s overall ability to
achieve that goal. The officer’s assignments will be based on the needs of the Army, the officer’s professional
development needs and the officer’s preference. While Infantry Branch, AHRC, makes every effort to support
individual officer’s assignment preferences, the needs of the Army and the officer’s professional development needs
must take priority.
b. Precedence. Certain assignments in Infantry Branch will occur in a precedence sequence. Other assignments to
include professional military training are not constrained, but if possible should occur in sequence. Command positions
will have precedence over staff positions. These positions develop an officer’s ability to command at various levels
throughout a career. For example, before an officer can be a battalion S3, he will have had a successful company
command. The normal sequence for a major for professional development is education, battalion XO/S3 or brigade/
regiment XO/S3, followed by a Joint, branch/FA generalist, or division/brigade staff officer assignment.
9–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Key Infantry Branch positions. The Infantry Branch officer will serve in several key developmental positions as
they progress through their career in order to develop a Joint and expeditionary mindset, tactical and technical expertise
in combined arms warfare, a firm grounding in Infantry operations, and knowledge of JIIM organizations. There is no
substitute in the Infantry Branch for Service with troops in key leadership positions. The goal of the Infantry officer
professional development model is to provide the Infantry officer a series of leadership and operational staff positions,
supplemented by opportunities to round out their knowledge in key generating force positions, in order to achieve
success in positions of leadership at successively higher levels. The primary positions that develop this level of
expertise, in sequence, are platoon leader, company commander, S3/XO, battalion command, and brigade/regimental
command. The goal is to ensure that every Infantry officer is given the opportunity to serve in each of these key
leadership assignments. While operational realities and the limited number of positions will prevent the branch from
providing every officer the opportunity to command at the battalion and brigade level, the goal remains to prepare
every Infantry officer for command. Those officers who do not command at the battalion level will continue to provide
critical support to the Army in key generating force positions. Their role will remain to ensure that generating force
organizations continue to maintain focus on their critical role in supporting the warfight. Infantry officers, schooled in
combined arms warfare, will serve as the critical link between the operational and generating force.
b. Infantry Branch life cycle. Figure 9–1, below, shows how Infantry Branch time lines, military, and additional
training, KD assignments, and self-development fit together to support the Infantry Branch goal of growing future
combined arms warriors. The Infantry Branch developmental goals directly support the goal of the Army transformation to grow a campaign qualify Army with Joint and expeditionary capabilities.

56

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Figure 9–1. Infantry Active Army Developmental Model

9–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for all Infantry Branch officers. To do this, the field
grade inventory must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support
branch/FA generalist positions, and to provide majors with the opportunity to serve in the critical developmental
assignment; S3/XO. The branch’s goal is to provide every major a minimum of two years S3/XO time.
b. OPMS implementation. The number of authorized Infantry billets, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions
are made, and actions to implement them are taken. Officers, who desire more information on Infantry Branch
authorizations or inventory, by grade, are encouraged to contact their AHRC OPMD assignment officer.
9–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Infantry
a. Structure. Infantry officers may serve in a variety of organizations during the Army’s transformation to include
combined arms battalions, infantry battalions, Stryker infantry battalions, RSTA squadrons, or reconnaissance squadrons. However, after modular transformation is complete, the primary operational assignments for Infantry officers will
be in brigade combat teams. Infantry officers may also serve in critical developmental assignments in TDA
organizations.
b. Acquire. Infantry officers are accessed through USMA, ROTC, and OCS. Officers are accessed into Infantry
based on their branch preference and the needs of the Army. Infantry is a recipient branch under the current system of
branch detailing. Infantry receives officers from the combat support and Service support arms to fill lieutenant

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

57

authorizations. Branch detailed officers return to their commissioning branch upon their selection to captain and
assignment to their branch transition course. The current system is meeting the needs of the force.
c. Distribute. The goal of Infantry Branch is to provide every Infantry officer a variety of leadership, staff, and
functional assignments at each grade to develop and use their craft as combined arms warriors. The priority is on
developing a depth of experience in Infantry operations while concurrently developing a depth of experience in JIIM
organizations and combined arms warfare. They will also be provided the opportunity to serve in key generating force
assignments in order to fully develop their knowledge of how the Army runs and to provide opportunities to support
the warfighting Army through key staff and functional assignments. Officers may also rotate between CONUS and
OCONUS assignments. Officers will have more time to gain the requisite skills in their branch and their branch/FA
generalist assignments. Infantry officers are rotated between assignments to ensure they develop the full range of skills
necessary to perform as senior leaders.
d. Deploy. Infantry officers remain the Army’s principle warfighters. Whether assigned to TOE organizations or
TDA organizations, all Infantry officers must be prepared to deploy on short notice anywhere in the world to lead
Soldiers. Infantry officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national
interests; or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace
keeping missions. Infantry Branch officers must prepare themselves and their Families for this most challenging life
cycle function.
e. Sustain. Infantry combat skills are maintained through institutional training and assignments in warfighting units.
(1) Promotion. Infantry Branch field grade officers designated to remain in Infantry and the MF&E functional
category will compete for promotion only within their functional category. If an Infantry officer is designated to one of
the two other functional categories, he/she will no longer compete against Infantry officers for promotion.
(2) Command. Infantry Branch commanders will continue to be centrally selected for command at the battalion and
brigade level. These commands are organized into four command categories: operations, strategic support, recruiting
and training, and installation. Officers have the option of selecting the category or categories in which they desire to
compete for command, while declining competition in other categories. The results of the command selection process
are announced in the CSL.
(3) Officer Evaluation Report (OER). The OER (DA Form 67–9) requires the rater and senior rater to recommend a
functional category for all Army competitive captains through lieutenant colonels. When recommending a functional
designation for rated officers, rating officials will consider the whole person with factors such as demonstrated
performance, educational background, technical or unique expertise, military experience, or training and personal
preference of the officer. Functional category recommendations of raters and senior raters on the OER will be an
important factor taken into consideration during the functional Designation Process.
f. Develop. Infantry officers are developed through a logical progression of TOE assignments, institutional training,
and staff/TDA assignments. The focus of Infantry officer professional development is on the attainment and utilization
of warfighting skills, and the utilization of those skills to support the critical doctrine, organization, training, material
systems, leader development, personnel, and facility (DOTMLPF) development missions of the branch. The goal is to
professionally develop officers to employ firepower and maneuver skills in support of combined arms and Joint
operations. Development occurs through the Army school system; all officers selected for major should complete some
form of ILE education, and all officers selected for colonel should complete SSC.
g. Separate. Infantry Branch has no unique separation processes.
9–8. Infantry Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. RC Infantry officer development objectives and qualifications parallel those planned
for their Active duty counterparts, with limited exceptions. The increase in advanced technology weaponry and the
lethality of modern weapon systems requires that RC officers train at the appropriate level. This is necessary in order to
acquire those skills required for commanding, training, and managing RC organizations for peacetime operation, as
well as mobilization. The RC officer must realize that a large portion of his/her education and training will be
accomplished on his/her own time, in accordance with his/her unit duty assignments. A variety of correspondence
courses are available as well as a full range of schools that he may attend as a resident student. Junior officers must
develop a strong foundation of Infantry tactical and technical expertise through assignments in their branch before
specializing in a specific area/skill.
(1) Role. The RC Infantry officer serves the same role and mission as his Active Army counterpart. The unique
nature of his role as a "citizen Soldier" will pose a challenge to his professional development program. However, RC
officer professional development is expected to mirror Active Army officer development patterns as closely as possible,
except as noted below. The two primary exceptions are: RC officers tend to spend more time in key leadership
positions and RC officers have increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. In order to meet
professional development objectives, the RC officer may need to rotate between ARNG and USAR TPU, the IRR, and
IMA assignments to reach his/her professional development objectives. Refer to chapter 7 for a detailed description of
RC officer career management and development.

58

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(2) RC lieutenant. Upon commissioning, each officer is assigned a career branch in which the emphasis for training
and development occurs during the officers first 7 to 8 years.
(a) Education. Mandatory military education during this phase is completion of the resident BOLC, which should be
completed within 12 months (no later than18 months) of commissioning and is a prerequisite for promotion to first
lieutenant. Officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university to qualify for
promotion to captain.
(b) Initial assignments. Officers should seek and be assigned to leadership positions in troop units whenever
possible. This duty provides the officer an understanding of operations and military life that will build a solid
foundation for future Service. Every attempt will be made to assign junior officers to troop units. While assigned at the
company level, officers should seek a variety of assignments, which will enhance their future performance as a
commander.
(3) RC captain.
(a) Formal training. Mandatory education during this phase is completion of the MC3, which is a prerequisite for
promotion to major. MC3 can be completed through attendance at the resident course or the RC course (MC3—DL)
that has a distance learning phase and a 2-week resident phase. A percentage of Infantry officers elect to attend the
Infantry CCC (resident or RC course) in lieu of MC3/ MC3—DL. Officers branch transferring are encouraged to refer
to ATRRS online for military education requirements and procedures to apply for MC3 constructive credit.
(b) Assignments. Assignments in a company, battalion, or brigade organization should follow a progressive order.
The command of a unit is the essence of leadership development at this stage of an officer’s career. Units fill company
command positions with officers who have demonstrated the potential for and the desire to command Soldiers. Most
command tours are 36 months long with the tour length set by the higher commander and should be preceded by
attendance at the company level PCC. The number of company command positions may not afford every officer to
have the opportunity to command at the captain level. Command can be of traditional modification tables of
organization and equipment (MTOE) line units or TDA) units. Some officers may receive more than one command
opportunity, but those cases are rare. Battalion staff experience is also desired during this period, but the focus should
be to command a unit.
(c) Typical duty assignments. Officers should aggressively seek Infantry company command. Following successful
company command, officers can be assigned to similar types of non-troop assignments as Active Army officers. In
addition, they may participate in the IMA and AGR programs.
(d) FA training. RC officers are awarded a FA based upon the needs of the Army, the officer’s geographic location,
individual experience, education, and training. FA assignments offer the Infantry officer flexibility and the opportunity
for additional assignments in both the ARNG and USAR. Officers who received an FA while on Active Duty may
continue to serve in that FA or may request award of a different FA based upon the availability of such assignments
and the needs of the Army. FA designators are awarded at the officer’s request once all prerequisites for award of the
FA have been met.
(4) RC major. Promotion to major normally occurs between the 12th and 14th year of commissioned Service.
Promotion prior to consideration by the DA mandatory promotion board (position vacancy promotion) is possible.
Selection for major is based on performance and potential for further Service in positions of greater responsibility.
These qualities are measured by the officer’s assignment history, branch development achieved, and the relative
standing of the officer to his/her peers as indicated in the OER.
(a) Formal training. Officers should complete ILE. The RC major must complete 50 percent of ILE as a prerequisite for promotion to lieutenant colonel; however, selection for command requires 100 percent completion of ILE.
Officers can complete the requirements for ILE in numerous ways: CGSC (resident or non-resident), sister Service
resident CGSC or Associate Logistics Executive Development Course (ALEDC).
(b) Assignments. The critical assignment during this phase is Service as a battalion S3 or XO, or brigade S3. Also,
duty on brigade/division staff and Joint Forces Headquarters (JFHQ) or ARCOM, GOCOM, MUSARC is desired. RC
Infantry majors may typically serve in similar assignments as Active Army officers and should continue to gain staff
experience at division level and higher. Successful assignments in positions such as battalion XO and operations
officers (S3) best prepares officers for the rigors of battalion command. Officers desiring to remain competitive for
battalion command should endeavor to serve in such positions. Duty in progressively challenging assignments is an
essential ingredient in the career development of officers prior to promotion to lieutenant colonel. Officers may
participate in the AGR program. Infantry positions in RC units are actively sought and highly competitive. An officer
should seek to remain in a unit if at all possible. An officer may choose to become a member of the IRR or the IMA
programs. The IRR and IMA programs for Majors offer many unique opportunities for training and development. The
IMA program provides the Infantry officer an opportunity to train in the position he/she will occupy upon mobilization.
(5) RC lieutenant colonel. The promotion board considers the RC Major for promotion to lieutenant colonel at the
16th year of commissioned Service. Promotion prior to consideration by the DA mandatory promotion board (BZ
promotion) is possible. Duty in progressively challenging assignments is an essential ingredient in the career development of officers and subsequent promotion to lieutenant colonel. Generally, these positions are in the MTOE or TDA
environment as staff officers in battalions, brigades, or JFHQ. Highly qualified officers in this phase may be selected to

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

59

command a battalion or squadron. Other assignments include: brigade DCO/XO; division primary staff; various JFHQ;
Army reserve commands (ARCOM); general officer commands (GOCOMS); or major USAR commands (MUSARC)
staff positions. He/she may also participate in the AGR, IRR, or IMA programs.
(a) Formal training. The RC lieutenant colonel must complete ILE prior to promotion to colonel. Selectees for
battalion command attend the Infantry PCC. Qualified Infantry lieutenant colonels may apply for the AWC or other
SSCs (resident or correspondence).
(b) Assignments. Highly qualified RC lieutenant colonels may be selected to command a battalion, squadron or
Infantry TASS battalion. Other typical assignments include the following: brigade XO; division primary staff, various
JFHQ, U.S. Army Reserve Regional Support Command (RSC), GOCOM, and MUSARC staff positions; or HQDA
level and Joint staff assignments. RC lieutenant colonels may participate in the AGR, IRR, or IMA programs
(6) RC colonel.
(a) Formal training. Although no mandatory education requirements (other than PCC for command selectees) exist
during this phase, officers are encouraged to complete SSC (resident or nonresident).
(b) Assignments. Highly qualified colonels may be selected to command a heavy BCT, Stryker brigade combat team
(SBCT), or infantry BCT. Other typical assignments include AGR program participation and various senior duty
positions at the division, JFHQ, RSC, GOCOM, MUSARC levels, and HQDA and Joint staff assignments.
b. Branch development. Even though RC officer development is challenged by geographical considerations and time
constraints, each officer should strive for Infantry assignments and educational opportunities that yield the same
developmental opportunities as their Active Army counterparts.
(1) Introduction. RC (ARNG and USAR) officers must also meet certain standards in terms of schooling and
operational assignments to be considered fully qualified in the Infantry Branch at each grade. Due to geographical,
time, and civilian employment constraints, RC Infantry officers may find it difficult to serve in the required operational
assignments required at each grade in order to remain fully qualified as an Infantry officer. Nevertheless, RC Infantry
officers are expected to complete the educational requirements discussed below and to aggressively seek out the
operational assignments to remain proficient in the branch.
(2) Lieutenant. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop the
requisite Infantry Branch skills, knowledge and attributes. The focus of the officer at this stage of his/her career is on
development of Infantry tactical and technical warfighting skills and the utilization of these skills in an operational
assignment.
(a) Education. The BOLC must be completed during this phase. BOLC provides the Infantry lieutenant the basic
skills necessary to function as an infantry platoon leader. In addition, the RC Infantry lieutenant may attend Ranger
School, Infantry Mortar Platoon Officer Course, or Airborne School. Additional training following BOLC is primarily
dependent on the lieutenant’s unit of assignment.
(b) Assignments. The critical assignment during this phase is serving as a platoon leader in a BCT. The typical
Infantry lieutenant will be assigned as a platoon leader or staff officer in an infantry battalion upon completion of the
basic course. Other typical assignments for lieutenants are battalion specialty platoon leader (recon, weapons, or
mortar), company XO, battalion liaison officer (LNO), S3 air or logistics officer (S4). An Infantry officer may also
serve in a staff position after promotion to captain, but prior to attendance at the MC3.
(c) Self-development. Self-development during this phase should focus on infantry tactical fundamentals, troop
leading procedures, leadership skills, organizational maintenance, resupply operations, basic administrative operations,
and other branch technical proficiency skills.
(d) Desired experience. Each Infantry lieutenant must complete all BOLC phases, successfully serve in an operational TOE platoon leader assignment, and then supplement his/her technical and tactical abilities through assignment
to a specialty platoon or staff position. The goal is to develop lieutenants with an understanding of Infantry maneuver
tactics at the platoon level.
(3) RC captain. The desired experience for the Infantry Branch Captain is—
(a) Completing the MC3. (See ATRRS online for military education requirements based on the type of BOLC
completed and for constructive credit application procedures.)
(b) Obtaining a baccalaureate degree to qualify for promotion to captain.
(c) Commanding an Infantry company successfully. The goal is for each RC captain to serve a minimum of 36
months company command time (plus or minus 12 months). However, the key is quality of the experience rather than
time in command.
(4) RC major. The goals for RC Infantry major professional development are as follows:
(a) Service in a TOE or TDA battalion or as a brigade S3. The goal is for each Infantry major to serve a minimum
of 24 months. There is no substitute for time spent as an S3/XO in preparing the Infantry major for battalion command
and for expanding his/her knowledge of combined arms maneuver warfare.
(b) Supplement their S3/XO experience with assignments in key duty positions in Infantry units. This includes
Service in primary staff positions at the battalion, brigade, or regiment levels; and continues to gain staff experience at
the division and higher levels. RC majors may participate in the AGR or IMA programs.

60

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(c) Enrollment in ILE prior to 18 years TIS. At least 50 percent of ILE must be completed for promotion to
lieutenant colonel.
(5) RC lieutenant colonel. The desired professional development experiences for the Infantry lieutenant colonel are
as follows:
(a) Completion of ILE. This must be completed within three years of promotion to lieutenant colonel.
(b) Command TOE maneuver battalion or TDA battalion for 36 months (plus or minus 12 months). While every
Infantry officer will not command at the battalion level, the goal of Infantry officer professional development is to
provide every Infantry officer the assignments, institutional training, and experience to prepare him/her for command at
this level. The Infantry officers selected for command will remain competitive for promotion to colonel and brigade
command.
(c) Service in key duty positions such as a brigade or regiment XO, or Service in division primary staff or JFHQ,
RSC, GOCOM, and MUSARC staff positions; or in HQDA and Joint staff assignments. RC lieutenant colonels may
participate in the AGR or IMA programs.
(d) May be selected to attend an SSC or AWC Corresponding Studies Course.
(6) RC colonel. The professional development goals for Infantry colonels are as follows:
(a) Command of a BCT for 36 months (plus or minus 12 months).
(b) Service in various duty positions at the division, JFHQ, RSC, GOCOM, and MUSARC levels; or in HQDA and
Joint staff assignments. Colonels may participate in the AGR or IMA program.

Chapter 10
Armor Branch
10–1. Unique features of the Armor Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Armor Branch. Armor Branch encompasses Armor or combined arms organizations that
close with and destroy the enemy using fire, maneuver, and shock effect; and cavalry and reconnaissance organizations
that perform reconnaissance, provide security, and engage in the full spectrum of combat operations.
b. The way ahead. The Army transformation and the contemporary operating environment will significantly affect
how the Armor Branch trains, assigns, and develops officers. While the focus of the Armor Branch has always been the
development of combined arms warriors, the Army’s ongoing transformation institutionalizes this concept through the
transition to combined arms formations. This will drive an increased focus on mounted maneuver operations for
company grade officers, transitioning to a combined and Joint operational focus for field grade officers whose expertise
includes the application of MF&E in the Joint operational battlespace. The development of Armor officers will also
focus on the development of agile and adaptive officers and multi-skilled leaders who collectively embody knowledge
of operations in a JIIM environment. While AHRC will make every effort to synchronize the three priorities, the needs
of the Army and the professional development needs of the officer must continue to take precedence over individual
preference. The assignment of Armor officers will continue to be made based on—
(1) The needs of the Army.

62

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(2) The professional development needs of the officer.
(3) The officer’s preference.
c. Unique functions performed by the Armor Branch. Armor officers fulfill their mission by commanding, directing
and controlling mounted maneuver, combined arms organizations; providing expertise on the employment of combined
arms forces at all staff levels; and developing the doctrine, organizations, training, materiel, and leaders necessary to
support the mounted maneuver mission. The initial focus of Armor officers is the development of the core technical
and tactical Armor, cavalry, and reconnaissance skills. Following the initial focus on Armor and cavalry skills
development, Armor officers begin to develop a broader focus on mounted maneuver, combined arms, and Joint
warfare as they progress through their careers.
d. Unique features of work in the Armor Branch. The Armor Branch currently has three AOCs and three skill
identifiers. Detailed descriptions of the AOCs and skill identifiers listed below can be found in DA Pam 611–21.
(1) Armor officer, general (19A). These officers perform in staff positions requiring skills involving general Armor,
cavalry, and reconnaissance practical experience. These officers should possess appropriate technical and tactical
institutional Armor School training in both tank and cavalry/scout weapons systems and have developed tactical
expertise in mounted combined arms warfare.
(2) Armor (19B). These officers perform in command or staff positions in mounted maneuver units with tanks or
mobile gun systems.
(3) Cavalry (19C). These officers perform in command or staff positions in cavalry and reconnaissance organizations. Cavalry officers must complete either the Scout Leader Course or the Cavalry Leader Course to serve in a 19C
coded position.
(4) Additional skill identifiers associated with Armor AOCs—
(a) M1A2 Abrams Tank (3J).
(b) M1A1 Abrams Tank (3M).
(c) M2/M3 Bradley CFV/IFV (3X).
e. Branch detail. Armor Branch participates in the branch detailing of officers into Armor for development and
growth at the grade of lieutenant. Officers detailed Armor (branch code 19) will lose their Armor designation once they
reach their branch detail expiration date and they have been reassigned into their new branch.
f. Branch eligibility. The Armor Branch is closed to female officers under the Secretary of Defense direct ground
combat rule. Male officers of other branches who desire a branch transfer to Armor should submit a request in
accordance with AR 614–100, chapter 4.
10–2. Officer characteristics required
a. Competencies and actions common to all. Armor officers are valued for their skills as leaders, trainers and
planners: skills which are acquired and perfected through realistic training, PME, and Service in the most demanding
positions Armor Branch offers. The Armor Branch values both critical warfighting operational force assignments and
the generating force assignments. The goal of the branch is to provide each officer with a series of leadership, staff and
functional assignments; institutional training; and self-development opportunities in order to develop combined arms
warriors with well rounded backgrounds and an understanding of JIIM operations.
b. Unique skills. Armor officers should display consistently outstanding performance across a wide variety of
MTOE warfighting and TDA training and staff positions. Armor officers should demonstrate excellence in their
warfighting skills; technical proficiency; a well developed understanding of mounted Joint and combined arms warfare;
and the ability to lead, train, motivate, and care for Soldiers.
10–3. Officer developmental assignments
a. Lieutenant. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop the requisite
Armor Branch skills, knowledge and attributes. The focus of the officer at this stage of his career is on development of
Armor and Cavalry tactical and technical warfighting skills and the utilization of these skills in an operational
assignment.
(1) Education. The BOLC must be completed during this phase. BOLC provides the Armor lieutenant the basic
skills necessary to function as a tank platoon leader and an overview of Cavalry tactics and techniques. Prior to
assignment to a cavalry platoon, the Armor lieutenant must attend the Scout Leader Course. In addition, the Armor
Lieutenant may attend Ranger School, Battalion Maintenance Officer Course (through distance learning), Infantry
Mortar Platoon officer Course, or Airborne School. Additional training following BOLC is primarily dependent on the
Lieutenant’s unit of assignment.
(2) Assignments. The critical assignment during this phase is serving as a platoon leader in a TOE operational unit.
Historically, all qualified Armor lieutenants have had the opportunity to serve as Armor, cavalry, or reconnaissance
platoon leaders. The typical Armor lieutenant will be assigned as a platoon leader or staff officer in a reconnaissance or
combined arms organization upon completion of BOLC. In addition, a limited number of Armor lieutenants will serve
as TRADOC training company executive officers or staff officers. However, the initial assignment for all Armor
lieutenants should be to a TOE operational unit. Other typical assignments for lieutenants are battalion or squadron

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

63

special platoon leader (scout or mortar), company or troop executive officer, or battalion/squadron staff officer. An
Armor officer may also serve in a staff position after promotion to captain, but prior to attendance at the MC3. A
limited number of Armor lieutenants will serve at the same installation through the completion of company command
as a captain. These officers will attend the MC3 then return to the same installation to complete their initial assignment
as a captain. The ability of an Armor officer to remain at the same installation for his initial two assignments will be
dependent on the Armor grade structure at that installation and the needs of the Army.
(3) Self-development. Self-development during this phase should focus on tank and cavalry tactical fundamentals,
troop leading procedures, leadership skills, tank gunnery, organizational maintenance, resupply operations, basic
administrative operations, and other branch technical proficiency skills.
(4) Desired experience. Each Armor lieutenant must complete all BOLC phases, successfully serve in an operational
TOE platoon leader assignment, then supplement his technical and tactical abilities through assignment to a specialty
platoon or staff position. The goal is to develop lieutenants with an understanding of mounted maneuver tactics at the
platoon level. A limited number of Armor lieutenants will also serve in generating force assignments prior to attending
MC3.
b. Captain. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop mounted
maneuver officers who have exhibited leadership skills as a company commander and staff officer in an operational
unit and who have rounded out their knowledge through successfully completing one or more assignments in the
generating force. Armor captains who have served in both operational and generating force positions have honed their
tactical skills and expanded their capabilities through their functional assignment. The Armor Branch wants to develop
captains with operational expertise and who are prepared to provide significant contributions to the generating force.
(1) Education. Completion of a branch CCC is mandatory during this period. The majority of Armor officers will
attend the MC3 branch training, while a select few will attend other branch CCCs. Officers assigned to a cavalry
organization after completion of CCC will normally attend the Cavalry Leader Course when available with respect to
unit requirements. Officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree prior to attending the CCC. Officers not holding a
degree can complete through the DCP in accordance with AR 621–1, chapter 4. The Armor captain should coordinate
the DCP with the Armor junior captain career manager.
(2) Assignments. Developmental assignments during this phase are a combination of operational company/troop
command and Service as a primary staff officer. Armor officers may serve on operational or generating force unit
staffs at the brigade/regiment and battalion/squadron level prior to command. Most Armor officers will be assigned to a
BCT/regiment for a three-year assignment immediately following completion of the CCC. (During the Army transformation to a unit focused assignment system, officers my serve varying tour lengths as three-year stabilized assignments
are phased in over several years.) A few select company commanders will serve their company command and staff
assignments initially or subsequently in a TRADOC TDA organization. In order to provide operational command
experience to the maximum number of Armor officers, Armor Branch will assign a number of captains to TDA
commands following the CCC and prior to assignment to a BCT. Additionally, a limited number of Armor captains
will be assigned to a TDA command following a BCT assignment. TDA company commanders having their first
commands at the Armor Center will be given the highest consideration for follow-on MTOE assignments to compete
for MTOE company command. This program increases operational command opportunity and ensures the integration
of officers with operational experience into the Armor Center to support the critical DOTMLPF mission. Upon
completion of company command, a full spectrum of assignments is possible. The purpose of these assignments is to
meet critical Army requirements, further develop the officer’s knowledge base, and provide him a more well-rounded
professional experience. Additionally, officers will have the opportunity serve in one of the following assignments
identified below:
(a) TDA staff.
(b) Active Army/RC training support brigade trainer and staff.
(c) CTC trainer or observer/controller.
(d) Service school instructor or small group instructor.
(e) Doctrine developer.
(f) Training developer.
(g) ACOM and higher-level DA staff.
(h) USMA faculty and staff.
(i) U.S. Army Recruiting Company Command and Staff.
(j) ROTC Assistant Professor of Military Science.
(k) Multinational and Coalition Trainer and Staff officer.
(l) Army Sponsored Fellowships and Scholarships.
(m) Other combat arms or branch generalist positions.
(3) Self-development. During this phase, Armor officers must hone their leadership, tactical and technical skills, and
concentrate on those critical tasks required to accomplish their wartime mission while winning on the battlefield. The
officer should also begin to develop a more thorough understanding of combined arms operations in a Joint
environment.
64

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(4) Army Acquisition Corps. Small numbers of Armor officers from each year group will be accessed into the Army
Acquisition Corps. The primary look is in year 6 of a captain’s career, and then the officer will be re-looked during
years 7–8. The Army Acquisition Corps conducts a DA level selection board. All applications for transfer must be
made directly to the acquisition manager, OPMD, AHRC. Volunteers make up most of the accession numbers, while a
few officers may be re- branched based on their academic degree. Officers accessed into the Army Acquisition Corps
will be branch transferred to acquisition corps.
(5) Desired experience. The KD assignment for an Armor captain is successful Service as a company/troop
commander. There is no substitute for operational company/troop command that develops an Armor officer’s leadership and tactical skills and prepares him for future leadership assignments at successively higher levels of responsibility. The goal is to provide each Armor captain 18 months (+/- six months) company command time; however, the key is
the quality of the experience rather than time. Armor captains should also expand their tactical and technical
capabilities through assignment as a battalion/squadron staff officer prior to reassignment out of the brigade/regiment.
Armor captains should strive to command in a 19Z/11Z/03A coded command if possible. In some cases, unit
requirements may require Armor captains to serve as company commanders of other organizations in order to meet
operational requirements. A limited number of Armor captains will also serve on transition teams in Iraq or Afghanistan. Service on a transition team, combined with 12 months of company command may provide the quality of
experience to consider an officer complete with their key developmental assignment as an Armor captain.
(6) FDB. A limited number of officers may choose to opt-in to an FDB after 3 YOS. The 4 year FDB selects a
limited number of captains to fill requirements at the grade of captain in select FAs. This board is not mandatory and
officers must choose to compete. FAs open each year are based on the needs of the Army. All Armor officers will
undergo a FDB at their 7 year mark. This HQDA board will decide in which of the 3 functional categories each officer
is best suited to serve. Decisions are based on the needs of the Army, the officer’s preference, rater and senior rater’s
recommendations, and the officer’s skills and training. The three functional categories are MF&E; operations support;
and force sustainment. After the FDB board convenes, each officer will be assigned a Branch or FA within a functional
category. Officers who are selected to serve outside of Armor Branch will be managed by their respective branch or
FA career manager. Officers who remain in Armor Branch will be managed by Armor Branch until selection for
colonel, when they will be managed by the Army Senior Leader Development Office. Armor officers who remain in
the MF&E functional category will receive both branch (19Z) and branch generalist (O1A/O2A) assignments.
c. Majors. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to expand the officer’s
mounted maneuver tactical and technical experience and continue to develop him as a combined arms warrior and
leader with a comprehensive understanding of combined arms warfare in a Joint and expeditionary environment.
Additionally, through a series of operational staff and generating force functional assignments, the Armor major
continues to increase his contribution to the institutional Army and his understanding of how the Army operates. The
key is to provide the Armor major with the tools that prepare him for future battalion command and for increasingly
complex generating force assignments.
(1) Education. Military education required during this phase is completion of ILE through completion of the U.S.
Army CGSC. ILE is divided into two phases. Phase 1 is a 14-week common core training block of instruction. Phase 2
is the AOWC, which is the field grade credentialing course that is required for all Armor officers. Officers may also
compete to be selected for the SAMS, following AOWC. Those selected must serve a utilization tour as a corps or
division plans/assistant G3 staff officer.
(2) Assignments. KD assignments during this phase are as follows:
(a) Battalion/squadron XO/S3,
(b) Brigade/regiment XO/S3.
(c) Division Chief of Plans. (SAMS Utilization)
1. The Division Chief of Plans position is considered a key developmental experience for the SAMS graduate
Armor officer when served in conjunction with at least 12 months Service in a battalion/squadron or brigade/regimental
S3/XO position. Experience at the brigade/regimental level and below is absolutely essential for the professional
growth of the Armor officer and necessary for success at future levels of command.
2. Each officer should have sufficient experience and participate in a capstone event in these KD assignments in
order to develop an understanding of mounted and combined arms operations. There is no substitute for preparing an
Armor officer for future command and for building his mounted maneuver and combined arms skills. The Armor major
may further expand his tactical and technical skills by serving in staff assignments at division level and higher.
(3) Armor majors will also meet the Army’s mission requirements and build on their institutional skills through
varied generating force, JIIM assignments. Examples of Armor major assignments beyond KD positions are as follows:
(a) Active Army/RC S3/XO.
(b) Doctrine developer.
(c) Training developer.
(d) DA staff officer.
(e) Joint staff officer.
(f) Brigade, division, or corps staff.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

65

(g) CTC trainer or staff officer.
(h) Unit of Action Experimental Element (UAEE) S3/XO.
(i) ACOM staff (CONUS and OCONUS).
(j) CGSC staff and faculty.
(k) Service school instructor.
(l) USMA faculty and staff.
(m) ROTC Assistant Professor of Military Science.
(n) Multinational and Coalition Trainer and Staff officer.
(o) Army sponsored fellowships and scholarships.
(4) Self-development. Armor majors are expected to continue self-development efforts to build intellectual capital,
strategic perspective, and hone operational skills. Armor majors will be required to develop and use a diverse set of
skills as they move between combined arms leadership positions in TOE and TDA organizations as well as functional
Armor, branch immaterial, and JIIM assignments.
(5) Desired experience. At this stage of the officer’s career, the Armor major must hone his skills in the planning
and execution of combined arms warfare and to develop expertise in the JIIM operational environment. While the goal
is to provide every Armor major a minimum of 18–24 months combined time in the critical assignments, quality of the
assignment rather than time is the critical factor. Not all Armor officers will have the opportunity for by-law Joint
credit assignments but rather the goal is that the Armor officer corps builds a bench of JIIM experience. The officer’s
operational expertise should be supplemented by further Service in positions of increasing responsibility in the
generating force.
(6) Additional factors.
(a) The goal of the branch is to develop an inventory of field grade officers who embody a collective knowledge of
JIIM experience. While not every officer will receive an assignment in a qualifying Joint assignment or serve a
fellowship in a JIIM agency, the goal is to provide the maximum opportunity for Armor majors to receive JIIM
experience. However, this will be dependent on Army demands and position/fellowship availability.
(b) A limited number of Armor field grade officers may be assigned to positions currently coded as FA positions. A
number of FA field grade positions will be coded as open to assignment by non-FA officers. The goal is to expand
position access, especially for JIIM positions. Armor majors may be assigned to Armor Branch, branch/combat arms
generalist (01A, 02A, 03A), or FA positions coded for access by branch officers.
(c) A limited number of Armor majors will serve on transition teams. This experience, when combined with time
spent as an S3/XO, provides the Armor major the skills to prepare him for future operational and generating force
assignments of increasing responsibility and for command. While our goal is to provide a minimum of 24 months
combined time in these positions, the key is the quality of the assignment vice time in position.
d. Lieutenant colonel. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is demonstrated
excellence in tactical skills, technical proficiency, and the ability to lead, train, motivate, and care for Soldiers in both
the staff and command environments. As the Armor officer increases in rank, his opportunity to serve in the
operational force will decrease as the percentage of positions in the generating force increases. The officer’s previous
generating force assignments prepare him for his expanded role in the generating force serving in positions of
increasing responsibility.
(1) Education. Lieutenant colonels selected for command complete a PCC and may be selected for SSC following
command.
(2) Assignments. Officers selected for lieutenant colonel in Armor should seek assignments of greater responsibility
in branch and branch generalist positions. The objective in lieutenant colonel assignments is greater contribution to the
branch and the Army. It is important in this phase of an Armor officer’s career that he serves in an assignment that
further develops his Joint combined arms skill set and improves warfighting skills. The most critical assignment for
Armor lieutenant colonels in the MF&E functional category is battalion level command. Top performing Armor
officers who are already highly competitive for Colonel and command selection are those most likely to be selected for
Lieutenant Colonel command. Armor lieutenant colonels selected for command will normally serve two to three years
in command at battalion level. Armor officers are selected for CSL commands in four command categories; operations,
strategic support, training and recruiting, and installation. Typical duty assignments for lieutenant colonels could
include—
(a) Battalion/squadron command.
(b) CTC task force trainer.
(c) Brigade or regiment XO, and deputy BCT commander.
(d) Division G3 (Note: This may migrate to a colonel assignment).
(e) Division or corps staff.
(f) Service branch school staff and instructors.
(g) HQDA or Joint staff, NATO staff, combatant commands staff.
(h) TSB battalion commander.

66

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(i) UAEE battalion command or staff.
(j) XO/S3 positions in an Active Army/RC training support brigade.
(k) RC support.
(l) ROTC PMS.
(m) ACOM staff.
(n) BCTP O/T. (Note that assignment opportunity for some Armor lieutenant colonel positions will be limited to
former battalion commanders.)
(3) Self-development. During this phase of an Armor officer’s career, self-development takes the form of selfassessment, off-duty civil schooling, and perfecting mentoring and managerial skills. The officer should also continue
to hone his combined arms warfighting skills and his understanding of the Joint operational environment.
(4) Desired experience. The goal of Armor Branch development is to prepare every officer for command of a
combined arms, cavalry, or reconnaissance warfighting organization at the lieutenant colonel level. While not every
officer will command, and Armor lieutenant colonels will provide exceptional contributions to the Army in the
generating force, the focus remains the development of officers imbued with technical and tactical knowledge of the
Joint, combined arms, mounted maneuver warfare, and the application of MF&E on the battlefield. The critical
assignment for an Armor lieutenant colonel is command. While the typical command tour has historically been 24
months, due to ongoing operational deployments, unit transitions, and the implementation of life cycle managed units,
command tours may range from less than 24 months to 36 months in length.
e. Colonel. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is sustainment of warfighting, training, and staff skill along with utilization of leadership, managerial, and executive talents. The majority of
strategic level leaders in the army are colonels. Colonels are expected to be multi-skilled leaders; strategic and creative
thinkers; builders of leaders and teams; competent full spectrum warfighters; skilled in governance, statesmanship, and
diplomacy; and understand cultural context and work effectively across it.
(1) Education. Historically, the majority of officers selected for promotion to colonel are selected to attend SSC.
(2) Assignments. Armor colonels contribute to the Army by serving in crucial assignments in branch and generalist
positions. The critical task during this phase is to fully develop the broad skills and competencies required of a multiskilled leader, while maintaining branch competency (warfighting skills). Officers should make maximum use of their
talents. Armor colonels will make full use of their broad MF&E and JIIM experience, managerial skills, and executive
talents to meet the needs of the Army. A critical assignment for an Armor colonel in the MF&E functional category is
selection for brigade or regimental command. Armor officers selected for brigade level command will serve in the
same four command CSL categories as lieutenant colonels, garrison command tour lengths are 24 months but can be
extended to 36 months. Critical assignments for colonels include—
(a) Brigade, regiment, or garrison command.
(b) CTC operations group commander/chief of staff.
(c) TRADOC systems manager/TRADOC capabilities manager.
(d) Division or corps chief of staff.
(e) Division, corps, or field Army Assistant Chief of Ataff, G–3.
(f) Executive officer to a general officer.
(g) Department Director, U.S. Army Armor Center.
(h) HQDA or Joint staff.
(3) Self-development. Armor colonels must maintain their branch skills and keep current on all changes that affect
the Soldiers they command and/or manage. JIIM assignments are important during this phase.
(4) Desired experience. The primary goal at this stage is to fully use the experience and knowledge gained in a
position where the officer can provide a significant contribution to the operational and generating force. The critical
assignment for an Armor colonel is brigade level command. No other position provides the Armor officer the
opportunity to fully use his depth of experience in Joint and combined arms warfare and to capitalize on his functional
generating force assignments in Service to the Army. However, only a limited number of Armor officers will have the
opportunity to command. Those officers not selected for command will continue to provide exceptional Service in
generating force and JIIM assignments of increasing responsibility. These officers also provide the critical bridge
between the operational and generating force, and serve as the advocate of commanders in key staff elements.
f. JIIM assignments. The development of Armor officers will also focus on the development of agile and adaptive
officers and multi-skilled leaders who collectively embody knowledge of JIIM organizations. Armor officers will be
considered for a billet on the JDAL based on the needs of the Army, professional development needs of the officer and
availability of a Joint assignment. Armor officers and units will continue to be called on to participate in Joint
operations around the world. JIIM experience, developed through sequential assignments, will provide the broad
perspective necessary to be successful now and in the future.
10–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. The professional development goal of the Armor Branch is to produce and sustain highly qualified

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

67

officers who are tactically and operationally oriented to lead Soldiers and command units in combat and perform other
assigned missions. Assignments in combined arms organizations will be made to develop the officer’s overall ability to
achieve that goal. The officer’s assignments will be based on the needs of the Army, the officer’s professional
development needs and the officer’s preference. While the Armor Branch, AHRC, makes every effort to support
individual officer’s assignment preferences, the needs of the Army and the officer’s professional development needs
must take priority.
b. Precedence. Certain assignments in the Armor Branch will occur in a precedence sequence. Other assignments to
include professional military training are not constrained, but if possible should occur in sequence. Command positions
will have precedence over staff positions. These positions develop an officer’s ability to command at various levels
throughout a career. For example, before an officer can be a battalion/squadron S3, he will have had a successful
company/troop command. The preferred sequence for a major for professional development is education, battalion/
squadron XO/S3 or brigade/regiment XO/S3, followed by a JIIM, branch/FA generalist or division/brigade staff officer
assignment, though operational requirements will require that some officers gain their battalion/squadron XO/S3 or
brigade/regiment XO/S3 prior to attending ILE.
10–5. Duration of officer life cycle assignments
a. Key Armor Branch positions. The Armor Branch officer will serve in several key developmental positions as they
progress through their career in order to develop a Joint and expeditionary mindset, tactical and technical expertise in
combined arms warfare, a firm grounding in Armor and cavalry operations, and knowledge of JIIM organizations.
There is no substitute in the Armor Branch for Service with troops in key leadership positions. The goal of the Armor
officer professional development model is to provide the Armor officer a series of operational staff and leadership
positions, supplemented by opportunities to round out their knowledge in key generating force positions in order to
achieve success in positions of leadership at successively higher levels. The primary positions that develop this level of
expertise, in sequence, are platoon leader, company/troop commander, S3/XO. The goal is to ensure that every Armor
officer is given the opportunity to serve in each of these key leadership assignments. While operational realities and the
limited number of positions will prevent the branch from providing every officer the opportunity to command at the
battalion and brigade level, the goal remains to prepare every Armor officer for command. Those officers who do not
command at the battalion level will continue to provide critical support to the Army in key generating force positions.
Their role will remain to ensure that generating force organizations continue to maintain focus on their critical role in
supporting the warfight. Armor officers, schooled in combined arms warfare and the application of MF&E in Joint
operations, will serve as the critical link between the operational and generating force.
b. Armor Branch life cycle. Figure 10–1, below, shows how Armor Branch time lines, military, and additional
training, KD assignments, and self-development fit together to support the Armor Branch goal of growing future
combined arms warriors. The Armor Branch developmental goals directly support the goal of the Army transformation
to grow a campaign qualify Army with Joint and expeditionary capabilities.

68

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Figure 10–1. Armor Active Army Developmental Model

10–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for all Armor Branch officers. To do this the field
grade inventory must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support
branch/FA generalist positions, and to provide majors with the opportunity to serve in the critical developmental
assignment; S3/XO. The branch’s goal is to provide every major a minimum of two years S3/XO time while stabilized
for three years.
b. OPMS implementation. The number of authorized Armor billets, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions
are made, and actions to implement them are taken. Officers, who desire more information on Armor Branch
authorizations or inventory, by grade, are encouraged to contact their AHRC OPMD assignment officer.
10–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Armor
a. Structure. Armor officers may serve in a variety of organizations during the Army’s transformation to include
combined arms battalions, armored cavalry squadrons, or reconnaissance squadrons. However, after transformation is
complete, the primary operational assignments for Armor officers will be in brigade combat teams and reconnaissance
squadrons. Armor officers may also serve in critical developmental assignments in TDA organizations.
b. Acquire. Armor officers are accessed through USMA, ROTC, and OCS. Officers are accessed into Armor based
on their branch preference and the needs of the Army. Armor is a recipient branch under the current system of branch
detailing. Armor receives officers from the combat support and Service support arms to fill lieutenant authorizations.
Branch detailed officers return to their commissioning branch upon their selection to captain and assignment to their

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

69

branch transition course. It is imperative that branch detail officers not attend follow-on schools (such as airborne or
ranger) after the Armor CCC; they should report directly to their unit of assignment. This provides the officer with the
required time to develop as a platoon leader in combat arms before transitioning to his commissioning branch. The
current system is meeting the needs of the force.
c. Distribute. The goal of the Armor Branch is to provide every Armor officer a variety of leadership, staff, and
functional assignments at each grade to develop and use their craft as combined arms warriors. The priority is on
developing a depth of experience in Armor and cavalry operations while concurrently developing a depth of experience
in JIIM organizations and combined arms warfare. They will also be provided the opportunity to serve in key
generating force assignments in order to fully develop their knowledge of how the Army runs and to provide
opportunities to support the warfighting Army through key staff and functional assignments. Officers may also rotate
between CONUS and OCONUS assignments. Officers will have more time to gain the requisite skills in their branch
and their branch/FA generalist assignments. Armor officers are rotated between assignments to ensure they develop the
full range of skills necessary to perform as senior leaders.
d. Deploy. Armor Branch officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA
organizations, all Armor officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict.
Armor officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests; or
as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping
missions. Armor Branch officers must prepare themselves and their Families for this most challenging life cycle
function.
e. Sustain. Armor combat skills are maintained through institutional training and assignments in warfighting units.
(1) Promotion. Armor Branch field grade officers designated to remain in Armor and the MF&E functional category
will compete for promotion only within their functional category. If an Armor officer is designated to one of the two
other functional categories, he will no longer compete with Armor officers for promotion.
(2) Command. Armor Branch commanders will continue to be centrally selected for command at the battalion and
brigade level. These commands are organized into four command categories; operations, strategic support, recruiting
and training, and installation. Officers have the option of selecting the category or categories in which they desire to
compete for command, while declining competition in other categories. The results of the command selection process
are announced in the CSL.
(3) OER. The OER (DA Form 67–9) requires the rater and senior rater to recommend a functional category for all
Army competitive captains through lieutenant colonels. When recommending CFs for rated officers, rating officials
will consider the whole person with factors such as: demonstrated performance, educational background, technical or
unique expertise, military experience or training and personal preference of the officer. Functional category recommendations of raters and senior raters on the OER will be an important factor taken into consideration during the functional
category designation process.
f. Develop. Armor officers are developed through a logical progression of TOE assignments, institutional training,
and staff/TDA assignments. The focus of Armor officer professional development is on the attainment and utilization
of warfighting skills, and the utilization of those skills to support the critical DOTMLPF development missions of the
branch. The goal is to professionally develop officers to employ firepower and maneuver skills in support of combined
arms and Joint operations. Development occurs through the Army school system; all officers selected for major should
complete some form of ILE education, and all officers selected for colonel should complete SSC.
g. Separate. Armor Branch has no unique separation processes.
10–8. Armor Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. RC Armor officer development objectives and qualifications parallel those planned
for their Active Duty counterparts, with limited exceptions. The increase in advanced technology weaponry and the
lethality of modern weapon systems requires that RC officers train at the appropriate level. This is necessary in order to
acquire those skills required for commanding, training, and managing RC organizations for peacetime operation, as
well as mobilization. The RC officer must realize that a large portion of his education and training will be accomplished on his own time, in accordance with his unit duty assignments. A variety of correspondence courses are
available as well as a full range of schools that he may attend as a resident student. Junior officers must develop a
strong foundation of Armor tactical and technical expertise through assignments in their branch before specializing in a
specific area/skill.
(1) Role. The RC Armor officer serves the same role and mission as his Active Army counterpart. The unique
nature of his role as a "citizen Soldier" will pose a challenge to his professional development program. However, RC
officer professional development is expected to mirror Active Army officer development patterns as closely as possible,
except as noted below. The two primary exceptions are: RC officers tend to spend more time in key leadership
positions and RC officers have increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. In order to meet
professional development objectives, the RC officer may need to rotate between ARNG and USAR TPU, the IRR, and

70

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

IMA assignments to reach his professional development objectives. Refer to chapter 7 for a detailed description of RC
officer career management and development.
(2) RC lieutenant. Upon commissioning, each officer is assigned a career branch in which the emphasis for training
and development occurs during the officers first 7 to 8 years.
(a) Education. Mandatory military education during this phase is completion of the resident BOLC, which should be
completed within 12 months (no later than 18 months) of commissioning and is a prerequisite for promotion to first
lieutenant. Officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university to qualify for
promotion to captain.
(b) Initial assignments. Officers should seek and be assigned to leadership positions in troop units whenever
possible. This duty provides the officer an understanding of operations and military life that will build a solid
foundation for future Service. Every attempt will be made to assign junior officers to troop units. While assigned at the
company level, officers should seek a variety of assignments, which will enhance their future performance as a
commander.
(3) RC captain.
(a) Formal training. Mandatory education during this phase is completion of the MC3 which is a prerequisite for
promotion to major. MC3 can be completed through attendance at the resident course or the RC course (MC3–DL) that
has a distance learning phase and a two-week resident phase. A percentage of AR officers elect to attend the Infantry
CCC (resident or RC course) in lieu of MC3/MC3–DL. Officers branch transferring are encouraged to refer to ATRRS
online for military education requirements and procedures to apply for MC3constructive credit.
(b) Assignments. Assignments in a company, battalion or brigade organization should follow a progressive order.
The command of a unit is the essence of leadership development at this stage of an officer’s career. Units fill company
command positions with officers who have demonstrated the potential for and the desire to command Soldiers. Most
command tours are 18–24 months long with the tour length set by the higher commander and should be preceded by
attendance at the company level PCC. The number of company command positions may not afford every officer to
have the opportunity to command at the captain level. Command can be of traditional MTO line units or TDA units.
Some officers may receive more than one command opportunity, but those cases are rare. Battalion staff experience is
also desired during this period, but the focus should be to command a unit.
(c) Typical duty assignments. Officers should aggressively seek Armor, cavalry, reconnaissance, or mechanized
Infantry company/troop command. Following successful company/troop command, officers can be assigned to similar
types of non-troop assignments as Active Army officers. In addition, they may participate in the IMA and AGR
programs.
(d) FA training. RC officers are awarded an FA based upon the needs of the Army, the officer’s geographic
location, individual experience, education, and training. FA assignments offer the Armor officer flexibility and the
opportunity for additional assignments in both the ARNG and USAR. Officers who received an FA while on Active
Duty may continue to serve in that FA or may request award of a different FA based upon the availability of such
assignments and the needs of the Army. FA designators are awarded at the officer’s request once all prerequisites for
award of the FA have been met.
(4) RC major. Promotion to major normally occurs at the tenth year of commissioned Service. Promotion prior to
consideration by the DA mandatory promotion board (position vacancy promotion) is possible. Selection for major is
based on performance and potential for further Service in positions of greater responsibility. These qualities are
measured by the officer’s assignment history, branch development achieved, and the relative standing of the officer to
his peers as indicated in the OER.
(a) Formal training. Officers should complete ILE. The RC major must complete 50 percent of ILE as a prerequisite for promotion to lieutenant colonel. Officers can complete the requirements for ILE in numerous ways: CGSC
(resident or non-resident), sister Service resident CGSC, or ALEDC.
(b) Assignments. The critical assignment during this phase is Service as a battalion/squadron S3 or XO, or brigade/
regimental S3. Also, duty on brigade/division staff and JFHQ or Army Reserve commands (ARCOMs), general officer
commands (GOCOMs), major USAR commands (MUSARCs) is desired. RC Armor majors may typically serve in
similar assignments as Active Army officers and should continue to gain staff experience at division level and higher.
Successful assignments in positions such as battalion XO and operations officers (S3) best prepares officers for the
rigors of battalion/squadron command. Officers desiring to remain competitive for battalion command should endeavor
to serve in such positions. Duty in progressively challenging assignments is an essential ingredient in the career
development of officers prior to promotion to lieutenant colonel. Officers may participate in the AGR program. Armor
positions in RC units are actively sought and highly competitive. An officer should seek to remain in a unit if at all
possible. An officer may choose to become a member of the IRR or the IMA programs. The IRR and IMA programs
for majors offer many unique opportunities for training and development. The IMA program provides the Armor
officer an opportunity to train in the position he will occupy upon mobilization.
(5) RC lieutenant colonel. The promotion board considers the RC major for promotion to lieutenant colonel at the
16th year of commissioned Service. Promotion prior to consideration by the DA mandatory promotion board (BZ

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

71

promotion) is possible. Duty in progressively challenging assignments is an essential ingredient in the career development of officers and subsequent promotion to lieutenant colonel. Generally, these positions are in the MTOE or TDA
environment as staff officers in battalions, brigades, or JFHQ. Highly qualified officers in this phase may be selected to
command a battalion or squadron. Other assignments include brigade/regimental XO; division primary staff; various
JFHQs; ARCOM; GOCOM; or MUSARC staff positions. He may also participate in the AGR, IRR, or IMA programs.
(a) Formal training. The RC lieutenant colonel must complete ILE prior to promotion to colonel. Selectees for
battalion command attend the Armor PCC. Qualified Armor lieutenant colonels may apply for the AWC or other SSCs
(resident or correspondence).
(b) Assignments. Highly qualified RC lieutenant colonels may be selected to command a battalion, squadron, or
Armor TASS battalion. Other typical assignments include brigade or regimental XO; division primary staff, various
JFHQs, USAR Regional Support Command (RSC), GOCOM, and MUSARC staff positions; or HQDA level and Joint
staff assignments. RC Lieutenant Colonels may participate in the AGR, IRR, or IMA programs
(6) RC colonel.
(a) Formal training. Although no mandatory education requirements (other than PCC for command selectees) exist
during this phase, officers are encouraged to complete SSC (resident or nonresident).
(b) Assignments. Highly qualified colonels may be selected to command a heavy BCT, SBCT, or infantry BCT.
Other typical assignments include AGR program participation and various senior duty positions at the division, JFHQ,
RSC, GOCOM, MUSARC levels, and HQDA and Joint staff assignments.
b. Branch development. Even though RC officer development is challenged by geographical considerations and time
constraints, each officer should strive for Armor assignments and educational opportunities that yield the same
developmental opportunities as their Active Army counterparts.
(1) Introduction. RC (ARNG and USAR) officers must also meet certain standards in terms of schooling and
operational assignments to be considered fully qualified in the Armor Branch at each grade. Due to geographical, time,
and civilian employment constraints, RC Armor officers may find it difficult to serve in the required operational
assignments required at each grade in order to remain fully qualified as an Armor officer. Nevertheless, RC Armor
officers are expected to complete the educational requirements discussed below and to aggressively seek out the
operational assignments to remain proficient in the branch.
(2) Lieutenant. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop the
requisite Armor Branch skills, knowledge, and attributes. The focus of the officer at this stage of his career is on
development of Armor and cavalry tactical and technical warfighting skills and the utilization of these skills in an
operational assignment.
(a) Education. The BOLC must be completed during this phase. BOLC provides the Armor lieutenant the basic
skills necessary to function as a tank platoon leader and an overview of cavalry tactics and techniques. Prior to
assignment to a cavalry platoon, the Armor lieutenant may attend the Scout Leader Course. In addition, the Armor
lieutenant may attend Ranger School, Battalion Maintenance officer Course (through distance learning), Infantry
Mortar Platoon Officer Course, or Airborne School. Additional training following BOLC is primarily dependent on the
lieutenant’s unit of assignment.
(b) Assignments. The critical assignment during this phase is serving as a platoon leader in a BCT. Historically, all
qualified Armor lieutenants have had the opportunity to serve as Armor, cavalry, or reconnaissance platoon leaders.
The typical Armor lieutenant will be assigned as a platoon leader or staff officer in a reconnaissance or combined arms
organization upon completion of the basic course. Other typical assignments for lieutenants are battalion or squadron
special platoon leader (support, scout, or mortar), company or troop XO, battalion, or squadron liaison officer (LNO),
S3 air or logistics officer (S4), and battalion or squadron maintenance officer (BMO/SMO). An Armor officer may also
serve in a staff position after promotion to captain, but prior to attendance at the MC3.
(c) Self-development. Self-development during this phase should focus on tank and cavalry tactical fundamentals,
troop leading procedures, leadership skills, tank gunnery, organizational maintenance, resupply operations, basic
administrative operations, and other branch technical proficiency skills.
(d) Desired experience. Each Armor lieutenant must complete all BOLC phases, successfully serve in an operational
TOE platoon leader assignment, then supplement his technical and tactical abilities through assignment to a specialty
platoon or staff position. The goal is to develop lieutenants with an understanding of mounted maneuver tactics at the
platoon level.
(3) RC captain. The desired experience for the Armor Branch captain is—
(a) Completing MC3. (See ATRRS online for military education requirements based on the type of OBLC completed and for constructive credit application procedures.)
(b) Obtaining a baccalaureate degree to qualify for promotion to captain.
(c) Commanding of an Armor or mechanized infantry company or troop successfully. The goal is for each RC
captain to serve a minimum of 36 months company/troop command time (plus or minus 12 months). However, the key
is quality of the experience rather than time in command.
(4) RC major. The goals for RC Armor major professional development are—
(a) Service in a TOE or TDA battalion or squadron or as a brigade S3. The goal is for each Armor major to serve a

72

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

minimum of 24 months. There is no substitute for time spent as an S3/XO in preparing the Armor major for battalion/
squadron command and for expanding his knowledge of mounted maneuver warfare.
(b) Supplement their S3/XO experience with assignments in key duty positions in Armor or mechanized units. This
includes Service in primary staff positions at the battalion, brigade, or regiment levels; and continues to gain staff
experience at the division and higher levels. RC majors may participate in the AGR or IMA programs.
(c) Enrollment in ILE prior to 18 years time in Service. At least 50 percent of ILE must be completed for promotion
to lieutenant colonel.
(5) RC lieutenant colonel. The desired professional development experiences for the Armor lieutenant colonel are—
(a) Completion of ILE. This must be completed within three years of promotion to lieutenant colonel.
(b) Command combined arms battalion or squadron or TDA battalion or squadron for 36 months (plus or minus 12
months). While every Armor officer will not command at the battalion level, the goal of Armor officer professional
development is to provide every Armor officer the assignments, institutional training and experience to prepare him for
command at this level. The Armor officers selected for command will remain competitive for promotion to colonel and
brigade command.
(c) Service in key duty positions such as a brigade or regiment XO or Service in division primary staff or JFHQ,
RSC, GOCOM, and MUSARC staff positions; or in HQDA and Joint staff assignments. RC lieutenant colonels may
participate in the AGR or IMA programs.
(d) May be selected to attend a SSC or AWC Corresponding Studies Course.
(6) RC colonel. The professional development goals for Armor colonels are—
(a) Command of a brigade combat team for 36 months (plus or minus 12 months).
(b) Service in various duty positions at the division, JFHQ, RSC, GOCOM, and MUSARC levels; or in HQDA and
Joint staff assignments. Colonels may participate in the AGR or IMA program.
(c) May be selected to attend a SSC or AWC Corresponding Studies Course.
c. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for Armor officers is shown at figure 10–2,
below.

Chapter 11
Aviation Branch
11–1. Unique features of the Aviation Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Aviation Branch. Army Aviation is a Combat Arms Branch that operates at theater and
below echelons throughout full spectrum operations. The mission of the Aviation Branch is to find, fix, and destroy the
enemy through fire and maneuver, and to provide combat support and combat Service support in coordinated
operations as an integral member of the combined arms team. Aviation officers lead missions characterized as combat,
combat support, and combat Service support, with assignments to attack, cavalry, air assault, special operations, general
support, air traffic services, unmanned aircraft system, maintenance, and military intelligence units. As military
professionals, each Aviation officer must embody the Army Values and the Warrior Ethos by being tactically and
technically proficient in the doctrinal and organizational foundations of the Aviation Branch, as well as the other
combat arms branches, in order to effectively plan, execute, command, and control aviation forces as a key member of
the combined arms team.
b. The way ahead.
(1) Previous philosophies encouraged officers to secure the "right" jobs in order to achieve "branch qualification"
instead of attaining quality experience in each job. This philosophy is no longer applicable. Every officer should
endeavor to apply the Warrior Ethos to every job and every facet of their development. Success does not depend on the
number or type of positions held, but rather on the skills attained and the quality of duty performance in every

74

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

assignment. Previously accepted standards regarding personnel management and branch qualification no longer apply.
The officer’s breadth and depth of experience are the metrics that accurately reflect an officers potential for promotion
and opportunity to serve in positions of increasing responsibility. Officers should explore opportunities to serve in JIIM
assignments throughout their careers as a way to expand their overall knowledge base and increase their ability to lead
in the Joint environment. Officers should concentrate their efforts on attaining and honing a broad skill-set by holding
KD positions that allow them to explore various aspects of their professional abilities.
(2) Force stabilization manning practices and policies are the cornerstone of a modular future force with a Joint
expeditionary mindset. Army Aviation’s approach to force stabilization will mirror that of the rest of the Army. Refer
to paragraph 1–9 of this publication for a detailed explanation and description of force stabilization and career
development.
c. Unique features of work in Army Aviation. Aviation officers employ aviation and ground units in support of land,
sea, Joint, and coalition operations. Aviation officers fight in all environmental conditions anywhere in the world. They
learn how to employ aviation assets through a rigorous series of schools and assignments. They must know the doctrine
and organization of aviation units as well as other combat and combat support arms units to effectively serve as part of
the Joint combined arms team.
d. Aviation officer tasks. The most unique feature of Aviation officers is the fact that they are all aviators and must
develop technical proficiency in their aviator skills as well as function as unit leaders. They must first master the
weapons platform before they master the organization. It is in the Army’s best interest to retain these officers in
operational flying positions as long as possible to gain experience and competency in technical and tactical skills. For
this reason, Congress changed the Aviation Career Incentive Act (ACIA) in 1989 to require that aviators serve their
initial utilization tours in Aviation CFs.
(1) Aviation Branch officer.
(a) AOC.
1. Aviation, general (15A). This code identifies positions for Aviation lieutenants and captains who have not yet
completed a CCC. This AOC identifies aviation officers from accession through the BOLC, the Initial Entry Rotary
Wing (IERW) Course, and through graduation of a CCC.
2. Aviation, combined arms operations (15B). Officers in this AOC are graduates of a branch CCC. They lead
sections and platoons, command companies, battalions and brigades, and serve as staff officers in battalion and higher
echelon units. As staff officers, they plan, direct, and control aviation units in concert with other members of the
combined arms team. Aviation combined arms operations officers lead, command, serve as staff officers, and perform
critical functions in the operating force (MTOE) units.
3. Aviation, all-source intelligence (15C/35). All-source intelligence Aviators will be qualified both as Aviation and
MI Branch officers. Branch code 35 (Military Intelligence) is assigned to Aviation officers upon successful completion
of the Military Intelligence Officer Tactician Course (MIOTC) and the Military Intelligence CCC. These aviators are
qualified and encouraged to alternate between Aviation and Military Intelligence assignments. Officers in this AOC
typically lead platoons and command companies within aerial exploitation battalions (AEB) engaged in the employment of Special Equipment Mission Aircraft (SEMA) in support of tactical and strategic intelligence information
collection. Officers that serve in AEBs must have successfully completed the Fixed Wing Multi-Engine Qualification
Course (FWMEQC) and SEMA course to attain the appropriate source intelligence (RC–12 Aircraft) for the unit of
assignment or completed EO/RC–7 Aircraft Qualification Course. These officers also serve as staff officers in battalion
or higher echelon units. They serve as S2s and All-source intelligence officers who oversee the total intelligence cycle
and intelligence and electronic warfare operations for the division, corps, and echelons above corps intelligence
requirements. These officers also direct and control the training, safety, administration, communication, supply,
maintenance, transportation, and force protection activities of SEMA units. All-source intelligence Aviators gain
critical experience by performing any of a wide variety of critical and high-risk duties at each grade for a total of at
least 18 months (plus or minus 6 months). In addition to leading platoons, commanding companies, and battalions,
employing SEMA in support of tactical, operational, and strategic intelligence missions, these aviators can perform
duties as Staff Officers in aviation units as well as have the ability to be assigned in any 35D position. Officers
selected for AOC 15C/35 (all-Source Intelligence Officer) attend the MIOTC and the Military Intelligence CCC. AOC
15C officers attend the 20-week MIOTC/Military Intelligence CCC and receive training as a 35 (all-Source Intelligence
Officer). They attend the FWMEQC before or after the Military Intelligence CCC with appropriate follow-on Aircraft
specific training. Officers that do not attend the FWMEQC will be designated as 15B35.
4. Aviation logistics (15D). The AOC 15D has been deleted (see para 14–3c(1)(C)). Officers desiring to pursue a
maintenance focused career should make every effort to attend the Aviation Maintenance Leaders Course (AMLC) and
the Aviation Maintenance Managers Course (AMMC) prior to taking command.
(b) Skill identifiers. Skill identifiers help to further refine the assignment process by designation of aircraft qualification or other specialty skill. When combined with an AOC, they become career management fields (CMFs), which
personnel managers use in the assignment process. See DA Pam 611–21, table 4–1 for a complete list of identifiers.
(c) Other Aviation participation programs. Aviation officers may participate in the following voluntary programs, if
qualified:

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

75

1. Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA).
2. Army Astronaut Program. (Contact Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC–IC–T))
3. Degree Completion Program (see AR 621–1, chap 5).
4. Army Fellowships and Scholarships (see AR 621–7)
5. The Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP), also known as SAMS (apply during ILE attendance).
6. ACS (also see AR 621–1, chap 3).
7. USMA Instructor Program (also see AR 621–1, chap 3).
8. TWI program provides officers the opportunity to train with selected civilian companies to gain knowledge of
industrial procedures, policies, and technologies (see AR 621–1, chap 6).
9. Experimental Test Pilot Training Program is an intense 11-month course at the Naval Test Pilot School in
Patuxent River, Maryland. Branch commissioned officers will transfer to the Army Acquisition Corps for the remainder
of their career. Applicants must be Active Army rated aviators in the rank of captain and have an academic background
that includes the completion of college math and hard-science courses with above average grades. (Contact DA AHRC
(AHRC–OPE–V).)
(2) Aviation WO. Aviation WOs are adaptive technical experts, leaders, trainers, and advisors. Through progressive
levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, they plan, administer, manage, maintain, and operate in
support of the full range of Army, Joint, combined, and coalition operations. Personifies the Warrior Ethos in all
aspects, from warfighting, to training, maintaining, and managing combat systems. The fully qualified Aviation WO
advances in different MOSs through progressively higher levels of training, rank (WO1–CW5), and by assignment
levels (platoon through brigade and above).
(a) The AT/ASM technician (150A) supervises the effective utilization of ATS equipment and ATS personnel at all
categories of Army ATC facilities; supervises fixed base ATS training and rating programs, combat support training
and certification programs, and combat support and fixed base facility operations procedures; and supervises airspace
management functions and airspace processing procedures into the National Airspace System (NAS).
(b) Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems (TUAS) operations technician (150U) supervise TUAS operations, to
include mission planning, mission payload operation, launching, remotely piloting, and recovering unmanned aerial
systems. Supervises employment of TUASs to conduct aerial reconnaissance, target detection, and target engagement.
(c) Aviation maintenance officers (151A) manage personnel, supplies, equipment, and facility assets to maintain and
repair Army rotary and fixed wing aircraft. Develops and implements maintenance plans and coordinates maintenance
support to achieve the mission assigned to the aviation companies, battalions, and brigades. Organizes maintenance
elements to inspect service, test, disassemble, repair, reassemble, adjust, replace parts, and retest aircraft or aircraft
components. Prepares, implements, and maintains standing operating procedures for management of maintenance
activities. Interprets regulations, technical manuals, and orders pertaining to maintenance of Army aircraft for commanders and subordinates. Supervises aviation equipment maintenance and repair shop, section, or platoon. Directs
maintenance and accountability of organizational test equipment, supplies, and recovery equipment.
(d) Scout/attack helicopter aviators (152B: OH–58A/C scout pilot, 152C: AH/MH–6 special operations pilot, 152D:
OH–58D scout pilot, 152F: AH–64A pilot, or 152H: AH- 64D pilot) plan, coordinate, brief, command, control, and
execute scout, attack, and special operations helicopter missions. Functions as a direct combat participant with organic
armament systems while piloting and commanding scout and attack helicopters under tactical and non-tactical conditions. Operates aircraft during all types of meteorological conditions during day and night as a participant in anti-armor
operations, reconnaissance missions, special operations, and security missions. Performs military aircraft operation in
support of peacetime training. Responsible for coordinating, conducting, and directing scout/attack helicopter operations, Joint air attack team operations, and indirect fire missions. These officers must maintain aircrew training manual
(ATM) requirements in appropriate aircraft.
(e) Assault/utility helicopter aviators (153A: rotary wing aviator, 153B: UH–1 pilot, 153D: UH–60A/L pilot, 153M:
UH–60M pilot or 153E MH–60 special operations pilot) plan, coordinate, brief, command, control, and execute air
assault, special operations, aeromedical evacuation, and combat support helicopter missions. Functions as a direct
combat participant with organic armament systems while piloting and commanding assault, special operations, and air
ambulance helicopters under tactical and non-tactical conditions. Performs military aircraft operation in support of
peacetime training, disaster relief, medical evacuation, combat, and combat support missions, while operating in all
types of meteorological conditions during day and night. These officers must maintain ATM requirements in appropriate aircraft.
(f) Cargo/medium lift helicopter aviators (154C: CH–47D pilot, 154F: CH–47F pilot or 154E: special operations
pilot) plan, coordinate, brief, command, control, and execute assault, special operations, combat support, and combat
Service support helicopter missions. Functions as a direct combat participant with organic armament systems while
piloting and commanding cargo helicopters under tactical and non-tactical conditions. Performs military aircraft
operation in support of peacetime training, disaster relief and combat, combat support, and combat Service support
missions, while operating in all types of meteorological conditions during day and night. These officers must maintain
ATM requirements in appropriate aircraft.
(g) Fixed wing aviators (155A: fixed wing pilot, 155E: C–12 pilot, 155F: jet pilot or 155G: RC–7 pilot) plan,

76

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

coordinate, brief, command, control, and execute tactical surveillance, combat Service support, and administrative
transport missions. Pilots and commands fixed-wing aircraft under tactical and non-tactical conditions. Responsible for
transporting passengers, mail or cargo for military purposes while operating aircraft during all types of meteorological
conditions during day and night. When appropriately equipped, performs military intelligence, and aerial radio relay
missions. These officers must maintain ATM requirements in appropriate aircraft.
e. Women in Army Aviation. All Aviation AOCs and most Aviation skills are open to women. Female aviators have
career opportunities equal to those of their male counterparts except for positions with a direct combat probability code
(DCPC) of P1. This restricts females from assignments in Special Operations Aviation (SOA). This restriction is based
on the mission profile of these aircraft. Women aviators accessed into the Aviation Branch before 28 April 1993 are
not required to transition into scout/attack aircraft, but may volunteer to compete for scout/attack aircraft transition
training and assignments in attack units. Women accessed into the Aviation Branch after 28 April 1993 are considered
eligible to fill aviation training and assignment needs.
11–2. Characteristics required of Aviation officers
a. Unique attributes. The Warrior Ethos must be at the heart of every Army Soldier. It is the Warrior Ethos that
transforms an aviator into an air warrior. Aviation officers must be proactive leaders who do not hesitate to tackle any
challenge and get into the fight. The Warrior Ethos embodies personal courage, commitment to duty, and loyalty to
unit. Army Values also form the very identity of the Army. They are non-negotiable and apply to every aviator at all
times and in all situations. The seven values that guide all leaders and the rest of the Army are loyalty, duty, respect,
selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage (LDRSHIP). Leaders must believe in them, model them in
personal actions, and teach others to accept them. Officers require a demonstrated mastery of branch, FA(s), or MOSspecific skills, and grounding in these seven values to successfully lead Soldiers in the 21st Century.
b. Unique skills. Army Aviators are immersed in an increasingly complex battlefield environment. The networkcentric command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) environment demands intellectually agile leaders, who can see, comprehend, make accurate decisions and clearly communicate
them during the full spectrum of aviation operations in all environments.
c. Unique actions. As defined by FM 6–22, "Leadership is influencing people - by providing purpose, direction, and
motivation - while operating to accomplish the mission and improving the organization." Leadership is crucially
important in Aviation organizations. Due to the small size of Aviation units and the considerable lethality of their
weapons systems, poor leadership can quickly result in catastrophic loss of life and equipment. Aviation leaders must
be multi-skilled, creative, and imbued with the Army Values and the Warrior Ethos so that they can be more agile,
adaptive, self-aware, and lifelong learners ready to provide positive leadership daily. Aviation Branch wants men and
women who consider themselves leaders, are excited to continuously learn and hone their leadership skills and are
prepared to operate as part of the full spectrum, JIIM team.
11–3. Aviation Branch Active Army officer
a. Officer qualification and development. (See Active Army development model fig 11–1, below). The three
domains of leader development, PME (institutional training), operational assignments, and self-development, define and
engage a continuous cycle of education, training, selection, experience, assessment, feedback, reinforcement, and
evaluation which helps to encourage officer development throughout career progression.
(1) PME. The institutional Army (schools and training centers) is the foundation for lifelong learning.
(2) Operational assignments. Upon completion of most institutional training, leaders are ideally assigned to operational assignments. This operational experience provides them the opportunity to use, hone, and build on what they
learned through the formal education process. Experience gained through on-the-job training in a variety of challenging
assignments and additional duties prepares officers to lead and train Soldiers in garrison and ultimately in combat. The
officer’s breadth and depth of experience are the metrics that accurately reflect potential for promotion and Service in
positions of increased responsibility. Assignments that increase an officers overall technical and tactical knowledge and
improve their understanding of combined and JIIM operations will also help to broaden the skill sets that will make
them more effective combat leaders.
(3) Self-development. Leaders must commit to a lifetime of professional and personal growth in order to stay at the
cutting edge of their profession. Every officer is ultimately responsible for their own self-development.
b. Lieutenant. Lieutenants must meet the requirements outlined in AR 611–110 for entry into the Aviation Branch.
(1) PME. All newly commissioned Aviation Lieutenants attend BOLC III and IERW training at the United States
Army Aviation Warfighting Center (USAAWC), Fort Rucker, Alabama. Training is conducted in three phases. Phase I
is the aviation specific phase of BOLC. Phase II is Initial Entry Rotary Wing training, conducted under the Flight
School XXI model. Phase III is the completion of BOLC, which combines the student’s recently acquired Aviation
skills with company level tactics and combined arms training. Phases I and III include training on general military
subjects such as leadership, weapons, combined arms operations, physical training, and fieldcraft training. Students will
also complete Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) and Dunker training during Phase I. IERW, or flight
school, consists of aeromedical factors, basic flight, aerodynamics, meteorology, instrument flight, and combat skills
training. Training is conducted from the preflight through the primary and instrument qualification phases in the TH–67
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

77

aircraft. Basic combat skills are then trained in an advanced aircraft, such as the AH–64D Longbow Apache, UH–60L/
M Blackhawk, and CH–47D/F Chinook. When an officer completes all phases of BOLC and flight training, they are
awarded the Basic Army Aviator Badge. Due to the time intensive initial training requirements of Flight School XXI
and Aviation’s compressed career time line, follow-on schooling enroute to their next assignment (that is, Airborne, Air
Assault, Ranger, and Cavalry Leaders Course) will only be approved by exception.
(2) Operational assignments. Junior officers initially assigned to a CONUS installation will be stabilized at their
first installation for an extended period of time that allows for branch advancement to the rank of captain. This initial
extended tour may include hardship tours or attendance at leader development schools (TDY or PCS), but in each case
the officer should return to their stabilization installation. Lieutenants should serve at the platoon and company level to
gain troop leading and flight experience. The officer will concentrate on planning and executing the tactics, techniques,
and procedures specific to their weapons platform and unit mission. The single-most important assignment consideration for personnel managers and commanders is ensuring that the new Lieutenant is assigned to a job which will allow
the officer adequate opportunity to develop flight experience and troop leading skills Lieutenants should serve 18–24
months in a platoon leader position. Due to the length of flight school, this may overlap into the officer’s first year as a
captain. Promotions will not automatically alter positions. Promotion from lieutenant to captain while still serving in an
operational assignment such as platoon leader will not be a negative consideration when determining the officer’s
future potential for promotion. The overall goal is for an officer to gain as much flight and leadership experience as
possible prior to moving to another operational assignment.
(3) Self-development. All officers should be afforded every opportunity to achieve a total of 500 flight hours and
qualification as a Pilot in Command (PC) prior to attendance of the Aviation CCC or equivalent. A lieutenant’s focus
should be to refine troop leading, aviator, tactical, logistic (maintenance and supply), force protection (risk management), and administrative skills. The key milestone in a lieutenant’s development should be attaining PC status In
doing so, lieutenants will acquire much needed technical and tactical experience, which will serve them well in future
assignments. For example, company commanders are expected to set the standard for other pilots within their company.
Being a PC allows that commander to be in-the-fight and to direct critical assets where needed. Lieutenants should also
strive to obtain key training experiences that enhance normal garrison training, including but not limited to CTC
rotations, Joint and combined exercise deployments, and worldwide contingency operations. To successfully compete
for promotion to captain, an officer must possess a thorough knowledge of aviation tactics and principles and have
obtained a baccalaureate degree. Officers may take advantage of pre-commissioning educational incentives such as
incurring an additional three year Active Duty Service obligation in exchange for the opportunity to pursue a master’s
degree later in their careers. Officers should contact AHRC prior to branch selection for program details.
c. Captain. A captain must successfully complete a branch CCC.
(1) PME.
(a) CCC. Captains must earn a Baccalaureate degree prior to attending a Ccc. Additionally, in accordance with Vice
Chief of Staff Army guidance, officers should have flown at least 500 hours and earned PC status for their particular
airframe before they are allowed to attend a CCC. Officers will attend a branch CCC between their 5th and 8th year of
commissioned Service. Aviation officers may attend other branch’s CCC. The branch phase of the Aviation CCC is 21
weeks. It prepares officers to serve as combined arms experts, company commanders, battalion/brigade staff officers,
and Brigade Aviation Element (BAE) officers assigned and organic to the ground BCT. Aviation CCC meets
established prerequisites for total operational flying duty credit (TOFDC) assignments. Aviators earn one month of
TOFDC for each month spent at Aviation CCC. Aviators attending another branch CCC do not earn TOFDC.
(b) Military Intelligence CCC. Officers selected for AOC 15C/35 (all-source intelligence officer) attend the MIOTC
if they did not attend Military Intelligence BOLC. AOC 15C officers attend the 20-week Military Intelligence CCC and
receive training as a 35 (all-source intelligence officer). They attend the FWMEQC before or after the Military
Intelligence CCC with appropriate follow-on Aircraft specific training. Officers that do not attend the FWMEQC will
be designated as 15B35.
(c) Aviation maintenance. With a battalion and or brigade commander’s approval, officers may request attendance at
the AMLC and the Aviation Maintenance Management Course (MMC). They can also request to continue their
military education by attending the Maintenance Test Pilot (MTP) Course. Aviation maintenance officers will serve in
Aviation support battalions (ASB) as production control officers or platoon leaders in maintenance or shops platoons in
the Aviation Support Company (ASC). They can also work as battalion and brigade S4/logistics officers, as well as
command Aviation maintenance companies. Additional opportunities exist for selected personnel at U.S. Army Material Command (AMC) depots and in Aviation Classification and Repair Activity Depots (AVCRADs). An Aviation
maintenance officer can serve as a commander or staff officer at battalion or higher-level units, to include Army
depots, ACOM/ASCC logistics offices, the Army Staff (ARSTAF) and Joint staffs. As staff officers, they must plan
and direct aviation logistics operations in situations ranging from low to high intensity conflicts. Commissioned
Aviation maintenance officers work closely with Warrant officer Aviation maintenance officer to manage the maintenance, removal, installation, modification, overhaul, and repair of aircraft equipment systems and subsystems. These
subsystems range from engines to airframes, instruments, rotor systems, powertrain, armament, avionics, electrical, and
fuel systems. These officers develop procedures for aircraft maintenance, and also direct the issuance and disposal of
aircraft, the requisitioning, receipt, inspection, storage, distribution, and disposal of aircraft supplies, repair parts, and

78

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

equipment. They must understand both air and ground logistics systems in order to be effective. Aviation maintenance
officers are excellent candidates for the Experimental Test Pilot Training Program. Officers wishing to pursue a
maintenance focused career path should focus on KD jobs that will add to their overall maintenance experience and
depth of knowledge.
(2) Operational assignments. Captains are utilized as the senior leader at the company level. Their primary goal is to
successfully command a TOE/TDA company/detachment or Aviation Maintenance Company for 18–24 months.
Captains can hold platoon leader positions in units authorized captains as platoon leaders. These units include the ASC
and ARSOA units. Captains also fill key staff positions at the battalion and brigade level, in addition to positions
within the BAE, Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cell, CTC/OC positions and SGI/Instructor positions at
the proponent and USMA. Even when assigned to staff positions, captains should continue to hone their direct
leadership skills, build flight experience, and achieve/maintain PC status.
(3) Self-development. Captains should gain an in-depth understanding of aviation brigade operations, combined arms
operations, aircraft maintenance, and Army Airspace Command and Control (A2C2). Aviation captains should dedicate
time to a professional reading program to gain a historical perspective on solutions to tactical and leader challenges.
Captains should strive for the same qualitative leadership building experiences as during their Lieutenant years; CTC
rotations, Joint and combined exercises, and deployment on real-world contingency operations. Performing the challenges at the captain/commander level will greatly enhance the officer’s tactical and technical skills, as well as build
critical flight experience. Captains should strive to meet the requirements for award of the Senior Aviator Badge by the
time they are promoted to major. Captains should broaden their understanding of warfighting through extension courses
and independent study. Commanders should maintain healthy officer professional development programs within their
units.
(a) Aviation captains can request to attend the Joint Air-Ground Operations School (AGOS) at Hurlbert Field, FL,
or the Cavalry Leaders Course at Fort Knox, KY. If attendance at AGOS is desired, the 3-week Joint Air Tasking
Order Process Course (JATOPS) located at Hurlbert Field, FL is recommended for officers who are required to
understand and apply airspace command and control and the application of the air tasking order. The 2-week Joint
Firepower Control Course (JFCC) at Nellis AFB, Nevada, is more suited to an understanding of the application of Joint
fire support systems.
(b) Officers may receive ACS/Expanded Graduate School Program (EGSP) participation if career time line permits
or if necessary for a FA or special assignment (that is, Army Acquisition Corps, Foreign Area officer or USMA
instructor). See paragraph 3–5b(4) for specifics.
(c) FDBs meet to consider officers in their 7th YOS for designation into other FAs or branches. Officers will submit
their top three choices at the 7 year mark. Officers receive a new career manager upon selection by the FDB for a
different branch or FA. Only a limited number of Aviators will be given a FA or branch outside of Aviation, usually
based on specific aviation skill requirements in select FAs. Aviation officers will not participate in the Army’s 4–year
FDBs.
(d) An aviator migrating out of MF&E functional category will serve in their new functional category for the
remainder of their career. Unless an officer has met their initial 12–year ACIP gate, migration out of MF&Es (with the
exception of FA 51, Acquisition) will result in termination of ACIP, as these officers will no longer be managed or
assigned against aviation operational assignments. Therefore, repetitive operational flying assignments through the
grade of captain are critical in order for officers to make their first ACIP gate. If an aviator has not met their first ACIP
gate, they will lose ACIP beyond the 12th year of aviation Service unless they are assigned to aviation operational
positions. HQDA waivers are possible for this situation, but highly unlikely for those aviators who functionally
designated out of branch 15 or FA 51 (Army Acquisition Corps). Aviators who remain in MF&E will continue to serve
in operational aviation assignments. See additional sections in this pamphlet and AR 611–110 for a complete
description of each functional designation and associated skills.
(e) If an officer does not receive their desired functional designation during their 7–year board, they may request a
functional designation appeal within 180 days of the results being released by HQDA. AHRC conducts an appeal board
every quarter. If an officer is outside of the 180 day FD appeals timeframe, then they can request a branch transfer into
a functional designation. This is only after their four year and 7–year boards and after the 180 days appeals timeframe.
(4) Army Acquisition Corps. Between the 7th and 8th YOS select officers are accessed into the Army Acquisition
Corps by a HQDA selection board. Aviators accessed into Army Acquisition Corps do not compete for Aviation
battalion or brigade commands. Instead, they compete for lieutenant colonel and colonel level product, project and
program manager positions. Officers accessed into the Army Acquisition Corps are redesignated with FA (FA 51).
Accession into FA 51 is based on the same criteria as mentioned above (officer preference, Army needs, training and
background, and officer skills). Again, Aviation Branch will only assess enough aviators into the Army Acquisition
Corps to meet Army Aviation Acquisition requirements.
(5) ASOA. Officers who are interested in joining the Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA), 160th Special
Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), should begin early in their lieutenant years to accumulate as much flight
experience as possible. ARSOA recruiters focus their recruiting efforts on experienced captains with solid leadership
and flight experience. Interested captains should pursue company command as soon as possible following the CCC.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

d. Major. Majors will complete the ILE course, a sister Service institution (Navy, Marine Corps, or Air Force), the
Joint Army Warfighting School (JAWS), or schools in other nations (SON) before they enter the primary zone of
consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
(1) PME. Following ILE, some officers are selected to attend the SAMS. Those officers selected for the SAMS must
serve an initial utilization tour as a plans/assistant G3 officer on division or corps staffs.
(2) Operational assignments. Majors should serve in one of the following assignments for 18–24 months: BAE,
ADAM cell, battalion staff (Active Army/RC and Active Duty) or major level command of a TOE/TDA aviation unit
such as an Aviation Support Company (ASC) which requires completion of the AMLC and the Aviation Maintenance
Managers Course (AMMC) and ARSOA units. Individuals selected and assigned as a BAE or ADAM cell staff officer
will serve in positions organic to the BCTs, as the aviation subject matter expert for the BCT commander. They will
provide the critical linkage with the BCT’s supporting Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB) to facilitate the most efficient
tactical employment of aviation assets in the BCT’s maneuver battlespace. Serving in a similar position at a higher
level also satisfies this intent. Aviation majors serve in TOE and TDA units and other assignments to include but not
limited to: observer controller/evaluator (OC/E) at a CTC, RC advisor, USAREC staff, USMA faculty and staff,
Service school instructors, ARSTAF, Joint staff, and branch/FA generalist positions. Majors should seek key developmental assignments that assist them in promotion and create the qualities of a fully multifunctional, expeditionary
officer, either in the Aviation Branch or in a FA. Majors should seek a field grade Joint duty assignment once tactical
and technical experiences have been attained.
(3) Self-development. Majors should focus self-developmental efforts on acquiring expertise in organizational leadership techniques, operations at Division level and above, and aviation logistical support operations. Their self-development must focus on JIIM and combined arms operations. This can be accomplished through correspondence courses or
institutional training. Majors should devote time to a professional reading program. Officers may take advantage of the
Expanded Graduate School Program and attend ACS if the follow-on assignment requires an advanced degree. Many
advanced degree programs are available in order for officers to obtain a graduate degree. Aviation majors will likely
serve in operational flying positions after being away from the cockpit for some time due to schooling and required
staff positions. Therefore, their self-development should also be focused on refreshing themselves with new aviation
technologies in the cockpit. They should set the example for the younger generation of officers by continuing to place a
strong emphasis on their technical and tactical aviation proficiency. Aviation majors in BR15 should strive to attain the
Master Aviator Badge by the time they are promoted to lieutenant colonel.
e. Lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels should serve in an Aviation coded position for 12–24 months.
(1) PME. No specific military education requirements exist for lieutenant colonels. A HQDA board determines
selection for resident SSC or the AWC Distance Education Course. Officers selected for CSL battalion command will
attend the Army’s PCC at Fort Leavenworth, KS, and the Aviation PCC at Fort Rucker, AL. Select TDA battalion
command designees may also be slated for attendance at the TRADOC PCC at Fort Jackson, SC. Battalion command
designees who have special courts martial convening authority will attend the Senior Officers Legal Orientation
(SOLO) Course at Charlottesville, VA. A master’s degree is strongly recommended, but is not required for promotion.
(2) Operational assignments. Lieutenant colonels who successfully complete a CSL battalion level command may
remain competitive for brigade command and enjoy a higher potential for promotion to Colonel and SSC selection.
Commands on the CSL are organized into four functional categories: Operations, Strategic Support, Recruiting and
Training, and Installation. Officers must complete the AMLC and the AMMC to Command an ASB. Officers have the
option of selecting the category or categories in which they desire to compete for command, while declining
competition in other categories. The following assignments are not necessarily coded as Aviation, however they are
considered KD assignments: lieutenant colonel positions at the CTCs, brigade/regiment/group XO, division primary
staff, corps assistant G3/G4, deputy assistant G3/G4, G3 operations, G3 assistant plans officer, ROTC or recruiting
duty, ACOM/ASCC/DRU staff, ARSTAF, Joint staffs, and selected Active Army/RC assignments. Performance in
demanding assignments is a prime consideration for promotion and school selection boards. Lieutenant colonels should
also seek a JDA. A field grade JDA is required for promotion to brigadier general.
(3) Self-development. Officers should continue to build warfighting, Joint, expeditionary, and FA expertise.
f. Colonel. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is sustainment of warfighting, training and staff skill, along with utilization of leadership, managerial and executive talents. The majority of
strategic level leaders in the army are colonels. Colonels are expected to be multi-skilled leaders, strategic and creative
thinkers; builders of leaders and teams; competent full spectrum warfighters; skilled in governance, statesmanship, and
diplomacy; and understand cultural context and work effectively across it.
(1) Aviation colonels are assigned by the Army’s Senior Leader Development Office. Colonels should serve 12 -18
months in an Aviation assignment coded at the grade of colonel.
(2) Although no specific mandatory military education requirement exists for colonels, the primary professional
development goal is completion of SSC. Resident or nonresident attendance at a SSC also identifies those officers with
exceptional promotion potential for Service in positions of increased responsibility. A HQDA board determines who
attends the resident course and participates in the AWC Distance Education Course. Officers selected for CSL brigade
command will attend the Army’s PCC at Fort Leavenworth, KS; and the Aviation PCC at Fort Rucker, AL. Brigade

80

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Command selectees may also attend the SOLO at Charlottesville, VA. Officers selected as TSMs will attend the
Combat Developers Course at Fort Lee, VA and the Project Manager’s ACAT III Course (commonly known as the
PM’s Survival Course) at Fort Belvoir, VA. The ACAT III Course has several prerequisites. Officers selected for TSM
billets should contact their OPMD assignment officer to discuss requirements. After PCS arrival at Fort Rucker, TSMs
will also attend the Aviation PCC.
(3) The following example assignments, some not necessarily coded as Aviation are also developmentally key: Joint
duty, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army Aviation Warfighting Center (USAAWC) Chief of Staff (former brigade
commander position); corps G3 or Deputy Chief of Staff; Deputy Assistant Commandant; Director of Training
Development and Doctrine (DOTD); Director of Combat Developments (DCD); Director of Evaluation and Standardization (DES); Director of Simulations (DOS); Director of Aviation Proponency; colonel positions at the CTCs;
Aviation Center Logistics Command; USALLS; ARSTAF, ACOM/ASCC/DRU staff, and Joint staffs; and selected
Active Army/RC assignments. HQDA centralized selection boards for brigade level command select a small percentage
of officers. Successful brigade level command marks officers as qualified for increased responsibility at the highest
levels in the Army and DOD. Commands filled by officers on the CSL are organized into four functional categories;
operations, strategic support, recruiting and training, and installation.
(4) Self-development goals should focus on perfecting organizational level leadership skills, Joint and coalition
operations, and theater level operations. An advanced degree is not required but is strongly recommended.

e. MOS 152–155 (see career development model fig 11–5, below). Army Aviator.
(1) Aviation WOs in these specialties pilot and command all army aircraft in tactical and non-tactical conditions.
Aviation WOs must be agile, adaptive, and creative, as they operate both fixed and rotary wing aircraft in all
meteorological conditions, both day and night, and are responsible for coordinating, conducting, and directing all types
of single Service and Joint combat, combat support, and Service support operations. These officers function as direct
combat participants with organic armament systems, and sustain combat proficiency for their designated aircraft as
outlined in the appropriate Aircrew Training Manual (ATM). Aviation WOs fill a unique role within Army Aviation as
the branches technical and tactical experts providing long-term continuity of Service within the units. As multi-skilled,
lifelong learners, the focus of every officer should be on bringing the Warrior Ethos to every job and every facet of
their development.

CW4s primarily support battalion, brigade, division, corps, and echelons above corps operations. They provide leader
development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs and other officers. CW4s will successfully perform as
squadron/battalion level aviation safety officer, standardization instructor pilot (SP), maintenance test flight examiner
(ME), tactical operations officer (TACOPS), master gunner, or in Army special operations aviator (ARSOA) positions.
Completing a graduate level degree prior to promotion to CW5 should be a self-development goal for these officers.
CW4s serve as the senior technical advisors to the battalion/squadron level commander, and as directed CW4s may
serve in non-operational staff officers positions at all levels of the Army as required otherwise, they should sustain
annual completion of all ATP requirements. Typical assignments include; SP/standards officer battalion and above,
TACOPs officer/brigade aviation officer, aviation safety officer battalion and above, ME/aviation material officer,
experimental test pilot, engineering test pilot, commander, division and higher level assignments officer, and brigade/
division/corps/DA level staff.
(6) MOSs 152–155 CW5s are master level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of
technical leader, manager, integrator, advisor, or any other particular duty prescribed by branch. These senior aviation
officers serve as staff officers and commanders. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. These officers primarily support brigade, division, corps,
echelons above corps, and major command operations. They provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and
counsel to other officers. CW5s have special WO leadership and representation responsibilities within their respective
commands. CW5s will complete the WOSSC not later than one year after promotion to CW5. Completion of an
advanced degree is highly encouraged. These officers will serve in brigade and higher-level ASO/SP/ME/TACOPS/
master gunner positions. CW5s will serve as directed in staff officer and non-operational positions at all levels of the
Army. When assigned to operational positions, they should sustain annual completion of all ATP requirements. Typical
assignments include; aviation safety officer brigade and above, SP/standardization officer brigade and above, TACOPs
officer brigade and above, aviation material officer, brigade/division/corps/DA level staff, Chief Engineering Test Pilot,
Commander, nominative positions, and Chief Warrant Officer of the Aviation Branch

Figure 11–5. WO Aviator Developmental Model

f. Aviation WO functional roles are as follows:
(1) Aviation safety officer (ASO) special qualification identifier (SQI) B are the primary advisors and assistants to
the commander on all matters related to aviation and ground safety. They monitor unit FAs and operations to identify
and eliminate systems defects that may cause accidents, injuries or operational failures. Active Army officers desiring
to become an aviation safety officer must complete a 6-week resident course. RC officers may attend the 6-week
course or a 2-week (Phase II) resident course combined with a prerequisite (Phase I) correspondence course. Course
information and prerequisites are ATRRS online site. Upon successful completion of the ASO course, these safety
officers are employed from the troop/company level to Army level. Senior ASOs may attend the CP12 safety course
which is a graduate degree producing program leading to professional certifications.
(2) Aircraft Armament Maintenance officer (AMO) SQI E graduates of the Aircraft Armament Maintenance
Technician Course are the primary supervisors of the maintenance and repair of aircraft armament systems.
(3) Instructor pilot/standardization officer SQIs C/F/H is the commander’s technical and tactical advisor. They help
the commander and the operations officer develop, implement, and manage the ATP. They train, evaluate, and provide
technical supervision for the aviation standardization program as specified by the commander. Training is based on the
unit’s wartime mission; standardization officers maintain standards, evaluate proficiency of the unit’s aviators, develop,
and execute training plans that result in proficient individuals, leaders, and units. Instructor pilots and standardization
officers assist the command in planning and preparing aviation training. Individual training is the building block for
crew training, which leads to team, platoon, and collectively trained units. Instructor Pilot Courses (IPC) for all Army
aircraft is taught at Fort Rucker or National Guard Training sites. Successful completion of IPC leads to award of SQI

88

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

C. The Instrument Flight Examiners Course is conducted at Fort Rucker and leads to award of SQI F. After completion
of the WOSC battalion level standardization officers are awarded SQI H. Instructor Pilots are assigned to each platoon
as CW2s, progressing to company level positions as CW3s. They work as senior instructor pilots, instrument flight
examiners, and battalion level standardization officers as CW4s. CW5s standardization officers work at brigade or
higher levels. Course information and prerequisites are ATRRS online, and AR 95–1.
(4) Maintenance test pilots (MTPs) SQIs G/L perform maintenance test flights in all Army aircraft. They advise the
commander on aircraft maintenance management issues, schedule required aircraft maintenance and serve as aviation
logistics managers. These officers complete the Aviation Maintenance Managers Course and appropriate aircraft
Maintenance Test Flight phase of training at Fort Rucker, AL. Successful completion of both phases of training results
in the awarding of an SQI of G. MTPs are assigned to each platoon as CW2s, progressing to Aviation Unit
Maintenance Company level positions as CW3s, Battalion level as CW4s and brigade or higher-level maintenance
officer positions as CW5s. For award of SQI L these officers must undergo a ME evaluation. MEs are responsible for
conducting evaluations of MTPs to maintain standardization of maintenance flight procedures. Course information and
prerequisites are found at ATRRS online, and AR 95–1.
(5) TACOPs officer SQI I is the commander’s tactical advisor and a technical source. They assist the commander
and the operations officer in the planning, coordination, briefing, and execution of tactical Army Aviation and warfare
in a Joint/combined environment. Additionally, provides commanders technical/tactical expertise of Army airspace
command and control (A2C2), personnel recovery, electronic warfare, threat analysis, digital operations, and Joint
tactics, techniques and procedures. They develop, implement, and manage the Aviation Mission Planning Systems
(AMPS), fratricide prevention, Threat Analysis, and Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) programs and organize the
planning of Personnel Recovery (PR). At the brigade aviation element (BAE) level, Tactical Operations Officers, in
conjunction with their primary tasks, recommend and assist in the integration of tactical Army Aviation warfighting
capabilities into the ground commander’s scheme of maneuver. Tactical operations officers develop threat training,
ASE, personnel recovery programs and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to integrate aviation operations into
the Joint/combined arms fight. An aircraft survivability equipment/electronic warfare officer, (ASE/EWO) course for
all mission design series aircraft is taught at Fort Rucker, AL. Company level TACOPs officer position as CW3s.
Battalion level TACOPs officers are assigned as CW4s and brigade or higher level TACOPs officers as CW5s.
(6) Aeromedical Evacuation Pilot (MEDEVAC) SQI D must be an aviator qualified in aircraft used for medical
evacuation and successfully complete the Army Medical Service Aviator Course or have one year documented
experience. Aeromedical evacuation aviators may be assigned to multiple MEDEVAC assignments or may revert to a
non-MEDEVAC assignment dependant upon the utilization requirements of the Army.
(7) Experimental test pilot (XP) MOS SQI J training program is an intense eleven-month course at the United States
Naval Test Pilot School (USNTPS), Patuxent River, MD. Branch commissioned officers will be transferred to the
Army Acquisition Corps for the remainder of their career. Applicants must be Active Army rated aviators and have an
academic background that includes the completion of college math and challenging-science courses with above average
grades. Aviation WOs interested in Army Aviation Engineering test pilot training must refer to the latest AHRC
MILPER Message regarding the Army Experimental Test Pilot Program selection boards. Upon successful completion
of USNTPS, XPs will serve a minimum of 24 months in an XP utilization tour.
11–5. Aviation Branch Reserve Component Officer
a. General career development. RC Aviation officer development objectives and qualifications parallel those
planned for their Active Army counterparts.
b. Development opportunities. The nature of the RC Soldier’s role as a citizen-Soldier poses a unique challenge for
professional development. RC officers are expected to follow Active Army officer development patterns as closely as
possible, except that RC officers have increased time windows to complete mandatory professional educational
requirements. Civilian career opportunities, military promotions and educational opportunities may force RC officers to
transfer between ARNG M–Day Units, USAR TPUs, IRR, IMA program, and the Active Guard and Reserve (AGR)
programs. These transfers are often hindered by geographical considerations, as well as a limited number of positions
to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions. Additionally, there may be occasions when NG Officers will be
transferred to the IRR or USAR officers to the trainee, transient, holdee, and student (TTHS) account while they
complete mandatory educational requirements. Such transfers are usually temporary and should not be seen as
impacting negatively on the officer’s career. The success of the RC officer is not measured by length of Service in any
one component or control group, but by the officer’s breadth and depth of experience which are the metrics that
accurately reflect an officers potential to serve in positions of increasing responsibility. Officers should focus on job
performance, as there are many paths that define a successful career within the Aviation Branch.
(1) Formal training. As RC officers simultaneously advance both civilian and military careers, they have less
available time than their Active Army counterparts to achieve the same military professional education levels. To
minimize this problem, RC courses are specifically tailored to reduce the resident instruction time. This cannot be
accomplished with graduate flight training courses.
(2) Assignments. The Adjutants General of the 50 states, 3 U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia (D.C.)
primarily manage officers in the ARNG. The AHRC-St. Louis and the USAR command manage officers in the USAR.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(3) Professional development through the military schooling system. The Aviation RC officer plays an important
role in the Aviation Branch mission. RC officers normally develop through one AOC and in one FA. However, a lack
of suitable positions in a geographic area may lead to some RC officers becoming qualified in multiple AOCs or FAs.
RC officers must attain educational levels commensurate with their grade and assignment, using resident and nonresident instruction options. RC officers have increased windows to complete military education requirements. (For further
guidance on RC career progression, see chap 7.)
(4) RC lieutenant. Lieutenants must meet the requirements outlined in AR 611–110 for entry into the Aviation
Branch.
(a) PME. RC officers commissioned into the Aviation Branch attend BOLC and IERW with their Active Army
counterparts. RC officers must have completed this training by their 2d year of commissioned Service.
(b) Operational assignments. Lieutenants should serve as a section/platoon leader in an Aviation assignment. A
lieutenant normally serves at company level to gain troop leading and flight experience.
(c) Self-development. Lieutenants focus on gaining and refining troop leading, aviator, Joint, and combined arms
tactics, logistics, and administrative skills. Effective 1 October 1995, a baccalaureate degree from an accredited
institution is required for promotion to captain or higher.
(5) RC captain.
(a) PME. Captains must complete a CCC. Options are CCC Active Army curriculum, CCC–RC (RC curriculum), or
the four-phase CCC-USAR.
(b) Operational assignments. The officer should serve in one of the following branch developmental positions for 18
to 36 months; successful company/detachment command of a TOE/TDA unit or successful tour as a platoon leader in
platoons that authorize captains as platoon leaders. These include intermediate and higher level maintenance (ASC)
units. As a captain, RC Aviation officers should aggressively seek a company command. They also serve as staff
officers at the battalion and group/brigade levels.
(c) Self-development. Captains should broaden their understanding of warfighting through extension courses and
independent study. Captains should gain an in-depth understanding of Joint and combined arms operations.
(6) RC major. To achieve branch leadership developmental standards at this level, majors must have enrolled in the
ILE course prior to 18 years TIS. They must have completed 50 percent of ILE to be eligible for promotion to
lieutenant colonel.
(a) PME. Most RC officers will complete the ILE common core via The Army School System (TASS) or an
upgraded Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) program. Some RC Officers will continue to attend the ILE in
residence at Fort Leavenworth, some will depart upon completion of the Core Course and others will remain for the
Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course (AWOC).
(b) Operational assignments. RC Aviation majors serve as company commanders, and in staff assignments. These
staff positions are at the battalion, group, brigade, HQDA, or Joint staff levels. Some majors also serve as instructors or
staff at Reserve Forces Service Schools. Officers should serve in one of the following branch developmental positions
for 18 to 36 months; battalion XO or S3, battalion support operations officer, brigade S3, successful major level (04)
command of a TOE/TDA aviation unit, branch chief at an Army National Guard Aviation Training Site (AATS),
Aviation Branch coded (15) or branch/FA generalist positions at the HQDA or Joint staff levels, group, or brigade
primary staff (S1, S2, or S4), Aviation Branch coded (15) or branch/function in a generalist position at Joint, ARCOM,
or GOCOM staff levels, Reserve Forces Service school instructor or staff, Aviation staff officer at the ACOM/ASCC/
DRU level, and BAE.
(c) Self-development. Self-development efforts should focus on becoming an expert in all aspects of aviation support
operations, including Joint and combined arms operations. These objectives can be accomplished through correspondence courses or institutional training. Majors should also devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their
Joint and combined arms operations perspectives.
(7) RC lieutenant colonel. In order to qualify for promotion to colonel, RC officers must have completed ILE.
(a) Operational assignments. RC lieutenant colonels should seek a battalion level command. Upon successful
completion of a command, RC Aviation lieutenant colonels serve in staff positions at group/brigade, major subordinate
commands, USAR GOCOM, or Joint staff levels. Some RC officers may also serve as Reserve Forces Service School
instructors or staff. Officers should serve in one of the following branch developmental positions for 18 to 36 months;
successful command of a TOE/TDA aviation battalion or equivalent sized aviation unit, completion of a resident or
nonresident ILE, Aviation Branch coded (15) or branch/FA generalist positions at the ACOM/ASCC/DRU, GOCOM or
Joint staff levels, group, or brigade staff, division, or branch chief, USAAWC, USARC, NGB, or USAALS, AGR Title
10/Title 32 position at USAAWC or USAALS (in a lieutenant colonel level position), deputy commander of an AATS.
(b) Self-development. Self-development goals should be to continue building Joint warfighting expertise. An advanced degree is preferred but optional unless required for a specific assignment.
(8) RC colonel.
(a) PME. Completion of SSC by resident or correspondence course is a primary professional development goal.
(b) Operational assignments. Some, but not all, RC officers serve as group or brigade commanders. Most serve in

90

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

staff positions requiring their Aviation experience at the GOCOM or Joint staff levels. Aviation RC colonels should
serve in one of the following branch developmental positions for 18 to 36 months:
1. Successful command of a TOE/TDA Aviation group or brigade.
2. Completion of a resident or nonresident SSC.
3. USAAWC; Army or Joint level staff; Aviation Branch coded (15) or branch/FA generalist positions at the major
subordinate commands.
4. GOCOM or Joint staff levels, AGR Title 10/Title 32 positions at USAAWC or USAALS (in a colonel level
position).
5. Command of an AATS.
6. Division chief of Aviation and Safety Division.
7. National Guard Bureau (NGB).
8. State Army aviation officer (SAAO).
(c) Self-development. Self-development goals should continue to build on war fighting expertise. An advanced
degree is preferred but optional unless required for a specific assignment.
c. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model is shown at figure 11–6, below.

11–6. Aviation Reserve Component Warrant Officer
a. Preferences. RC Aviation WO development objectives and qualifications basically parallel those planned for their
Active Army counterparts.
b. Precedence. As with the RC commissioned officer, the RC WO’s role as a citizen Soldier also poses a unique
challenge for professional development. RC WOs are expected to follow Active Army WO development patterns as
closely as possible. RC WOs also have increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements.
(1) Formal training. As citizen Soldiers, RC Warrant Officers simultaneously advance civilian and military careers.
To minimize this impact, the USAAWC, and the WOCC have developed RC courses specifically tailored to reduce the
resident instructional time.
(2) Critical life cycle assignments. RC Aviation WOs are managed in the same manner as the RC commissioned
officer.
c. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory. RC Aviation WOs must attain educational levels commensurate with
their grade and assignment, using resident and nonresident instruction options. RC WOs also have increased windows
to complete military education requirements. As Aviation Branch aircraft systems increase in complexity and capability, a corresponding increase occurs in tactical employment capabilities. The need for AWOs who are highly competent
in operations, maintenance, safety, training and tactical employment of complex aircraft systems is critical to the
success of the Aviation Branch.
(1) MOS qualification and development.
(a) WO1. After completing the WOCS, WO1s attend their IERW and WOBC. WO1 appointments are contingent
upon successfully completing WOBC. These officers are basic level, technically and tactically focused officers who
perform the primary duties of leaders and operators. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and
supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. WO1s primarily support levels of operations from team
through battalion, requiring interaction with all Soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide leader development,
mentorship, and counsel to enlisted Soldiers and NCOs. WO1s should focus their efforts in becoming technically and
tactically competent in the aircraft and achieving pilot in command status. Typical company level additional duties
include ALSE, and Armament officers
(b) CW2. CW2s are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position.
CW2s will complete the TRADOC mandated common core prerequisites for the AWOAC prior to becoming eligible
for promotion to CW3. CW2s serve as intermediate level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties
of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, and advisor. CW2s provide direction, guidance,
resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. They primarily support levels
of operations from team through battalion, requiring interaction with all Soldier cohorts and primary staff. They
provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs and other officers. RC AWOs have the option
of resident or distance learning (DL) training. The purpose of the AWOAC is to refresh and enhance common skills
and leadership, update technical and tactical training, and provide doctrinal changes and additional training as
prescribed by the branch proponent. All training is based on future needs and requirements. Upon reaching the rank of
CW2, WOs should be certain of what career track they desire to enter. CW2s should concentrate on attaining Pilot in
Command status, complete career track training courses for Safety officer, Instructor Pilot, Maintenance officer, or
TACOPs officer, and annual completion of all ATP requirements towards attaining the Senior Army Aviator badge.
Typical company level assignments include; pilot in command, ALSE, armament, aviation safety officer, instructor
pilot, MTP, XP, and TACOPs officer.
(c) CW3. CW3s serve as advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical
leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, and advisor. CW3s provide direction, guidance, resources,
assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. They primarily support levels of
operations from troop/company through battalion, requiring interaction with all Soldier cohorts and primary staff. They
provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs and other officers. CW3s serve as senior
technical advisors to the company commander.
(d) CW4. CW4s are senior level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader,
manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. CW4s assigned to CW5 positions will attend their MOS
WOSSC prior to assignment. These officers serve at the field grade level as commanders and staff. They provide
direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. CW4s
primarily support battalion, brigade, division, corps, and echelons above corps operations. They provide leader
development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs and other officers. CW4s serve as the senior technical advisors
to the battalion/squadron level commander. RC CW4s not selected for CW5 may continue to serve in the TPU unless
otherwise prohibited by a retention board. AGR CW5s will attend the Active Army training.
(e) CW5. These most senior aviation officers serve as commanders and staff. CW5s are master-level technical and
tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, manager, integrator, advisor, or any other particular

92

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

duty prescribed by branch. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for
subordinates to perform their duties. These officers primarily support brigade, division, corps, echelons above corps,
and major command operations. They provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to other officers.
CW5s have special WO leadership and representation responsibilities within their respective commands.
(2) Professional development. Aviation WOs are adaptive technical experts, leaders, trainers, and advisors. Through
progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, they plan, administer, manage, maintain, and
operate in support of the full range of Army, Joint, combined, and coalition operations. WOs are teachers, warfighters,
and developers of specialized teams of Soldiers. Throughout their career, WOs should continue their self-development,
to include the pursuit of a specialty related graduate degree and/or advanced industry certification programs. The
following are the professional development goals for WOs:
(a) Complete an associate’s degree in a MOS related degree program and/or an MOS related certification program
by eligibility for promotion to CW3.
(b) Complete a baccalaureate degree in an MOS related degree program and/or an advanced certification program by
eligibility for promotion to CW4.
(c) Complete a graduate degree in an MOS related degree program and/or a second advanced certification program
by eligibility for promotion to CW5. Aviation RC WO MOS’s align with the Active Army WO MOSs (see career
development models figs 11–2, 11–3, 11–4, and 11–5, above).

Chapter 12
Field Artillery Branch
12–1. Unique features of the Field Artillery Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Field Artillery Branch. The Field Artillery Branch synchronizes and integrates Army fire
support assets, multiple Joint assets (Air Force, Navy, and Marine), interagency, inter-Governmental, and multinational
assets at the designated place and time to ensure our enemies are overwhelmed by lethal and/or non-lethal firepower.
The Field Artillery combines the devastating effects of its own cannon, rocket, missile and acquisition systems with
numerous fire support assets across a variety of combat arms and Joint Services to maximize the fires that are brought
to bear on enemies of the United States.
b. Unique functions performed by the Field Artillery Branch.
(1) Field Artillery officers are assigned directly to Army maneuver units (Infantry, Armor, Aviation, Ranger, Special
Forces) and to a variety of key positions in divisions and higher headquarters (to include Joint and Multinational
elements) to perform their unique and critical fires integration mission. Field Artillery officers plan, coordinate,
integrate, synchronize, and employ lethal and non-lethal firing assets and systems in support of Joint and combined
arms operations. These systems include air support, naval surface fires, attack aviation, mortars, electronic warfare,
information operations, space-based systems and Field Artillery target acquisition and weapon systems.
(2) Field Artillery officers plan and integrate information operations and electronic attack providing multifaceted or
alternative means to accomplish stated missions sometimes eliminating the need to use lethal fires. This integration is
yet another unique mission Field Artillery officers engage in using a variety of assets from organic systems to more
complex national capabilities.
c. Unique capabilities. Field Artillery officers are the integrators and synchronizers of lethal and non-lethal indirect
fires for the Army. Field Artillery officers advise commanders on how to obtain the effects they desire with the
systems available. Field Artillery officers also command Field Artillery firing assets and systems and execute fires
based on the commander’s intent. The Field Artillery WO provides the Army with the necessary technical and tactical
expertise to operate, maintain, and employ Field Artillery target sensors and to serve as platoon leaders, counterfire
officers, targeting officers, and Field Artillery intelligence officers (FAIO) integrating lethal and non-lethal fire support
from battalion levels through Joint Force headquarters levels.
d. Unique features of Service in the Field Artillery Branch. Below are brief descriptions of the nature of Service that
sets Field Artillery officers in operational units apart from officers in other branches or functional categories. First and
foremost, Field Artillery officers are Soldiers and combat arms leaders. They work at every level of command and staff
and perform the following functions/tasks:
(1) Lead and command Field Artillery combat units and other type units at platoon, battery, battalion, and brigade
levels.
(2) Coordinate the fire support and targeting process in rapidly moving JIIM operations.
(3) Create and formulate doctrine, organizations, and equipment to support the fire support mission worldwide.
(4) Teach Field Artillery and fire support skills at Service schools and Combat Training Centers (CTCs).
(5) Lead in positions requiring general combat skills such as staff officers in military headquarters and activities
requiring combat arms expertise.
(6) Instruct at pre-commissioning programs, Service schools, and Service colleges.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

93

(7) Train and advise the total Army Field Artillery force.
e. Unique features of Service in the Field Artillery Warrant Officer Program. The Field Artillery WO provides
assistance and advice to the commander and staff on all matters relative to the employment of Field Artillery target
acquisition, fire support assets and the Army’s targeting methodology. Field Artillery WOs provide many of the same
functions as the Field Artillery officers except command of tactical units. Field Artillery WOs perform the following
functions/tasks:
(1) Lead Field Artillery target acquisition platoons.
(2) Assist in managing Field Artillery target acquisition and collection assets employment at the Field Artillery
battalion, brigade, and division level.
(3) Develop subject matter expertise in information operations, especially electronic attack, in support of the
targeting process.
(4) Provide technical and tactical expertise in the coordination of the targeting process in combined arms or JIIM
operations.
(5) Teach Field Artillery target acquisition asset employment and targeting skills at Service schools and CTCs.
12–2. Officer characteristics required
a. General competencies. Army officers must be warriors who can effectively apply the four core dimensions of
leadership: values, attributes, skills and actions. The four core leadership dimensions provide the basis for what a leader
must be, know and do. The values and attributes set the basis for the character of the leader - what a leader must be.
The skills developed by leaders establish his or her competence - what a leader must know. The actions that leaders
conduct and execute constitute leadership - what a leader must do. The leadership framework describes a leader of
character and competence who acts to achieve results across the spectrum of operations from total war, to stability and
support operations, disaster relief, or realistic training operations.
b. Unique skills of Field Artillery officers. Field Artillery officers must be team players and strong leaders, skilled in
fire support tactics, techniques, and procedures. The goal of all Field Artillery officers is to gain an in-depth
understanding (as the officer’s experience base broadens) of how to best employ fire support in support of combined
arms and JIIM Operations. A Field Artillery officer must possess the following skills:
(1) Leader competency of Field Artillery officers must first and foremost be competent leaders as well as professional Field Artillerymen.
(2) Tactical skills referring to a clear understanding of war fighting tasks and missions.
(3) Technical skills reflecting competence with specific duty requirements and missions.
(4) Interpersonal skills and confidence in communicating with people.
(5) Decisionmaking and execution skills enabling mission accomplishment through adaptive and flexible thought
processes and proactive and innovative actions.
(6) Conceptual skills enabling the understanding of new ideas and information.
(7) Mental toughness is displayed by overcoming adversity. Self-discipline, initiative, judgment, confidence, intelligence, and fairness are key attributes a Field Artillery officer must possess.
(8) Physical readiness and perseverance are required of Field Artillery officers as they may be selected to serve in a
variety of physically demanding roles in Field Artillery units and in positions as fire support officers in Ranger, Special
Forces, Infantry or Armor units. All Field Artillery officers lead through example and physical fitness is an integral
part of overall health fitness, stamina, military bearing, and professional bearing. Physical fitness is a decisive
advantage in combat. All Field Artillery officers will strive for optimum physical fitness levels.
(9) Field Artillery officers must be team players with the acute ability to work together with other branches, services
and people of all nations.
c. Unique knowledge.
(1) Field Artillery officers must be subject matter experts in Field Artillery and in the integration of Joint fires to
support land/maneuver commanders. This knowledge includes practical experience in tactics, combined arms operations, Joint operations, target acquisition and direct and indirect weapon systems. Officers gain this knowledge through
a logical sequence of continuous education, training, and experience. Officers must possess and continually improve
basic computer literacy skills as Field Artillery system digitization and automation increases. Individual officers sustain
knowledge through institutional training and education, duty in operational assignments, and continuous self-development.
(2) Field Artillery WOs must possess the same attributes of an FA officer as well as a high degree of technical and
tactical knowledge of Field Artillery sensors, their employment and the Army’s targeting process. They are accessed
from all Field Artillery enlisted MOSs as well as the infantry mortar crewmember (11C) and carry forward the
competencies learned on the respective systems. Continuous education, training, experience and self-development
enhance the Field Artillery WOr’s technical expertise.
d. Unique attributes. The Field Artillery requires dynamic, competent, well-trained leaders at all levels who must

94

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

understand how other combat arms fight in order to effectively integrate Joint fires. Field Artillery officers must
possess the following attributes:
(1) Leader attributes. Field Artillery officers have a dynamic and challenging mission. Successful Field Artillery
officers must be mentally, physically, and emotionally tough.
(2) Terrain sense. The ability to quickly "visualize" terrain. This is more than viewing the terrain and knowing the
range capability of weapon systems. It is the ability to visualize the battlefield and know how to optimize weapon
systems and the application of fires on that terrain. This includes understanding the military ramifications of urban
environments and complex terrain in regards to fire support.
(3) A passion for precision. Field Artillery officers must be known for their attention to detail ensuring every fire
mission is on time and on target - nothing less is acceptable. Field Artillery officers control devastating firepower that
can and will annihilate anyone or anything at the point of impact. It is critically important that every call for fire a
Field Artillery officer initiates impacts at the exact time and exact place designated. Field Artillery officers must
maintain a passion for precision to ensure every request for fire is executed to exacting standards from target location,
to firing data computation, to weapon system munitions delivery. This reputation for extremely high standards of
precision, demonstrated time and again by Field Artillerymen, is what gives our maneuver comrades-in-arms the
confidence to request danger close artillery fires - the most important mission the Field Artillery has.
(4) Tenacity. An imaginative, driving intensity to complete a mission with available or procured assets. This
intensity represents the warrior spirit with an attitude to continuously accomplish all missions, with the highest priority
of supporting the combined arms commander and their Soldiers with relevant and responsive fires.
(5) Audacity. The willingness to take reasonable risks to achieve an objective or goal. Display self-confidence in
word and action inspiring others to perform at high levels.
(6) Physical confidence and health. A sense of physical well being that enhances self-image. The ability to
participate in regular, rigorous, and demanding physical activity; not just athletic ability.
(7) Practiced and practical judgment. The ability to distinguish the vital from the unimportant, the immediate from
casual and truth from deception.
(8) Discipline. Artillerymen must have strong self-discipline, unit discipline and institutional discipline. This discipline leads to precision in execution, sustaining a keen attention to detail, and sustaining the highest standards of
performance and accuracy with an end result of placing the right fires at the right place at the right time. This
discipline promotes trust and confidence in our ability to bring fires to bear in close combat; the single most important
mission of those supported in war.
(9) Joint and expeditionary mindset. All Field Artillery officers must possess a willingness to take the fight to the
enemies of the nation at the time and place of our choosing. This means Field Artillerymen must be ready to apply fire
support anywhere in the world, in either long or short duration requirements, and do so in a flexible and adaptive
manner. This application of fire support will include Joint, coalition/multinational, and potentially interagency or interGovernmental assets that will have to be synchronized and synergized to win the nation’s wars. Field Artillery officers
must gain in-depth knowledge in the discipline of fire support as well as learning the nuances of JIIM planning. This
lifelong learning effort starts prior to commissioning and continues throughout the officer’s entire career. The study of
foreign cultures, language skills learned in college, numerous professional development opportunities provided throughout an Army career, and formal schooling (both military and civilian) are just a few of the opportunities that will assist
an officer develop an expeditionary mindset.
e. Unique attributes fire support officers. Fire supporters must possess a combination of delivery system skills and a
passion to impose their will on the enemy with the application of both lethal and non-lethal fire support. Great fire
support officers are a unique blend of the best attributes of a Field Artilleryman and an infantryman. Fire supporters
must be "street fighters" with a rugged determination to close with and kill the enemy with a bayonet if necessary, but
also carry the ability to bring out the "big stick" for the maneuver force, which is the capability to muster more
firepower, in any weather, any time, any place, than is available in any infantry or armor force; the devastating fires of
the Field Artillery. The fire supporter must advise the maneuver force on what the Field Artillery can do and then do it
with uncompromising exactness and determination.
f. Unique attributes Field Artillery WOs. Field Artillery WOs should have all the same attributes as Field Artillery
officers as well as the following:
(1) A high degree of comprehension and technical competence in Field Artillery systems, Intelligence collection
assets, and architecture specific functions.
(2) Acute systemic problem solving skills.
12–3. Active Army Field Artillery officer developmental assignments
a. Branch officer professional development. Field Artillery officer assignment patterns will vary depending on the
needs of the Army, professional development requirements, the type of manning system used in the unit where the
officer is assigned, and individual officer preferences. To fully understand officer career development patterns an
officer must first understand the Army Stabilization Policy.
b. Field Artillery officer development.

(1) Lieutenant.
(a) After commissioning, officers will go to Basic officer Leader Course (BOLC) II, a six-week program focused on
small-unit leadership experience, platoon leader skills and troop-leading procedures. BOLC II is required for all branch
officers after commissioning and precedes BOLC III. BOLC II is taught at two locations, Fort Benning and Fort Sill.
Field Artillery lieutenants will be sent to either of the two BOLC II locations.
(b) FA BOLC III is a 15.4-week course, focuses on training Field Artillery officers to become competent and
professional field artillerymen with a focus on those skills required of a combat-ready company fires officer (or fire
support officer), firing platoon leader and fire direction officer.
(c) While at FA BOLC III, lieutenants are encouraged to participate in the Ranger Indoctrination Program. This
program prepares officers to attend Ranger School by providing additional physical training and skills training related
to Ranger School. Officers who successfully complete this program will normally attend Ranger and Airborne School
after BOLC III. Ranger School is particularly beneficial to those officers desiring Fire Support positions in light
infantry, air assault, airborne, Ranger, or Special Forces units. However, all officers are encouraged to attend Ranger
School regardless of assignment, as it provides an excellent foundation in small unit tactics as well as being a
tremendous leadership experience improving competence and confidence.
(d) After BOLC III, lieutenants can expect to be assigned to a tactical firing battalion at battery level, potentially in
a life cycle managed unit, to gain leadership experience and to enhance technical and tactical competence and
confidence. Ideally, lieutenants will experience duty at the firing battery level as platoon leaders, XOs, or fire direction
officers and then serve in company fire support officer positions. Officers initially assigned to generating force units
(also known as TDA units) will have an opportunity for assignment to operating force units to gain experience and
further develop tactical Field Artillery skills
(e) Typical Field Artillery developmental assignments for lieutenants are as follows:
1. Professional development as a lieutenant should focus on developing platoon level leadership skills, mastering
basic Field Artillery technical and tactical competencies, and developing combined arms fire support integration skills
and competencies.
2. The KD assignments as a lieutenant are platoon leader, fire direction officer and company fire support officer.
Lieutenants should seek one or more of these key assignments as these are the toughest assignments and provide
valuable experiences in both leadership and fire support expertise. However, success in any of the following Field
Artillery Branch developmental assignments listed below (or combination of assignments) will provide excellent
opportunities for career development and future consideration for promotion to the rank of captain:
a. Company fire support officer.
b. Firing platoon leader.
c. Fire direction officer.
d. Battery XO.
e. Battery operations officer.
f. Support platoon leader.
g. Other equivalent assignments as platoon leaders or key staff officers.
(f) Educational requirements. Before promotion to captain, an officer must obtain a baccalaureate degree from an
accredited college or university. The officer can go before the captain’s promotion board and become promotable
without a degree, however, he must complete the degree before the actual captain promotion pin-on date and before
attending the CCC.
(2) Captain.
(a) CCC.
1. Field Artillery officers normally attend the Field Artillery CCC following selection for promotion to the grade of
captain. Field commanders, in coordination with the U.S Army Human Resources Command (AHRC), will determine
the best time for school attendance based on the needs of the Army, the continued professional development
requirements of the officer, and the officer’s individual preferences.
2. Field Artillery officers in life cycle managed units (after approximately 36 months in lieutenant positions) will
attend the CCC and will, most likely, return to their previous duty station for continued career development in captain
level positions.
3. The CCC consists of approximately 18 weeks of branch specific technical and tactical training with integrated
common core instruction. This training prepares officers to command at battery level, perform fire support coordination
as a battalion level fire support officer, or work as a key staff officer on a battalion or brigade level staff. Selected
captains may have an opportunity to attend one of the other Maneuver, Fires & Effects (MF& E) Career Courses. A
Field Artillery officer, for example, may attend the infantry or armor CCC. This cross training option benefits officers
of both branches. Selection is competitive and these slots are generally reserved for officers with KD experiences.
(b) Captain leader development. A wide variety of interesting and challenging assignments are available to Field
Artillery captains after the career course. The majority of captains will be assigned to Field Artillery cannon or rocket
battalions or to fire support positions within maneuver battalions (Ranger, Special Forces, Infantry, Armor, and

96

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Aviation). A small number of officers will be assigned to generating force units (the Field Artillery Training Center as
an example) to ensure the training base has quality officers to lead and command training units and new recruits. Most
assignment paths offer Field Artillery experience, including battery command.
(c) Typical Field Artillery developmental assignments for captains are as follows:
1. Professional development as a captain is focused on developing strong troop leading skills, mastering technical
and tactical Field Artillery competencies, learning skills in fire support coordination in support of Joint and combined
arms operations, and understanding Field Artillery specific operations, logistics, and support requirements. Professional
development experiences following the CCC are numerous. In many cases, officers will have an opportunity to serve in
multiple assignments to assist in their career development.
2. The KD assignments for a captain include battery command and battalion level Fire Support officer. Battery
command provides the single most valuable experience a captain can obtain in troop leading and small unit operations.
The battalion fire support officer assignment at the maneuver battalion provides the most challenging assignments
available in the discipline of fire support coordination support integration with maneuver forces. These assignments
provide a very credible developmental experience in the core skill sets required of fire support coordinators, future
Field Artillery battalion level commanders, and key field grade staff officers. Captains should seek these tough
assignments.
3. Branch developmental assignments for captains, overall, are designed to allow commanders wide latitude in
tailoring the type, number, and order of assignments based on the developmental needs of the officer, the operational
needs of the unit, the availability of developmental duty positions within the command, and the overall needs of the
Army. Success in the assignments listed below (or combination of assignments) will provide opportunities for career
development and future consideration for promotion to the rank of major (which will be primarily based on performance in one or more of the following positions):
a. Battery command*.
b. Battalion fire support officer*.
c. Fires battalion assistant S3.
d. Fires battalion fire direction officer (FDO).
e. Fires brigade operations.
f. Primary staff officers at battalion and higher levels.
g. Special JIIM assignments.
h. Other career developing captain equivalent assignments.
Note. Asterisks indicate KD assignment (see para 12–3b(2)(c)2, above, and paras 12–3b(2)(c)4 and 12–3b(2)(c) 7, below).

4. The goal of the Field Artillery Branch is to provide a battery command opportunity for all captains displaying the
competence required of a commander in this challenging experience. However, battery command selection will remain
competitive. Commanding is a privilege, not a right. Field commanders will determine and select Field Artillery
officers exhibiting the necessary skills and experience to lead Soldiers as a battery commander. Officers who do not
have a command opportunity will be provided other branch developmental opportunities in other challenging positions
that will satisfy the professional development requirements to continue successfully within the Field Artillery CF and
potentially lead to promotion. Assignment as a battalion fire support officer, battalion fire direction officer, battalion
assistant S3, or as a battalion primary staff officer are some examples of superb career developmental assignments in
addition to battery command.
5. Battery command length will vary based on mission requirements and can range between 12 and 36 months. Field
commanders will determine battery command length based on mission requirements. However, the goal for battery
command duration is 18 months (plus or minus 6 months).
6. A small percentage of captains may have a second command opportunity. Second command opportunities are
usually reserved for commands that tend to present a unique and more diverse challenge (where the unit and Soldiers
would benefit significantly by having a commander with previous command experience). Additionally, commanders of
generating force units who display future potential as a battalion commander will be given the highest consideration for
a second command opportunity in an operating force unit. Also, training center units, due to the importance of their
mission, may be offered as a second command to former tactical unit commanders. For this reason, there is an active
battery command exchange program, which promotes an exchange of training unit commanders with tactical force
commanders after 12–18 months in command. This exchange program is based on the availability of officers, force
training requirements and the needs of the Army. Second commands remain a viable, although limited, option to
provide a varied and relevant leadership experience that benefits the officer and the unit.
7. Battalion fire support officer is very difficult and demanding, but highly rewarding. Captains should aggressively
prepare for and seek assignments as battalion fire support officers. Fire support officers are assigned directly to
maneuver organizations, which include Ranger, Special Forces, Infantry, Armor, Aviation, and other maneuver type
forces. Battalion fire support officers work directly for maneuver commanders in maneuver organizations. The
battlefield insights and perspectives gained while working directly in maneuver formations benefit these Field Artillerymen throughout their entire career. The experience of integrating fire support for the maneuver force is so critically
important that field commanders are encouraged to place their most experienced officers in these critical positions.
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

97

Former battery commanders make excellent choices to fill fire support assignments, as their battery command
experience provides a unique perspective and understanding of the fires delivery process. Former battery commanders
bring tremendous credibility to these critical fires positions by providing an experienced and knowledgeable leader to
advise and support our maneuver forces; our most important mission. All Field Artillery officers should strive for fire
support experience during their lieutenant and captain years.
8. Although the focus of career development for captains is to become competent in fire support operations, it
remains critically important to develop officers with a Joint and expeditionary mindset and experience base. Therefore,
as early in an officer’s career as possible, assignments that broaden the experience base, and perspective of officers, as
they relate to Joint operations and coalition warfare, will benefit both the Army and the officer. Captains that have
gained the necessary branch specific experiences should seek assignments and/or schooling that provide unique JIIM
perspectives and experiences. A balance of breadth of experience versus depth of understanding in a particular field
must be considered and will vary based on the needs of the Army.
9. All captains should aggressively seek challenging tactical assignments that provide the best professional opportunities and experiences to develop them as Field Artillery officers. In general terms, the more challenging and tougher
the assignment, the more rewarding and beneficial the experience. Seeking the tough jobs and succeeding at them will
provide the best opportunities for professional growth and development. Doing well in a tough assignment is personally
rewarding and will also open future career options as the officer progresses and has the opportunity to appear before
competitive promotion boards that look at the future potential of competing officers. In most cases, offices will be
assigned positions based on the needs of the Army at all levels, including the immediate commander. In all cases, the
most important measure of an officer’s success is how well he/she performs in the position he/she is assigned.
10. How well the job assigned is done remains the primary determination of your success. There is room for a wide
variety of career paths and job assignments in the Field Artillery. FA designation opportunities are also avenues Field
Artillery officers can pursue to provide an even broader variety of additional unique career paths. Clearly, an officer’s
overall "career success" is based on the goals and objectives established by each individual officer and not by Field
Artillery assignment policies. There is no one set prescriptive career path that every officer must follow to be
"successful".
(d) Assignments. Beyond key and branch developmental assignments, captains can expect assignments consistent
with the needs of the Army. Additional developmental and career enhancing assignments include the following:
1. Training, mentoring, and guiding our future leaders, the most important asset, is of the utmost importance to the
Field Artillery. Our most experienced and best leaders must become the trainers and mentors of our next generation of
officers and Soldiers. Therefore, it is important to highlight the SGL and observer/controller evaluators (O/CE)
assignments considered so critical to the overall success of the Field Artillery. The SGL positions are important
instructor assignments at Fort Sill (mainly for instruction related to the Field Artillery CCC) and in other key billets
throughout the Army. The O/CE positions are challenging subject matter expert (SME) assignments at the CTCs (NTC,
JRTC, CMTC, BCTP). These superb assignments are nominative (officer files are reviewed in a competitive selection
process). Officers with the right credentials and experience are nominated and offered this challenging assignment that
will further improve their technical, tactical, and leadership skills. Therefore, these assignments are considered career
enhancing because only the best officers are asked to fill them. Additionally, the personal satisfaction of mentoring and
developing young leaders provides these select officers a very worthwhile and gratifying experience. The small group
leaders (SGLs) and O/CEs truly become SMEs and their experience and opinions are shared across the Field Artillery.
All officers should seek out these challenging and rewarding assignments.
2. Other critical instructor positions (USMA faculty, ROTC, other branch and Service school instructors).
3. Other branch/FA generalist positions (that is, Recruiting command staff, Active Army/RC positions, or other RC
duty).
4. Other special assignments in JIIM positions.
5. Other nominative assignments (that is, aide-de-camp and internships).
6. ACS (based on Army requirements).
(e) Building professional knowledge. Captains should continue to gain an in-depth understanding of combined arms
operations and become proficient in fires and fire support tasks. These tasks provide the foundation of knowledge
required to effectively serve in the branch as a leader at the battery and battalion level. Captains must gain a working
knowledge of command principles, battalion level staff operations, and combined arms and fire support operations. As
a captain develops, they should also seek to broaden their perspectives in JIIM assignments due to the nature of the
expeditionary forces and the likelihood of future coalition warfare. Captains should also dedicate time to professional
reading to gain a historical perspective on tactical and leadership challenges.
(3) Major.
(a) At the 7th year, an officer’s record goes before a FDB. This board, comprised of senior officers, will decide if
the officer is best suited to serve in one of three functional categories; MF&E, operations support, or force sustainment.
1. The majority of Field Artillery captains will be designated to remain in the MF&E functional category and the
fires grouping based on requirements. AHRC, Field Artillery Branch, will manage assignments for Field Artillery
captains in the fires group. Field Artillery officers remaining in the fires group will be assigned to branch and branch/

98

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

FA generalist assignments. A stated goal of OPMS is to allow operations CF officers to stabilize time served in
operational units for 36 months.
2. Field Artillery Captains, based on skills and experience, may request other than the MF&E functional category.
Selection to assignment outside of the MF&E functional category is competitively based on the specific requirements
for the desired category (number of officers required, education, experience, and so on). Qualification standards and
assignments for captains designated into one of the other functional categories will be managed by the assignment
officers for those categories and groupings.
3. Officers will compete for promotion to lieutenant colonel and higher within their designated functional category
(MF&E for those staying within the Field Artillery).
(b) Leader development at the rank of major is designed to prepare officers for command of fires battalions and to
enhance fire support coordination knowledge and skills. Majors will serve in a variety of positions in a combination of
developmental positions in fires battalions, BCTs, and at other levels throughout the Army.
1. Key Field Artillery developmental assignments for majors.
a. S3, XO. To ensure future potential battalion commanders are given a strong experience base in the operation of a
fires battalion, key branch leader development includes serving as a S3 or XO in a fires battalion, fires brigade, or in a
comparable organization (tactical or training command).
b. Deputy fire support coordinator (DFSCOORD) at brigade level, AFSCOORD or assistant fire support coordinator (AFSCOORD) at division or higher HQ. To ensure continued mastery of critical fire support expertise, majors also
need to obtain experience in fire support coordination assignments as well. Both Field Artillery operational experience
and critical fire support/operations developmental assignments are important to ensure potential battalion commanders
and future battlefield staff officers remain well versed across the spectrum of Field Artillery operations and in fire
support coordination Support synchronization.
2. Key branch developmental assignments for majors, such as battalion S3/XO, brigade S3/XO/DCO, fires brigade
S3/XO/DCO, BCT DFSCOORD. The positions of Brigade DFSCOORD at BCT/SBCT are the premier Fire Support
positions in the Field Artillery. These brigade level positions are among a select few positions providing experience for
future fires battalion commanders in BCTs or for key staff officers or commanders in fires brigades or at higher
echelon headquarters or commands. Assignment as a BCT S3/XO/DCO increases your competitiveness to be selected
to command a BCT as a colonel fire support skills are critical for future commanders who may also be D/
AFSCOORDs for divisions. A strong performance as a D/AFSCOORD is a clear indicator of future potential for
Service as a battalion commander.
3. Other branch developmental assignments for majors are as follows:
a. A competent, capable and knowledgeable Field Artillery officer must have a mix of career developmental
opportunities and experience. Some officers will require in-depth knowledge and expertise gained through repetitive
assignments in specific areas due to the complexities of their assignments and focused mission requirements. Other
officers will require a broader focus in assignments to be able to execute and synchronize efforts across a multitude of
organizations or agencies. In either case, it is clear that there can be no single standard career path for every officer.
Most Field Artillery officers will have a mix of developmental assignments that will be different from their peers.
Some officers may have multiple KD assignments (S3/XO/ or D/AFSCOORD) and some, possibly, may not have the
opportunity. In either case, a hard working and dedicated officer will find career success and make a significant
contribution to the success of the Field Artillery. Officers must have a diverse and flexible career path in order to
create the skill sets required to maintain a very professional, dynamic and successful branch and officer corps.
b. The need for expeditionary type experiences, to include JIIM assignments, is essential to the experience base and
career development of all field grade officers. Although the Field Artillery aspect of career development for majors is
focused on the development of expertise in fire support coordination, it remains critically important to develop officers
with a Joint and expeditionary mindset and experience base as well. Assignments will be offered to either broaden the
experience base and perspective of officers in the area of JIIM or to develop more in-depth expertise required to ensure
success in specific operations or areas. In either case, these assignments will significantly enhance an officer’s
development as well as providing the Army with more effective subject matter experts. Majors should seek assignments and schooling providing unique JIIM perspectives and experiences. JIIM staff positions or in assignments
embedded with sister Services all provide superb experience.
c. There may be limited instances where a major does not have an opportunity for assignment in a KD position (S3/
XO or D/AFSCOORD). This could happen based on timing, the need for specific subject matter expertise job
availability, command decisions, or for numerous other legitimate reasons. In these instances, several other branch
developmental jobs and experiences will support an officer’s career advancement and consideration for promotion, as
long as the officer’s overall duty performance and his overall demonstrated potential warrant it. The goal of the Field
Artillery is to provide a key developmental assignment opportunity to all qualified officers; however, selection to these
positions will remain somewhat competitive. All majors should strive for assignment to at least one key branch
developmental assignment. Additional branch developmental assignments for majors (fire support/operations), division,
or corps DFSCOORD/AFSCOORD; operations officer of battlefield coordination detachment (BCD), specific Joint
assignments, and other special assignments currently under review (which include a variety of JIIM experiences)

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

99

4. The goal of the Field Artillery Branch is to provide majors the opportunity to serve for 24–36 months in KD
positions (XO, S3, BCT DFSCOORD, division, and higher HQ AFSCOORD) and/or branch developmental positions.
Commanders are provided wide latitude in tailoring the order of these developmental assignments based on the
developmental needs of the officer, the operational needs of the unit, and the availability of developmental jobs versus
the number of officers requiring experience.
5. The particular assignments a major is selected for and his level of success in those assignments sets the
conditions for promotion opportunities to lieutenant colonel and possible selection to battalion command. Field
Artillery battalion commanders are selected from a DA Command Selection List (CSL) by a board of senior officers.
This board selects the best-qualified officers based on performance in tough and challenging assignments that provide
the experience necessary for successful command of a combat arms battalion. The board looks for demonstrated
success in a very competitive selection process.
6. In many cases, the "branch developmental experience" at the major level does not necessarily equate to "battalion
command selection". Majors and newly promoted lieutenant colonels desiring to command a fires battalion must fight
for the tough jobs and seek additional assignments and experience in line with the type of battalion they desire to
command. Those officers desiring to command a fires battalion in a BCT, for example, must fully understand how to
integrate and synchronize fires in combined arms operations, and also possess a strong knowledge of Field Artillery
tactics and logistics. Assignments as a BCT FSCOORD for lieutenant colonels, DFSCOORD for majors, fire support
OC at a CTC, fires battalion or fires brigade S3, and/or XO, are some examples of the developmental experiences
critically important to gain the necessary expertise and leadership acumen to command successfully. The assignments
required for competitive selection as a battalion commander may go beyond those required for normal "branch officer
development". Command selection remains very competitive and the opportunity to command is a privilege, not a
right. However, success in today’s Army does not require selection as a battalion commander. Many consider
promotion to lieutenant colonel success. In either case, each individual officer determines career success. Raters and
senior raters will discuss career progression, key assignments, and professional developments goals that are realistic
and obtainable for all officers. All officers need to define what they consider success and work to meet the goals they
establish. The Field Artillery Branch will assist in supporting the career of any officer that emulates the Army Values;
there are many paths to success.
7. Most Field Artillery majors will continue to serve in Field Artillery positions at division and corps or in force
generating units (TDA organizations) after completing tactical level developmental assignments at the battalion,
brigade and higher levels. Other typical assignments include—
a. SGL O/CE. Training, mentoring and guiding our future leaders, our most important asset, is of the utmost
importance to the Field Artillery Branch. Our most experienced and best leaders must become the trainers and mentors
of our next generation of officers and Soldiers. Therefore, it is important to highlight the SGL and O/CE assignments
considered so critical to the overall success of the Field Artillery. The SGL positions are important instructor
assignments at Fort Sill (mainly for instruction related to Field Artillery CCC) and in several other key billets
throughout the Army. The O/CE positions are challenging subject matter expert (SME) assignments at the CTCs (NTC,
JRTC, CMTC). These superb assignments are nominative (officer files are reviewed in a competitive selection
process). Officers with the right credentials and experience are nominated and offered this unique challenge that will
further improve their technical, tactical, and leadership skills. Therefore, these assignments are considered career
enhancing because only the best officers are asked to fill them. Also, the personal satisfaction of mentoring and
developing young leaders provides a very worthwhile and gratifying experience. The SGLs and O/CEs truly become
subject matter experts and their experience and opinions are shared across the Field Artillery. All officers should seek
out these challenging and rewarding assignments.
b. JIIM/DOD or Army Staff positions.
c. RC support.
d. Echelons above corps staff.
e. ACOM staff.
f. General Staff College ILE faculty and staff.
g. Branch/FA generalist positions (such as Inspector General, ROTC instructor, or as other faculty and staff).
(c) Some officers are selected for the School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) and will serve as division and
corps planners during some portion of their next assignment.
(d) Majors should continue self-development and lifelong learning efforts to become an expert in all aspects of fire
support coordination to include Joint and multinational operations. Self-development should include correspondence
courses, civilian education, and institutional training. Officers should also devote time to a professional reading
program to broaden their warfighting perspective.
(e) Current institutional training for majors includes completion of the command and General Staff College ILE.
Completing this course is considered essential for branch development and promotion to lieutenant colonel.
(f) All Army competitive category officers will have the opportunity to attend ILE.
(g) ILE is designed to provide common core and operational instruction, and additional tailored education opportunities tied to the requirements of the officer’s specific branch or FA, based on OPMS guidelines. This program will

100

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

produce field grade officers with a Warrior Ethos grounded in warfighting doctrine. It will provide officers the
technical, tactical, leadership competencies, and skills to be successful in their branch or FA.
(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Officers selected for lieutenant colonel should seek assignments of greater responsibility in the branch and
branch/FA generalist positions.
(b) The objective of lieutenant colonel assignments is to provide a greater contribution to the branch the Army and
to other JIIM efforts. Key assignments for lieutenant colonels include the following:
1. CSL battalion level command.
2. BCT FSCOORD, division or higher HQ deputy fire support coordinators, fires brigade deputy commanders and
operations officers, and a variety of other key staff officer positions.
3. Senior fire support OC.
4. BCT S–3/XO/DCO (Assignment as a BCT S3/XO/DCO increases your competitiveness to be selected to
command a BCT as a colonel.
5. Corps/division staff.
6. JIIM/DOD or Army Staff positions.
7. Service school staff.
8. Active Army/RC training support team chief/commander.
(c) Self-development objectives should continue to build upon warfighting expertise and gaining perspectives on
JIIM operations.
(d) Institutional training for lieutenant colonels includes resident or nonresident SSC education; with attendance
dependent on centralized selection.
(5) Colonel. Field Artillery colonels contribute to the branch by serving in critical assignments to include the
following:
(a) Colonel level command (that is, command of a fires brigade, command of a BCT, training brigade, or other
brigade level commands to include operational or generating force units).
(b) Selection for a designated key billet, battlefield coordination detachment.
(c) Deputy commanders.
(d) Chief of Staff, G–3/5/7 or other key division, corps, division, or center staff position)
(e) FSCOORD at the division/corps or at other higher echelons.
(f) Selected positions in the Field Artillery School (Directors of key departments/directorates).
(g) JIIM/DOD or other Army Staff key positions.
(6) Institutional training for colonels includes senior post-SSC fellowships.
(7) WO1.
(a) Upon graduation from WOCS and appointment to WO1, each officer will attend the Fort Sill WOBC.
(b) Field Artillery WOs to be radar platoon leaders, counterfire officers, and targeting officers within the BCT.
(8) CW2.
(a) CW2s are normally assigned as a radar platoon leader within a target acquisition platoon or a Fires Battalion
Counterfire officer.
(b) Ideally, WO1/CW2s will also experience duty as a radar platoon leader and counterfire officer prior to serving as
the target analyst/targeting officer at the BCT.
(c) While a WO1/CW2, the focus should be on acquiring and refining the technical knowledge and tactical
experience to effectively integrate Field Artillery sensors within the BCT’s area of operations. Before promotion to
CW3, WOs should possess a strong foundation of Field Artillery skills and an extensive knowledge in the employment
of Field Artillery sensors, and the counterfire and targeting process. Completion of an associate’s degree is a
recommended goal prior to becoming eligible for promotion to CW3.
(9) CW3.
(a) The Field Artillery WOAC has two phases. Phase one is a TRADOC common core prerequisite and must be
completed prior to attending the phase two resident course. Officers should complete the WOAC by the one year time
in grade point as a CW3. WOAC must be completed for promotion to CW4. The residential course consists of 9 weeks
of advanced technical and tactical training in the targeting process at the division, corps, Joint task force, or ASCC.
This training prepares WOs for duty at the Fires Brigade or higher level targeting officers and Field Artillery
intelligence officer (FAIO).
(b) Ideally, CW3s will have served as a BCT level targeting officer prior to serving as a fires brigade targeting
officer, division, or corps targeting officer/FAIO. Assignment oriented training will be focused towards future positions
that enhance the officer’s duty performance. Completion of a baccalaureate degree is a recommended goal prior to
becoming eligible for promotion to CW4.
(c) Select WOs in the grade of CW3 can also expect to receive assignments consistent with the needs of the Army,
such as the following:

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

101

1. CTC observer controller/evaluator (OC/E).
2. BCTP observer controller.
3. Service school instructors.
4. Combat developers.
5. Training/doctrine developers.
6. Assignment to SOCOM community, ranger regiment, Special Forces groups.
(d) CW4.
1. WOSC.
2. CW4s will serve as FAIOs and targeting officers in positions at division, corps, and higher echelons or in
generating force organizations. Select CW4s can also expect to receive assignments consistent with the needs of the
Army, such as, the following:
a. Targeting officer in the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.
b. Service school instructor.
c. Combat developer.
d. Training/doctrine developer.
e. Test officer (TEXCOM).
f. Program manager.
g. Branch manager.
3. CW4s should continue self-development efforts to enhance expertise in all aspects of target acquisition asset
employment and targeting to include Joint and combined operations utilizing assignment oriented training. Selfdevelopment should include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training. CW4s should devote
time to obtaining a graduate level degree. CW4s should attend WOSC by the 1 year TIG point as a CW4. Officers
must attend WOSC for promotion to CW5.
(e) CW5.
1. WOSSC.
2. CW5s will serve as targeting officers in positions at corps and higher echelons or in force generating organizations. Select CW5s can also expect to receive assignments consistent with the needs of the Army, such as, the
following:
a. Senior Service school instructor.
b. U.S. Army Nuclear and Chemical Command instructor and doctrine developer.
c. Chief Warrant officer of the Field Artillery/personnel proponent officer.
d. HQDA systems integrator.
e. Targeting officer in the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.
3. CW5s should continue self-development efforts to enhance expertise in all aspects of targeting to include Joint
and combined operations.
c. Branch/FA generalist assignments. Officers above the rank of lieutenant can expect to serve in branch/FA
generalist assignments, such as ROTC or USMA faculty and staff that are not directly related to the branch but are
important to the Army.
d. JIIM/DOD or Army Staff assignments. Officers can expect consideration for a variety of duty assignments
worldwide. Expeditionary assignments increase an officer’s overall experience and are a critical requirement for the
Army to ensure development and understanding of expeditionary warfighting skills and for advancement into senior
leadership positions. The majority of JIIM/DOD or Army Staff assignments will be in branch/FA generalist jobs or in
assignments on Joint staffs or a variety of unified or coalition type headquarters.
12–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences.
(1) The Field Artillery Branch is diverse enough to allow for numerous career development paths. Officers are
encouraged to seek assignments across the spectrum of systems employed by the Field Artillery (light cannons, heavy
cannons rockets). Officers should also expect to serve in overseas duty assignments during their career. The professional development goal of the Field Artillery is to produce and sustain highly qualified tactically and operationally
oriented officers with both a breadth and depth of understanding of the branch that clearly have the professional ability
to lead Field Artillery organizations and elements in combat and other assigned missions. Developmental leadership
positions will remain the priority within assignments, but the branch will maintain flexibility on the sequence of
assignments. An officer’s preference is taken into consideration when assignments are made. Assignment patterns are
not tightly constrained to precedence; however, the branch will attempt to assign officers within generally prescribed
sequences to support the Army’s unit focused stabilization initiatives and to maximize the development and competency of every Field Artillery officer as much as possible.
(2) Field Artillery WOs should seek assignments across the spectrum of Field Artillery target acquisition systems

102

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

and organizations (light, mechanized, armor). The professional development goal is to produce and sustain highly
qualified technically, tactically, and operationally oriented WOs.
b. Precedence.
(1) Lieutenants should expect initial assignments of approximately 36 months in life cycle or cyclic manned units
with a second follow-on cycle of 36 months in stabilized life cycle installation assignments. Lieutenants assigned to
stabilized installations can expect to attend the CCC at some point during their first 36 months at the assignment. The
timing is based on unit requirements. The officer will likely return to his/her unit or installation after the CCCC ready
to assume command or continue career development in captain level assignments. Lieutenants assigned to life cycle or
cyclic manned units can expect to attend the CCC at the commander’s discretion to support the unit’s life cycle.
Officers initially assigned to generating force units (TDA assignments) will normally have a follow on assignment to
an operating force (tactical) unit.
(2) Captains will normally not be assigned to positions outside of an operational unit until they have had the
opportunity to obtain branch development goals that may include battery command and fire support officer experiences.
(3) Assignments for majors between operating and generating force assignments (branch/FA generalist, or echelons
above corps positions) may vary in sequence; however, every major will be afforded the opportunity to obtain
competency through branch developmental assignments.
(4) Lieutenant colonels and colonels will serve to meet the requirements of the branch, with command positions as
the priority.
(5) WO1/2 Field Artillery WOs should be initially assigned for a minimum of 18 to 24 months as a target
acquisition platoon leader to develop operational and functional skills on Field Artillery sensors. The officer should
progress through a series of counterfire and targeting officer jobs to gain experience in the targeting process. Senior
Field Artillery WOs should be assigned to field artillery brigades, or at the division, corps, or higher echelons in an
ascending order if possible. The intent is to gain experience at the lower echelons prior to moving to a position at the
higher echelon.
12–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Field Artillery Branch developmental positions. Field Artillery lieutenants must serve at least 24–36 months in
Field Artillery battalions as part of their branch development. Field Artillery captains must serve in branch developmental positions for at least 24–36 months. The branch developmental goal for captains is to have a battery command
opportunity when possible. Normal duration of a battery command is 18 months (+/- 6 months) depending on unit
requirements and cycles. Majors will spend between 24–36 months in Field Artillery units in branch developmental
assignments. The branch developmental goal for majors is to provide an opportunity for majors in a KD assignment
when possible. The current HQDA policy of assigning lieutenant colonels and colonels to 2 to 3 year battalion and
brigade commands remains unchanged, although in certain units this time may flex based on Army requirements.
b. Field Artillery officer career developmental life cycle and utilization model. Figure 12–1, below, displays a Field
Artillery Branch developmental life cycle model displaying KD positions for Field Artillery officers that will provide
leadership opportunities and development of branch competency.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Figure 12–2. Field Artillery WO Developmental Model

12–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for branch officers remaining in the MF&E functional
category. This requires developing an optimized field grade inventory in order to meet branch authorizations, to
provide sufficient flexibility to support branch/FA generalist positions, and to provide majors with a minimum of two
years of key branch developmental time.
b. OPMS. Officers wanting more information on branch authorizations or inventory, by grade, are encouraged to
contact the branch proponency office or their AHRC assignment officer.
12–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Field Artillery
Branch life cycle function highlights associated with OPMS are as follows:
a. Structure. The structure of Field Artillery organizations is transforming to become more agile, lethal, and relevant
based on new equipment capabilities and emerging global threats.
b. Acquire. Officers will continue to be accessed through USMA, ROTC, OCS, and WOCS. Accessions are based
on officer preference and the needs of the Army. The branch will also remain a recipient of branch detail officers from
other branches.
c. Distribute. Officers will be assigned to stabilized installation assignments under life cycle or cyclic manned units.
(1) Stabilized installation assignments. The majority of officers assigned to stabilized installations will be initial
entry from Field Artillery BOLC III. These officers will be initially assigned to an installation for approximately 36

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

105

months. During this time, the officer will complete their platoon leader and lieutenant years. They will then proceed to
the CCC and in most cases will return to the same installation to complete captain career development and have an
opportunity to command at battery level. The officers will gain tactical and operational experience that will benefit
them and the Army in future positions.
(2) Life cycle units. Officers at all levels may be assigned to life cycle units (generally the SBCTs and BCTs) for a
minimum of 3 years. Branch detailed officers will remain in their detail branch until after completion of the assignment
to a life cycle unit.
(3) Cyclic units. Units not assigned missions in support of BCT and SBCT will most likely be managed on a cyclic
manning system. Replacements will be sent to these units and installations periodically to maintain readiness. Tour
lengths and developmental position opportunities may vary. Branch detailed officers will remain on standard branch
detailed time lines. Officers continue to rotate between assignments to tactical operating force units and to generating
force units (TDA) in CONUS and OCONUS locations. The sequencing and timing of assignments permits officers to
gain the requisite skills to assume roles as senior leaders in the Army. OPMS distribution rules: officers in the
operations CF will work either in branch or FA positions; majors can expect more branch developmental time and
increased unit stability.
d. Deploy. Field Artillery Branch officers are warriors who must remain personally and professionally prepared to
deploy worldwide at all times. All Field Artillery officers must remain fully deployable to accomplish missions across
the full spectrum of conflict whether assigned to operating force units with high levels of readiness or to a fixed site
generating force unit. The War on Terrorism makes it critically important that all Field Artillery officers are ready,
willing, and able to deploy on short notice to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests. This also
includes support to joint and multinational operations such as humanitarian, peacekeeping missions, stability operations, and civil support operations. Field Artillery officers must fully prepare themselves and their Families for this
important challenge.
e. Sustain. OPMS programs remain effective.
(1) Promotion. Functional category based promotion boards remain viable. Majors and above will compete for
promotion within their functional category.
(2) Command. Lieutenant colonel and colonel level commanders will be listed on the CSL.
(3) OER. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS Captains, lieutenants, WO1s,
and CW2s will no longer have a senior rater block check (ACOM/COM/BCOM) on their OERs. These same officers
will receive counseling from their raters using DA Form 67–9–1a. Current OER early masking remains in effect.
f. Develop. Officer development will occur through a sequence of progressive assignments in operating force units
and in generating force units. The goal is to professionally develop officers across a broad spectrum of operations that
can expertly employ fire support skills in support of Joint and combined arms operations that validate the doctrine,
training, and material development missions of the branch.
g. Separate. The officer separation process remains unchanged.
12–8. Field Artillery Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. RC units comprise the majority of the Field Artillery units in America’s Army. All
Field Artillery units in the RC are in the ARNG. The overwhelming majority of positions in the RC correspond to
those positions in the MF&E functional category under OPMS. Field Artillery RC officer careers are spent
predominantly in tactical units. RC officers should optimize their time in developmental fire support and operational
Field Artillery positions.
b. Branch developmental opportunities. RC Field Artillery officers should strive to adhere, as nearly as possible, to
the standards and professional development patterns in individual training, operational assignments, and self-development as their Active Duty counterparts (see fig 12–3, below). RC officers should build a solid foundation in leadership,
fire support skills, and Field Artillery unit operations to successfully serve in the branch. Ideally this occurs through a
variety of assignments as fire support officers at all levels, in artillery units, on staffs, and in support units where Field
Artillery expertise is needed. Because of geographic location or other considerations, RC Field Artillery officers may
not have the opportunity to serve in as many Field Artillery and fire support positions as Active Duty officers.
However, this is offset by longevity in positions that are available in tactical units in their geographic area.
(1) RC career development. To meet career development requirements, a RC Field Artillery officer must have the
following:
(a) Completed at least 60 hours of college credit to receive a commission.
(b) Completed the Field Artillery BOLC III; ARNG officers must complete within 18 months and USAR officers
should complete by the end of the first year of commissioned Service, but not later than the third year.
(c) Completed Field Artillery CCC, either the active or RC course (resident or nonresident). BOLC II graduates of
other branches transferring to the Field Artillery are encouraged to attend a pre-course or take advantage of home
station training prior to enrolling in the Field Artillery CCC.
(d) Successfully commanded a battery level unit for 24 months (plus or minus 12 months) or served as one or more
of the following for 24 months (plus or minus 12 months): battalion fire support officer, battalion fire control/direction

106

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

officer, or assistant operations officer at battalion or fires brigade/division artillery. Ideally, an officer will serve in a
position through at least two annual training periods.
(2) RC field grade officer standards.
(a) RC major. Majors must have completed common core ILE to be competitive for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
To be best qualified, majors should seek KD duty positions as battalion XO, operations officer, brigade deputy fire
support coordinator, assistant fire support coordinator at various levels (division, Corps, BCD, and so on), or as
assistant brigade level operations officer. Optimally majors should spend 24 to 36 months in one of these positions.
(b) RC lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant Colonels must have completed ILE to be competitive for promotion to colonel.
To be best qualified, lieutenant colonels should seek duty positions as battalion commanders, as various FSCOORDs
support (at the lieutenant colonel level), and as brigade level XOs or operations officers. Optimally, lieutenant colonels
should spend 24 to 36 months in one of these positions.
(c) RC colonel. Colonels serve as brigade level commanders, commanders of battlefield coordination detachments
and in a variety of important staff positions to include the deputy assistant commandant at the Field Artillery School
and in a variety of branch/FA generalist positions at brigade level and above or staff positions at state or national level.
(d) RC selection board. Lieutenant colonels and colonels are selected for SSC by a RC selection board.
(3) Battalion or brigade command. To be ready for Field Artillery battalion or brigade command, RC officers must
meet the appropriate educational requirements for the grade and position. Attendance at the Field Artillery PCC is also
recommended prior to assumption of command.
(4) Continuing development. Officers desiring consideration for key positions in RC artillery units should aggressively pursue positions that develop essential warfighting leader skills. Officers should continue self-development
efforts to become an expert in all aspects of fire support coordination to include Joint and multinational operations.
Self-development should include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training. Officers should
devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their warfighting perspective.
(5) Branch transfers. RC Field Artillery officers may have to branch transfer during the course of their careers due
to lack of positions in their geographic area. When an officer transfers into Field Artillery, completion of either the
Field Artillery BOLC III or the CCC and minimum time in a key position is required before branch qualification is
complete. Commanders will consider the officer’s experience level in recommending which qualification course is
required. Commanders should closely manage branch transfer officers and assign them to a qualifying position
concurrent with enrollment in the Field Artillery BOLC III or the CCC or after completion of the course. Officers
should not normally be assigned to a qualifying position prior to enrolling in or completing Field Artillery BOLC III or
the CCC.
(6) RC guidance. For further guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7 in this pamphlet.

Chapter 13
Air Defense Artillery Branch
13–1. Unique features of the Air Defense Artillery Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Air Defense Artillery (ADA) Branch. ADA organizations provide the Army with an organic
capability to defend against a wide array of hostile aerial and missile threats while ensuring a modular and expeditionary air defense force to meet future Army requirements. Combat-proven ADA weapons platforms (shooters) and early
warning systems (sensors) provide the Army with a technologically advanced, fully digitized capability that enables air
defenders to detect and engage air and missile threats much earlier, at greater distances, and with increased lethality.
ADA organizations are ideally suited for, and frequently support, Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) operations. Employment of ADA forces achieves a strategic, operational, and/or tactical advantage on the
battlefield. In concert with the Army, ADA organizations are rapidly transforming to remain "Relevant and Ready." In
addition to changes to ADA force structure and how to fight (battle command), the introduction of air defense airspace
management (ADAM) cells embedded in brigade combat teams (BCTs) and the establishment of the Ground-Based
Mid-Course Defense (GMD) Brigade not only provide growth, but also add challenging assignment opportunities. For
example, national missile defense and space operations are closely aligned with ADA missions and functions. New
weapon systems (shooters), such as the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), Surface-Launched Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (SLAMRAAM), Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) System,
and Extended Air Defense System (EADS), will likely enter the Army inventory in the near future, as will a host of
early warning/detection devices (sensors) including the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted

108

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Sensor (JLENS), MEADS sensors, Multi-Mission Radar (MMR), Forward-Based X–Band Transportable (FBXT) radar,
and THAAD radar.
b. Unique functions performed by ADA today. ADA unit missions vary based on the following system capabilities:
(1) Avengers are currently assigned to air and missile defense (AMD) units supporting maneuver elements to
provide a gun/missile capability. Integration with infantry, armor, artillery, aviation, and logistics elements are critical
to success on the battlefield.
(2) Sentinel radars and the forward area air defense (FAAD) command, control, communications, computers, and
intelligence (C4I) digital communications architecture provide early warning, detection, and identification of enemy
aircraft, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), remotely-piloted vehicles (RPVs), and cruise missiles.
(3) The Patriot missile system is designed to defeat a wide variety of air and missile threats. Normally found at
corps and echelons above corps, Patriot is capable of countering the growing theater ballistic missile threat. Patriot
units can, and frequently do, operate along Joint and multinational lines.
c. The way ahead. As the Army transforms, many units formerly known as brigades, divisions, and corps will
develop into modular "plug and play" organizations such as Stryker brigade combat teams (SBCTs), BCTs, and combat
aviation brigades. In synchronization with the Army’s transformation, robust ADAM cells will form at each of these
organizations to coordinate and plan for the introduction of air defense forces onto the battlefield. Targeting, airspace
command and control (C2), and early warning are common functions performed by officers assigned to these cells.
Composite ADA battalions consisting of Patriot, Avenger, and Sentinel systems are generally assigned to corps units
and are tasked as required to Army modular organizations. The ADA transformation includes the introduction of a host
of new missile systems (shooters) and early warning systems (sensors). The intent is to make future air defense systems
more lethal, mobile, tailorable, and deployable. Improvements in interoperability with JIIM forces are continuous and
will serve the Army well in all expeditionary endeavors. In summary, the Army’s transformation has expanded the role
of air defenders on the battlefield and has led the way for increased participation in the planning and execution of air
defense operations in Army and JIIM operations.
d. Unique features of work in ADA. The descriptions below provide a general overview of the nature of work
specific to ADA and WOs based on organizational design. The term ADA officer(s) refers to both commissioned and
WOs assigned to branch code 14 or the 140-series MOS. Although the nature of some work is similar at company-level
grades, not all assignment functions and requirements are interchangeable. Specific career path information is provided
throughout this document.
(1) Assignments to modified table of organization and equipment (MTOE) units provide opportunities to C2 and
direct ADA organizations at detachment, platoon, battery, battalion, and brigade levels. Staff assignments are also
characteristic of MTOE assignments. These skills are essential to professional development and expansion of experience in personnel matters (S1), intelligence (S2), training and operations (S3), and supply and logistics (S4).
(2) Assignments in table of distribution and allowances (TDA) organizations provide opportunities similar to those
stated above, but lend themselves more to hands-on equipment training and platform instruction for new recruits and
officers.
(3) Assignments to ADAM cells across the modular force provide opportunities for officers to serve as staff
planners and coordinators for a wide variety of missions at multiple echelons. By design, these organizations can and
will operate along Joint lines and are expeditionary in nature. Additional schooling provided by the U.S. Army Air
Defense Artillery School (USAADASCH) prepares ADA officers to serve in these critical assignments.
e. ADA officer tasks. The following information below provides a broad outline of an ADA officer’s mission
essential task list:
(1) Serve as Soldiers first and maintain the Warrior Ethos.
(2) Integrate (plan and employ) ADA forces into Army or JIIM organizations to defeat third-dimension threats.
(3) Plan Army airspace command and control (A2C2) and targeting as part of an Army or JIIM team.
(4) Provide early warning of air and missile threats to all Army and/or JIIM forces.
(5) Serve as ADA advisors to U.S., allied, and coalition forces.
f. ADA assignment opportunities other than MTOE.
(1) Develop, review, and evaluate doctrine and training for all ADA organizations.
(2) Train, develop, and evaluate ADA skills at combat training centers (CTCs).
(3) Serve in positions requiring specific as well as general technical and tactical skills, such as staff officers in
organizations and activities requiring ADA expertise (includes JIIM and Army Staffs).
(4) Serve as instructors at pre-commissioning programs and Service schools.
(5) Serve as ADA advisors to ARNG andUSAR component organizations.
13–2. Characteristics required of Air Defense Artillery officers
a. Competencies and actions common to ADA officers. ADA officers are—
(1) Premier warfighters who maintain the Warrior Ethos at all times.
(2) Joint and expeditionary minded.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

109

(3) Worldwide deployable, motivated, disciplined, and physically fit.
(4) Grounded in Army core values.
(5) Intellectually capable of understanding and operating the Army’s most technical and sophisticated digitized
equipment.
(6) Guided by the four dimensions of leadership: values, attributes, skills, and actions (for additional discussion of
these leadership dimensions, see FM 6–22).
(7) Leaders who consistently display competencies that enables them to adapt to today’s contemporary operating
environment (peacetime, disaster relief, contingency operations, and war).
b. Unique attributes. All officers must be physically and mentally fit, maintain and display confidence and selfcontrol, remain decisive under pressure, and adhere to published standards and regulations.
c. Unique skills. Competence is—
(1) Technical and tactical. ADA officers must be technically and tactically proficient on a wide variety of missionunique equipment and systems. In the most generic sense, ADA officers must be capable of employing systems in a
tactical environment, training Soldiers and units to perform their wartime missions, and developing plans as part of a
combined arms or Joint team. Repetitive operational assignments and lifelong learning are necessary to maintain the
professional knowledge, judgment, and warfighting expertise needed to accomplish all tasks and functions required
during ADA operations.
(2) Conceptual. ADA officers must possess the ability to perform critical and creative thinking and moral reasoning
while clearly communicating information across a wide spectrum of operations.
d. Unique actions. Leadership is—
(1) Decisionmaking. ADA officers must be capable of rapidly assessing complex situations and making split-second
decisions while operating under stress and in austere field conditions. Sound judgment, logical reasoning, and wise use
of resources are critical to mission success.
(2) Planning and executing. ADA officers must be able to conduct ADA operations with Army and JIIM forces,
meet mission standards, take care of people and resources, and develop detailed and executable plans that are feasible,
acceptable, and suitable.
13–3. Critical Active Army Air Defense Artillery officer developmental assignments
a. Officer qualification and development. See career development model is at figure 13–1, below.
(1) Lieutenant.
(a) After completing ADA Basic officer Leadership Course (BOLC) Phase III (proponent institutional training),
lieutenants are assigned to platoon leader positions in either a pure Patriot, Patriot/Avenger composite, or maneuver
AMD battalion (Avenger). As platoon leaders, these lieutenants will gain valuable experience and training that will be
the "cornerstone" of their career development. Additional developmental duty positions for seasoned platoon leaders
include battery tactical control officer (TCO), executive officer (XO), battalion staff officer, liaison officer (LNO), and
aide-de-camp.
(b) The focus of effort during the lieutenant years is to acquire, reinforce, and hone troop-leading, technical, tactical,
logistics, and administrative skills. Inculcation of the Warrior Ethos and Army core values are essential to the
development of young officers. Prior to promotion to captain, officers must possess an in-depth knowledge of ADA
and combined arms operations gained through experience in MTOE warfighting units. By law, officers must obtain a
baccalaureate degree before promotion to captain. Professional reading and lifelong learning must begin at the grade of
lieutenant.
(2) Captain.
(a) Officers generally attend the Captains’ Career Course (CCC) at their fourth year of Service, which currently
corresponds with promotion to captain. Select ADA officers may have an opportunity to attend the resident phase of
another combat arms branch CCC or the U.S. Marine Corps Expeditionary Warfare School. These schools are
extremely competitive and provide increased benefits to the Army and the officer.
(b) captains must aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience that will prepare them for duties at the
grade of major. The following are considered key developmental (KD) assignments for ADA captains:
1. ADA battery command (exceptions may include command of another combat arms battery or company).
2. HHB commander of an Active Army ADA organization.
3. ADAM cell officer-in-charge (OIC) within a Multifunctional Brigade including Aviation, Fires, and BFSB.
4. Joint Tactical Alerting Ground Station (JTAGS)/FBX–T detachment commander.
(c) Completion of CCC and a minimum of 12 months in one of the above positions will fully qualify captains for
promotion to major. The optimal time line will provide an 18–36 month experience. Battery command is not required
for promotion to major. Officers who serve in Army modular units will not suffer prejudice as a result of not having
commanded at the battery level. Some captains may be assigned to either branch-specific or generalist assignments,
allowing them to develop a wider perspective of the Army or other services. The following are examples of branchspecific/generalist assignments for captains:

110

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

1. CTC observer/controller (O/C).
2. Small group instructor (SGI).
3. GMD brigade staff officer.
4. Battalion or brigade tactical director (TD).
5. Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) staff.
6. Army/Army Command (ACOM)/Army Space (ARSPACE) staff.
7. Other branch developmental positions (for example, AMD doctrine or combat developer in the Directorate of
Combat Developments (DCD); Directorate of Training, Doctrine, and Leader Development (DOTD–LD); or the Army
Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC). (See para 13–2a(2)(e), below.)
U.S. Army Recruiting Command (USAREC) staff/command positions.
9. Active Army/RC positions.
10. ACS (based on Army requirements).
11. ROTC instructor, USMA instructor, or tactical officer.
12. Foreign Service exchange officer or foreign Service school exchange officer.
13. ADA fire coordination officer (ADAFCO).
14. JIIM assignments.
15. Fellowship positions.
16. Aide-de-camp.
(d) Developmental assignments, both branch-specific and generalist, will provide ADA captains with exposure to the
Army and, in some cases, JIIM organizations. The captains must master troop leading skills and fully understand
operations at battery, battalion, and brigade levels. At this stage in their career development, ADA captains must
recognize how the Army functions and fights (for example, how a recruit enters the training base and is inculcated with
Army Values, how training and certification programs are developed, and what organizations are responsible for what
training).
(e) Officers are eligible for FA designation at both their fourth and seventh years of Service. The formal designation
of FAs is based on the needs of the Army, officer preference, military experience, and civilian schooling. Several FAs
provide ACS, which may be granted upon selection to the FA (subject to change). The Army Acquisition Corps will
assess a limited number of ADA officers between the 7th and 8th YOS.
(3) Major.
(a) At the 7th year, an HQDA-level board considers Army requirements and each officer’s skills, experience, and
preferences before assigning each officer to a branch or FA in one of three functional categories. ADA is in the Fires
grouping in the MF&E functional category. Officers selected to remain in the ADA basic branch (functionally
designated) should successfully complete intermediate level education (ILE) to be competitive for promotion to
lieutenant colonel. ILE is critical at this point in an ADA officer’s career. This quality education for all field grade
officers prepares them for success for their next ten years of Service. Upon completion of ILE, ADA majors must
aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience that will prepare them for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
The following are considered key developmental assignments for ADA majors:
1. ADAM cell OIC at SBCT, HBCT, IBCT.
2. Battalion/brigade S3 or XO of an Active Army ADA organization or special troop battalion (the only exceptions
are battalion/brigade S3/XO of another combat arms unit).
3. Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC) Deputy Chief of Operations.
(b) Completion of ILE and a minimum of 12 months in a KD assignment will fully qualify majors for promotion to
lieutenant colonel. The optimal time line provides officers with the opportunity to serve in one or more of the above
listed positions for at least 18–36 months. ADA battalion and brigade S3/XO assignments are not required for
promotion to lieutenant colonel. Officers who serve in Army modular units will not suffer prejudice as a result of not
having served as an XO or S3. Some ADA majors may be assigned to either branch-specific or generalist assignments
allowing them to develop a wider perspective of the Army or other Services.
(c) The following are examples of branch-specific/generalist assignments for majors:
1. CTC senior O/C.
2. USAADASCH/ILE faculty and staff.
3. Brigade/division/corps staff.
4. GMD brigade/ARSPACE/SMDC staff.
5. DOD/JIIM/Army/ACOM staff.
6. Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) positions.
7. Service school instructor.
8. Active Army/RC positions.
9. Other branch or multi-functional positions.
10. Inspector General.

11. ROTC/USMA instructor.
12. DCD/DOTD–LD/ATEC/TRADOC Futures/Army Staff G–8 (Force Development Experiment (FDE)) and
AHRC) positions.
(d) All majors must exercise continuous self-development to fully master all aspects of ADA operations, including
JIIM operations. Self-development may include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training.
Officers must devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their warfighting perspective.
(e) As stated earlier, skills and experience will drive an officer’s career path and future assignments (see fig 13–1,
below).
(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Officers selected for lieutenant colonel must seek assignments of greater responsibility in branch positions. The
objective in lieutenant colonel assignments is to give ADA officers the opportunity to make a greater contribution to
the branch and the Army.
(b) KD assignments for lieutenant colonels include the following:
1. Command Selection List (CSL) battalion-level command.
2. Brigade deputy commander/XO.
3. AAMDC Chief of Operations/Chief of Plans.
4. Divisional ADA officer.
(c) The following are examples of branch-specific/generalist assignments for lieutenant colonels:
1. GMD brigade fire direction center (FDC) director (new position within SMDC’s GMD brigade).
2. SMDC staff.
3. DOD/JIIM/Army/ACOM staff.
4. Service school instructor/staff.
5. Active Army/RC positions.
6. BCTP positions.
7. Proponent deputy directors (DCD, DOTD–LD, ATEC).
8. AHRC staff.
(d) Completion of SSC and a minimum of 12 months in a key developmental assignment will fully qualify
lieutenant colonels for promotion to colonel.
(5) Colonel.
(a) ADA colonels contribute to the branch by serving in key and developmental assignments to include the
following:
1. CSL brigade-level command (for example, ADA brigade, garrison command, recruiting).
2. USAADASCH directors (DCD, DOTD–LD, OCADA, ATEC).
3. Division/installation/AAMDC DCS, G–3/5/7.
(b) The following are examples of branch-specific/generalist assignments for colonels:
1. SMDC/German Air and Missile Defense Force/GMD staff.
2. DOD/Joint/Army/ACOM staff.

140E, currently only approved for GMD positions.
(1) MOS 140A, Command and control systems integrator. ADA WO development and utilization model (Active
Army) for active warrants is at figure 13–2, below, and the ADA WO development and utilization model (RC) for
reserve/ARNG warrants is at figure 13–4.
(a) WO1 and CW2 MOS 140A. A WO is technically qualified in MOS 140A upon successful completion of the
140A, Command and Control Systems Integrator WOBC. All WOs converting from other MOSs/branches must
successfully complete the MOS 140A WOBC prior to being awarded the MOS. MOS 140As supervise and coordinate
operations, data link management, maintenance, and training associated with FAAD C4I systems; Patriot and THAAD
Tactical Control Station with the automated Battery Command Post; Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control
System; SBCTs ADAM Cells; and theater missile warning detachment (formerly the JTAGS. They act as instructors
for Soldiers and officers, teaching the necessary tasks of employing assets and adapting the software that best supports
Army ADA C2doctrine. They analyze and interpret data employed in the communications architecture for a Joint
theater to support immature or sustained operations with the C2 assets on hand and could act as the sector interface
control officer. When necessary, they can serve as the detachment commander for the theater missile warning
detachment. Completion of at least an associate’s degree with a concentration on writing and critical thinking is
strongly recommended prior to promotion board eligibility to CW3. They should also complete the Multi-Tactical
Digital Information Link Joint Interoperability Course and Joint Tactical Information Distribution System Course. If
assigned to the SBCT ADAM cell, in addition to the courses listed above, they should attend the Joint Firepower

113

Course, the Link-16 Planners Course, and the Joint Interface Control officer (JICO) Course. All CW2s must complete
the prerequisite first phase of 131–F41, Action Officer Development Course, and the first phase of the support
operations courses through distance/distributive learning prior to attending the ADA Warrant Officer Advanced Course
(WOAC).
(b) CW3. MOS 140A CW3s should attend ADA WOAC not later than one year after promotion to CW3 and must
have attended WOAC prior to promotion to CW4. They should also attend both the Force Integration and JICO
Courses. Recommend completion of these courses prior to promotion eligibility to CW4. MOS 140A CW3s are
assigned to air defense brigades; ARSPACE company/battalion/brigade headquarters; AAMDC; USAADASCH; and
can serve as the Army track-data coordinators for the regional area air defense coordinator; and the regional interface
control officer. Daily duties include configuration management for the Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control
System (including ancillary equipment). These CW3s advise and coordinate the activities of enhanced operators for the
maintenance of commercial off the shelf and common hardware systems (including ancillary equipment). These WOs
also estimate repair priorities based on fix or fight criteria and availability of required assets, as well as, provide advice
to the commander on system employment option capabilities for Army ADA C2 systems involved with a BCT. These
CWs also serve as data-link managers providing prioritization and standing operating procedures for Joint interoperability. CW3s should complete directed self-development studies and prerequisite distance/distributive learning
modules prior to promotion and prior to attendance of the Warrant officer Senior Course (WOSC) at the 12- to 14-year
mark. Completion of a baccalaureate degree is highly recommended prior to promotion board eligibility.
(c) CW4. MOS 140A CW4s should attend and successfully complete the WOSC not later than one year after
promotion to CW4, but must complete WOSC prior to promotion to CW5, and should also complete the Joint course
on logistics. MOS 140A CW4s are usually assigned to USAADASCH, Joint commands, Army/ACOM staffs,
ARSPACE, or SMDC positions. These CW4s can serve as Army JICOs for the area air defense coordinator or in other
nominative positions Armywide, with duties as instructors or career managers. The CW4 should complete directed selfdevelopment studies prior to attendance to the Warrant officer Senior Staff Course (WOSSC) at the 17- to 20-year
mark. At this juncture, CW4s should begin, continue, or complete graduate-level studies.
(d) CW5. MOS 140A CW5s will attend and successfully complete the WOSSC not later than one year after
promotion to CW5, and should complete the Joint Officers Course. Usual assignments for MOS 140A CW5s are to
USAADASCH as Chief Warrant Officer of the Branch (CWOB), AAMDCs, or in nominative positions Armywide.
These CW5s provide leadership to the branch and act as a subject matter expert (SME) on all matters pertaining to air
defense WOs. Recommend continuation/completion of a graduate degree.
(2) MOS 140E, Air and missile defense systems tactician/technician. ADA WO development and utilization model
(Active Army) for active warrants is at figure 13–2 and the ADA WO development and utilization model (RC) for
reserve/ARNG warrants is at figure 13–4.
(a) WO1 and CW2 MOS 140E. A WO is technically certified in MOS 140E upon successful completion of the
Patriot System WOBC. WOs converting from other MOSs or branches must successfully complete WOBC prior to the
awarding of the 140E MOS. These MOS 140E WOs are normally assigned to battery level positions such as systems
maintenance officers and TCOs, evolving into the continuity for tactical control operations training at the unit level.
They are also the senior maintenance trainers that plan, organize, implement, monitor, evaluate, and supervise
operations and unit maintenance of air defense weapons systems including The Army Maintenance Management
System and prescribed load list. An assignment to these positions allows the WOs to gain leadership experience, and
enhance their technical and tactical competence. All CW2s must complete the prerequisite first phase of 131–F41
(Action officer Development Course) through distance/distributive learning and the first phase of the Support Operations Courses prior to attending the ADA WOAC at the seven- to eight-year marks. Individual proponents administer
their own WOAC. Completion of at least an associate’s degree with a concentration on writing and critical thinking is
highly recommended prior to promotion board eligibility for CW3.
(b) CW3. MOS 140E CW3s should attend and successfully complete the ADA WOAC not later than one year after
promotion to CW3. The WOAC must be completed prior to promotion to CW4. Usual assignments for MOS 140E
CW3s are to battalion-level positions with duty in the S3 section, FDC as TDs, battalion AMD Planner T5, or within
USAADASCH as an instructor, training developer, or writer. As the senior maintenance officer in the battalion, the
CW3 provides leadership, technical guidance, and direction to the commander and subordinate elements. Additionally,
the CW3 evaluates, trains, and validates unit readiness for the commander and provides advice on system capabilities
and limitations. The CW3 should complete directed self-development studies and prerequisite distance/distributive

the branch and are the SME on all matters pertaining to air defense WOs. Recommend continuation/completion of a
graduate degree.

Figure 13–2. ADA Army WO Developmental Model

c. Generalist and multi-functional assignments. These assignments normally apply to the grades of captain through
colonel and are offered to those who possess the skills and experience necessary to successfully enhance the Army’s
mission. Branch generalist positions are available on a limited basis and are filled in accordance with Army priorities.
Assignments to organizations such as ROTC, USMA, and USAREC can provide extremely challenging and rewarding
work for those who desire Service outside of the branch. Multi-functional positions are those positions accessible to
officers beyond a particular branch or FA.
d. Joint assignments. Field grade officers are targeted for Service in JIIM assignments. All officers must fully
understand Joint and multinational/coalition operations, and seek experiences that will enhance learning. They should
also gain understanding of and experience in interagency operations (for example, working with the Department of

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

115

State) and inter-Governmental operations (Federal/state/local). Since ADA officers frequently work along Joint lines,
migration to theater missile defense/JIIM assignments is natural. Attendance to sister Service schools is highly
encouraged and provides invaluable training for ADA officers. Although highly competitive, ADA captains can apply
for selection to the Joint Intern Program. The Joint experience at an early stage in an officer’s career will yield longterm positive benefits.
e. Nominative assignments. ADA officers may be selected for assignments outside of branch-specific duties based
on the needs of the Army. These assignments encompass a wide variety of Service and can be characterized as
positions requiring responsible, mature, exceptionally skilled, well-grounded officers. Generally, these positions are
filled by handpicked officers and may require an extensive interview process. These positions include but are not
limited to special fellowships, senior-level aides, XO positions, and highly visible staff positions.
13–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. The ADA branch provides diverse assignment opportunities that allow for numerous career developmental paths. The branch’s professional development goal is to produce and sustain highly qualified tactically and
operationally oriented officers to lead ADA forces in combat and to accomplish a host of other mission-essential tasks.
b. Precedence. Although there is flexibility, the assignments mostly occur in a logical sequence. Officers seek
training and education assignments to assist in developing the ADA officer knowledge base.
(1) Typically, ADA officers desiring a career focused on "troop leading" may seek assignments along the following
glide path: (as a lieutenant) platoon leader, TCO, battery XO; (as a captain) CCC, battalion staff (S1, S4, assistant S3),
battery command, ADAM cell OIC, battalion/brigade TD, ADA C2 Operations officer, air defense staff officer
assignment, division/corps staff; (as a major) ILE, battalion/brigade XO or S3, ADAM cell OIC staff officer, DOD/
JIIM/Army/ACOM staff, branch or multi-functional assignments; (as a lieutenant colonel) brigade XO/S3, corps ADA
officer; Joint/Army/ACOM staff, lieutenant colonel-level command, senior Service college (SSC); and (as a colonel)
Joint/Army/ACOM staff, brigade-level command.
(2) Typically, ADA officers pursuing a career focused on Joint and space opportunities may seek assignments such
as the following: (as a lieutenant) platoon leader/battery XO; (as a captain) CCC; battalion staff (S1/S4, or assistant
S3); battery command; ACS; SMDC positions; FDE; internships; ADAM cell OIC; battalion/brigade TD; ADA C2
operations officer; (as a major) ADAM cell OIC staff officer; training, doctrine, and combat development staff officers;
ILE; (as a lieutenant colonel) AAMDC staff, GMD brigade or 1st Space Brigade Operations Chief/XO; Joint theater
AMD officer, German Air and Missile Defense Force planner, DOD/JIIM/Army/ACOM staff, command Service
college staff positions; and (as a colonel) Joint theater missile defense officer for an ACOM or ASCC such as U.S.
Army Central, U.S. Army North, U.S. Army Europe, and so on.
(3) Typically, ADA officers aspiring to serve in ADA staff assignments, such as force development, may seek
assignments provided in the following guidelines. To gain the skill set required to serve as the proponent’s DCD
director, upon completion of company grade key developmental assignments, officers may be assigned to DCD,
DOTD- LD, or ATEC. These assignments provide the basic skills and experience required for future Service at DCD.
Additional Service outside the ADA Branch in positions shared with FA 49 (operations research systems analyst) or
FA 59 (strategic plans) strengthen the officer’s skill sets in support of ADA. Assignments with DCD, TRADOC
futures, or FDE following KD assignments will further groom officers for Service as the DCD director.
13–5. Duration of officer assignments
The typical duration of ADA captain and major command and KD assignments is a minimum of 12 months, but
optimally is 18–36 months. Currently lieutenant colonel and colonel battalion and brigade command tours are two
years. Garrison commands are three years, but may be reduced to two years with proper and approved documentation.
Figure 13–1 displays the ADA KD positions and identifies other branch developmental positions for officers.
13–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for ADA branch officers remaining in the MF&E
functional category. This requires optimizing the company and field grade inventory to meet branch authorizations,
providing sufficient flexibility to support branch or multi-functional positions and providing optimal time in key
developmental assignments while stabilizing the force.
b. Transformation. Army transformation has led to an increase in air defense authorizations for captains through
colonels. For more information contact ADA assignments officers at AHRC.
c. Troop leadership. Typically, ADA officers pursuing the Fires track for the purpose of "troop leading" throughout
their career may seek assignments provided in the following guideline: Platoon leader/battery XO, CCC, battalion staff
(S1/S4, or assistant S3), battery command, ADAM/AMD cell OIC/ADA C2 operations officer with BCTs , air defense
staff officer, nominative assignment, division/corps staff, ILE, battalion/brigade XO/S3, battalion command, ACOM/
Joint staff, O/C, instructor, Active Army/RC positions, SSC, TSM, Director DCD, Director DOTD–LD, AMD planner
at staff, brigade commander.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

13–7. Key Active Army officer life cycle initiatives
The following section provides branch life cycle functions and highlights changes associated with implementing force
stabilization and transformation initiatives:
a. Structure. Inactivation of select divisional ADA battalions has forced changes in the manner in which ADA will
fight and support maneuver elements. ADA officers will man robust ADAM cells across the modular force to plan and
support maneuver unit operations. Although ADA divisional battalions are no longer in the division structure, ADA
composite battalions remain at corps and ADA brigade organizations. The Army’s push to modularity will drive
ADA’s future structure. In addition, growth in the branch will occur with the introduction of multiple AAMDCs, RC to
Active Army conversion, and the establishment of the GMD. WOs will have new opportunities to serve in tactical
controller positions normally held by lieutenants and as TDs, positions normally held by captains. This is not a shift in
responsibilities, lieutenant and captain will also continue in these positions. This will enable lieutenants to focus on
honing/developing troop-leading skills while adding continuity and experience to the TCO and TD positions.
b. Acquisition. Officers will continue to be accessed through USMA, ROTC, and the Officer Candidate School
(OCS). Warrants will continue to be recruited from the noncommissioned officer (NCO) Corps. Both officer and WO
accessions are based on preference, qualifications, and needs of the Army. The branch will also remain a donor branch
for detailed officers from other combat support/combat Service support branches.
c. Officer distribution. Officers will be provided assignment opportunities to develop the skills and experience base
necessary for Service at the next higher grade. The sequencing and timing of assignments is driven by Army priorities.
The Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) and Army transformation are currently the driving forces behind the distribution of officers Force stabilization will also continue to influence officer distribution.
d. Deployment. ADA officers are warfighters who must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to warfighter-centric units or training organizations, readiness is imperative to
the success of the mission. ADA officers must prepare themselves and their Families for planned and no-notice
deployments. In today’s fast-paced and uncertain operating environment, Families must be ready for multiple deployments of unknown duration.
e. Sustainment of OPMS.
(1) Promotion. Skills, experience, duty performance, and adherence to branch requirements are all factors that
influence promotion. Promotion rates will be determined by Army needs/Defense Officer Personnel Management Act
goals.
(2) Command. Commands at battalion and brigade level are organized into four functional categories: operations,
strategic support, recruiting and training, and installation. Officers do have the option to compete for selection to the
desired command category and can decline others without prejudice. Officers who are selected for command may
submit operational and personal deferment requests. Since the command CSL process may change, officers should
contact ADA assignments officers at AHRC to receive the latest information. The results of the command selection
process are announced in the CSL. (Note: This subparagraph is not applicable to WOs.)
(3) OER. The OER will reinforce the link between officer development and the OPMS. At the captain level, the
rater together with the senior rater will make a recommendation concerning the officer’s functional category. The WO
evaluation report remains unchanged.
(4) Development. officer development will occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in
tactical, training, and staff assignments. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly perform ADA
mission essential task list-related functions during Joint and combined arms operations. These tasks include, but are not
limited to, development and validation of doctrine, training, and equipment.
(5) Separation. The officer separation process remains unchanged.
13–8. Reserve Component Air Missile Defense officers and warrant officers
a. General career development. The RC career development model for ADA will essentially mirror that of Active
Army officers/WOs, except that assignments will not be limited to one component or control group within a
component. Figures 13–3 (officers) and 13–4 (WOs) delineate the mandatory time line for promotion to the next higher
grade. In certain cases, an RC officer can be promoted to the next higher grade after meeting minimum time in grade
(TIG) requirements. The ADA officer should count on being dual branched to facilitate career progression. In addition,
an ADA officer will most likely be required to branch transfer to another basic branch due to limited geographical and
upward mobility positions; however, these officers should remain proficient.
b. Role. ADA RC officers/WOs serve in most of the same roles and missions as their Active Army counterparts.
The unique nature of the RC Soldier’s role as a citizen Soldier poses a challenge for professional development;
however, RC officers/WOs are expected to follow Active Army development patterns as closely as possible. RC
officers/WOs have increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. To meet professional development objectives, RC officers/WOs must be willing to rotate between ARNG and USAR TPUs, IRRs, the IMA
program, and other Active Army and RC programs. Geographical considerations necessitate these transfers, as well as
the need to provide as many officers/WOs as possible, the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff
positions. Additionally, there may be occasions when RC officers/WOs will be transferred to the Individual Ready

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

117

Reserves while they complete mandatory education requirements. Such transfers will be temporary and should not be
seen as impacting negatively on the officer’s/WO’s career. The success of an RC officer/WO is not measured by the
length of Service in any one component or control group, but by the officer’s/WO’s breadth of experience, duty
performance, and adherence to branch requirements. (Note: Figs 13–1, 13–2, 13–3, and 13–4 illustrate the typical
Active Army and RC officer and WO careers from accession to separation.)
c. WO assignments. WOs, as the branch’s technical experts, are considered certified upon successful completion of
the WOBC and remain so throughout their WO career (140X specialty code denotes a position that can be filled by
either a 140A or 140E, currently only approved for GMD positions).
d. RC officer qualification and development. Career development model is at figure 13–3.
(1) Lieutenant (years one through six). RC officers must complete a minimum of 90 hours of college/university
credits to receive a commission. ADA BOLC III is the starting point for newly accessed RC ADA officers. RC ADA
officers should complete the resident initial leadership instruction by the eighteenth month for ARNG officers (the
second year for USAR officers), or prior to the end of the third year for OCS graduates and direct appointees. Officers
should seek to serve in more than one unit position during this phase, allowing for maximum exposure to the
diversified functions within an ADA unit. Typical ADA lieutenant assignments include TCO, platoon leader, battery
XO, battery maintenance officer, and battalion staff officer. Officers are encouraged to actively participate in professional reading programs and continue correspondence studies. Officers must earn a baccalaureate degree from an
accredited college/university to qualify for promotion to captain.
(2) Captain (years seven through thirteen). ADA officers must complete the resident CCC in the Active Army or
RC curriculum. The RC CCC includes nonresident instruction and one Active Duty for training phase at USAADASCH. During this phase, all officers are highly encouraged to pursue a specialty related undergraduate or graduate
degree. RC ADA officers should aggressively seek opportunities to command an ADA battery for a minimum tour of
two years (optimally three years). RC ADA command opportunities are only available in ARNG units. Typical
assignments for captains include battery command; The Army School System (TASS)/Regional Training Institute (RTI)
tactical officer; battalion, brigade, division, state area command, or USAR Regional Support Command (RSC) staff
officer; battalion liaison officer; CTC O/C; and multi-functional billets. Officers may select a FA designation between
the seventh and 10th YOS. The designation of FAs should be based upon the needs of the Army, geographical
considerations, and officer preference. FA assignments are useful for bypassing temporary roadblocks to career
progression in the ADA branch due to geographical constraints or position availability; however, RC ADA officers
should endeavor to return to an ADA assignment as soon as practicable. A limited number of qualified officers will be
accessed into the Army Acquisition Corps.
(3) Major (years 14 through 21). During this phase, officers should enroll in, and complete common core ILE and
pursue a specialty-related graduate degree. ADA officers should seek further development in ADA assignments during
this phase. Branch standard assignments include (but are not limited to) battalion/brigade/division Continental United
States Army (CONUSA) staff officer, battalion/brigade XO/S3, ADAM cell OIC, CTC O/C, TASS/RTI battalion
tactical officers, and ROTC instructor duty.
(4) Lieutenant colonel (years 21 through 26). During this phase, officers should seek professional military education
at the SSC level. Officers may seek assignments to senior command and staff positions. Additionally, many assignments in both HQDA and Joint staffs are available in the IMA program for RC officers. lieutenant colonels with three
years time in grade must complete ILE to qualify for assignment to any principal staff position at brigade or higher
levels of command. If transferring from another branch and designated to command at the battalion level, RC officers
must have attended a transition course and pre-command course under the auspices of USAADASCH. (Note: Exceptional officers selected to command an ADA battalion (minimum two-year, optimum three-year tour) may also be
selected for resident SSC or the Army War College (AWC) Distance/Distributive Education Course.) Branch standard
assignments include (but are not limited to) battalion commander, TASS/RTI commanders, brigade XO, brigade XO/
S3/operations officer, division staff officer; and CONUSA/JIIM/HQDA-level staff assignment. RC ADA command
opportunities are only available in ARNG units.
(5) Colonel (years 26 through 30). Assignments during this phase should provide for maximum utilization skills in
ADA or FA. Assignment standards include RTI/garrison commander, brigade deputy commander, division/corps staff
officer, and training support/combat division chiefs of staff. Senior staff assignments include (but are not limited to)
positions at National Guard Bureau Headquarters, USAR Command, and on CONUSA/JIIM/HQDA staffs. If transferring from another branch and designated to a colonel-level command, officers must have attended a transition course
and pre-command course (PCC) under the auspices of USAADASCH. (Note: Exceptional officers selected to command
an ADA brigade (minimum two years, optimum three years) may also be selected for resident SSC or the AWC
Distance/Distributive Education Course.)

Chapter 14
Engineer Branch
14–1. Unique features of the Engineer Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Engineer Branch. The Corps of Engineers provides the Army and the nation with officers
trained and experienced in providing essential engineer support in many different forms. Engineer officers perform
missions that span the entire military and civil engineering spectrum while serving our Army and nation in war and
peace. Engineer officers should strive to obtain and excel in professionally balanced assignments; this is the fundamental tenet of successful career progression in the transforming engineer regiment of the 21st Century.
b. Unique functions performed by the Engineer Branch. Engineers provide support to maneuver commanders,
ACOM staffs, installations, and the nation. As combat engineers, they execute mobility, countermobility, survivability,
general engineering and topographic missions, Joint duty, Combatant Command staff positions, and possibly the
emergency management role in support of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under the Civil Works
Program. As construction engineers, they manage and control military construction programs for the Army and other
DOD agencies as well as directing complex water, flood control, and natural resource development and restoration civil
works programs throughout the nation. As a WO they provide the Army the necessary technical and tactical expertise
to plan organize and supervise the maintenance and repair of utilities equipment, maintenance support to medical
hospitals, and the installation of fixed or mobile power plants. They also supervise the interior and exterior repair of
facilities to include carpentry, masonry, plumbing, electrical equipment, and interface between the engineering and
intelligence communities for geospatial engineering issues. They manage geospatial operations and provide geospatial
data production/generation, data management, analysis and geospatial services (topographic survey, hardcopy map
replication and printing, electronic media storage/replication) support to combat and combat support elements at all
echelons.
c. Unique features of work in the Engineer Branch.
(1) The AOC for the Corps of Engineers is 21Z which encompasses—
(a) Providing engineer support on the battlefield as a member of the combined arms team.
(b) Staff positions that do not require another specific AOC.
(c) Planning, executing, and managing construction projects on installations and in the Civil Works Program.
(2) Engineer officers perform many functions that are common throughout the branches, especially as lieutenants
and junior captains. Examples include engineer troop leading and staff positions (for example, platoon leader, company
commander, battalion staff officer, and so on). Additionally, engineers serve as the engineer advisor/staff officer to the
supported command. As officers gain experience and are promoted, they may serve in senior engineer positions as the
primary staff officer for all engineer functions. In addition to the combat engineer command and staff positions, the
United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) districts include engineer positions, which require a unique blend of
tactical and technical proficiency.
(3) Unique features of work in the Engineer WO Program are as follows:
(a) Utilities operation and maintenance technician (210A). The engineer utilities operation and maintenance technician provides assistance and advice to the commander and staff on matters relative to the following functions/tasks:
1. Provide technical, administrative, and budgetary recommendations to the commander regarding the repair and
maintenance of power generation equipment.
2. Coordinate and supervise the organizational maintenance of environmental control units, heaters, water distribution equipment, wheeled vehicles, mobile medical equipment, for Deployable Medical System (DEPMEDS) equipped
hospitals.
3. Coordinate and supervise the operation, repair, and maintenance of station hospital facilities and utilities.
4. Repair, modify, and rehabilitate utility systems and subsystems, facilities, structures, and power plants in station
and mobile hospitals.
5. Coordinate and supervise the repair of water supply systems, plumbing, sewage, and heating and air conditioning
systems.
6. Read and interpret blueprints, engineering drawings, electrical wiring schematics, or diagrams and specifications.
7. Estimate construction material and equipment and personnel requirements for maintenance and repair of facilities,
plants, and utilities.
8. Command and manage separate teams performing theater prime power missions.

6. Serve as the technical advisor to the commander and staff providing guidance and management of geospatial
engineering activities.
7. Manages the geospatial data for the common topographic operational environment (CTOE) for C4I systems.
14–2. Officer characteristics
All officers must be physically and mentally fit, maintain and display self-control, remain calm under pressure, and
adhere to published standards and regulations. The Engineer Branch requires officers who are well grounded in
engineer doctrine; who possess strong Army Values, leader attributes, and leader skills. Additionally, there are branch
unique skills, knowledge, and attributes that require professional development.
a. Competencies and actions common to all. Army officers must be premier warfighters and possess the Warrior
Ethos and must effectively apply the four core dimensions of leadership: values, attributes, skills, and actions. (For
additional discussion of these leadership dimensions, see FM 6–22.) The four core leadership dimensions provide the
basis for what a leader must be, know, and do. The Army Values and attributes set the basis for the character of the
leader - what a leader must be. The Soldier’s Creed and skills developed by leaders establish his or her competence what a leader must know. The actions that leaders conduct and execute constitute leadership - what a leader must do.
The leadership framework describes a leader of character and competence who acts to achieve excellence across the
spectrum of operations from total war, to operations other than war, to disaster relief, and in times of peace.
b. Unique skills. Engineer officers are able to—
(1) Visualize the battlefield and know how to optimize the resources at the commander’s disposal.
(2) Plan and execute engineer missions, both combat and construction, in support of the maneuver commander at all
levels.
c. Unique knowledge. As a branch that is both tactically and technically oriented, USACE officers gain knowledge
through a continuous cycle of education, training, and experience. In general, engineer officers—
(1) Understand tactical decisionmaking and the engineer’s role as a platoon leader, commander, and staff officer in a
combined arms or Joint environment.
(2) Understand terrain analysis and how it can increase the effectiveness of the combined arms team.
(3) Understand the design of and are able to manage large construction projects and facilities in support of the Army
and the nation.
(4) Possess a high degree of technical knowledge of Engineer missions, maintenance and construction operations,
prime power operations, and geospatial information support to missions and operations. They are assessed from
specific engineer enlisted MOSs and bring with them proven learned systems and significant management attributes.
Engineer WOs technical expertise is enhanced through continuous education, training, experience, and self-development.
d. Unique attributes. Engineer officers display the following personal attributes:
(1) Interpersonal competence. Engineer officers must be skilled in building teamwork within their organization and
recognize they often simultaneously belong to many teams. They must possess the ability to express themselves to their
team members clearly, concisely and accurately, both orally and in writing.
(2) Tactical competence. Engineers are part of a combined arms team. Engineer officers must show proficiency in
required professional knowledge, judgment, and warfighting. They must apply their doctrinal knowledge and understanding to the solution of tactical and engineering problems, and formulate and defend solutions to tactical problems
using current Army and Joint doctrine. These skills are gained and developed through repetitive operational assignments, continuous professional study, self-development, and mentoring.
(3) Technical competence. Engineer officers and WOs must understand the capabilities of engineer organizations,
equipment, and systems. Engineer officers must prepare and present clear and informative briefings relating to their
technical areas of expertise to peers, subordinates, and superiors. Additionally, engineer officers are accountable
stewards of people, time and, in many instances, financial resources and the environment.
14–3. Officer developmental assignments
a. Engineer Branch officer development assignments.
(1) General. This paragraph represents a career guide by defining those professional development opportunities
available at each grade, which prepare the engineer officer for further Service at the next higher rank. Engineer officers
122

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

possess the skills, knowledge, experience, and attributes required to perform the basic duties at their current grade and
have the potential for further Service at the next higher rank. This will drive an increased focus on tactical maneuver
support operations for company grade officers, transitioning to a combined and Joint operational focus for field grade
officers whose expertise includes the application of MF&E in the Joint operational battlespace (see career development
model at fig 14–1, below.
(2) Leader development and command preparation. Professional and leader development broadens an officer’s skills
and prepares the engineer officer to lead complex organizations and/or command an engineer platoon, company,
battalion or USACE district, and ultimately a colonel-level engineer group, brigade, or USACE district command.
Command opportunities for the engineer officer cover a wide variety of units. These include heavy mechanized and
light divisional combat engineer units; corps combat engineer and special engineer units such as bridge, port construction and airborne combat engineer organizations; combat heavy and topographic engineer units; brigade troops
battalions; and Engineer Training Center units. Leaders of these organizations must be well-versed in basic Engineer
Branch and combat engineer skills.
(3) Assignments. At the completion of a company grade officer’s assignment, engineer officers will serve in a wide
variety of positions throughout the military, to include branch/combat arms generalist (01A/02A) and FA positions.
Broad experience is important to the development of agile, adaptive, and multi-skilled leaders who collectively embody
knowledge of operations in a JIIM environment. Engineer captains are encouraged to seek assignments in their
preferred area of concentration to prepare for assignments as field grade officers. Assignment considerations (in
priority) are the needs of the Army, required professional development, and officer preference.
(4) Lieutenant.
(a) Education. All Engineer lieutenants must successfully complete the Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC), Phase
III (proponent institutional training). Special training (for example, Sapper Leader, Airborne, Ranger, and so on) to
support an officer’s initial assignment may follow this course. All engineer lieutenants should have a minimum of 90
credit hours towards a bachelor’s degree from an accredited university and, if required, be able to complete a
bachelor’s degree in a year or less. Officers should devote time to a career long professional reading program to
broaden their professional perspective.
(b) Leader development and command preparation. The focus of effort during the lieutenant years is to acquire,
reinforce, and hone troop leading, technical, tactical, logistics, and administrative skills. Inculcation of the Warrior
Ethos and Army core values is essential in the development of young officers. Prior to promotion to captain, officers
must possess an in-depth knowledge of and combined arms operations gained through on the job training. By law,
officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree before promotion to captain. The goal of Service beginning as a lieutenant
is to lead and train Soldiers to be able to win in combat. To properly prepare for future assignments, lieutenants should
seek positions where they are responsible for leading Soldiers and should focus on acquiring and refining troop leading
and Engineer Branch-specific skills. Lieutenants should gain a thorough knowledge of platoon-level operations and
combined arms principles, coordination, logistical operations, and company administration
(c) Assignments. Engineer lieutenants will serve in company level positions to gain leadership experience, enhance
technical and tactical competence, and, when appropriate, complement this Service with staff experience at the
battalion level. Typical duty positions include engineer platoon leader, company XO or training officer in training
center units, and battalion staff officer.
(5) Captain.
(a) Military education. Engineer captains will attend the engineer CCC, at about the 4th YOS, which currently
corresponds with promotion to captain. Attendance at the CCC will be either PCS or PCS and return as fits the needs
of the Army and follow-on assignment. This will prepare the officer for company-level command and duties at
battalion or higher levels. Some engineer officers may attend another branch’s CCC. The credit earned from attendance
at another branch’s course is the same as having attended the engineer course. Special training (for example, Sapper
Leader Course, Airborne, Ranger, and so on) to support an officer’s next assignment, may follow the completion of the
CCC. Captains must aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience that will qualify them for promotion to
major. The following are considered desired branch experience for engineer captains:
1. Company command.
2. Commander of a captain-coded detachment command.
(b) Civil education. All officers are required to obtain a baccalaureate degree from an accredited educational
institution prior to being promoted above the grade of first lieutenant and attending the CCC, in accordance with 10
USC 12205. The Army has many programs that provide officers the opportunity to earn baccalaureate and advanced
degrees fully-funded, full-time, or off duty. The ACS is a fully-funded program that supports advanced degree
requirements for certain branches and FAs. Many universities award constructive credits for military courses, which
can facilitate earning an advance degree at an accelerated pace. Additionally, an officer can obtain an advanced degree
at his/her own expense off duty. A full explanation and eligibility requirements for these programs are contained in AR
621–1.
(c) Leader development and command preparation. Captains should prepare for and seek company-level or certain

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

123

types of detachment commands. Engineer officers who successfully serve with troops as lieutenants and have completed the CCC are basically considered ready for assignments as company or certain types of detachment commanders. The goal is to allow engineer officers to serve in company command 18 ± 6 months for continued professional
development and to enhance unit cohesion. Typically, engineer officers will have the opportunity to serve in an
Engineer position on a battalion or brigade staff to further prepare for command. Officers should possess a thorough
knowledge of company-level operations and thorough knowledge of combined arms principles, coordination, logistical
operations, and battalion administrative requirements.
1. Following company command, captains can expect to serve in a wide variety of assignments, consistent with the
needs of the Army. These include: O/C at one of the CTCs; small group instructor at one of the TRADOC schools;
Active Army/ RC positions; project officer in a USACE district; FA positions; branch generalist assignments (for
example, ROTC instructor, USAREC, and so on); other nominative assignments (for example, allied Service school
exchange officer, and so on); or ACS (based on FA or overall Army requirements). Captains are encouraged to seek
those assignments, which best meet, their personal and professional desires for future Service as field grade officers.
Specific training tailored to many of these assignments is available via distance learning and resident experiential
training at the Engineer School.
2. Developmental assignments, both branch-specific and generalist will provide captains with exposure to the Army,
and in some cases, JIIM environments.
3. The Army Acquisition Corps will assess a limited number of engineer officers between their 7th and 8th YOS.
4. A limited number of officers may choose to opt-in to a Functional Designation Board (FDB) after 3 YOS. The 4
year FDB selects a limited number of captains to fill requirements at the grade of captain in select FAs. This board is
not mandatory and officers must choose to compete. FAs open each year are based on the needs of the Army.
5. All engineer officers will undergo a FDB at the 7th YOS. The formal designation of FAs or branch is based upon
the needs of the Army, officer preference, military experience and, in some cases, ACS. Some FAs have extensive
educational requirements. Officers will be designated into a branch or FA in one of the three functional categories:
MF&E (with the Engineer Branch in the maneuver support grouping), operational support, or force sustainment. After
functional designation, officers will serve and compete for promotion only in their functional category and will be
managed by their branch or FA assignment officers at OPMD. Engineer officers who are designated into the Engineer
Branch in the MF&E functional category should seek assignments in the engineer regiment to increase diversity and
gain a greater understanding of the entire spectrum of the Engineer Branch.
(6) Major. Officers retained in the Engineer Branch will attend the resident Intermediate Level Education (ILE)
Course. Upon completion of ILE majors must aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience that will
prepare them for duties as a lieutenant colonel.
(a) Education. All majors should complete ILE schooling prior to promotion to lieutenant colonel. All Engineer
majors should continue self-development efforts to become experts in all aspects of engineering to include Joint and
multinational operations. Self-development should include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional
training.
1. Completion of ILE and serving successfully in positions of responsibility in branch positions will prepare officers
for lieutenant colonel. The optimum time for an engineer officer to attend is their last year in the rank of captain or the
first year as a major. This will facilitate their follow-on assignment to a professionally-developing job as well as a
possible appointment to a 3-year life cycled unit, which maximizes their branch developmental potential.
2. Current challenges with operational requirements and school scheduling will require a limited number of officers
to complete ILE after their Engineer Branch developmental assignment.
a. Assignments. Engineer majors in MF&E can expect to serve in engineer and/or branch generalist positions.
Engineer positions include assignment to Army/ACOM/Joint staff, O/C or Active Army/RC. Branch generalist assignments can include Army or Joint staff, Active Army/RC, ROTC, USMA faculty and staff, USAREC, or Inspector
General billets. The officer must maximize his/her skills and experience in order to be placed in the right assignment
and could be returned to the same duty location to enhance cohesion and stability.
b. Professional developmental positions. Positions identified as essential for engineer majors to ensure required
professional development in MF&E is attained prior to consideration for promotion include the following:
3. Positions coded for engineer majors in a BCTs which include brigade engineer (BCT); brigade engineer planner;
TAC CP engineer; and division engineer plans.
4. Positions in engineer battalions and brigades coded for engineer majors. Brigade S3; battalion XO; geospatial
planning cell operations officer; and battalion S3.
5. Positions in separate brigades or units coded for engineer majors such as special forces group engineer; ranger
regiment engineer; cavalry regimental engineer; and SBCT engineer.
6. Battalion S3 or battalion XO in units coded branch generalist (such as the BTB or STB)
7. The number of positions available for officers to serve in a MTOE unit enables a greater number of engineer
officers to serve in positions with operational experience. While the seven deputy district engineer positions in USACE
are challenging, rewarding, and excellent developmental positions for future USACE commanders, these TDA positions should be filled by officers who have successfully served in one of the positions listed above.

124

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(b) JIIM experience. The goal of the branch is to develop an inventory of field grade officers who embody a
collective knowledge of JIIM experience. While not every officer will receive an assignment in a qualifying Joint
assignment or serve a fellowship in a JIIM agency, the goal is to provide the maximum opportunity for engineer majors
to receive JIIM experience. However, this will be dependent on Army demands and position/fellowship availability. A
limited number of Engineer field grade officers may be assigned to positions currently coded as FA positions. FA
number of FA field grade positions will be coded as open to assignment by non-FA officers. The goal is to expand
position access, especially for JIIM positions.
(c) Self-development. Majors must exercise continuous self-development to fully master all aspects of operations
including Joint and multinational operations. Self-development may include correspondence courses, civilian education,
and institutional training. Officers must devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their warfighting
perspective. As stated earlier, skills and experience will drive an officer’s career path and future assignments (see fig
14–1).
(7) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Education. Officers should continue their self-development in all facets of combat, construction, geospatial, and
facilities engineering particularly in Joint and multinational operations. If selected by a HQDA board, engineer
lieutenant colonels should complete resident Senior Service College (SSC) instruction or the nonresident AWC
Distance Education Course.
(b) Leader development and command preparation. Leader development for lieutenant colonels is accomplished
through the assignment process and self-development. Engineer lieutenant colonels should continue to pursue opportunities for self-development through professional, technical leadership programs. Selection for lieutenant colonel level
command is extremely competitive. All Engineer promotable majors and lieutenant colonels are eligible to compete for
lieutenant colonel level command during the Command Selection Board. Selection is based primarily on the officer’s
experience, qualifications, and overall performance. A centralized selection board will select officers in a given
category based on HQDA guidance. AHRC will slate officers to specific units within the categories. Officers being
considered for command are allowed to select the categories in which they desire to compete. The HQDA CSL
designates commands into four functional categories:
1. Operations. This includes TOE engineer battalions throughout the Army as well as brigade troops battalions
within transformed BCTs. The majority of engineer lieutenant colonel commands are in this category.
2. Strategic support. Lieutenant colonel USACE engineer districts are in this category.
3. Recruiting & training. TRADOC engineer battalions are in this category as well as USAREC battalion command.
4. Installation. Garrison commands are in this category. Engineer officers compete with all officers considered in
this category.
(c) Assignments. Officers selected for lieutenant colonel must seek assignments of greater responsibility in the
branch and serve in branch generalist positions throughout the Army. The objective of lieutenant colonel assignments is
for officers to continue to provide a valuable contribution to the branch, Army, and our nation based on their unique
experiences and qualifications. Officers desiring to contribute in the tactical arena should focus on positions such as
brigade executive officers, CTC trainers, brigade troops battalions in the BCTs and staff officers at corps/division/
ACOM level and on the Army/DOD/Joint staffs. Likewise, those officers desiring to contribute in the facilities/
construction management arena should focus on positions as deputy district commander, deputy director of civil works
or military programs at HQ USACE, or as a primary staff engineer on the ACOM/HQDA/Joint staff. Officers with
geospatial engineering training or experience are encouraged to serve as the Commander of a Geospatial Planning Cell
at Theater Army level. Although not designated as a CSL command, this is considered a critical assignment.
Additionally, officers will have the opportunity to continue to contribute by serving in any of a myriad of key branch
generalist positions at Service schools, as ROTC professors of military science, in Active Army/RC support positions,
and at senior level staff engineer positions throughout the Army and DOD. Completion of a 2-year assignment in a
specific assignment is preferred.
(d) JIIM experience. The goal of the branch is to develop an inventory of field grade officers who embody a
collective knowledge of JIIM experience. While not every officer will receive an assignment in a qualifying Joint
assignment or serve a fellowship in a JIIM agency, the goal is to provide the maximum opportunity for engineer
lieutenant colonels to receive JIIM experience. However, this will be dependent on Army demands and position/
fellowship availability.
(e) FA. A limited number of engineer field grade officers may be assigned to positions currently coded as FA
positions. A number of FA field grade positions will be coded as open to assignment by non-FA officers. The goal is to
expand position access, especially for JIIM positions.
(8) Colonel. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is sustainment of warfighting, training, and staff skill, along with utilization of leadership, managerial and executive talents. The majority of
strategic level leaders in the army are colonels. Colonels are expected to be multi-skilled leaders; strategic and creative
thinkers; builders of leaders and teams; competent full spectrum warfighters; skilled in governance, statesmanship, and
diplomacy; and understand cultural context and work effectively across it.
(a) Education. Officers should complete SSC, either resident or nonresident.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

125

(b) Leader development and command preparation. Selection for colonel level command is extremely competitive.
Engineer promotable lieutenant colonels and colonels with less than 27 years of active Federal commissioned Service
are eligible to compete for colonel-level command during the Command Selection Board. The HQDA CSL designates
commands into four functional categories: operations, strategic support, recruiting & training and installation. Selection
is based primarily on the officer’s experience, qualifications, and overall performance. Officers being considered for
command are allowed to select to compete or decline consideration in each category. Officers should continue to
pursue self-development through professional, technical, managerial and leadership programs, and assignment
opportunities.
(c) Assignments. Engineer colonels are assigned by the Army’s Senior Leader Development Office. The engineer
colonel is the architect of the future. Engineer colonels contribute to the branch by serving in critical assignments to
include the following: Directors at the Engineer School or USACE, and executive level positions on corps, division,
ACOM, Joint, DOD, and Army staffs. Engineer colonels can also expect to serve in key branch or branch generalist
positions throughout the Army. The range of possible assignments is vast.
1. Branch generalist assignments. Engineer colonels can expect to serve in branch generalist assignments, such as
inspector generals and instructors that may or may not be directly related to the Engineer Branch, but are important to
the Army.
2. JIIM assignments. Engineer officers are considered for Joint duty assignments worldwide. JIIM experience is
important to the Army and is essential to officers for advancement to senior leadership positions.
3. Other assignments. Engineer officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those discussed
previously. These assignments include the White House Fellow Program and duty with the National Security Council
or the United Nations, as well as Engineer Branch representatives at allied Service schools. The spectrum of possible
assignments is broad and is characterized as highly responsible, important and requiring mature, skilled, and wellrounded officers.

Figure 14–1. Engineer Branch Active Army Developmental Model

b. WO MOS qualifications, professional development, and assignments.
(1) MOS qualifications and development. Engineer WOs are considered certified upon completion of their technical
certification course, WOBC, and their developmental assignments. WOs will spend the majority of their junior WO
career, serving in TOE operational assignments. Senior WOs can expect to alternate assignments between TOE and
TDA based on the needs of the Army.
(a) A utilities operation and maintenance technician junior WO’s first assignments will likely be in key development
positions at TOE, construction units, and survey and design teams. Developing a strong technical understanding of the
engineer’s capabilities in support of the force is essential in becoming a subject matter expert. The expectation is that
these junior WOs will occasionally serve as leaders and continually develop their skills prior to assignments at
ACOMs. Advanced WOs should be utilized as prime power systems technicians or engineer utilities maintenance
technicians assigned to hospitals. Senior WOs should be utilized as brigade engineer technicians, Service school
instructors, training developers, combat developers for systems, and engineer branch assignment officers. CW5s should
be utilized as the chief warrant of the branch, personnel proponency WO, and engineer maintenance control officer.
Figure 14–2, below, provides a chart of the TOE/TDA positions.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Figure 14–2. 210A Developmental Model

(b) A geospatial information technician junior WO’s first assignment will likely be in KD positions at division/corps
(including BCTs) level terrain teams and topographic engineer companies. Developing a solid technical understanding
of engineer capabilities and MDMP to provide geospatial information and accurate analysis of the terrain in support of
the force is essential in becoming an SME. The expectation again is that these junior warrants will serve as leaders and
continually develop their skills prior to assignments at higher echelons and ACOMs. Senior WOs should be utilized at
corps topographic companies, battalions, echelons above corps units, and proponent Service schools. Figure 14–3,
below, provides a chart of the TOE/TDA positions.

14–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Engineer Branch officer.
(1) Preference. Engineer Branch has diverse assignment opportunities. Officers should submit preferences that
enable them to achieve their career goals. Officer assignments will be influenced by Army requirements, professional
development and officer preference (for example, Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP), Joint domicile, and
so on).
(2) Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, but there is flexibility on
the sequence of assignments. Typically, Engineer officers should seek assignments in the following order:
(a) Engineer BOLC.
(b) Platoon leader.
(c) Company XO or training officer in training units.
(d) Battalion staff.
(e) CCC.
(f) Company command.
(g) Nominative assignment/USACE, (ILE).
(h) Brigade or division staff.
(i) Battalion level command.
(j) SSC.
(k) Brigade level command.
b. Engineer Branch WO.
(1) Preference. Engineer WOs should seek progressive assignments at all echelons of command within their
respective CF. The professional development goal is to produce and sustain highly qualified technically and functionally proficient WOs.
(2) Precedence. Junior engineer WOs should be initially assigned to a minimum of 24 to 36 months in junior
positions as annotated in figures 14–2 and 14–3. The WO should progress through a series of engineering support
missions to gain experience at those levels. Senior WOs should be assigned at higher levels (battalion, brigade,
division, and echelons above corps) to mentor the junior warrants below them. The intent is for all WOs to gain
experience at the lower level prior to assuming the higher position.
14–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
Key engineer positions. Engineer captains serve as company commanders for a minimum of 12 months, while the goal
is to allow them to serve 18 ± 6 months for continued professional development and to enhance unit cohesion
lieutenant colonels and colonels will serve two years in battalions and brigades. Colonel level district commands have a
36-month length tour unless DOD directive limit the duration as on the Korean Peninsula. Officers selected for garrison
command may have command tours extended up to three years.
a. Engineer Branch life cycle. Figure 14–1 depicts the Engineer Branch time line with positions and developmental
assignments.
b. Engineer WO life cycle. Figures 14–2 and 14–3, displays the engineer WO life cycle model with KD positions
that will provide leadership opportunities and development of technical competency of each MOS.
14–6. Key Active Army officer life cycle initiatives
The following section provides branch life cycle function and highlights changes associated with implementing force
stabilization initiatives and transformation.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

131

a. Structure. There will be changes to the authorizations of engineer units based on the restructuring and re-coding
initiatives associated with the implementation of OPMS and force stabilization. Other minor changes are possible due
to the iterative nature of the restructuring and re-coding process.
b. Acquire. Officers will continue to be accessed through USMA, ROTC, and the Officer Candidate School.
Warrants will continue to be recruited from the NCO Corps. Both officer and WO accessions are based on preference,
qualifications and needs of the Army. Because of the lack of branch specific civil schooling and opportunities for
relevant experience, there will be few opportunities for direct commissioning into the Engineer Branch.
c. Distribute. Officers will be provided assignment opportunities to develop the skills and experience base necessary
for Service at the next higher grade. The sequencing and timing of assignments is driven by Army priorities. The
GWOT and Army transformation are currently the driving forces behind the distribution of officers. Force stabilization
will also continue to influence officer distribution. Under force stabilization, tour lengths of assignments will be longer,
and officers will have more time to gain the requisite skills in their branch and their branch generalist assignments.
Engineer Branch officers designated in another branch or FA will no longer serve in Engineer Branch billets.
(1) Stabilized installation assignments. Officers assigned to stabilized installations will be initial entry officers from
BOLC. A limited number of these officers may be assigned to an installation for approximately 7 years. During this
time, the officer will complete their platoon leader and lieutenant years. They will then proceed to the CCC and may
return to the same installation to complete company command. The officers will gain tactical and operational
experience that will benefit them and the Army in their development in future positions.
(2) Life cycle units. Officers at all levels may be assigned to life cycled units (generally the SBCTs and BCTs) and
will remain in the unit for a minimum of 3 years.
(3) Cyclic units. The majority of the installations and EAD combat and combat support engineer units will be
managed on a cyclic manning system. Replacements will be sent to these units and installations periodically to
maintain readiness of the units. Tour lengths and developmental positions opportunities can vary.
d. Deploy. Officers are warfighters who must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at
all times. Whether assigned to warfighter centric units or training organizations, readiness is imperative to success of
the mission. Officers must prepare themselves and their Families for planned and no notice deployments. In today’s
fast-paced and uncertain operating environment, Families must be ready for multiple deployments of unknown
duration. Engineer Branch officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA
organizations, all engineer officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict.
Engineer officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests;
or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping
missions. Engineer Branch officers must prepare themselves and their Families for this most challenging life cycle
function.
e. Sustain. OPMS changes the manner of execution of four major actions that affect officer career development.
(1) Functional designation. Officers will be designated into one of three functional categories at the 7th YOS;
MF&E, operational support, or force sustainment.
(2) Promotion. Skills and experience, duty performance, and adherence to branch requirements are all factors that
influence promotion. Promotion rates will be determined by Army needs/DOPMA goals.
(3) Command. Commands at battalion and brigade level are organized into four categories; operations, strategic
support, recruiting and training, and installation. Officers do have the option to compete for selection to the desired
command category and can decline others without prejudice. Officers who are selected for command no longer have
the option to decline without prejudice 30 days after the publication of board results. Since the CSL process continues
to change, officers should contact branch to receive the latest information. The results of the command selection
process are announced in the CSL. (Note: This subpara is not applicable to WOs.)
(4) OER. The OER will reinforce the link between officer development and OPMS. At captain, the immediate rater
and senior rater will make a recommendation concerning the officer’s functional designation. The warrant evaluation
report remains unchanged.
(5) Development. Officer development will occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in
tactical, training, and staff assignments. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly perform METL
related function during Joint and combined arms operations. These tasks include, but are not limited to development
and validation of doctrine, training, and equipment.
(6) Separation. The officer separation process for Engineer officers remains unchanged. The most current separation
information can be found on the AHRC Web page at: https://www.perscomonline.army.mil/tagd/retire/retire.htm.
14–7. Engineer Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. The Engineer RC officer plays an important role in the USACE and the Engineer
Regiment at large. The wartime effectiveness of the engineers is dependent upon the quality of the engineer officers in
USAR and ARNG units, as well as the IRR. Additionally, the quantity and quality of training that RC engineer officers
receive prior to mobilization dictates to a large extent their wartime effectiveness. RC engineer officer development

132

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

objectives and qualifications basically parallel those planned for their Active Army counterparts. Junior officers must
develop a strong foundation through assignments in their branch before specialization begins. RC life cycle development model for engineer officers shown at figure 14–4, below.
(1) Even though RC engineer officers and WOs are limited by geographical considerations, they should strive for
engineer assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as their Active Army counterparts. RC career
progression is often constrained by the geographic dispersion of units. There may not be sufficient positions in a
geographic area to continue in engineer assignments. Therefore, planned rotation into progressively challenging
engineer positions by RC commands is essential to producing the best-qualified Engineer officer. To meet professional
development objectives in the USAR, Engineer officers must be willing to rotate between TPUs, the IRR, and the
IMA, Joint Reserve Unit (JRU), IRR–Augmentee (IRR–A), and Active Guard Reserve (AGR) programs. ARNG
engineer officers should contact their state personnel officer to ensure they can meet their professional development
objectives. These transfers are necessitated by geographical considerations, as well as the need to provide as many
officers as possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions, or to complete professional
military education (PME) requirements. Transfers within a component will normally be temporary, and should not be
seen as impacting negatively on an officer’s career. The success of an RC engineer officer is not measured by length of
Service in any one component or control group, but by the officer’s breadth of experience, duty performance, and
adherence to branch requirements. Officers may elect to apply for a FA beginning at the rank of captain. For additional
guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7.
(2) Engineer officers and WOs in the IRR may find assignments in reinforcement units (RTU); IMA positions in
Active Army organizations, installations or HQDA agencies; and tours of Active Duty for special work (ADSW),
annual training (AT) or temporary tour on Active Duty (TTAD). Assignment in the IRR can also be used for
completing PME requirements.
(3) Typical assignments could include—
(a) Engineer TPUs or engineer positions in other than engineer units.
(b) IMA program which provides officers the opportunity to train in the positions they will occupy upon
mobilization.
(c) Counterpart Training Program.
(d) Positions in JRUs.
(e) IRR–A program.
(f) AGR tours where officers serve full-time in support of either the USAR or ARNG. They receive the same
benefits as Active Army officers, including the opportunity for retirement after 20 years of active Federal Service.
b. Life cycle development model. Professional development requirements are normally satisfied by attendance at
military schools combined with planned, progressive assignments in engineer units or positions. To be considered a
branch qualified engineer officer at each grade, the length of Service in a given position is not the focus; the key is
assignment diversity and sufficient time served during each assignment to develop branch competence. The following
standards should be met:
(1) RC development.
(a) Lieutenant.
1. Successfully complete engineer BOLC by the end of the second year (USAR) or 18 months (ARNG) of
commissioned Service.
2. Obtain a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university. This is required for promotion to captain.
3. Serve in leadership and other Engineer assignments, such as staff positions at company and battalion level, for a
minimum of 18–24 months.
4. Actively participate in professional reading programs and continued corresponding studies.
(b) Captain.
1. Successfully complete CCC.
2. Serve in at least one Engineer staff position for a minimum of 24 months.
3. Successfully command a company (highly desirable, but not mandatory).
4. Captains should continue to broaden their understanding of warfighting through CONUS and OCONUS exercises,
enrollment in correspondence courses, and other independent study.
5. Currently, RC officers also attend the Combined Armed Services Staff School (CAS3) through a combination of
advanced distributed learning and a two-week residency piece at Fort Leavenworth, KS. The transformation of CAS3 is
now implemented in TASS battalions as the combined arms exercise (CAX). CAX is now the educational requirement
before entering into the ILE.
(c) Major.
1. Successfully complete at least 50 percent of ILE.
2. Serve a minimum of 24 months in at least one engineer staff position.
3. Even though not a requirement for promotion to lieutenant colonel, officers are encouraged to obtain a master’s
degree from an accredited college or university.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

133

(d) Lieutenant colonel.
1. Successfully complete ILE within three years after promotion to lieutenant colonel.
2. Serve a minimum of 24 months in at least one engineer staff position.
3. Be selected to attend resident or nonresident SSC (highly desirable, but not mandatory).
4. Successfully commands a battalion (highly desirable, but not mandatory).
(e) Colonel. Serve in at least one engineer staff officer position for a minimum of 12 months.

Figure 14–4. Engineer Branch RC Developmental Model

(2) RC Warrant officer MOS qualification and development.
(a) MOS qualification.
1. Basic level qualifications. Warrants, as the branch technical experts, are considered certified upon completion of
the Warrant officer Basic Course (WOBC), and remain so throughout their WO career.
2. Professional development. Focus on acquiring and refining the technical knowledge and experience in effective
management principles in support of the USACE. Completion of an associate’s degree in a discipline related to the
engineer WO’s MOS is a recommended goal.
(b) Qualification and assignment. Qualifications and assignments are similar to the Active Duty WO. See the life
cycle chart for time lines of progression for the RC WO (figs 14–2 and 14–3).

Chapter 15
Chemical Branch
15–1. Unique features of the Chemical Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Chemical Branch. The Chemical Branch is a combat support branch aligned under the
MF&E functional category and is focused primarily on warfighting operations and training that supports all aspects of
combating weapons of mass destruction (WMD): nonproliferation, counter proliferation, and consequence management.
The Chemical Corps is focused on operations and training in support of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear
(CBRN) defense; obscurants, and flame employment; CBRN vulnerability assessment; biological and chemical arms
control verification; smoke and flame munitions technology and management; chemical weapons storage and
demilitarization; WMD force protection programs; CBRN foreign and domestic consequence management; and CBRN
military support to civil authorities. Additional functions include scientific, developmental, and material management
activities for these programs. The branch provides the Army with a highly trained corps of CBRN experts to advise
commanders and staffs at all levels in the DOD. Officers assigned to the Chemical Branch carry branch code 74.
b. Unique functions performed by the Chemical Branch. CBRN officers plan, employ, and coordinate CBRN
defense systems from platoon level through corps and Joint task forces in support of Joint and combined arms
operations. These systems include CBRN agent reconnaissance systems, biological agent detection systems, smoke and
obscurants systems, flame weapons, thermobaric devices and munitions, CBRN decontamination systems, and other
CBRN hazard detection and warning systems. CBRN officers coordinate assets and efforts for WMD force protection
programs, consequence management, and CBRN military support to civil authorities. Officers also conduct technical
escort, CBRN hazard characterization, monitoring, disablement, and elimination support operations; provide WMD and
CBRN incident emergency response; contingency support operations to combatant commanders and lead Federal
agencies; and provide site remediation and restoration support operations for DOD.
c. Unique features of work in the Chemical Branch. CBRN officers work at all levels of command to advise and
provide protection from the full range of toxic hazards. CBRN officers are generally the sole subject matter experts on
CBRN defense operations within their organization. CBRN Soldiers and units are recognized for their unique mission
capabilities that include expertise in: CBRN vulnerability analysis; multi-spectral obscuration; sensitive site exploitation; CBRN reconnaissance; CBRN decontamination; WMD force protection; and combating WMD, which includes
nonproliferation, counter proliferation, and consequence management. These traits make CBRN units invaluable in
supporting both foreign and domestic contingency operations. Additionally, CBRN officers perform the following
functions and tasks:
(1) Command and lead CBRN defense and obscuration units from platoon to brigade, to include the Special Forces
Chemical Reconnaissance Detachments (CRDs).
(2) Command chemical weapons storage and demilitarization activities/installations and ammunition manufacturing
and storage activities/installations.
(3) Command and supervise environmental activities.
(4) Serve as CBRN staff officers in tactical through strategic national level organizations including Army staffs from
battalion through Army level and in OSD, Joint, other Federal departments, and combatant command staffs. As staff
officers, CBRN officers will conduct CBRN vulnerability assessments; plan, conduct, and supervise CBRN defense
training and operations; evaluate CBRN technical and tactical intelligence data; develop plans for employing and
conducting obscurant operations, flame field expedient and thermobaric operations; plan CBRN reconnaissance,
detection, and decontamination operations, and plan and coordinate WMD elimination/sensitive site exploitation
operations.
(5) Develop requirements, organizational structure, doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures for CBRN, obscuration, flame, and thermobaric capabilities.
(6) Serve as CBRN advisors to USAR and ARNG organizations.
(7) Support WMD force protection and CBRN military support to civil authorities. Advise civil, Federal, state, and
international agencies in WMD force protection and response to incidents involving CBRN materials.
15–2. Officer characteristics required
a. The Chemical Branch requires officers skilled in leadership at all levels, who emulate the Warrior Ethos, possess
strong Army Values; are technically and tactically proficient in CBRN operational tactics, techniques, and procedures;
and are educated in the CBRN sciences and technologies required for the 21st Century. They must be dynamic,
competent warfighters who can effectively apply the character attributes and core leader competencies required of
contemporary leaders. (For additional discussion of these attributes and competencies, see FM 6–22.) The core leader
competencies emphasize the role, functions, and activities of what leaders do. The values and attributes set the basis for
the character of the leader - what a leader must be. The skills developed and knowledge gained by leaders establishes
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

135

his or her competence - what a leader must know. Leaders are not effective until they apply this knowledge; the actions
that leaders conduct and execute constitute leadership - what a leader must do. The leadership framework describes a
leader of character and competence who acts to achieve excellence across the range of military operations. One who
personifies the Warrior Ethos in all aspects, from warfighting to statesmanship to business management as a way of
life.
b. Unique skills are as follows:
(1) Decisionmaking skills. CBRN officers often work in an environment where time available for problem analysis
is limited but where sound and timely decisions are urgent. Information gained in this environment will vary in its
completeness and ambiguity. An ability to operate under stress, make decisions, and act under a variety of conditions is
critical to success.
(2) Tactical and technical skills. CBRN officers must be technically proficient with branch and mission-unique
equipment, tools, and systems. CBRN mission success requires the proper balance between technical skills and the
ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactical skills at the right moment. These skills must be gained and
developed through repetitive operational and institutional assignments and continuous professional study and selfdevelopment. CBRN officers must not only know their own unique branch skills, tactics, techniques, procedures, and
specialized equipment; but they must also know the uniqueness of the units to which they are assigned or are
supporting.
c. Unique knowledge is as follows:
(1) Officers must possess expert knowledge of Chemical Branch requirements, combined arms, CBRN unit support,
and coordination principles. This knowledge includes practical experience in tactics, combined arms operations, and the
employment of all assets available to the Chemical Branch, as well as general knowledge of JIIM operations and how
the Chemical Corps supports each of them. Officers gain this knowledge through a logical sequence of continuous
education, training, and experience sustained through mentoring. Individual officers sustain knowledge through institutional training and education, experience gained in operational assignments, and continuous self-development.
(2) Serving as staff and faculty at the Chemical School allows officers with recent troop and CBRN staff assignments to share their field experience with the school and students. In turn, officers from the school return to the field
with an updated knowledge of doctrinal, training, organizational, and materiel developments. With such an exchange of
knowledge and experience between the field and the Chemical School, these officers ensure that the Chemical Corps,
sister Services, and the Army are fully prepared to fight and win on the increasingly complex battlefields associated
with the contemporary operational environment (COE).
d. Unique attributes are as follows:
(1) Personal attributes. CBRN officers must know and routinely execute drills and operate within established SOPs.
Officers must be physically fit, flexible, agile, adaptable, and values-based if they, as warfighters, are to lead CBRN
Soldiers effectively across the full range of military operations.
(2) Multi-functionality. CBRN officers initially will perform duties that are branch oriented; however, as the officer
becomes more familiar with systems and their specialty, they can expect to be called upon for a wide range of duties
including those providing JIIM exposure. Officers must develop and use a diverse set of skills as they move between
branch TOE and TDA leadership positions and as they serve in branch/generalist assignments. CBRN officers must be
able to design and lead CBRN organizations and personnel that enable the warfighter to retain the highest levels of
combat power.
(3) Situational awareness of the battlespace. The ability to quickly judge terrain, weather effects, friendly capabilities, and threat capabilities is vital. This transcends viewing the terrain, analyzing the weather, and knowing the range
capability of threat weapon systems and our weapon systems. It is the ability to visualize the battlespace and know how
terrain and weather impact threat employment of CBRN weapons and how to optimize CBRN defense systems in a
multidimensional battlespace.
15–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. CBRN officer career development. CBRN officers develop in the Maneuver, Fire and Effects functional category.
A CBRN officer should expect, over the span of a 20 to 30 year career, to be assigned to a variety of units and
organizations and developmental assignments. An officer will serve in several troop assignments in CBRN and other
units from platoon to Army level; CTCs; TRADOC Service schools; chemical weapons storage and demilitarization;
DA, DOD, field operating agency, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), interagency, Joint and combatant
command staff positions; and Active Army assistance to the RC (Active Army/RC) positions. KD assignments for each
grade are listed below. Some assignments by their very nature offer greater opportunity to gain knowledge and
experience. These positions impact the Army and the CBRN mission over the longer term and are especially
challenging. Officers should seek one or more of these assignments at each level of their career. (See fig 15–1, below,
for an Active Army career development model. See para 23–8c and fig 15–2 for a RC career development model.)
Regardless of the assignment, individual success is ultimately tied to performance.

136

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Figure 15–1. Chemical Active Army Developmental Model

(1) Lieutenant.
(a) Newly commissioned officers will attend the CBRN BOLC Phase III at the U.S. Army Chemical School
(USACMLS) at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. CBRN BOLC emphasizes leadership, tactics, combined arms operations, maintenance, supply, and physical fitness. Additional areas of concentration include CBRN decontamination,
obscuration operations, hazardous materials (HAZMAT), radiological operations, chemical and biological warfare
agents, and CBRN reconnaissance operations. CBRN lieutenants also undergo training with actual toxic chemical
agents, biological stimulants, and radioactive sources in the Chemical Defense Training Facility. Upon graduation
lieutenants are prepared to lead platoons and serve as battalion CBRN officers.
(b) Lieutenants have the opportunity after BOLC to attend airborne and other schools if their follow-on duty
assignment requires that specific training. Ranger training is authorized for officers with a projected assignment to the
75th Ranger Regiment.
(c) BOLC graduates should expect to serve in a variety of positions ranging from battalion level assistant S3/CBRN
officer to CBRN company positions that will develop critical leadership and Chemical Branch skills. Typical duty
positions include battalion/squadron staff officer, platoon leader (obscuration, decontamination, CBRN reconnaissance,
or Biological Integrated and Detection System (BIDS)), and company XO. These positions build a solid foundation that
is the bedrock for the remainder of the officer’s career. Officers who are assigned to battalions in life cycle BCTs will
be assigned for 36 months. Lieutenants entering life cycle units will stay for the unit’s entire life cycle.
(d) The focus during the lieutenant years is to acquire and refine leadership and branch related coordination,
logistics, and administrative skills. Inculcation of the Warrior Ethos and Army core values is essential in the

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

137

development of young officers. CBRN lieutenants should also become proficient in both common core and branch
tasks. Before promotion to captain, officers should possess an in-depth knowledge of combined arms operations as well
as knowledge of CBRN defense operations in combined arms organizations. Experiences on a contingency deployment
or other real-world operational mission are invaluable in preparing lieutenants for detachment/company level command
in an expeditionary Army.
(e) Officers who have not completed an undergraduate degree must do so during this point in their careers. The
Degree Completion Program (DCP) enables selected commissioned officers to complete degree requirements at
accredited civilian colleges and universities as a resident full-time student. Officers interested in the DCP must submit
applications through their chain of command to the CDR, AHRC–Alexandria, Chemical Branch, OPMD,
AHRC–OPB–CM, 200 Stovall St., Alexandria, VA 22332–0414 not later than five months prior to the requested DCP
start date.
(2) Captain.
(a) Officers will attend the CBRN CCC at about the 3d YOS to prepare for detachment/company level command
and duties in brigade or higher-level staff positions. Officers have another opportunity to attend airborne and other
military schools en route from the career course to their next assignment, providing their next duty assignment requires
the training. Officers are strongly encouraged to participate in a master’s degree program offering enrollment while
attending the career course.
(b) Following attendance at the CCC, captains should expect to serve as a CBRN officer in a BCT. In this position,
the officer has a major impact on the CBRN preparedness of that unit.
(c) Command is highly desirable for professional development in the Chemical Corps. CBRN company command
opportunities are few and, as a result, are highly competitive. Therefore, many CBRN officers strive for branch
generalist company commands, such as, battalion and brigade HHCs. Captains should aggressively prepare for and seek
detachment/company level command.
(d) Following detachment/company command, officers should expect to be assigned to other positions that round out
leadership and technical proficiency, such as battalion level primary staff officers, Service school instructors, CTC
observer controller/evaluators (OC/Es), Active Army/RC program trainers, U.S. Army Recruiting Command
(USAREC) company commanders, or technical escort battalion company commanders or team leaders. Qualified
officers may be selected to participate in additional professional development opportunities, such as ACS, the Joint
staff Intern Program, or the USMA Instructor Program.
(e) Officers who have served at least 24 months in a branch coded position, preferably to include company
command, can be assigned to the following positions listed below:
1. CBRN BOLC/CCC small group instructor at the Chemical School.
2. OC/Es at one of the Army’s CTCs.
3. Branch/generalist positions (for example, USAREC, Reserve Officers Training Course (ROTC) instructor, USMA
faculty and staff, or Active Army/RC duty). (For more detail, see para 23–3d.)
4. Other nominative assignments (for example, JCS/DOD interns).
5. FA positions.
6. ACS. (Based on FA, the Chemical Branch, or overall Army requirements.)
(f) Officers will declare a functional category and go through a FDB)at either their 4th or 7th YOS. This board will
decide the FA and which of the 3 functional categories each officer is best suited to serve. The 3 functional categories
are MF&E, operations support, and force sustainment. The formal designation of FAs is based upon the needs of the
Army, officer preference, military experience, and civilian schooling. A limited number of officers will be accessed
into the Army Acquisition Corps upon completion of detachment/company command. For more information about the
Army Acquisition Corps accession process, see chapter 42.
(g) Captains should continue to gain an in-depth understanding of combined arms operations and become proficient
in all captain level common core and branch tasks for CBRN officers. These tasks provide the foundation of CBRN
operations and leadership required to effectively serve in the branch at increasing levels of responsibility. Captains
require a working knowledge of command principles, battalion and brigade level staff operations, and combined arms
and CBRN operations at the battalion to brigade levels. An officer should also dedicate time to complete the Chemical
Corps Professional Reading Program to gain a historical perspective on tactical, strategic, and leadership challenges of
interest to Chemical Corps Soldiers.
(h) Desirable developmental assignments for CBRN captains include—
1. Detachment/company commander.
2. Brigade CBRN officer.
3. Primary battalion staff officer.
4. USACMLS CBRN BOLC/CCC SGI.
5. CTC OC.
6. Technical escort team leader.
(i) Other developmental assignments include instructor for USMA, ROTC, or USACMLS and JCS/OSD intern.

138

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(3) Major.
(a) CBRN officers who remain in the MF&E functional category will serve in branch, functional group (maneuver
support), or branch/FA generalist assignments. Their primary professional development objective is to continue to
strengthen Chemical Corps tactical skills and leadership; however, at this level officers begin to at attain JIIM
experience and exposure. Majors will attend the resident ILE common core and Advanced Operations and Warfighting
Course (AOWC); successful completion qualifies for the award of Joint Professional Military Education I (JPME I).
(b) CBRN majors should aggressively seek assignments as a battalion/brigade XO or S3, major level unit commander, brigade primary staff officer, tactical CBRN operations officer, special forces group or separate brigade or regiment
CBRN officer, DA or Joint staff officer, or CTC OC/Es. Many CBRN officers seek XO/S3 positions in other than
CBRN battalions. Other developmental assignments include: branch chief at the USACMLS; Army, corps or ACOM/
ASCC/DRU/combatant command staff; Command and Staff College faculty and staff; Service school instructor; duty
with chemical/biological arms control/verification activities, or Active Army/RC support. Majors will also serve in
other branch/generalist positions such as ROTC or USMA faculty and staff and inspector general positions. Those
officers selected for the School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) at Fort Leavenworth will serve at a corps
headquarters or the 20th Support Command (CBRNE) headquarters as planners.
(c) Majors should continue self-development efforts to become experts in all aspects of the Chemical Corps and
Joint and multinational operations. Self-development should include correspondence courses (such as the Defense
Strategy Course) and civilian education. Officers should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their
warfighting perspective. Officers should strive to complete a master’s degree or equivalent at this point in their career.
For requirements at this grade, majors should have completed multiple developmental assignments as a captain,
assignments as a major in the Chemical Branch coded positions for at least 24 months, and ILE.
(d) Desirable developmental assignments for CBRN majors include—
1. Battalion/brigade level XO or S3.
2. Major level commander.
3. Tactical CBRN operations officer.
4. Major level CBRN officer.
5. Brigade primary staff officer.
6. ACOM/ASCC/DRU, DA, or Joint staff officer.
7. CTC OC.
(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Officers selected for lieutenant colonel in the MF&E functional category should seek assignments of greater
responsibility in the branch, functional group, and branch/FA generalist positions. The objective for lieutenant colonel
assignments is to seek positions that provide greater contributions to the branch and the Army that continue to develop
overall JIIM skills. The two pinnacle assignments for CBRN lieutenant colonels are battalion commander and division
CBRN officer.
(b) CBRN lieutenant colonels are centrally selected by a DA board to serve as commanders of CBRN battalions,
brigade special troops battalions, training battalions, ammunition plants, chemical facilities, depots, base support
battalions, garrisons, and recruiting battalions. Commands are typically 24 months in length.
(c) CBRN lieutenant colonels are chosen to serve as Division CBRN Officers by the Chief of Chemical at the
USACMLS. Division CBRN officer assignments are typically 24 months for CONUS and Korea and 36 months for
Germany.
(d) Desirable developmental assignments for CBRN lieutenant colonels include—
1. Lieutenant colonel level command.
2. Division CBRN officer.
3. Brigade XO/S3.
4. Corps, ACOM/ASCC/DRU, HQDA, OSD, or Joint staff officer.
5. ROTC professor of military science.
6. Duty with chemical/biological arms control/verification activities.
(e) Other challenging positions include duty at field operating agencies, and division chief at the USACMLS.
(f) Selection for SSC is extremely competitive. Officers are selected to either attend SSC in residency or to complete
SSC through the AWC Distance Education Course. A HQDA board centrally selects both of these courses. Selfdevelopment objectives should continue to build warfighting and branch technical expertise as well as support the
officer’s FA when applicable.
(g) For requirements at this rank, lieutenant colonels should have successfully completed requirements as a major as
well as assignments as a lieutenant colonel in Chemical Branch coded positions for at least 24 months.
(5) Colonel.
(a) The primary objective for this grade is optimal application of a colonel’s tactical and technical capabilities and
executive and leadership skills in those positions that best support the OSD, unified combatant command, and
multinational force requirements.

(b) CBRN colonels are assigned to command and senior staff positions in a wide variety of branch and branch/FA
generalist positions.
(c) The following developmental assignments are considered key for CBRN colonels:
1. Colonel level command.
2. Assistant Commandant, USACMLS.
3. Corps or Army CBRN officer.
4. ACOM/ASCC/DRU, HQDA, OSD, or Joint staff (division chief level).
5. Army, ACOM/ASCC/DRU or combatant command CBRN officer.
6. Director, USACMLS.
(d) For requirements at this rank, colonels should have successfully completed requirements as a lieutenant colonel
as well as assignments for colonels in Chemical Branch positions for at least 12 months.
b. Branch/FA generalist assignments. Officers above the rank of lieutenant can expect to serve in branch/FA
generalist assignments that may or may not be directly related to the Chemical Branch. In the past, CBRN officers
have rarely filled these positions based on the availability of CBRN officers. As the inventory of CBRN officers
dictates, the opportunity to serve in positions such as ROTC instructor, recruiting command, and inspector general may
be available.
c. Joint assignments. Field grade CBRN officers can expect to be considered for Joint duty assignments worldwide.
After assignment to KD positions, majors and lieutenant colonels should aggressively seek opportunities for Joint
qualification. Joint experience is important to the Army and professionally develops officers for advancement into
senior leadership positions. At this point in their career, officers should be working toward JPME II qualification.
d. Other assignments. Chemical Branch officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated
above. These other assignments may include White House/Congressional fellowships, National Security Council duty,
United Nations duty, and Chemical Branch representative at allied Service schools. The spectrum of possible assignments is large. These assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and important, requiring mature, skilled,
and well-grounded officers. Officers should continue to broaden their experiences by also serving in JIIM assignments
as well as functional group assignments (maneuver support).
e. Army Acquisition Corps. Qualified CBRN officers may request accession into the Army Acquisition Corps. An
annual Army Acquisition Corps accession board selects a small number of CBRN officers following successful
completion of command. These officers are managed as Army Acquisition Corps (FA 51) officers and work strictly
within the acquisition arena in the force sustainment functional category for the rest of their careers. An Army
Acquisition Corps officer’s career development is focused toward serving as a program manager or as a commander of
an acquisition command. Throughout their acquisition career, they continue as members of the Chemical Corps
Regiment. This link between the Chemical Corps and Army Acquisition Corps should be strong so that the best
possible CBRN-related equipment and systems are developed and procured. (Additional information on the Army
Acquisition Corps can be found in chap 42.)
f. ACS. Some Chemical Corps positions require advanced degrees. An advanced degree can provide additional
opportunities for select assignments. The Corps annually sends officers to graduate school to obtain advanced science
degrees in disciplines, such as chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, and environmental engineering. Selection is
strongly tied to the manner of performance, undergraduate GPA, GRE scores, and the individual officer’s career time
line. Officers incur a Service obligation of 3 years for each year of school in accordance with AR 350–100. Upon
graduation, officers will serve a follow-on utilization tour in a validated position for 2 or 3 years. (Further details on
ACS can be found in AR 621–1.)
g. Additional military schooling. Officers have additional opportunities to become proficient in several areas that
provide additional skill identifiers. Some of these programs and courses are Explosive Ordnance Disposal, CBRN
Reconnaissance and Surveillance Unit Leaders Course/L1, Technical Escort/L3, BIDS, Fox Reconnaissance Vehicle/
L5, Stryker NBC Reconnaissance Vehicle/L6, and CBRN Responder/R1.
h. Branch detail officers. The following applies to branch officers who are detailed:
(1) Under the branch detail program, some Adjutant General Signal, Finance, Military Police, Transportation,
Military Intelligence, Ordnance, and Quartermaster Corps officers are detailed to recipient branches for 4 years. As a
recipient branch, the Chemical Corps receives officers each year from donor branches to fill its lieutenant authorizations. See AR 614–100, chapter 3 for specific details on the Branch Detail Program.
(2) Lieutenants detailed to the Chemical Corps follow the same career development path as basic branch CBRN
lieutenants. They can expect opportunities to serve at the battalion level as an assistant S3/CBRN officer and in platoon
leader and executive officer positions at the company level. These officer development opportunities are the foundation
for successful careers in every branch of the Army. At the end of the detail period, officers revert to their basic branch.
These officers normally attend a transition course sponsored by their basic branch before serving subsequent assignments. (See chap 3 for additional information concerning the branch detail program.)

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

15–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. The Chemical Branch has diverse assignment opportunities that allow for numerous career development paths. The professional development goal of Chemical Branch officers is to produce and sustain highly qualified
technically, tactically, and operationally oriented officers to lead the Chemical Branch in combat, and on other assigned
missions. Assignments in the Chemical Branch that provide experiences on a contingency deployment or other realworld operational mission are particularly important in developing leaders in an expeditionary Army. Requirements for
individuals in the Joint Domicile Program are listed in AR 614–100 and requirements for the Exceptional Family
Member Program are listed in AR 608–75. All Family concerns for individuals in these programs will be considered by
assignment officers to support these individuals.
b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility
on the sequence of assignments. Typically, Chemical Branch officers should seek assignments in the following order:
CBRN BOLC, battalion staff (as an assistant S3/CBRN officer), platoon leader, CCC, BCT staff, detachment/company
command, post-command assignment, battalion S3 or XO or brigade S3 (as a major), ILE, JIIM assignments, HQDA
staff assignment, troop assignment (as a lieutenant colonel) such as battalion level command, division CBRN officer,
SSC, JIIM assignments, HQDA staff assignment and troop assignment (as a colonel) such as brigade level command,
and corps or Army CBRN officer.
15–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Key CBRN positions. At the company grade level, because of the wide variety of assignments, no one quantitative
standard will define success. The most important objective for the CBRN officer is to become versatile and proficient
in the full range of CBRN operations. Captains should strive to serve as a company or detachment commander for a
minimum of 12 months, with a goal of 18 months. Majors should seek to serve in an S3 and/or XO position for 12 to
24 months. Selected lieutenant colonels and colonels will serve 2 years in battalion and brigade commands. Colonels
selected for garrison command have command tours of 2 years in length, with an option of a third year.
b. Chemical Branch life cycle. Figure 15–1, above, displays a Chemical Branch life cycle with typical developmental assignments.
15–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for CBRN officers. To do this the field grade
inventory must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support branch/
generalist positions, and to provide majors the opportunity to serve as a battalion S3/XO while attempting to stabilize
for 3 years.
b. OPMS implementation. The numbers of authorized CBRN billets, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions
are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring additional information on Chemical Branch
authorizations or inventory are encouraged to contact the personnel proponency office at the USACMLS or the AHRC
Alexandria Chemical Branch assignment officer.
15–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for the Chemical Corps
a. Structure. The Army will make changes to the structure of CBRN organizations through the Total Army Analysis
(TAA) process. Other minor changes are possible due to the iterative nature of the restructuring and re-coding process.
b. Acquire. Officers will continue to be accessed into the Chemical Branch through the USMA, ROTC, and Officer
Candidate School. Accessions are based on the needs of the Army and officer preference. Because of the lack of
branch-specific civil schooling and opportunities for relevant experience, there will be few opportunities for direct
commissioning in the Chemical Branch.
c. Distribute. Chemical Branch officers will continue to rotate between TOE and TDA units in CONUS and
OCONUS with a goal of longer assignments at one station.
(1) Stabilized installation assignments. Officers assigned to installations with ample professional development
opportunities may be stabilized for extended periods. Some company grade officers may be offered the opportunity to
attend CCC, and return to their initial installation.
(2) Life cycle units. Officers at all levels assigned to life cycled units (generally the SBCTs and BCTs) will remain
in the unit for a minimum of 3 years Branch detailed officers will remain in their detail branch until after completion of
the assignment to the BCT.
(3) Cyclic units. The majority of the installations will be managed on a cyclic manning system. Replacements will
be sent to these units and installations periodically to maintain readiness of the units. Tour lengths and developmental
positions opportunities can vary. Branch detail officers will remain on standard branch detail time lines.
d. Deploy. Chemical Corps officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to deployable TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA
organizations, all Chemical Corps officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the range of military
operations. CBRN officers may deploy at any time with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national
interests or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than war, such as humanitarian and peace

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

141

keeping missions. Chemical Corps officers must prepare themselves and their Families for this most challenging life
cycle function.
e. Sustain.
(1) Promotion. Chemical Branch officers will compete for promotion only within the MF&E functional category.
Knowledge, skills, experience, duty performance, and adherence to branch requirements are all factors that influence
promotion. Promotion rates will be determined by Army needs/The Defense Officer Personnel Management Act
(DOPMA) goals.
(2) Command. Chemical Branch commanders will continue to be centrally selected for battalion and brigade level
command. All CBRN officer command opportunities are in the MF&E category. Commands are located in four
functional categories: operations, strategic support, recruiting and training, and installation. Officers have the option of
selecting the category or categories in which they desire to compete for command, while declining competition in other
categories. The results of the command selection process are announced in the CSL.
(3) OER. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS. Starting with captain, the
rater will recommend the rated officer for the functional category which best suits their abilities and interests.
f. Develop. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in
TOE units with troops, staff/TDA assignments, and institutional training assignments. Self-development continues to be
an essential component of officer development The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly employ CBRN
and obscuration assets and have knowledge of maneuver skills in support of combined, Joint, and multinational/
coalition operations. Development occurs through the Army and Joint school systems as well. Other officer development areas include ACS to support the needs of the Army and individual preferences.
g. Separate. The officer separation process remains unchanged.
15–8. Chemical Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. RC CBRN officer development objectives basically parallel those planned for their
Active Army counterparts. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation through assignments in their branch before
specialization begins. The U.S. Army RC CBRN officer plays a vital role in the Chemical Corps combat support
mission. The RC comprises the majority of all CBRN units and more than half of the personnel associated with the
Chemical Corps force structure. Therefore, interaction and interoperability between the Active Army and RCs are
essential. Reserve officers commissioned into the Chemical Corps are designated branch code 74 (Chemical) by the
Commander, AHRC-St. Louis. See chapter 7 for guidance on RC officer development.
b. Branch developmental opportunities.
(1) Even though RC CBRN officers are limited by geographical considerations, they should strive for CBRN
assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as their Active Army counterparts. RC career progression
is often constrained by the geographic dispersion of units. There may not be sufficient positions in a geographic area to
continue in CBRN assignments. Therefore, planned rotation into progressively challenging CBRN positions by RC
commands is essential to producing the best-qualified CBRN officer.
(a) To meet professional development objectives in the USAR, CBRN officers must be willing to rotate between
TPU, the IRR, and the IMA, Army Reserve Element (ARE), and Active Guard Reserve (AGR) programs.
(b) Professional development objectives in the ARNG differ from the USAR in that ARNG officers rotate between
TPUs normally within their own states. ARNG officers also have an opportunity to apply for and serve in Military
Technician Programs (MilTec) and the Title 32 or Title 10 AGR programs.
(c) These transfers are necessitated by geographical considerations, the need to provide as many officers as possible
the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions, or to complete PME requirements. Such transfers
will normally be temporary, and should not be seen as impacting negatively on the officer’s career. The success of an
RC CBRN officer is not measured by length of Service in any one component or control group, but the officer’s
breadth of experience, duty performance, and adherence to branch development goals. Officers may elect to apply for a
FA beginning at the rank of captain. AGR officers will be boarded and assigned a CF designation as a senior captain or
junior major. For additional guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7.
(2) CBRN officers in the IRR may find assignments in RTU, IMA positions in Active Army organizations,
installations, or HQDA agencies, as well as tours of ADSW, AT, or TTAD. Assignment in the IRR can also be used
for completing PME requirements.
(3) Typical assignments could include the following:
(a) Positions in CBRN TPUs or CBRN positions in non-CBRN units.
(b) IMA program which provides officers the opportunity to train in the positions they will occupy upon
mobilization.
(c) Counterpart Training Program.
(d) Positions in AREs.
(e) AGR tours where AGR officers serve full-time in support of either the ARNG or USAR. They receive the same
benefits as Active Army officers, including the opportunity for retirement after 20 years of AFS.
c. Life cycle development model. Professional development requirements are normally satisfied by attendance at
142

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

military schools combined with planned, progressive assignments in CBRN units or positions. The RC life cycle
development model for CBRN officers is shown in figure 15–2, below. In order for a CBRN officer to achieve the
desired branch experience at each grade, the length of Service in a given position is not the focus; the key is
assignment diversity and sufficient time served during each assignment to develop branch competence. The following
paragraphs describe how company and field grade RC officers may gain and maintain Chemical Branch experience
throughout a career. The desired goal for CBRN officer assignments is at least one assignment in a Chemical Branch
coded position for a total of 24 months at the company grade level and at least two assignments in a Chemical Branch
coded position for a total of 48 months at the field grade level. Officers should pursue the following experiences:
(1) Lieutenant.
(a) Newly commissioned officers branched Chemical will attend the CBRN BOLC Phase III at the USACMLS, Fort
Leonard Wood, Missouri. CBRN BOLC prepares lieutenants to lead platoons and serve as battalion Chemical officers.
During CBRN BOLC, Chemical lieutenants also undergo instruction with actual toxic Chemical agents, biological
simulants, and radioactive sources in the Chemical Defense Training Facility. USAR lieutenants must complete CBRN
BOLC by the end of their second year of commissioned Service. ARNG officers must complete CBRN BOLC by the
end of 18 months commissioned Service.
(b) A baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university is required for promotion to captain.
(c) Officers should seek assignments as platoon leaders, company XOs, or battalion assistant S3s/CBRN officers.
These positions build a strong foundation for subsequent development as a CBRN officer.
(d) Lieutenants should also become proficient in common core tasks.
(2) Captains.
(a) All officers should complete a CCC, preferably the resident CBRN CCC at Fort Leonard Wood, MO.
(b) Officers who have completed the CBRN BOLC or other branch basic BOLC III and are unable to attend the
resident CBRN CCC may receive credit by attending the RC CBRN CCC that consists of a combination of distance
learning course work and resident training at the USACMLS.
(c) Officers should seek assignments or experience equivalent to brigade/group level CBRN officer or other brigade
level staff positions. Company command is highly desirable for continued professional development. The survey team
leader on a weapons of mass destruct - civil support team (WMD–CST) is a very desirable developmental assignment
in the National Guard.
(d) CBRN captains should continue to become proficient in common core tasks. An officer should also dedicate
time to complete the Chemical Corps Professional Reading Program to gain a historical perspective on tactical,
technical, strategic, and leadership challenges of interest to Chemical Corps Soldiers.
(e) The desired goal for CBRN officer assignments at the company grade level is at least one assignment in a
Chemical Branch coded position for a total of 24 months.
(3) Major.
(a) The key requirement for development and progression at this grade is enrollment in and completion of ILE
common core.
(b) Field grade officer development paths reflect a greater variety of assignment possibilities. Developmental
positions for majors include COSCOM, separate brigade, armored cavalry regiment, or group CBRN officer; battalion
XO and S3; and division or other major command level staff positions.
(c) CBRN majors should continue self-development efforts to become experts in all aspects of the Chemical Corps,
Joint, and multinational operations, as well as in a FA when applicable. Time should be devoted to a professional
reading program to broaden the warfighting perspective.
(d) Majors should strive to obtain a master’s degree from an accredited college or university, but it is not a
requirement for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
(4) Lieutenant Colonel.
(a) ILE common core is mandatory for promotion to lieutenant colonel. ILE must be completed within 3 years after
promotion to lieutenant colonel.
(b) Lieutenant colonels that have not developed a breadth of experience as a CBRN officer at this point in their
career may do so through completion of the Senior Leader Qualification Course, sponsored by the USACMLS. This
course is designed to fill in CBRN professional development gaps and refresh skills diminished by the passage of time.
(c) Developmental positions include lieutenant colonel level staff positions, CBRN or other battalion level commands, and selection for resident/nonresident SSC. In the National Guard, state Joint Force Headquarters staff positions
and division CBRN officer positions are available and desirable. Self-development objectives should continue to build
warfighting and technical expertise and support the officer’s FA when applicable.
(d) Assumption of CBRN position duties at the lieutenant colonel level with no prior CBRN training or experience
is discouraged. Fully successful performance generally requires the skills and instincts developed over time by practice
of the CBRN segment of the military art. (Refer to chap 7 for a detailed description of RC career management and
development.)
(5) Colonel.

143

(a) Colonels who have not developed a breadth of experience as a CBRN officer at this point in their careers may
do so by completing the Senior Leader Qualification Course, sponsored by the USACMLS.
(b) CBRN positions available at this grade include CBRN brigade commander, deputy CBRN brigade commander,
and high level staff.
(c) Assumption of CBRN position duties at the colonel level with no prior CBRN training or experience is
discouraged. Successful performance generally requires the skills and instincts developed over time by practice of the
CBRN segment of the military art. (Refer to chap 7 for a detailed description of RC career management and
development.)

Chapter 16
Military Police Branch
16–1. Unique features of the Military Police Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Military Police (MP) Branch. MP Corps officers contribute to battlefield success by
performing combat and combat support operations. Combat operations consist of direct and indirect engagement
against threat forces in contiguous and non-contiguous areas of operation. The MP Corps diverse requirements are
overarching in ensuring full-spectrum dominance in an operational environment. MP officers are developed to meet
challenges of full-spectrum dominance; major combat operations (MCO) through operational stability. MP officers

144

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

must understand: campaign plan execution; cultural, ethnic, political, tribal, religious and ideological factors; and the
dimensions of war, measured in maturity, timing, infrastructure, and civil authority that cross through all military police
functions in an unrestricted environment. The MP Corps has five main functions: maneuver and mobility support
operations (MMSO), internment and resettlement (I/R) operations, area security (AS) operations, law enforcement (LE)
operations, and police intelligence operations (PIO). These functions are further defined in paragraph 16–1b, below, but
introduced as follows:
(1) MMSO assist in expediting the battlefield movement of combat forces and resources.
(2) I/R operations involve the evacuation and internment of enemy prisoners of war, high-risk detainees, U.S.
military prisoners, and dislocated civilians.
(3) AS operations help protect the force and local populace by providing security for critical sites, assets, high-risk
personnel, and through execution of aggressive anti-terrorism measures.
(4) LE operations provide for the stability and order within a given area of operation through the conduct of law
enforcement, criminal investigations, customs support, and assisting with dislocated civilian operations and host nation
(HN) policing. Additionally, LE operations form the core branch competency of every MP officer, these skills are used
extensively in training and professionalizing indigenous security/police forces.
(5) PIO supports, enhances, and contributes to the common operational picture and situational understanding of the
combatant commander. Criminal activity is always inextricably linked to the capabilities of enemy forces. PIO ensures
that intelligence developed during the conduct of the other MP functions is provided to the overall intelligence effort.
In peace, PIO provides the criminal intelligence analysis of local crimes and local terrorist threat posture for the
provost marshal (PM), garrison commander, and senior mission commander. PIO provides situational awareness and
visualization across the operating environment and is essential to the success of Army protection programs. During
peacetime, the MP provide security to critical Army facilities and resources by providing law enforcement and
confinement services. This develops and enhances skill sets needed to support our wartime mission. MP officer
experiences and competencies at each progressive level of operations (tactical, operational, and strategic) are inherent
in developing leaders within the MP Corps.
b. Unique functions performed by the Military Police Branch. Military police perform five critical functions, which
support the full spectrum of military operations in all environments. These functions and supporting actions are
performed during JIIM operations as well as during operations exclusive to the Army:
(1) MMSO. The MMSO function involves numerous measures and actions necessary to support the commander’s
freedom of movement in their area of responsibility (AOR). MP expedite the forward and lateral movement of combat
resources and ensure commanders get forces, supplies, and equipment when and where they are needed. MP forces
maintain the security and viability of the strategic and tactical lines of communication (LOC) to ensure the commander
can deploy and employ his/her forces to ensure mission success. MP also support the commander and help expedite
tactical movements by operating traffic control points (TCP), defiles, or mobile patrols; erecting temporary route signs
on main supply routes (MSRs) or alternate supply routes (ASRs), or conducting a reconnaissance for bypassed or
additional routes. As part of the MMSO function, the MP support river-crossing operations, breaching operations, and
passage of lines. They provide straggler control, dislocated-civilian operations, MSR regulation and enforcement In
both military combat and stability operations, MP coordinate HN support to the extent necessary or available in order
to keep convoys secure and moving unimpeded.
(2) AS operations. MP perform the AS function to protect the force and enhance the freedom of units to conduct
their assigned missions. Providing critical area security, military police play a key role in supporting forces in
contiguous and non-contiguous operations. MP also are a vital force that locates delays and defeats enemy attempts to
disrupt or demoralize military operations throughout the battlespace. MP mobility and communication makes it possible
to detect threats with aggressive and quickly coordinated/synchronized patrolling in the area of operation (AO), MSRs,
key terrain, and other critical assets. Organic communication enables military police to advise the appropriate headquarters, bases, base clusters, and moving units of impending enemy activity. With organic firepower, MP are capable
of engaging in decisive combat operations against a Level II threat and delaying Level III forces either alone or
augmented by other forces. Augmented by combat forces, military police are capable of delaying a Level III threat
until the commitment of the tactical combat force (TCF). MP countermeasures may include implementing vulnerability
assessments, developing procedures to detect terrorist actions before they occur, hardening likely targets, and conducting offensive operations to destroy the enemy. MP use checkpoints and roadblocks to control the movement of
vehicles, personnel, materiel, and prevent actions that may aid the enemy. MP provide combat power to protect the C2
headquarters, other critical sites and equipment, and services essential for mission success. They provide the maneuver
commander with a light, mobile fighting force that can shoot, move, and communicate against any threat. Major subtasks associated with AS are air-base defense, response force operations, critical site, and asset security. The United
States Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) conducts personal vulnerability assessments on designated
high-risk personnel (HRP) and, as required by regulations, provides personal security for designated DOD executives
and other key officials. Further, in conjunction with AS operations, USACIDC performs logistical security analyses
and vulnerability assessments on key areas. The analysis is provided to the commander to assist in minimizing and
reducing exposure to criminal threat entities.
(3) LE operations. LE operations consist of those measures necessary to enforce laws, restore order, reconstitute
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

145

indigenous police forces, conduct investigations, and control populations. LE operations include performing LE,
conducting criminal investigations, collecting and analyzing police information, and developing and disseminating
criminal intelligence. MP LE capabilities support military operations across the full spectrum by enabling freedom of
action and protection of the force. The focus of LE operations during defensive operations is on physical security,
access control, and antiterrorism. Stability operations lead to an environment which, in cooperation with a legitimate
government, the other instruments of national power can predominate. A criminal threat impacts military operations
and requires the commander to minimize that threat to forces, resources, and operations. The activities of LE operations
provide a lawful and orderly environment for the commander. The MP Corps has created specialized skill sets such as
CID special agents, MP investigators (MPI), I/R specialists, and other specialists that enhance the success of military
LE operations. Because of the broad scope of capabilities, jurisdiction, and authority, uniformed enforcement of
military and Federal laws and regulations can be applied in both tactical and non-tactical environments. MP and
USACIDC LE functional capabilities are force multipliers that enhance protection of the force across the full range of
military operations through timely, thorough and unbiased investigations. During full-spectrum operations, MP constantly adapt to support efforts of forces engaged in offense, defense, and stability operations. Skills developed in patrol
operations and working with the populace in peace contribute directly to mission success when operating in major
combat or stability operations.
(4) I/R operations. MP shelter, sustain, guard, protect and account for enemy prisoners of war/civilian internees
(EPW/CI), U.S. military prisoners, dislocated civilians (DC) and HRD. MP provide trained and equipped forces to
support I/R missions during Army and JIIM operations. Working in conjunction with HN assets, MP assist and direct
civilians away from ongoing military operations and ensure the rapid and safe evacuation of EPW/CIs, DCs, and HRD
to designated holding areas. In stability operations, MP work closely with JIIM and indigenous assets to reestablish and
train police infrastructure.
(5) Police intelligence operations (PIO). PIO provide situational understanding and visualization across the operating
environment and greatly enhance the success of Army protection programs. PIO provides relevant intelligence to deter,
detect, detain, or defeat threats against U.S. or protected persons, materiel, and information. PIO occurs in both tactical
and non-tactical environments through a network of LE, security, and intelligence organizations. PIO collects, analyzes,
fuses, and reports intelligence regarding threat/criminal groups for evaluation, assessment, targeting, and interdiction.
PIO involves the evaluation of all available elements of intelligence including human imagery, signal, measurements
and signal and criminal intelligence, and so on. PIO can act as a stand-alone function for the direct purpose of
developing intelligence to meet specific requirements or it can be conducted in conjunction with other MP functions.
c. Unique features of work in the MP Branch. MP officers work at all levels of command and staff, providing daily
interaction with JIIM law enforcement organizations during transition to participating in Joint tasks forces (JTFs) and
multinational force missions. Additionally, they participate in a broad spectrum of force protection and contingency
operations ranging from security assistance missions to combat operations. MP Soldiers frequently deploy as the
contingency force in support of U.S. policy objectives. MP Soldiers and units are recognized for their unique mission
capabilities. These capabilities include, but are not limited to, expertise in dealing with the demands of cross-cultural
operations; universal acceptability as a force focused on security and safety; and skills in conflict resolution using
minimum force techniques enhanced through practical experience gained at post, camp, and station LE mission
execution. These traits make military police units invaluable in supporting contingency and nation-building assistance
operations. Additionally, MP officers will—
(1) Command and control MP and USACIDC units and organizations.
(2) Provide MP coordination and liaison at all Army, Joint, and allied levels as appropriate.
(3) Develop doctrine, organizations, and equipment for future MP missions.
(4) Serve as instructors at various pre-commissioning programs, Service schools, and Service colleges.
(5) Serve as MP advisors to USAR and ARNG organizations.
16–2. Officer characteristics required
The MP Branch requires officers who are skilled in leadership at all levels; who are knowledgeable in MP tactics,
techniques, and procedures; who possess strong Army Values, leader attributes, and leader skills; who can quickly
adapt to changing dynamics when dealing with people and encountering complex situations; and who fully understand
the key leadership actions that must be taken to ensure success. Additionally, there are branch-unique skills, knowledge, and attributes that require professional development.
a. Unique skills. MP officers must possess skill proficiency related to the individual and associated collective tasks
that are part of the five MP functions. This includes not only knowledge of the tasks, but the ability to execute them
under a variety of conditions and at progressive levels of command responsibility. MP officers embody the traits
looked for in a pentathlete as they deal with complexity in both peace and war where decisions are always critical from
saving lives, conducting combat operations or enforcing laws in a manner that will be upheld under court scrutiny.
(1) Decisionmaking skills. MP officers often work in an environment where time available for problem analysis is
seriously constrained; sound, timely decisions are urgent. Available information in this environment will vary in its

146

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

completeness and ambiguity. An ability to operate under stress, develop viable courses of action, make decisions, and
accomplish a mission regardless of constraints is critical to an MP officer’s success.
(2) Human dimension skills. MP officers must develop skills that allow them to deal effectively with various crosscultural, ethnic, and human dimensional attitudes encountered in the majority of MP-related activities. A thorough
understanding of these attitudes and emotions is critical to MP success. MP officers deal with a broad range of
domestic and international issues that require application of the core human values of fairness, patience, compassion,
and caring. Therefore, an effective grasp of the human dimension is pivotal in effectively managing situations of stress
or conflict and in the proper use of conflict resolution or deterrence.
(3) Leadership skills. Leadership is the overarching trait required of all MP officers. It summarizes the Army’s
seven core values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless Service, honor, integrity, and personal courage. Leaders inspire
Soldiers with the will to win and provide purpose, direction, and motivation in all operational environments. MP
officers are expected to study the profession, becoming both tactically and technically proficient. Equally important,
however, they must continually demonstrate strong character and high ethical standards in order to infuse these traits
into their units and Soldiers. Lastly, MP leadership must focus on taking responsibility for decisions, being loyal to
superiors and subordinates, inspiring and directing assigned resources toward a purposeful end, and providing the
vision that focuses and anticipates the future. The MP officer must constantly refine these skills, if he or she is to
successfully lead the outstanding Soldiers in the corps.
b. Unique knowledge. Army and MP professional development programs produce versatile, competent Soldiers and
leaders. The unique aspects of MP knowledge include the development of special qualifications needed to perform such
duties as provost marshal, security officer, physical security officer, corrections, and criminal investigations. To be
successful, MP officers must possess a high degree of knowledge about how the Army, as well as the MP Corps,
functions, and laws and regulations at local, state, Federal, and international level. Knowledge of the Army should
include general knowledge of combined arms, JIIM operations, and how the MP Corps supports each of them. Branch
officers must, therefore, maintain a proper balance between technical skills and the ability to understand and apply the
appropriate tactics, techniques, and procedures at the right time and place. These abilities can only be gained and
developed through repetitive operational assignments and continuous professional study and self-development. MP
officers must have the ability to operate independently and articulate the capabilities of MP Soldiers to others across
the full spectrum of military operations.
c. Unique attributes. The skills and knowledge needed to function as an MP officer supplement core attributes
required of all Army officers. Army officers are expected to maintain the necessary technical proficiency and flexibility
necessary to perform any branch related mission. However, the nature of the five MP functions often demands that MP
officers possess certain attributes unique to the MP Corps. The most critical of these unique requirements are—
(1) Personal attributes. MP officers must possess exceptionally high moral and ethical values. The MP mission is to
enforce laws, directives and punitive regulations, and demands that the standards of the MP officer be above reproach.
The diversity of MP functions, particularly those associated with collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information
also require MP officers to continually seek self-improvement across a wide range of skills, from computer applications
to interpersonal communications. Finally, MP officers must also recognize the critical importance of physical fitness
and personal bearing if they as warfighters are to lead MP Soldiers effectively across the full range of MP functions.
(2) Professional attributes. MP officers must demonstrate professional attributes that reinforce MP Corps values and
traditions. Skill proficiency, dedication, teamwork, and flexibility, coupled with fairness and respect for others,
highlight the essential traits demanded of every MP Soldier, regardless of rank. These professional attributes form the
basis for the trusts that the Army has placed in the MP Corps and is reflected in the mission to impartially enforce the
law upon fellow Soldiers.
(3) Multi-functionality. As MP Branch officers progress in their careers, they can expect their assignments to
become increasingly diverse. Initially, officers will perform duties related to their branch. Eventually, as the officer
becomes more familiar with his or her specialty and the Army, he or she can expect to be called upon to perform a
wide range of military duties. This may include serving in various leadership positions, as well as serving in branch/
functionally aligned generalist assignments. MP officers may perform duty outside the branch working JIIM opportunities utilizing their unique skills. Some MP officers may perform in a Joint billet as an expert in maneuver support or
force protection, inter-Governmental or interagency working at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) or Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in countering terrorism (Joint terrorism task forces) or multifunctional such as Secretary
of General Staff, Office Chief of Legislative Liaison, and so on.
16–3. Officer developmental assignments
a. Branch officer KD. MP officers develop in the MF&E functional category. This is an environment which places
great emphasis on leading Soldiers. For company grade officers, the focus is on the platoon leader and company or
detachment command experience, BCT staffs, and PM operations officers as KD assignments. In the field grade ranks,
the focus is on critical troop-related duty positions such as battalion S3, XO or brigade S3, Division Deputy PM, I/R
staff, installation PM or MP-coded division staff positions in the command posts, PM or deputy PM of an installation,
SBCT planner, and battalion and brigade command. Other professional development assignments include instructor
duty at the MP School or one of the senior leadership institutions (for example, CGSC, USMA, and so on) and Service

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

147

on Joint/DOD/Army/ACOM, ASCC, or DRU staffs. Additionally, assignment to a transition team within the operational theater to assist in indigenous HN police training is recognized as KD. Regardless of the duty position,
individual success is ultimately and inseparably tied to performance.
(1) Lieutenant.
(a) The MP lieutenant’s first objective is to complete the BOLC (Phases I–III). BOLC emphasizes leadership,
tactics, training operations, maintenance, supply, and physical training. Additional areas of concentration include MP
LE operations, communication skills, personnel administration, drivers training, and weapons training. Graduates of
BOLC possess the technical and tactical skills, physical fitness, and leadership qualities required to successfully lead a
platoon. They are familiar with the five functions of the MP Corps and are trained on the most critical tasks required of
a platoon leader. These officers demonstrate a thorough understanding of and willingness to live by the Army Values
and a firm grasp of the attributes, skills, and actions that form the foundation of a competent and confident leader.
Platoon leaders should seek to observe/intern with a local police agency (minimum 8 hours) and jail/corrections
operations. Following the basic course, selected officers may attend specialized courses, such as Non-lethal Weapons
Instructor, Special Reaction Team (SRT), Anti-terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) Program Manager (designed for
those engaged in AT/FP at brigade level organizations or higher), Airborne or Air Assault School, to support follow-on
assignment requirements and to complement professional development. Key MP Schools include Physical Security,
Criminal Antiterrorism and Police Intelligence Management (CAPIM) and SRT.
(b) The second objective is a branch assignment with troops. Consistent with Army requirements, lieutenants can
expect an initial assignment as a platoon leader in an MP company. While serving as a platoon leader, lieutenants
should develop a comprehensive understanding of Army operations and military life that will provide a solid foundation for assuming the challenge of company command. Beyond a platoon leader assignment, lieutenants should take
advantage of opportunities to broaden their technical, tactical, and leadership skills in company XO or staff officer
positions at battalion or brigade level (MP or BCT) or within an installation PM’s office. Experiences on a contingency
deployment or other real-world operational mission are especially valuable in preparing lieutenants for company or
detachment command in an expeditionary Army.
(c) Additionally, officers who have not completed an undergraduate degree must do so at this point in their careers.
The DCP allows selected officers to complete baccalaureate degrees at their own expense while still drawing full pay
and allowances at their current rank as full-time students at accredited colleges or universities. Officers are required to
have a baccalaureate degree from an accredited university prior to attending a branch CCC. Time allotted for degree
completion is normally limited to 12 months. Officers interested in the DCP must submit applications through their
chain of command to the MF&E Division, officer Personnel Management Directorate, ATTN: AHRC–OPB–L, 200
Stovall St., Alexandria, VA, 22332–0414, not later than five months prior to the requested DCP start date.
(2) Captain.
(a) Officers are eligible to attend the MP CCC between their third and eighth year of commissioned Service. This
course prepares officers to command at the company or detachment level and to serve in MP staff positions. The MP
CCC trains officers to successfully function as staff officers and ensures that officers possess the technical, tactical,
leadership, and physical fitness skills required to successfully lead companies. Graduates of the MP CCC will have a
firm grasp of the attributes, skills, and actions that form the foundation of competent and confident leaders.
(b) Command of an MP unit (company or detachment) provides invaluable leadership experience for an MP captain.
Captains who have not commanded an MP unit will be assigned, if possible, to locations that provide an opportunity
for command. Command of a modification table of organization and equipment (MTOE) or selected table of distribution and allowance (TDA) units are considered equivalent assignments. Because of current and projected strengths and
the number of available companies, MP company grade officers should not expect more than one assignment to a
command or other KD position. Some captains may be offered a second command at the MP School, USACIDC
Protective Services Unit, HHC of BSTB or BCT, or Recruiting Command.
(c) MP captains should continue developing their technical and tactical skills. Maximum hands-on experience in a
variety of MP leadership positions should be sought during this phase (CID, I/R, PM, division staff, CS units). Other
valuable assignments for MP officers includes staff officer positions at the battalion or brigade level, small group
leader (SGL) or staff officer at the MP School, PM operations at the installation or Army Command (ACOM), Army
Service Component Command (ASCC), or Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) level. Captains should seek out PM operations
officer. Attendance at branch-specific functional training courses is recommended, depending on timing and opportunity. MP schools to attend include Law Enforcement Senior Leaders (LESL) Course, AT Level II Program Manager
Course, CAPIM, and Physical Security.
(d) Captains are also eligible for nominative or generalist jobs, such as USMA faculty and staff, Cadet Command,
Recruiting Command or RC. Assignment to one of these career opportunities is discussed between the Soldier and the
AHRC branch assignment manager, and will be confirmed based on the professional development needs of the officer
and Army requirements.
(e) Officers will declare a functional designation at either their 4th or 7th YOS. (Officers may request consideration
for select FAs at the 4th YOS; the 7-year FDB considers all officer files for all FAs.) Officers should solicit counseling
from their raters and senior raters as well as their branch assignment managers on the functional designation processes.

148

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Part of the OER includes rater and senior rater recommendations indicating a potential functional designation for the
rated officer. Captains should be aware of this rater and senior rater responsibility, and this important part of the OER
should be discussed during support form counseling. Captains should intern (usually one to three months) at mid-sized
police departments and seek corrections experience.
(f) A small number of Captains may participate in Project Warrior, a program designed to spread the expertise
developed by combat training center (CTC) observer/controllers (O/C) to the rest of the MP Corps. After 12 to 24
months at a CTC, Project Warrior officers are assigned to the MP School as SGLs to provide additional combined arms
tactical experience to MP instruction and allow CTC lessons learned to be incorporated into the training base.
(g) Though not a requirement for promotion to Major, officers are encouraged to obtain a master’s degree from an
accredited college or university. A number of opportunities exist for highly qualified MP officers to participate in fullyfunded and partially-funded graduate civilian education. Two fully-funded programs exist, the MP Branch Advanced
Civil Schooling (ACS) program and the Army’s Expanded Graduate School Program (EGSP). These programs are
generally focused for officers in their eighth to twelfth year. MP Branch focuses ACS allocations in disciplines such as
corrections or security management. The goal of the EGSP, offered post-commissioning to officers with high potential,
is development of broader skills such as language, regional knowledge, diplomacy, governance, and so on. Officers
selected to participate in a fully-funded civilian training or education program will be assigned to a follow-on
utilization tour within an MP unit that best utilizes their degree (that is, Corrections Master to the United States
Disciplinary Barracks or a like unit). MP officers may attend a partially funded cooperative degree program while
attending the MP CCC.
(h) Attendance at the FBI National Academy (FBINA) is offered to high potential, Active Duty MP captains and
majors who have completed a baccalaureate degree and the MP CCC, and have successfully commanded. Subjects
taught during the nine-week course include: forensic science, criminal law, behavioral science, and management
applications. Upon graduation officers will be assigned to a follow-on utilization tour that best utilizes the skills learned
at the FBINA.
(3) Major.
(a) Developmental assignments include MP battalion S3 or XO, brigade S3/XO, CID group S3, deputy division PM,
brigade/division MP planner, or Regional Corrections Facility (RCF)/CID field office commander (when authorized a
major). MP majors should perform duty in strategic staff positions (that is, HQDA, USAMPS, ACOM, ASCC or DRU
staff, modularity staff (corps, division, BCT)), and acquire institutional experience to include I/R/CID experience.
Other typical assignments include corps staff, ACOM, ASCC, DRU/Joint/DOD/Army Staff, ILE faculty and staff,
USMA faculty and staff, USACIDC, inspector general, Service school instructor, or RC support. Majors can also serve
in other branch/generalist positions. A very small number of officers are selected for the School of Advanced Military
Studies (SAMS) and must serve an initial utilization tour as a plans officer on division or corps staff.
(b) ILE for majors is essential for their professional development and it is Army policy that all officers will be given
the opportunity to attend in a resident status. In addition, officers should continue to pursue other professional
development goals to include completing a graduate level degree if their job requirements permit. The three-month ILE
common core Course will be delivered in residence at Fort Leavenworth for most basic branch officers and RC
officers, and a complement of sister Service and international officers. Immediately following the Common Core
Course, Active Army basic branch officers attend a seven-month Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course
(AOWC) at Fort Leavenworth, focused on planning and executing full spectrum operations at the tactical and
operational levels. RC officers may attend The Army School System (TASS) classrooms located in Continental United
States (CONUS) and overseas, or can take the common core via an Advanced Distributed Learning Course. Officers
completing the ILE common core Course and AOWC are JPME I qualified. History, leadership, and Joint instruction
receive heavy emphasis throughout the curriculum. Simulations are used extensively to drive the learning and officers
have multiple opportunities to practice their warfighting competencies and skills. Other valuable qualifications include
language skills and proficiency.
(c) Assignments after promotion to major will be managed at AHRC, MP Branch for branch assignments and
generalist assignments.
(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) MP lieutenant colonels can expect assignment to senior staff positions where they will be employed in a wide
variety of operational or key branch/generalist positions or maneuver support functionally aligned positions. KD
assignments include division PM, installation PM (when authorized a lieutenant colonel), battalion commander, brigade
S3 or XO, deputy brigade commander, or MP school staff. MP lieutenant colonels can also be assigned to JIIM/DOD/
Army/ACOM, ASCC, DRU staff assignments, ROTC, or RC support and should seek JIIM assignments and internships with appropriate local, state, and Federal LE/corrections agencies.
(b) An HQDA central selection board will select a limited number of officers for battalion command or its
equivalent. Selection rates for command vary because of the number of commands available and the size of the
officer’s year group.
(c) Lieutenant colonels are encouraged to continue their individual professional development by completing the SSC
program. Selection for the resident phase and the AWC Distance Education Course continue to be done by a HQDA

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

149

central selection board. Lieutenant colonels should consider attending the LESL course early for added value to PM
duties.
(5) Colonel.
(a) The primary objective during this phase of an officer’s career is to maximize use of his or her technical and
tactical capabilities, leader and management skills, and other executive skills in positions of high responsibility. A wide
variety of critical positions are available, to include ACOM, ASCC, or DRU PM, Service school director, and JIIM/
DOD/Army staff assignments.
(b) An HQDA centralized board will select a limited number of officers for brigade command or its equivalent.
Selection rates for command vary because of the number of commands available and year group size.
(c) Branch, functionally aligned (Maneuver support) and area generalist assignments. Officers above the rank of
lieutenant can expect to serve in generalist assignments, such as ROTC, RC, recruiting, USMA faculty and staff and
inspector general, which may or may not be directly related to the MP Branch but are important to the Army.
(d) MP officers can expect to be considered for Joint duty assignments worldwide. After assignment to KD
positions, majors and lieutenant colonels should aggressively seek opportunities for Joint qualification. Joint experience
is important to the Army and is essential to individual officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions.
An officer on the Active Duty list may not be appointed to the grade of O–7 unless the officer has completed a full
tour of duty (36 months) in a Joint duty assignment (JDA). Although the Assistant Secretary of Defense (FMP) may
waive that JDA requirement on a case-by-case basis for scientific and technical qualifications for MP officers, officers
receiving scientific and technical waivers must serve continuously in the specialized field or serve in a JDA before
reassignment to a nonscientific and technical position.
(e) MP Branch officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated above. These other
assignments may include White House Fellowships, duty with the National Security Council, Joint Chiefs of Staff
Internship, or the United Nations, as well as MP Branch representatives at allied Service schools. The spectrum of
possible assignments is large and these assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and important, requiring
mature, skilled officers. MP officers should broaden their assignments by serving in positions at JIIM opportunities and
seeking functionally aligned assignments within maneuver support; MP, CM, and EN.
b. Warrant officer MOS qualification, professional development and assignments. The only WO military occupational specialty (MOS) in the MP Corps is MOS 311A, CID Special Agent. The USACIDC is a DRU to the DA
Provost Marshal General. USACIDC provides a full range of criminal investigative services and support to commanders and directors at all levels, in tactical and garrison environments, worldwide. USACIDC plans, coordinates, and
directs criminal investigations, crime prevention surveys, personal security operations and collects, analyzes, and
disseminates criminal intelligence in support of criminal investigation, crime prevention, and force protection.

(r) Collect, analyze, and disseminate criminal intelligence to commanders in support of their force protection efforts.
(s) Develop, conduct, and supervise student instruction in criminal investigative methods and techniques.
(t) Professional military education includes but not limited to hostage negotiations, advanced crime scenes, WMD
investigator, CAPIM, and fraud and computer crime courses.
(2) MOS qualification and development.

150

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(a) MOS qualification. At all WO grades, CID special agents must be U.S. citizens and qualify for a security
clearance of TOP SECRET. The qualifications outlined in AR 195–3, paragraph 2–2b must be met and the Commander, USACIDC, must accredit CID special agents.
1. Basic level MOS qualification (WO1). In addition to the general MOS qualifications, CID special agents must
complete the Warrant officer Candidate School (WOCS) and the MP Warrant Officer Basic Course (WOBC). This
course emphasizes the necessary skills to become a team chief that include leadership, investigative and technical
skills, and physical training.
2. Advanced level MOS qualification (CW2/CW3). Continuation of the CID special agent career path provides for
completion of the MP Warrant Officer Advance Course (WOAC). This course emphasizes the necessary skills to be a
special agent in charge, battalion or brigade staff officer, and the ability to serve as USAMPS instructor. This course
provides specific technical and tactical training.
3. Senior level MOS qualification (CW4). Each selection to higher grade provides for additional training requirements. CID special agents are required to complete the Warrant Officer Staff Course (WOSC). This course emphasizes
the necessary skills to be a CID detachment commander, battalion operations officer, battalion/brigade/HQ, USACIDC
investigative staff officer, and the ability to serve as USAMPS instructor. This course provides specific training that
focuses on the ability to work in senior advisory or supervisory positions.
4. Master level MOS qualification (CW5). CID special agents, who acquire the master level for WOs, must complete
the Warrant officer Senior Staff Course (WOSSC). This course emphasizes the necessary skills to be a brigade
operations officer, Regimental Chief Warrant officer of the Branch, WO Advisor to the CG or Chief, Current
Investigative Operations officer at USACIDC, Senior Special Agent to IG, Chief Intelligence Division, and AHRC
assignment manager. WOs at this skill level receive specific training that focuses on senior level leadership, mentorship
and organizational operations.
(b) Professional development.
1. WO1.
a. The primary performance objective for the new MP WO1 special agent is a leadership role within a CID unit.
Consistent with Army requirements, WO1 special agent can expect an initial assignment as an assistant CID team chief
at a large installation or as a team chief at a small installation. Each WO can also expect to be the senior member of a
two-person tactical, deployable investigative team. Each WO1 should continue to develop a comprehensive understanding of investigative techniques, tactics, and procedures. WO1 should develop an understanding of CID and Army
operations that will provide a solid foundation for assuming duties as a detachment commander/special agent in charge.
b. The WO1 will have experience as an enlisted CID special agent (MOS 31D) and have graduated from the
WOCS. The new WO’s first objective is to complete the WOBC. Following WOBC, selected WO may attend
specialized courses, such as Airborne or Air Assault School, Hostage Negotiation School, or Protective Services
Training to support follow-on assignment requirements and to complement professional development.
c. WOs who have not completed an undergraduate degree should continue to work towards that goal. Qualification
for selection as a WO candidate in MOS 311A requires a waiver for any applicant who has not already earned a
baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university.
2. CW2.
a. CW2 special agents will continue to fill junior leadership roles within a CID unit. The primary performance
objective as a CW2 will be a successful tour as a team chief or section leader. CW2 SA can expect to continue to be
the senior member of a two-person tactical, deployable investigative team. Senior CW2 SA may also be the section
leader of an eight special agent, deployable investigative section.
b. CW2 should continue developing as leaders and investigators. They should seek functional training and operational assignments that enhance specific leadership and investigative skills. Examples of training opportunities include
the FBINA, Canadian Police Academy, and advanced training in specific investigative skills that focus on advanced
investigative techniques, such as drug suppression, economic crime, protective services, and criminal intelligence
management. Assignments such as personal security officer (PSO) and operations staff officer at a CID battalion or
brigade are available. A limited number of opportunities exist for highly qualified CW2 to participate in fully-funded
advanced civilian schooling as forensic science officers (FSO), or for training and utilization as a polygraph examiner.
Staff and specialty training and assignments should normally only be considered after a successful tour as a team chief.
CW2 special agent must complete the Action Officers Development Course prior to attending the WOAC. Every CW2
eligible for selection to CW3 is expected to have completed undergraduate studies and have earned a baccalaureate
degree.
3. CW3.
a. The primary performance objective for the CW3 is a successful tour as a special agent in charge (SAC). Any
CW3 who has not served as a SAC should be selected for a SAC position, based on the availability of that position and
the needs of the Army. Other duties include staff and specialty positions, such as personal security officer, battalion,
brigade, or USACIDC staff officer, MP school instructor, and polygraph examiner.
b. Not later than one year after promotion to CW3, the WO special agent should complete WOAC. This course must
be completed prior to promotion to CW4. CW3 special agent should continue to seek functional training and

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

151

operational assignments that enhance specific leadership and investigative skills. They remain eligible for training
opportunities like the FBINA, Canadian Police Academy, and advanced training in specific investigative skills, such as
FSO. Those selected for duties as a SAC will be eligible to attend the annual SAC training course. A limited number of
opportunities remain for highly qualified CW3 special agent to participate in fully-funded ACS as FSOs, training and
utilization as a polygraph examiner or as a computer crimes investigator. In addition, CW3 special agent should
continue to pursue other professional development goals to include work towards a graduate level degree. Regardless
of the duty position, individual success is ultimately and inseparably tied to performance.
4. CW4.
a. The primary performance objective for the CW4 is a successful tour as a CID battalion operations officer or a
large detachment commander. Field Investigative Unit operations officer and Protective Service Unit operations officer
are additional critical CW4 assignments. CW4 special agent can expect assignment to senior staff or supervisory
positions where they will be employed in a variety of operational positions.
b. Not later than one year after promotion to CW4, he or she should complete WOSC. This course must be
completed prior to promotion to CW5. In addition, CW4 should continue to pursue other professional development
goals to include completing a graduate level degree. CW4s should be given consideration for technical operational
assignments in environments for exposure and experience.
5. CW5.
a. The primary objective in utilizing the CW5 is to maximize his or her technical and tactical capabilities, leader and
management skills, and other executive skills in positions of the highest responsibility in the WO ranks. Critical
positions include battalion operations officer, brigade operations officer, senior special agent on the inspector general
team, and USACIDC Chief of Investigative Operations and Policy & Command Chief WO Advisor to the CG, CID
and, Regimental Chief WO of the MP Branch/Chief, MP Investigations Division at the U.S. Army MP School.
b. CID special agent selected for promotion to CW5 will be scheduled to attend the WOSSC and the Army Force
Management Course. CW5 special agent should complete a graduate level degree if they have not already done so.
CW5s must be given consideration for technical operational assignments in JIIM environments for exposure and
experience for a minimum of six months.
c. The FBINA is offered to high potential, Active Duty criminal investigators (MOS 311A) WOs, and CW2–CW4.
Subjects taught during the nine week course include; forensic science, criminal law, behavioral science, and management applications. Upon graduation they will be assigned to a follow-on utilization tour that best utilizes the skills
learned at the FBINA.
16–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. MP Corps Branch officer preferences and precedence.
(1) Preferences. The MP Branch has diverse assignment opportunities that allow for numerous career development
paths. The goal of the professional development of MP Branch officers is to produce and sustain highly qualified,
tactically, and operationally oriented officers to lead MP Soldiers during wartime and on other assigned missions.
Assignments in the MP Corps will develop the officer’s ability to achieve that goal. Requests from officers for
assignments that do not contribute to achieving that goal will likely be rejected. MP field grade officers should look at
opportunities to perform as a strategic leader as part of maneuver support on a Joint staff.
(2) Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility
on the sequence of assignments. Typically, MP Branch officers should seek the following assignments: MP BOLC,
platoon leader, staff officer in a battalion or brigade, installation PM office; MP CCC, company or detachment
command, battalion, brigade or division staff, nominative assignment, JIIM opportunities, ILE, battalion S3 or XO or
brigade S3 (as a major), battalion command, division PM, Installation PM, SSC, brigade command, and ACOM,
ASCC, or DRU PM.
b. MP WO CID special agent preferences and precedence.
(1) Preferences. The MP WO has diverse assignment opportunities, which allow for numerous career development
paths. The goal of the professional development of MP WOs is to produce and sustain highly qualified, tactically, and
operationally oriented WOs to lead MP Soldiers/special agents during wartime and on other assigned investigative
missions in tactical and garrison environments for the Joint and expeditionary Army force. Assignment within the MP
Corps and the USACIDC will develop the WO’s ability to achieve that goal. Requests from WOs for assignments
which do not contribute to achieving that goal will likely be rejected.
(2) Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility
on the sequence of assignments. Typically, MP WOs should seek assignments and training in the following order: WO
Candidate Course, MP WOBC, CID Team Chief, SAC of a small CID office, MP WOAC, SAC of a large CID office
or detachment commander, MP school instructor, battalion/brigade investigative staff officer, MP WOSC, battalion
operations officer, USACIDC investigative staff officer, MP School Division Chief, WOSSC, U.S. Army Force
Management Course (CWOB only), brigade or USACIDC level investigative operations officer, Command Chief WO
Advisor to the CG of USACIDC, Regimental Chief of the MP Branch.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

c. MP Branch officer assignments. MP officers should use the chart at figure 16–1, below, to determine KD
positions throughout their career.

Figure 16–1. MP Active Army Developmental Model

d. Requirements. Officers should meet certain standards in terms of schooling, operational assignments, and manner
of performance within the MP Corps at each rank. Meeting these standards ensures that the officer has acquired the
skills, knowledge, and attributes to remain proficient in the MP Corps at that rank. With this proficiency, the officer is
qualified for promotion/retention in the branch. These standards for schooling and operational assignments best prepare
an officer for command or positions of greater responsibility in the branch. All MP Branch officers should seek the
opportunity to perform in KD assignments at each rank.
(1) Company grade KD assignments. Because of the wide variety of MP missions and units, no one quantitative
standard will define success. The most important objective for the MP Corps officer is to have served in leadership
positions (preferably platoon leader and company commander) at company grade level. Platoon leaders and company
command are important in that it ensures the MP officer is able to lead, train, and care for Soldiers. Additionally, the
MP officer must be well rounded in the basic techniques needed to execute wartime missions. Company grade officers
should complete the following requirements within the MP Corps.
(a) Lieutenant. As an MP lieutenant, the officer must complete MP BOLC and one assignment as a platoon leader.
Lieutenants should serve as platoon leaders for a minimum of 12 months with a goal of 18–24 months.
(b) Captain. As an MP Corps captain, the officer must meet the following requirements:

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

153

1. Complete the CCC. Officers who are branch transferred after successful completion of any branch CCC will be
considered to have met this educational prerequisite.
2. Captains should serve as a company or detachment commander for 12 months with a goal of 18–24 months.
3. Field grade KD assignments. MP Branch field grade standards are:
(c) Major. As an MP major, the officer should meet the following goals:
1. Complete ILE.
2. Serve 12 months, with a goal of 18–24 months, as a battalion or brigade S3 or XO, deputy division PM/planner,
SBCT MP PM, RCF/CID field office commander (when authorized a major), installation deputy PM, branch-related
position on Joint/DOD/Army ACOM, ASCC, or DRU or multinational staffs, instructor at a branch Service school, or
in any MP Branch position that is coded at the rank of major or above.
(d) Lieutenant colonel. As an MP lieutenant colonel, the officer should serve 12 months with a goal of 18–24
months as a battalion commander, division provost marshal, installation PM (when authorized a lieutenant colonel),
brigade S3 or XO, deputy brigade commander, branch related position on Joint/DOD/Army/ACOM, ASCC, or DRU or
multinational staffs, or in any MP Branch position which is coded at the rank of lieutenant colonel or above. If selected
by a HQDA board, MP officers should complete resident or nonresident SSC.
(e) Colonel. As an MP Corps colonel, the officer should serve 12 months with a goal of 18–24 months in any one of
the positions listed below that is coded at the rank of colonel.
1. MP-coded positions such as brigade commander; branch-related positions on Joint/DOD/Army/ACOM, ASCC, or
DRU or multinational staffs; ACOM, ASCC, or DRU or corps PM; or senior director at USAMPS or other Service
schools.
2. Staff or faculty position at an ILE-producing Service school or USMA.
3. Division chief or higher position on Joint/DOD/Army/ACOM, ASCC, DRU, or interagency, inter-Governmental
staff.
4. Garrison commander or installation chief of staff.
5. Nominative or specialized position outside DOD.

16–5. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
The number of authorized MP billets, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions are made and actions to
implement them are taken. The goal of the MP Corps is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for MP officers. To
do this, the field grade inventory must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient
flexibility to support branch/FA generalist positions, and to provide Majors with up to two years of KD time. Officers
desiring more information on MP Branch authorizations or inventory, by grade, are encouraged to contact the MP
Corps personnel proponency office or MP Branch assignment officer.
16–6. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Military Police Corps
a. Structure. Any changes to the authorizations of MP units will be based on the restructuring and re-coding.
Additional changes may result due to the iterative nature of the restructuring and re-coding process.
b. Acquire. The majority of commissioned officers in the MP Corps are accessed directly from ROTC and USMA
and, to a lesser extent, OCS. All officers should meet the physical and aptitude requirements specified in AR 40–501.
Designation of the MP Corps as an initial branch is regulated by HQDA through the various commissioning sources.
The remainder of commissioned officers in the MP Corps is acquired through in-Service branch transfers. Accession
via branch transfer is directed by HQDA and may be voluntary or involuntary based upon the needs of the Army.
Officers of other branches who desire a transfer to the MP Corps may submit a written request for branch transfer in
accordance with AR 614–100.
c. Distribute. MP Branch officers will continue to rotate between operating force and generating force units in

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

155

CONUS and OCONUS with a goal of longer assignments at one station (consistent with Army Force Stabilization
policies; see AR 600–35). Officers should have more time to gain the requisite skills in their branch and their branch/
FA generalist assignments. In particular, majors should receive more key developmental time and increased stability.
MF&E functional category MP officers will work either in branch or branch/FA generalist positions.
(1) Officers assigned to installations with ample professional opportunities may be stabilized at that installation for
extended periods. Additionally, some company grade officers may be offered the opportunity to attend the MP CCC
and return to their initial unit of assignment. Individual time lines are affected by Army and MP requirements.
(2) Consistent with Army focus on force stabilization (see AR 600–35), officers at all levels assigned to life cycle
managed units (generally the SBCTs and BCTs) will remain in the unit for a minimum of three years.
(3) The majority of installations will be managed on a cyclic manning system. Replacements will be sent to these
units and installations periodically to maintain readiness of the units. Tour lengths and developmental position
opportunities can vary.
d. Develop. Today’s MP officer is confronted by two diverse and complex challenges. First, the officer should lead
and train Soldiers who can achieve tactical success; protect and expedite the movement of critical resources; evacuate,
process, and intern enemy prisoners of war; and support law enforcement operations. Second, in the garrison environment the officer manages technical planning and supervision in the areas of LE, crime prevention, criminal investigations, anti-terrorism, physical security, and corrections. To master the skills required to meet these challenges, MP
officers selected for major must complete ILE. All 1994 year group and later officers must attend resident ILE; 1993
and earlier year groups selected for resident will attend that course and others will complete the non-resident course.
Officers selected for colonel should complete SSC training if selected by a HQDA board. Professional development
can also occur through The Army School System (TASS) via select self-development courses.
e. Deploy. MP Branch officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to operating force (MTOE) units or generating force (fixed site TDA)
organizations, all MP officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. MP
officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests or as
individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping
missions. MP Branch officers must prepare themselves and their Families for this most challenging experience.
f. Sustain.
(1) Promotion. MP Branch officers will compete for promotion only within the MF&E functional category.
(2) Command. Senior MP Branch commanders will continue to be centrally selected for command. All MP officer
command opportunities are in the MF&E group. Officers have the option of selecting the category or categories in
which they desire to compete for command, while declining competition in other categories. The results of the
command selection process are announced in the CSL.
(3) OER. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS starting with captain, the
rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the functional category which best suits their abilities and
interests.
g. Separate. The separation process for MP officers remains unchanged.
16–7. Military Police Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. MP officers in the RCs play a vital role in the total force structure during peace as
well as mobilization. More than 61 percent of requirements in the MP Corps are in the RC and certain specialized
organizations such as internment/resettlement units exist almost entirely within the USAR and ARNG. To fulfill its
wartime mission, the MP Corps must rely on extensive interaction with the RC. Wartime effectiveness will depend to a
large extent on the quality and level of training RC MP officers receive. RC MP officers serve the same roles and
missions as their Active Army counterparts.
b. RC officer qualifications and development. To meet professional development objectives, RC officers should
rotate among TPUs (USAR) or M–Day units (ARNG), IRR, and IMA assignments. Those interested in serving the
National Guard or Army Reserve on a full-time basis may apply for entry into the AGR program. Officers selected for
the AGR program may elect to complete an Active Duty career in support of either the ARNG or USAR. RC officers
are assigned to positions in MTOE and TDA organizations; however, the vast majority of positions are in MTOE units.
Their duties and responsibilities will be fundamentally the same as their Active Army counterparts, with the exception
of those personnel management, administrative, and operational requirements unique to the ARNG and USAR. All RC
MP assignments are open to both male and female officers.
(1) The RC MP officer has a challenging and complex mission. The officer should lead and train Soldiers who can
achieve tactical success. They must be tactically and technically proficient and capable of executing the five MP
functions of area security, maneuver and mobility support, LE, internment and resettlement operations, and police
intelligence operations. Additionally, the ARNG MP officer plays a major role in preparing for and providing
assistance to their state during natural disasters, sensitive public activities, and civil disturbances. A requirement for
proficiency in both battlefield operations and peacetime MP skills usually means a wide variety of educational
opportunities and challenging assignments for the MP officer.

156

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(2) The majority of RC officers appointed for assignment in the MP Corps come from ROTC, Federal, and state
OCS programs. All officers meet the prerequisites specified in AR 135–100 for appointment in the RC of the Army.
HQDA and area commanders regulate appointment to the MP Corps as an initial branch. Additional requirements for
appointment of ARNG officers are listed in NGR 600–100.
(3) Positions in all MP skills are available to RC officers. ARNG WOs Federal recognition and related personnel
actions are found in NGR 600–101. The qualifications and professional development for RC CID special agents is in
paragraph 18–3.
c. Development model. There are five phases of professional development for RC MP Corps officers (see fig 16–3,
below). These phases are related to military rank and depict broadly based goals and career opportunities at each rank
so that an officer may expand capabilities and optimize performance. These objectives are flexible since the actual
course of an officer’s professional development and utilization will be influenced by RC requirements and the officer’s
strengths, experiences, performance, and desires.
d. Professional development objective. The professional development objectives for RC officers by grade are as
follows:
(1) Lieutenant.
(a) The MP lieutenant’s first objective is to complete the MP BOLC. Lieutenants appointed without concurrent
Active Duty should complete the MP BOLC within 24 months of the date of appointment. This course emphasizes
leadership, tactics, training operations, maintenance, supply, and physical training. Additional areas of study include
MP operations, law, communicative skills, personnel administration, drivers training, and weapons training. Graduates
of the MP BOLC possess the technical and tactical skills, physical fitness, and leadership qualities of the MP Corps
and are trained on the most critical tasks required of a platoon leader. These officers demonstrate a thorough
understanding of and willingness to live by the Army Values and a firm grasp of the attributes, skills, and actions that
form the foundation of a competent and confident leader. Following BOLC, selected officers may attend such
specialized courses as Airborne and Air Assault, to support their follow-on assignment.
(b) The second objective is a branch material assignment with troops. Consistent with Army requirements, RC MP
lieutenants can expect an initial assignment as a platoon leader for 12 months with a goal of 18–24 months. This will
ensure lieutenants develop a comprehensive understanding of Army operations and military life that will provide a
solid foundation for assuming the challenge of company or detachment command. Lieutenants should seek leadership
positions and every opportunity to broaden technical, tactical, and leadership skills in support of the MP combat and
peacetime missions. Some assignments may also be with a battalion or brigade headquarters staff. Nearly all are with
MTOE organizations.
(c) RC MP lieutenants are eligible for promotion to captain when they meet the Service and educational requirements contained in chapter 7.
(2) Captain.
(a) RC officers of the MP Corps in the rank of first lieutenant or higher who have completed an officer BOLC are
eligible to attend the MP CCC. The MP CCC is a five-phase course of instruction where phases 1, 2, and 4 are distance
learning and phase 3 and 5 are two-week resident experiences at the MP school. The MP CCC prepares officers to
command at the company or detachment level and to serve in MP staff positions.
(b) The most critical leadership position for an MP captain to hold is commander of a company or detachment for
12 months with a goal of 18–24 months. Officers should seek maximum hands-on experience in a variety of MP
leadership positions as captains. RC captains should actively pursue assignments in both TPU/M-day units and as
IMAs to broaden their professional experience and enhance opportunities for training and education. Captains can
expect to serve in a broad range of command and staff assignments, including a variety of generalist opportunities. MP
captains should continuously strive at developing their technical and tactical skills in preparation of a field grade
assignment.
(c) RC captains are required to complete CCC to be considered for promotion to major. RC captains who are
serving in an active status and meet educational, performance and Service requirements may be selected for promotion
by a centralized mandatory board or by a unit board convened to fill vacancies.
(3) Major.
(a) The primary professional development objective of an RC MP Corps major is to continue to strengthen MP
skills. Key assignments at this rank are battalion or brigade S3 or XO or deputy division/RRC PM for 12 months with
a goal of 18–24 months.
(b) The needs of the Service increasingly dictate that an officer serve in positions away from troops. KD positions at
this rank include observer controller in an exercise division in support of unit training and readiness; instructor/staff
officer in an institutional training division in support of the TASS; and staff officer at a Continental U.S. Army
(CONUSA) or Regional Readiness Command (RRC) headquarters.
(c) Regardless of their career track, MP majors should ensure they attend ILE. RC officers not on Active Duty
should apply to attend an ILE course. Since RC officers are required to complete 50 percent of ILE to be considered
for promotion to lieutenant colonel, timely completion is key to remaining competitive.
(d) RC majors who are serving in an active status and meet educational and Service requirements may be selected

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

157

for promotion by a centralized mandatory board or by a unit board convened to fill position vacancies, based on status.
Majors not selected for promotion after consideration by two consecutive mandatory boards are not retained beyond 20
years of commissioned Service unless selectively continued.
(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Lieutenant colonels can expect assignments to senior staff positions where they will be employed in a variety of
branch and generalist positions in units, training centers and headquarters elements. Brigade S3 or XO or deputy
brigade commander are key assignments during this phase.
(b) At this phase, officers may be selected for battalion command or its equivalent, as identified by their JFHQ or
RRC–designated positions list. Only a very small percentage of eligible officers will actually have an opportunity for
battalion command because of the limited number of command positions available.
(c) Lieutenant colonels are required to complete ILE (100 percent) to be considered for promotion to the grade of
colonel. RC lieutenant colonels are encouraged to complete SSC, if selected by the ARNG and the USAR boards.
Standards for the selection process can be found in AR 350–1, paragraph 3–8c.
(d) RC lieutenant colonels are eligible for selection to colonel upon completion of the requisite Service requirements
listed in chapter 7. Lieutenant colonels remain eligible for promotion to colonel as long as they continue to serve in an
active status and meet the selection criteria.
(5) Colonel.
(a) The primary objective for this phase is maximum use of the officer’s technical and tactical capabilities and his or
her managerial and executive skills in positions of senior responsibility.
(b) Colonels are encouraged to complete SSC. Both the ARNG and USAR conduct SSC selection boards and
standards for the process can be found in AR 350–1, paragraph 3–8c(b).

Chapter 17
Special Forces Branch
17–1. Unique features of the Special Forces Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Special Forces (SF) Branch. Their mission is to conduct special operations across the full
range of military operations in any operational environment in war, peace, or contingencies. SF teams expand the range
of available options in a variety of scenarios where the commitment of conventional military forces is not feasible or
appropriate. They provide military capabilities not available elsewhere in the armed forces. They are the only force
specially selected, trained, and equipped to conduct unconventional warfare. SF operations are inherently Joint, often
multinational or interagency in nature and are focused at the operational and strategic levels. SF are language trained,
culturally astute and regionally oriented, their operations are frequently conducted through, with, or by surrogate forces.
b. Unique functions performed by the SF Branch. SF Branch is a MF&E branch. As representatives of the United
States in a foreign country, SF often serve as trainers as well as warriors. In war, SF provides unique combined, Joint,
or unilateral capabilities to the combatant commander. They interact closely with and live under the same conditions as
the indigenous people. They conduct peacetime operations and promote regional stability in areas where conventional
forces normally do not operate. Their continuous forward presence assists in creating the conditions for stable
development, thereby reducing the risk of armed conflict.
c. Unique features of work in the SF Branch. The U.S. Army organizes, trains, and equips SF to perform its core
tasks of unconventional warfare (UW), foreign internal defense (FID), direct action, special reconnaissance (SR),

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

159

counterterrorism (CT), counter-proliferation (CP), and support to information operations (IO). Through the conduct of
these seven core tasks, SF supports the accomplishment of United States Special Operations Command’s (USSOCOM’s) specified Joint SOF core tasks. SF missions are dynamic and constantly evolving in response to politicalmilitary considerations, technology, and other considerations.
d. SFs seven core tasks.
(1) UW. SF defines UW a broad range of military and/or paramilitary operations and activities, normally of long
duration, conducted through, with, or by indigenous or other surrogate forces that are organized, trained, equipped,
supported, and otherwise directed in varying degrees by an external source. UW operations can be conducted across the
range of conflict against regular and irregular forces. These forces may or may not be state-sponsored. FM 3–05.201
has more detailed information on UW.
(2) FID. FID is participation by civilian and military agencies of the Government in any of the action programs
taken by another Government or other designated organization to free and protect its society from subversion,
lawlessness, and insurgency. FM 31–20–3 has more detailed information on FID.
(3) Direct action. Direct action operations are short-duration strikes and other small-scale offensive actions conducted as a special operation in hostile, denied, or politically sensitive environments and that employ specialized
military capabilities to seize, destroy, capture, exploit, recover, or damage designated targets. Direct action differs from
conventional offensive actions in the level of physical and political risk, operational techniques, and the degree of
discriminate and precise use of force to achieve specific objectives. FM 3–05.203 has more detailed information on
Direct action.
(4) SR. SR operations are reconnaissance and surveillance actions conducted as a special operation in hostile,
denied, or politically sensitive environments to collect or verify information of strategic or operational significance,
employing military capabilities not normally found in conventional forces. These actions provide an added capability
for commanders and supplement other conventional reconnaissance and surveillance actions. FM 3–05.204 has more
detailed information on SR.
(5) CT. CT is the full range of operations that include the offensive measures taken to prevent, deter, preempt, and
respond to terrorism. There are three categories of CT operations: hostage rescue, recovery of sensitive material from
terrorist organizations, and attacks against terrorist infrastructure.
(6) CP. CP of mass destruction (WMD) is a specialized mission assigned to designated SOF. SF participation in CP
is through the conduct of UW, SR, and direct action. Special Forces operational detachments (SFODs) designated in
national and theater contingency plans to participate in CP may be specially task-organized, trained, and equipped.
(7) Support to IO. SF supports the IO core capabilities of electronic warfare, computer network operations,
psychological operations, military deception, and operations security, in concert with specified supporting and related
capabilities, to affect or defend information and information systems, and to influence decisionmaking (see FM 3–13).
e. SF officer roles.
(1) SF officers plan, coordinate, direct, and participate in SF units performing the above core tasks in all operational
environments. An SF captain commands a SFOD–A. The SFOD–A is a flexible and highly trained unit, which includes
(in addition to the commander) one Special Forces WO and ten Special Forces noncommissioned officers (NCOs). the
NCOs hold one or more of the following specialties: operations, intelligence, weapons, communications, engineering,
or medical. The successful SFOD–A must be adept at accomplishing a wide range of requirements including training
management, logistical planning, resource management, training plan development for foreign forces, and negotiating
and working with foreign and U.S. Government agencies and country teams. SF officers who successfully command an
SFOD–A may later command larger Special Forces units. They serve on upper echelon SF, Army and Joint Special
Operations Forces (SOF) staffs, as SOF observer-controllers at combat training centers, in Special Mission Units
(SMUs), and in interagency assignments. They also serve as special operations staff officers at various higher level
conventional Army and Joint Staffs as well as serving on the staff and faculty of the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy
Special Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS).
(2) SF WOs (180A) are combat leaders and staff officers. They are experienced SMEs in unconventional warfare
and operations/intelligence fusion for planning and execution at all levels across the operational continuum. They are
responsible for the integration of emerging technologies. They advise commanders on all aspects of special operations.
The WO1, CW2, and select CW3 WO serves on the SFOD–A as the assistant detachment commander or commander
in his absence. The CW3–CW5 SF WO serves as a staff operations WO within the SF group, as well as at higher
commands within SF, Army SOF and Joint SOF staffs. They may lead task organized SOF elements as directed. They
serve as the senior warrant officer advisor (SWOA) to the commander for all WO matters and other interests as
directed. Select CW5’s serve as the SWOA to the SF group and United States Army Special Forces Command
(Airborne) commanders as an integral part of the commander’s personal staff.
17–2. Officer and warrant officer characteristics required
a. Unique skills.
(1) SF officers must—
(a) Be proficient infantry tactical commanders and experts in unconventional warfare and SF operations.

160

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(b) Be tactically and technically proficient in skills required of an SFOD–A.
(c) Have an aptitude for learning a foreign language and must sustain foreign language proficiency throughout their
careers. This is an essential skill to gain and sustain, and is critical for all SF officers. During the 18A Special Forces
Detachment officer Qualification Course (SFDOQC), officers who do not already meet language requirements receive
extensive foreign language and cultural training. All officers must successfully meet language course requirements
before graduating and joining an SF group.
(d) Be qualified military parachutists, with a goal of attaining a senior parachutist rating by promotion to major.
(2) SF WOs must—
(a) Be proficient in unconventional warfare and special operations and intelligence as well as tactical skills.
(b) Be familiar with all the technical skills represented on an SFOD–A.
(c) Have an aptitude for learning a foreign language and must sustain foreign language proficiency throughout their
careers. This is one of the most important and difficult skills to gain and sustain and is a critical skill for all SF
officers.
(d) Be qualified military parachutists, with a goal of attaining a senior parachutist rating by promotion to CW3.
b. Unique knowledge.
(1) SF officers and WOs require an in-depth knowledge of at least one region of the world and proficiency in at
least one of the region’s languages.
(2) Completion of the SFDOQC provides officers with entry-level knowledge of SF operations. As they develop,
officers gain a broader understanding of SF tactics, techniques, and procedures, the special operations targeting and
mission planning process, the special operations support and sustainment process, and the Joint, multinational, and
interagency aspects of special operations.
(3) SF officers and WOs have unique knowledge of specialized infiltration and exfiltration techniques, for many of
which the SF Branch is the proponent.
c. Unique attributes. SF officers and WOs must—
(1) Be physically fit.
(2) Possess unquestioned personal integrity and moral courage.
(3) Be self-reliant team players that can function as leaders in tightly knit small groups or independently.
(4) Possess the cognitive resilience and mental dexterity to act autonomously while under great stress and be able to
inspire others to perform effectively in a highly stressful environment.
(5) Be an adaptive thinker, able to thrive in complex and ambiguous situations.
(6) Be mentally flexible and willing to experiment and innovate in a decentralized and unstructured environment.
(7) Have the ability to solve complex political-military problems and develop and employ conventional or unconventional solutions. Develop and employ non-doctrinal methods and techniques when applicable. Be capable of
decisive action for missions in which no current doctrine exists.
(8) Be able to learn new skills, accept new ideas, and teach others.
(9) Possess good interpersonal and cross-cultural communications skills as well as political acumen and cultural
sensitivity. Mission success will often depend on an ability to establish rapport and influence the attitudes and
behaviors of people from foreign cultures.
17–3. Professional development overview
a. SF Branch is one of three branches that make up the ARSOF group within the MF&E category. SF Branch
consists of officers in the grade of WO1 through colonel. SF Branch is a volunteer non-accession branch that draws its
officers from other branches of the Army, or in the case of WOs, from within enlisted career management field 18
(CMF18). The U.S. Army Recruiting Command recruits SF officer volunteers. Promotable first lieutenants who
volunteer in the targeted year group are selected by a DA centralized accession board and undergo a rigorous and
demanding assessment and selection program to qualify as SF officers. SF officers are expected to have served a
successful initial tour as a lieutenant in a small unit leadership position in one of the Army’s other basic branches. As a
result they are expected to have knowledge of conventional Army operations and be experienced in Army leadership.
All SF officers are airborne qualified and maintain that proficiency throughout their careers. They attend the resident
Maneuver Captain’s Career Course (MCCC) including staff process training. Based on operational requirements, some
SF officers undergo training in advanced special operations skills such as military free-fall parachuting, combat diving,
close-quarter battle, and military mountaineering. Throughout their careers, SF officers enhance that knowledge by
increasing their understanding of the Joint and interagency aspects of special operations while they command SF units
at levels of increasing responsibility beginning with detachment as a captain, company as a major, battalion as a
lieutenant colonel, and group as a colonel.
b. The SF WO is a volunteer accessed from CMF18. All candidates attend the Special Forces Warrant Officer
Technical and Tactical Certification Course (WOTTC) at USAJFKSWCS, Fort Bragg, NC. The WOTTC is comprised
of select officer leadership tasks and WOBC tasks. Based on operational requirements, some SF WOs undergo training

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

161

in advanced special operations skills such as military free-fall parachuting, combat diving, close-quarter battle, and
military mountaineering.
c. SF officers and WOs continuously undergo intensive preparation for assignment in their unit’s designated
geographic areas. Whether the mission profile calls for clandestine employment in a denied area or a low visibility FID
mission in a developing nation, the overall requirement for regional orientation, language proficiency and cross-cultural
interpersonal skills remains the same. SF officers and WOs gain and maintain area orientation through military and
civilian schooling, language study, area study, mission preparation, and repetitive operational experience during their
careers. While initial language qualification is most often achieved through formalized instruction, it must be maintained through practice and self-study. Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) scores reflect language proficiency
and must be updated through formalized testing annually. Although the SF groups are organized by AOC, the
management of regional expertise is subject to modification as the needs of the Army change.
17–4. Officer development assignments
An SF officer must have successfully served in his basic branch in order to be eligible for SF, and subsequently serves
in a KD position as an SF captain upon graduation from the SFDOQC. The latter is described below; the former is
addressed in paragraph 17–8b.
a. Captain.
(1) SF Branch is a non-accession branch. In order to meet Army military education level requirements, every SF
officer must complete MCCC prior to their attending the SFQC.
(2) Special Forces captains should successfully command an SFOD–A, optimally for 24 months. This is the KD
position for all SF captains. This duty equates to company, battery, or troop command in the other MF&E branches
formerly known as combat arms.
(3) Upon graduation from the SFDOQC, all SF captains should optimally serve a minimum of 36 months in an 18A
coded position within an SF group. A DA Form 4187 signed by the battalion and group commanders will be required
in order for a captains to be reassigned from an SF group prior to 36 months utilization within the group. A captain
serves two years as an ODA commander followed by a 3d year as a company XO or S3 within an SF group.
Additionally, select captain may remain assigned for a total of up to four years in an SF group.
(4) The primary preferred developmental assignment for an SF captain is in an 18A coded position as a staff officer
in an SF operational battalion or group headquarters. Other preferred developmental assignments include—
(a) A second command following SFOD–A command. Selection to a second command is appropriate for an officer
with high potential. This command time is in addition to the officer’s initial tenure as an SFOD–A commander.
(b) Service as a small group instructor (SGI) at the SFDOQC.
(c) Service as a Joint staff officer or DOD staff intern.
(5) In addition to professional development through operational assignments, SF captains should begin an intensive
self-development program. Their efforts should focus on gaining an in-depth understanding of combined arms operations, gaining and maintaining regional and linguistic expertise, and increasing proficiency in SF and infantry officer
common core and branch tasks.
(6) Captains may attend advanced special operations skill courses such as combat diver, combat diving supervisor,
military free fall, military free fall jumpmaster, advanced special operations techniques (ASOT), and SF Advanced
Reconnaissance, Target Analysis, & Exploitation Course (SFARTAETC) to meet mission requirements.
(7) SF officers, as commanders of airborne units, are expected to successfully complete static line jumpmaster
training as a captain.
(8) Due to the extensive training involved in SF officer accessions, officers volunteering for SF who do not already
have a baccalaureate degree will be required to complete their degree before attending the SFDOQC.
b. Major. SF majors should successfully serve for approximately 24 months in any of the KD positions listed below
or a combination of these positions.
(1) Majors command SF companies. Each SF line company commander is responsible for his company headquarters
(SFOD–B) and six subordinate SFOD–As.
(2) The SF S3 performs duties as the battalion operations officer, similar to other MF&E S3s.
(3) The SF battalion XO performs duties similar to other MF&E battalion/brigade XOs.
(4) The SF group S3 plans officer performs duties relating to planning for future operations.
(5) The SF group support company (GSC) commander is responsible for intelligence, training, and operations
support to SF groups.
(6) The SF group operations detachment commander is responsible for training support and oversight of designated
special or advanced skills within the SF groups.
(a) Positions corresponding to 1 through 5 above in the USAJFKSWCS, 1st Special Warfare Training Group
(Airborne), (1st SWTG(A)), Special Operations Recruiting Battalion, or an SMU.
(b) Designated positions corresponding to 1 through 5 above in a Joint Special Operations Task Force in contingency operations.

162

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(7) Commander, SFOD-39 in Korea.
(8) Designated operations or plans staff officer positions at United States Special Operations Command, in a Theater
Special Operations Command (TSOC), or equivalent Joint Special Operations unit.
(9) Designated operations or plans staff officer positions in the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC) or Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center (DLIFLC).
(10) Preferred developmental assignments for SF majors include—
(a) Service as a Joint or combined staff officer. Special operations are inherently Joint operations and SF majors
should seek Joint or combined duty after their branch qualifying assignment.
(b) Service as a Special Forces assignment officer at AHRC.
(c) Attendance at the highly competitive Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP) at the School of Advanced
Military Studies (SAMS). The AMSP is a year of advanced study for selected officers that have completed ILE. It
provides a broad, deep education in the art and science of war at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels, followed
by a tour (normally after serving in a KD position) as an operational planner at USSOCOM, USASOC, a TSOC, or in
designated JSOTFs in contingency operations. When not in KD positions, SF officers who have completed AMSP will
serve repetitively in operational and strategic planning positions on the Joint/OSD staff, interagency staff, USSOCOM,
USASOC, and the TSOCs and can be expected to serve as J5s on JSOTFs during contingency operations.
(d) Attendance at the highly competitive Special Operations/Low Intensity Conflict (SO/LIC) Program at the Naval
Postgraduate School. The SO/LIC program is 18 months of advanced study for selected officers. It provides a broad,
deep education in the art and science of unconventional warfare at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels,
followed by a tour (normally after serving in a KD position) as an operational planner at USSOCOM, USASOC, a
TSOC, or in designated JSOTFs in contingency operations. When not in command, SF officers who have completed
SO/LIC may serve repetitively in operational and strategic planning positions on the Joint/OSD staff, USSOCOM,
USASOC, and the TSOCs and can be expected to serve as J5s on JSOTFs during contingency operations.
(11) There is much greater emphasis on self-development at the field grade levels, with the focus on more general
areas of knowledge rather than specific tasks. Officers without a masters degree are encouraged to enroll in a civilian
college or university to earn an advanced degree either off-duty or, if applicable, through a fully-funded program in
conjunction with ILE. However, completion of a master’s degree should not take precedence over completion of ILE or
successful execution of any assignment. SF majors should also maintain and enhance their foreign language and
cultural proficiency and continue their self-development program aimed at the mastery of UW doctrine, tactics,
techniques, and procedures.
c. Lieutenant colonel.
(1) KD for a SF lieutenant colonel is successful Service in any SF-coded lieutenant colonel position or combination
of positions. The most critical of these assignments is Service as a tactical, training, institutional, or recruiting battalion
commander (CSL billet at the battalion level), which develops the lieutenant colonel for future responsibilities. For the
majority of lieutenant colonels, promotion to lieutenant colonel constitutes success and assignments will be aimed at
developing the officer for broader contributions to the branch, the U.S. Army, and special operations in general.
(2) Preferred developmental assignments for SF lieutenant colonels include—
(a) Serve in a USSOCOM or TSOC designated JSOTF in a contingency operation.
(b) Service as DCO or XO of a SF group, within the 1st SWTG(A), or in an equivalent position at a SMU.
(c) Service as a DA, DOD, or JCS staff officer or in interagency positions requiring SF experience and expertise.
(d) Service as a staff officer or commander in a Joint or combined headquarters and earning a Joint Service skill
identifier.

or G–7.
(f) Service in USAJFKSWCS as the G–3, Directorate of Training and Doctrine XO, Special Forces Proponent Chief
(g) Service in USASOC as the assistant G–3, Command Group XO, or Deputy Chief of Staff.
(h) Service at AHRC as the SF officer Branch Chief or Enlisted Branch Chief.
(i) Service on the staff and faculty of the Command and General Staff College (CGSC).
(3) For self-development, SF lieutenant colonels focus on general areas of knowledge. They should enhance their
regional knowledge and improve their language proficiency as well as continue their mastery of UW.
d. Colonel.
(1) SF colonels continue to serve the branch, special operations, and the Army through Service in any SF-coded
colonel position or combination of positions within USSOCOM, USASOC, USAJFKSWCS, U.S. Army SF Command,
HQDA, Joint staffs, Service schools, and other key organizations.
(2) KD for a SF colonel is successful Service in any SF-coded colonel position or combination of positions. The
most critical of these assignments is Service as a tactical, training, institutional or recruiting commander (CSL billet at
the group or brigade level), or command of a designated JSOTF in a contingency operation, which develops the colonel
for continued responsibilities. SF colonel assignments will be aimed at developing the officer for broader contributions
to the branch, the U.S. Army, and special operations in general.

166

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Figure 17–2. SF WO Developmental Model

f. Branch and generalist assignments. SF Branch officers who remain in the MF&E functional category above the
rank of captain will have increasing opportunities to serve in branch and generalist assignments.
g. Joint and interagency assignments. SF officers can expect to be considered for Joint as well as interagency duty
assignments and should strive to serve in these critical positions. Due to the inherent Joint nature of SF operations, SF
Branch has the highest density of JDAL within the MF&E functional category. SF officers are utilized in Joint
organizations worldwide. Joint experience is important to the Army and essential to individual officers for their
advancement into senior leadership positions.
h. Combined assignments. SF officers/WOs can expect to be considered for duty as commanders or staff officers of
combined commands at a rate that equals or exceeds that of the other MF&E officers/WOs. Experience in combined
commands provides serious professional development to individual officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions.
i. Command selection criteria. The main criterion for SF command selection is a demonstrated manner of performance that is exceptional. To remain competitive for command selection in both SMUs and SF groups, officers should
balance key assignments in both types of units. SF officers are strongly encouraged to volunteer for recruiting and
garrison command consideration, as well as critical command and staff billets in Joint and Joint Special Operations
Task Forces (JTFs/JSOTFs).
17–5. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. Regional expertise results from language training and the initial SF group assignment. The goal of

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

167

SF officer professional development is to produce and sustain highly qualified, regionally oriented officers, and AHRC
will assign officers to further this goal.
b. Precedence.
(1) SF officers’ assignments to developmental leadership positions have precedence. Typically, SF Branch officers
should seek assignments in the following order:
(a) Command of an SFOD–A. This command will be the officer’s first assignment after completion of SF training.
(b) Battalion or group staff, SFOD–B XO, or designated specialty ODA.
(c) Service at the USAJFKSWCS, USASFC, or USASOC.
(d) The AMSP (preceded by ILE) or the SO/LIC Course.
(e) Command and General Staff Officer Course ILE or equivalent program.
(f) Command of a SF company, Service as an SF battalion S3 or XO, plans officer, operations detachment
commander or GSC commander, an SF group S3, or designated KD position.
(g) Joint assignment.
(h) Battalion level (CSL) command.
(i) SSC.
(j) Group level command.
(2) Active duty and RC SF WO assignments to positions of leadership and technical expertise have precedence.
Typically, SF WOs should seek assignments in the following order:
(a) SFOD–A assistant detachment commander.
(b) Company (SFOD–B) operations WO.
(c) Battalion (SFOD–C) operations WO.
(d) SF group operations WO and/or senior WO advisor to the commander.
(e) Operations WO, or staff officer/instructor/writer at USAJFKSWCS, USASFC(A), USASOC, or a Joint assignment may be sought after promotion to CW3. (Applicable to RC when serving on Active Duty orders).
17–6. Duration of developmental officer life cycle assignments
a. SF Branch KD positions. All SF captains will optimally serve 24 months in their KD position at an SF Group as
a SFOD–A commander. The goal is for all SF majors to serve for 24 months in a KD position. Majors will serve in an
operational, training group, or other 18A coded position designated as KD.
b. SF Branch life cycle. Figure 17–1, above, displays an Active Army SF Branch life cycle with key and preferred
developmental positions.
c. Special Forces Warrant officer life cycle. Figure 17–2, above, displays an Active Army SF Branch life cycle with
key and preferred developmental positions.
17–7. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for SF Branch officers who remain in the MF&E
functional category. To accomplish this, the field grade inventory must be structured to meet branch authorizations, to
provide sufficient flexibility in supporting branch and generalist participation, and to allow all SF officers to serve in
KD assignments for the period needed to achieve requisite professional development.
b. Captain accessions. The goal for all captains is to graduate SFDOQC between 5 to 6 years in Service in order to
serve in SF assignments and obtain professional development in SF prior to consideration for promotion to major.
Captain accessions requirements are validated in an annual mission requirement letter from CG, USAJFKSWCS to
DCS, G–1.
17–8. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Special Forces
a. Structure. SF structure is somewhat different from that of the other maneuver, fires and effects because of its high
officer content and absence of lieutenants. Its structure will continue to reflect those characteristics for the foreseeable
future.
b. Acquire. SF is a non-accession branch.
(1) The U.S. Army Recruiting Command recruits officers as SF volunteers. Officers are accessed upon selection for
promotion to captain and normally complete all training and reach their first operational assignment two years later.
Over 400 officers typically apply each year, of these approximately 155 successfully graduate SFDOQC and branch
transfer into SF. The accessions window for applicants is the ARSOF Officer Accessions Board, which is conducted
following completion of the Captain’s Promotion Board.
(2) SF WOs are accessed from all CMF 18 MOSs. The Directorate of Special Operations Proponency (DSOP),
USAJFKSWCS will publish recruitment guidance each fiscal year. The primary recruiters for new accessions are SF
WOs. Individuals meeting MOS 180A prerequisites will submit an application packet through their respective chain of
command to DSOP, USAJFKSWCS for proponency validation. Once validated, Active Duty applications will be
forwarded to the United States Army Recruiting Command where a centralized WO selection board will select best

168

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

qualified applicants based on the needs of the Army. ARNG applications will be returned to The Adjutant Generals’
office of the relative state where a Federal Recognition Board will be conducted to select best qualified applicants.
Board selected individuals will be scheduled to attend the SF WOTTC Course at USAJFKSWCS, Fort Bragg, NC.
c. SF officer training prerequisites.
(1) Officers applying for selection for SF training must meet the following prerequisites:
(a) Be a male volunteer for SF training in accordance with course information found at ATRRS online.
(b) Be in their third year of active Federal commissioned Service (AFCS) when the SF accession board meets
(Active Army only).
(c) Be a captain or selected for promotion to captain.
(d) Have enough time remaining as a captain to complete SF training and serve a minimum of three years in a SF
unit before DA centralized selection board consideration in the primary zone for promotion to major. This is in order to
permit completion of KD assignments and gain sufficient SF experience prior to selection for major.
(e) Be airborne qualified or volunteer for airborne training.
(f) Have passed the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT), in the 17– to 21–year–old age category, with a minimum of
240 points overall and passing in each event.
(g) Be able to swim 50 meters unassisted while wearing the full Army combat uniform (ACU) with boots.
(h) Have scored at least 85 on the Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) or meet USAJFKSWCS language
school graduation standards on the Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) in a Special Forces required language
(other than English).
(i) Have met the medical standards for SF training per AR 40–501.
(j) Possess a Secret security clearance and be eligible for a Top Secret security clearance.
(k) Be a resident MCCC graduate by the time of enrollment in the SFDOQC. Normally, officers will attend the SF
Assessment and Selection (SFAS) Course prior to resident MCCC attendance.
(2) Branch transfer policies.
(a) Although SF Branch controls volunteers throughout their SF training, they remain members of their basic
branches of assignment during training. The training pipeline begins with TDY attendance to SFAS, which must be
successfully completed in order to continue on to subsequent phases of SF qualification training. Upon successful
completion of SFDOQC, the officer is assigned to his first SF operational unit. AHRC branch transfers officers to SF
upon successful completion of the SFDOQC. Officers failing to be selected at SFAS or failing to achieve SFDOQC
course standards will be returned to their initial branches of assignment.
(b) Officers who completed SF training as enlisted Soldiers must still successfully complete SFDOQC prior to
branch transfer to SF, but will normally not attend SFAS or SUT training. SERE training will not be required for those
who have already completed the SERE Level C (High Risk) Course.
(c) Active and RC SF qualification training requirements are identical. Officers who successfully complete the
Active Army 18A SFDOQC as reservists do not have to repeat SFDOQC training if accessed into the Active Army.
(d) The CG, USAJFKSWCS, is the final waiver authority for course prerequisites as well as SF qualification and
branch transfer requirements. All requests for waivers should be addressed to the CG, USAJFKSWCS, ATTN:
AOJK–SP, Fort Bragg, NC 28310–5200.
(3) Active and RC SF WO training requirements are identical. SF NCOs applying for selection for SF WO (MOS
180A) training must meet the following prerequisites:
(a) U.S. Citizenship (no waivers).
(b) General technical (GT) score of 110 or higher (no waivers).
(c) High school graduate or have a GED (no waivers).
(d) Secret security clearance.
(e) Pass the standard 3-event APFT in accordance with FM 21–20 and meet height/weight standards in accordance
with AR 600–9.
(f) Pass the appointment physical for technicians as verified by appropriate medical authority on USAREC Form
1932.
(g) All Applicants must have 12 months remaining on their enlistment contract.
(h) Be less than 46 years of age.
(i) Be serving as a SSG (E–6) or above.
(j) Hold at least one CMF18 MOS.
(k) Have a minimum of three years experience at the SFOD–A level.
(l) Current DLPT with at least a 1/1 foreign language proficiency score; or a DLAB minimum score of 85.
(m) Meet the medical fitness standards for SF duty. NOTE: Verification statement by appropriate medical authority
to be included on USAREC Form 1932.
(n) Letters of recommendation from the chain of command through the first SF colonel/O6, as well as a senior SF
WO, as well as the group senior WO.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

169

(o) The CG, USAJFKSWCS, is the final waiver authority for MOS prerequisites.
d. Distribute. Careful management is required to balance the need to retain sufficient experienced officers in the
branch with the need to keep the inventory small enough to provide them adequate opportunity for sufficient KD
assignments to achieve requisite professional development. Every effort will be made to provide professional development opportunities for SF officers to ensure they are able to compete for advancement.
e. Deploy. SF officers must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all times.
Whether assigned to deployable TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA organizations, all SF
officers must be deployable and able to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. SF officers may
deploy on short notice with their units to conduct combat operations, deter potential adversaries, and to protect national
interests, or as individuals to support Joint and multinational combat operations or sustainment and support operations.
SF officers must prepare themselves and their Families for this most challenging life cycle function.
f. Sustain. Recent OPMS updates change the manner of execution in some areas affecting officer career
development.
(1) Promotion. Following functional category designation, SF Branch officers will compete for promotion only
within the MF&E functional category.
(2) Command. SF Branch lieutenant colonel and colonel commanders will continue to be centrally selected for
command in four functional categories: operations, strategic support, recruiting and training, and installation. The
results of the command selection process are announced in the CSL. The SF personnel proponent at the
USAJFKSWCS closely monitors the number of commands available to SF officers in order to achieve branch
professional development on par with that of the other MF&E functional category branches. A special DA board fills
selected SMU commands. Officers are selected to command SMUs generally in lieu of CSL commands, not as a
second command. Selected SMU positions are designated as second commands.
(3) OER. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and officer personnel management.
Starting with captain, the rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the functional category which best
suits his abilities and interests. SF raters and senior raters thus perform a critical function that helps ensure quality
officers are designated into both the MF&E functional category and other functional categories.
g. Develop. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments
in TOE units with troops, staff/TDA billets, Joint and coalition assignments, and institutional training positions. Selfdevelopment continues to be an essential component of officer development. The goal is to professionally develop
officers to expertly conduct SF operations in support of the combatant commanders. Development occurs through the
Army school system as well, with all officers selected for promotion completing some form of resident PME training,
in accordance with OPMS and functional category CF guidelines.
h. Separate. The branch separation process remains the same as for the rest of the Army.
17–9. Special Forces Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. RC captain, major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel branch transfer and developmental requirements are the same as for Active Army officers. Due to geographical and recruiting realities of the ARNG
system, lieutenants may be assigned to SF companies.
b. Developmental opportunities. RC captain, major, lieutenant colonel and colonel key and primary developmental
assignments as well as branch transfer requirements are the same as for Active Army officers. ARNG officers may not
find a SF unit with openings at their grade or may be ineligible for promotion until finding a troop unit position at the
proper grade. RC officers’ civilian careers and other considerations may limit them to serving in geographically
available units. Other options for such officers include duty in the IRR with possible IMA program positions or shorttour positions, AGR program positions, or positions in non-SF units. Some officers may have to branch transfer. A RC
officer may branch transfer several times during his career and may not be able to follow the normal SF career model.
c. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for SF officers is shown at figure 17–3,
below.

Chapter 18
Psychological Operations Branch
18–1. Unique features of the Psychological Operations Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Psychological Operations (PO) Branch. PO are special purpose forces capable of
providing a deliberate response of extended duration or rapid response to contingencies throughout the world. Their
mission is to conduct PO across the full range of military operations in any operational environment in war, peace, or
contingencies. PO forces expand the range of available options in a variety of scenarios. They provide capabilities not
available elsewhere in the armed forces or other Governmental agencies. PO are inherently Joint, usually bilateral and
interagency in nature and are focused at the operational and strategic levels. PO are frequently conducted by, with or
through platforms key communicators and media of other forces, organizations, agencies or nations, and are typically
not attributed to U.S. Army PO personnel or units.
b. Unique functions performed by the PO Branch. PO branch is a SOF branch in the MF&E functional category,
consisting of officers in the grade of captain through colonel. As representatives of the United States in a foreign
country, PO personnel serve as diplomats as well as warriors. In war, PO provides unique combined and unilateral
capabilities to the combatant commander. They may interact closely with and live under the same conditions as the
indigenous people, or they may work in highly restricted U.S. only facilities for particularly sensitive PO, activities,
and programs. They conduct peacetime operations and promote regional stability in areas where other U.S. military
forces normally do not operate. Their continuous forward presence assists in the operational preparation of the

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

171

battlespace that involves the disruption, degradation, and ultimate elimination of terrorist networks; influencing
information and ideas consistent with political and military objectives creating the conditions for stable development.
The mission of PO is to influence the behavior of foreign target audiences (TAs) to support U.S. national objectives.
PO accomplishes this by conveying selected information, indicators, and/or advising on actions that influence the
emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign audiences. Behavioral change is at the
root of the PO mission. Although concerned with the mental processes of the TA, it is the observable modification of
TA behavior that determines the mission success of PO. It is this link between influence and behavior that distinguishes PO from other capabilities and activities of information operations (IO) and sets it apart as a unique core
capability; force multiplier, and peacetime contributor.
c. Unique features of work in the PO Branch. PO personnel perform the following 5 core roles:
(1) Influence foreign populations by expressing information subjectively to influence attitudes and behavior, and to
obtain compliance, noninterference, or other desired behavioral changes. These actions facilitate military operations,
minimize needless loss of life and collateral damage, and further the objectives of the supported commander, the
United States, and its allies.
(2) Advise the commander on psychological acts (PSYACTs), PO enabling actions, and targeting restrictions that
the military force may execute. These actions and restrictions minimize adverse impacts and unintended consequences,
attack the enemy’s will to resist, and enhance successful mission accomplishment. PO Soldiers also advise the
commander on the psychological effects and consequences of other planned military actions and operations
(3) Provide public information to foreign populations to support humanitarian activities, restore or reinforce legitimacy, ease suffering, reduce confusion, and maintain or restore civil order. Providing public information supports and
amplifies the effects of other capabilities and activities such as civil-military operations (CMO).
(4) Serve as the supported commander’s voice to foreign populations to convey intent and establish credibility. This
ability allows the commander to reach more audiences with less expenditure in resources and time.
(5) Counter enemy propaganda, misinformation, disinformation, and opposing information to portray friendly intent
and actions correctly and positively for foreign TAs, thus denying others the ability to polarize public opinion and
political will against the United States and its allies.
d. Officer roles. PO officers (Branch 37A) plan, coordinate, direct, and participate in PO units performing the above
core roles in all operational environments. A POs captain commands a tactical PO detachment or an operational
detachment. The tactical PO detachment is a highly trained dissemination unit, which includes (in addition to the
commander) fifteen PO NCOs, and enlisted personnel. The PO operational detachment is a highly flexible organization
that consists of eight NCOs who hold the one of the specialties of PO, HUMINT collection or multimedia graphics
illustration. The successful OPDET must be adept at accomplishing a wide range of requirements including PO
planning, TA analysis, PO product development, and PO product testing and evaluation. Dissemination of OPDET PO
products is typically by, with or through platforms and media owned by other forces, agencies or nations, and is not
typically attributed to U.S. Army PO. Because of this, OPDET personnel must be adept at negotiating and working
with foreign and U.S. Government agencies and country teams. PO officers who successfully command a detachment
may later command larger PO units, at a larger detachment and at company level as a major, battalion as an lieutenant
colonel, and group as a colonel. They serve on upper echelon PO, Army and Joint Special Operations Forces (SOF)
staffs and in interagency assignments. They also serve as staff officers in division, corps, ASCC/Theater Armies and in
Joint Task Forces. There are a very high number of JIIM assignment possibilities and opportunities within the PO
Branch.
e. Assignment opportunities other than MTOE. In addition to operational positions, PO officers may serve on Joint,
interagency, USASOC, and the DA staffs, as staff and faculty of the USAJFKSWCS, CGSC/AWC and in a wide
variety of other SOF or branch immaterial positions worldwide. Due to the wide-ranging demands and opportunities
resident in the special operations community, the PO Branch remains a flexible, diverse force, with many individual
paths to professional success and promotion.
18–2. Characteristics required of Psychological Operations officers
a. Unique attributes. PO officers must—
(1) Be physically fit.
(2) Possess unquestioned integrity.
(3) Be self-reliant team players that can function as leaders in tightly knit small groups.
(4) Possess the cognitive resilience and mental dexterity to act autonomously while under great stress.
(5) Thrive in complex and ambiguous situations.
(6) Be mentally flexible and willing to experiment and innovate in a decentralized and unstructured environment.
(7) Have the ability to solve complex political-military problems and develop and employ conventional or unconventional solutions. Develop and employ non-doctrinal methods and techniques when applicable. Be capable of
decisive action for missions in which no current doctrine exists.
(8) Be able to inspire others to perform effectively under stress.

172

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(9) Possess good interpersonal skills and display political acumen and cultural sensitivity. Mission success will often
depend on an ability to establish rapport and influence the attitudes and behaviors of people from foreign cultures.
b. Unique skills. PO officers must—
(1) Be proficient in tactical level operations in their basic branches and experts in PO.
(2) Be tactically and technically expert in all capabilities required of a tactical PO detachment or an operational PO
detachment.
(3) Be capable of planning and conducting PO at the tactical and the operational levels interchangeably.
(4) Be subject matter experts and recognized authority in the Psychological aspects of warfare, Joint and interagency
operations, planning, operations, and intelligence as well as technical and tactical skills.
(5) Have an aptitude for learning a foreign language and must sustain foreign language proficiency throughout their
careers (Active Army only). This is one of the most important and difficult skills to gain and sustain and is critical for
all PO officers. Immediately after completing the 37A Psychological Operations Qualification Course (POQC), officers
who do not already meet the language requirements receive extensive foreign language training and cultural training
taught at the USAJFKSWCS and elsewhere, and must successfully meet all language course requirements (a score of 1/
1/1 on the DLPT) before joining a PO group.
(6) Be qualified military parachutists (Active Army only).
c. Unique knowledge.
(1) Completion of the POQC provides officers with entry-level knowledge of PO. As they develop, officers gain a
broader understanding of PO tactics, techniques, and procedures, the PO targeting and mission planning process, the
support and sustainment process for PO unique equipment and requirements, and the Joint, multinational, and
interagency aspects of PO.
(2) Active Army PO officers continuously undergo intensive preparation for assignment in their unit’s designated
geographic area. Whether the mission profile calls for employment in support of SOF in a denied area or a low
visibility military support to public diplomacy mission in support of a country team, the overall requirement for
regional orientation, language proficiency, and cross-cultural interpersonal skills remains the same. PO officers gain
and maintain area orientation through military and civilian schooling, language study, area study, mission preparation,
and repetitive operational experience during their careers. While initial language qualification is most often achieved
through formalized instruction, it must be maintained through practice and self-study. DLPT scores reflect language
proficiency and must be updated through formalized testing annually. Although only the Active Army PO units are
currently organized by AOC, the management of regional expertise is subject to modification as the needs of the Army
change.
18–3. Officer developmental assignments
Career development model is at figure 18–1, below.
a. Lieutenant. The PO Branch is a volunteer non-accession branch that draws its officers from other branches of the
Army. The USAREC Special Operations Recruiting Battalion (SORB) recruits PO, SF, and CA volunteers, in
accordance with the force stabilization procedures outlined in AR 600–35. PO officers are expected to have served a
successful initial tour as a lieutenant in a small unit leadership position in one of the Army’s other basic branches. As a
result they are expected to have knowledge of conventional Army operations and be experienced in Army leadership.
Lieutenants who volunteer in the targeted year group are selected by a DA centralized ARSOF accession board and
then go to a designated CCC to qualify for continued PO officer training.
b. Captain. PO candidates will be selected by a consolidated ARSOF board and scheduled for attendance to a select
CCC. Upon completion of CCC, the officer will then attend the PO training pipeline, consisting of POQC/language/
Advanced Regional Analysis Course (ARAC) prior to receiving an operational assignment.
(1) PO captains must successfully command a detachment.
(2) Captains will serve optimally for two years in a detachment command. This duty equates to company, battery, or
troop command in the other branches and is considered critical branch experience for a captain. Assignment as a
detachment commander will normally be an officer’s initial assignment following completion of their PO qualification
training.
(3) The branch objective at the detachment command level is to provide the operational force with the highest
possible quality leadership in order to execute missions in support of combatant command operational objectives and
requirements. Detachment command also provides a common base of experience, professional development, and
opportunities by which to develop and evaluate PO captains.
(4) The goal for a captain is 36 months assigned to CF 37 coded positions within a PO group. A captain serves 2
years as a detachment commander followed by company XO, a headquarters company commander at battalion, group,
or flag-level HQs, or staff officer at battalion or group level. Selection to a second command is appropriate for an
officer with high potential. This command time is in addition to the officer’s initial tenure as a detachment commander.
(5) Other preferred developmental assignments include—
(a) Service as an instructor at the POQC.
(b) Completion of the Naval Post Graduate School SO/LIC program. This program entails 18 months of graduate
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

173

study to include authorship of a thesis on a topic of current interest to the SOF community. It provides a broad, deep
education in the art and science of unconventional warfare at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels, and the
curriculum is accredited as an ILE course. Attendance entails a utilization tour as an operational planner at a division
or a corps HQ, or at USSOCOM, USASOC, TSOCs, a PO group, or in designated JSOTF/JOPTFs in contingency
operations.
(6) In addition to professional development through operational assignments, PO captains should begin an intensive
self-development program. Their efforts should focus on gaining an in-depth understanding of mass communications,
marketing, behavioral science, and advertising, gaining and maintaining regional and linguistic expertise and becoming
proficient in PO and common core and branch tasks.
(7) Active Army PO officers, as commanders of airborne units, are expected to successfully complete static line
jumpmaster training early in their careers.
c. Major.
(1) PO majors should successfully serve for approximately 24 months in any of the positions listed below or a
combination of these positions in order to meet critical branch experience requirements. The branch objective at the
major level is to provide the Army and the SOF) community with the highest possible quality leadership and mid-level
management in support of accessing, training, employing, and commanding PO forces worldwide. Additionally,
individual officers will be provided with demanding experiential and professional development opportunities focused
toward the individual’s abilities, attributes, skills, and desires, vice the commonality of experience at the captain
detachment level.
(a) Majors command PO line companies and PO detachments. Each PO detachment commander is responsible for
operational and strategic level planning for his/her geographical region and specified TAs, and two regionally oriented
operational PO detachments. Each PO development company commander is responsible for their company headquarters
and four subordinate PO detachments. Each tactical PO company commander is responsible for four tactical PO
detachments.
(b) The PO battalion S3 performs duties as the battalion operations, training, and plans officer, similar to other
MF&E S3s.
(c) The PO XO performs duties similar to other combat arms battalion/brigade XOs.
(d) Positions corresponding to the above in the 1st Special Warfare Training Group (Airborne) (1st SWTG(A)), or
an SMU.
(e) Designated positions corresponding to the above in a Joint Special Operations Task Force or JOPTF in
contingency operations.
(f) Designated operations/plans staff officer positions in USSOCOM, a TSOC, or equivalent Joint Special Operations unit.
(g) Other critical designated PO-coded positions.
(2) Preferred developmental assignments for PO majors include duty as a staff officer in a PO position at division
and corps, DA, major ASCC, Theater Army or major subordinate command (MSC) level, or as a SF group PO staff
officer.
(3) Other developmental assignments for PO majors include—
(a) Service as a Joint or combined staff officer. Psychological operations are inherently JIIM operations and PO
majors should seek Joint or combined duty after their key and developmental assignments.
(b) Attendance at the highly competitive AMS) at the SAMS. The AMSP is a year of advanced study for selected
officers completing ILE at the CGSC at Fort Leavenworth. It provides a broad, deep education in the art and science of
war at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels, followed by a tour after key and developmental assignment as an
operational planner at division or corps, USSOCOM, USASOC, a TSOC or in designated JSOTF/JOPTFs in contingency operations. When not in command, PO officers who have completed AMSP will serve repetitively in operational
and strategic planning positions on the Joint/OSD staff, interagency staff, USSOCOM, USASOC, and the TSOCs and
can be expected to serve as J39s on JSOTF/JPOTFs during contingency operations.
(c) Attendance at the Naval Post Graduate School SO/LIC program. This program entails 18 months of graduate
study to include authorship of a thesis on a topic of current interest to the SOF community. It provides a broad, deep
education in the art and science of UW at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels, and the curriculum is accredited
as an ILE course. Attendance entails a utilization tour as an operational planner at Division or Corps, USSOCOM,
USASOC, a TSOC, a PO group, or in designated JSOTF/JPOTFs in contingency at the highly competitive SO/LIC
program at the Naval Postgraduate School.
(4) There is much greater emphasis on self-development at the field grade levels, with the focus on more general
areas of knowledge rather than specific tasks. Officers without a master’s degree are encouraged to enroll in a civilian
college or university to earn an advanced degree either off-duty or, if applicable, through a fully-funded program in
conjunction with ILE. However, completion of a master’s degree should not take precedence over completion of ILE or
successful execution of any assignment. PO majors should also maintain and enhance their foreign language and
cultural proficiency and continue their self-development program aimed at the mastery of Psychological aspects of
warfare, (doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures) and mass communications and political theory.

174

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

d. Lieutenant colonel.
(1) Developmental requirements for a PO lieutenant colonel involve successful Service in any PO-coded lieutenant
colonel position or combination of positions. The most critical of these assignments is Service as a PO TOE or TDA
battalion commander (CSL billet), which develops the lieutenant colonel for future responsibilities as a senior
commander or staff officer. The main criterion for PO command selection is outstanding performance of duty. PO
officers are strongly encouraged to volunteer for all command consideration whether in operations, strategic support,
recruiting and training, and installation categories, as well as critical command and staff billets in Joint and Joint PO
Task Forces (JTFs/JSOTF/JOPTFs).
(2) The branch objective at the lieutenant colonel level is to provide the Army and the SOF community with the
highest possible quality leadership and senior management in support of accessing, training, employing, and commanding PO forces world-wide. For the majority of lieutenant colonels, promotion to lieutenant colonel constitutes success
and assignments will be aimed at developing the officer for broader contributions to the branch, the U.S. Army, and
special operations in general. However, since the PO structure provides relatively fewer lieutenant colonel command
positions than other branches, CSL-designated command is not the sole route to colonel. Officers should be promoted
based on their pattern of Service to the Army and potential for Service at the next higher grade.
(3) lieutenant colonel developmental assignments include—
(a) Service in a USASOC, USSOCOM, or TSOC designated JSOTF or JPOTF in a contingency operation.
(b) Service as DCO, XO, or S3 of a PO group.
(c) Service as a division, corps, or ASCC/Theater Army PO officer.
(d) Service as a DA, DOD, or JCS staff officer or in interagency positions requiring PO experience and expertise.
(e) Service as a staff officer or commander in a Joint or combined headquarters and earning a Joint Service skill
identifier.
(f) Service as Deputy G–3 or Deputy G–8, U.S. Army Special Operations Command or G–3, USAJFKSWCS.
(g) Service on the staff and faculty of the CGSC.
(4) For self-development, PO lieutenant colonels focus on general areas of knowledge. They should enhance their
regional knowledge and improve their language proficiency as well as continue their mastery of the Psychological
aspects of warfare, (doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures) and mass communications and political theory.
e. Colonel.
(1) PO colonels continue to serve the branch, special operations, and the Army through senior executive Service in
any PO-coded colonel position or combination of positions within USSOCOM, USASOC, USAJFKSWCS, HQDA,
Joint staffs, ASCC/Theater Army, combatant commands, Service schools, and other key organizations.
(2) Critical assignments include Joint staff (Deputy Director for Global Operations (DDGO)) J39 PO, command of a
PO group, USSOCOM Joint PO Support Element, command of a USSOCOM or TSOC designated JPOTF or JSOTF/
JPOTF in a contingency operation. The main criterion for PO command selection is outstanding performance of duty in
command at the lieutenant colonel level. PO officers are strongly encouraged to volunteer for command consideration
outside the PO branch in branch immaterial commands, as well as critical command and staff billets in Army, JTFs/
JSOTFs/JPOTFs.
(3) Primary developmental assignments include—
(a) Service as an ASCC/Theater Army or Joint staff officer or commander in a Joint critical position requiring PO
expertise.
(b) Service as Chief of Staff or DCS, G–3/5/7, USASOC.
(c) Service in the USSOCOM Joint PO Support Element.
(d) Service as assistant commandant, chief of staff, or directorate chief, USAJFKSWCS.
(e) Service with the Army Staff or with another Government agency.
(f) Service on the staff and faculty of the CGSC or AWC.
(g) Service on a combined staff.
(4) For self-development PO colonels focus on general areas of knowledge. Colonels should further enhance their
regional orientation and language proficiency and continue to follow an extensive professional self-development
regimen.
(5) Functional sharing-coded and immaterial "generalist" assignments. PO Branch officers who remain in the PO
Branch above the grade of captain will have increasing opportunities to serve in branch/functional generalist assignments, such as IGs and instructors. Officers are provided opportunities to work in FAs, in the same manner as do other
basic branches, but must volunteer for selection to do so.
(6) PO officers should expect to be considered for Joint duty assignments, and should strive to serve in these critical
positions. Due to the inherent Joint nature of PO, PO Branch has a very high density of JDAL positions. PO officers
are utilized in Joint organizations worldwide. Joint experience is important to the Army and essential to individual
officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions.
(7) PO officers can expect to be considered for duty as commanders or staff officers of combined commands at a

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

175

rate that equals or exceeds that of the other combat arms. Experience in the JIIM environment provides significant
professional development to individual officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions.
18–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. Regional expertise results from language training and the initial PO group assignment. The goal of
PO officer professional development is to produce and sustain highly qualified, regionally oriented officers to lead our
forces in combat, and AHRC will assign officers to further this goal.
b. Precedence. PO officers’ assignments to developmental leadership positions have precedence. Typically, PO
Branch officers should seek assignments in the following order:
(1) Command of a detachment. This command will be the officer’s first assignment after completion of POQC
training.
(2) Company XO
(3) Battalion staff (as an assistant S3 at battalion or group level), company command in a captain company
command billet, or PO company XO.
(4) Service at the USAJFKSWCS, USASOC, or in a generalist/branch immaterial billet.
(5) The AMSP (preceded by ILE) or the SO/LIC Course.
(6) ILE or equivalent program.
(7) Command of a PO company, battalion S3 or XO, group S3 or PSYDET commander, and/or other designated
branch critical assignment.
(8) Joint assignment.
(9) Battalion level (CSL) command or senior level SOF or Army developmental position.
(10) SSC.
(11) Group level (CSL) command or senior executive level SOF, Joint, or Army position.
18–5. Duration of developmental officer life cycle assignments
a. PO desired branch experience. The goal is for all PO captains and majors to serve for 24 months in KD branch
positions. All captains will serve in a PO group. Majors will serve in an operational group, training battalion, or other
specifically designated position.
b. PO Branch life cycle. Figure 18–1, below, displays an Active Army PO branch life cycle.

176

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Figure 18–1. PO Developmental Model

18–6. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Psychological Operations
a. Structure. PO structure is somewhat different from that of the other combat arms because of its high officer
content and absence of lieutenants. Its structure will continue to reflect those characteristics for the foreseeable future.
b. Acquisition. PO is a non-accession branch. The USAREC recruits PO volunteers through the special operations
recruiting battalion. Officers are accessed upon selection for promotion to captain and normally complete all training
and reach their 1st operational assignment 1–2 years later. Over 100 officers typically apply each year, of these
approximately 35 successfully graduate POQC and branch transfer into PO. The accessions window for applicants is
the ARSOF Officer Accessions Board, which is conducted following completion of the Captain’s Promotion Board.
The goal for all captains is to graduate POQC between 4 to 6 years in Service in order to serve in PO assignments and
obtain professional development in branch 37 prior to consideration for promotion to major. Captain requirements are
validated in an annual mission requirement letter from CG, USAJFKSWCS to DCS, G–1.
(1) PO training prerequisites. Officers applying for selection for PO training must meet the following prerequisites:
(a) Be a volunteer for PO training in accordance with course information in ATRRS online.
(b) Be in their third year of AFC when the ARSOF accession board meets (Active Army only).
(c) Be selected for promotion to captain (Active Army only).
(d) Have enough time remaining as a captain to complete PO training and serve 3 years in a PO unit before DA
centralized selection board consideration in the primary zone for promotion to major. This is in order to permit
completion of the key leader development assignments prior to selection for major.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

177

(e) Be airborne qualified or volunteer for airborne training.
(f) Have passed the APFT.
(g) Have scored at least 85 on the DLAB or met USAJFKSWCS language school graduation standards of a 1/1/1 on
the DLPT in a PO required language (other than English).
(h) Have met the medical standards for PO training per AR 40–501.
(i) Be eligible for a Top Secret security clearance.
(j) Be a CCC graduate by the time of enrollment in the POQC.
(2) Branch transfer policies.
(a) Although PO Branch controls volunteers throughout their PO training, they remain members of their basic
branches of assignment during training. The training pipeline begins with attendance at the POQC. The training
pipeline ends with the assignment of an officer to his/her first operational unit. AHRC branch transfers Active Army
officers to PO upon successful completion of the POQC (which includes the Advanced Regional Analysis Course and
language training). PO officer training is a multiple part entity with a single Active Duty Service obligation. Officers
failing to achieve POQC course standards will not be PO qualified and will be returned to their initial branches of
assignment. USAR officers will complete the Advanced Regional Analysis Course within three years of graduating
POQC.
(b) Officers who completed PO training as enlisted Soldiers must still successfully complete POQC prior to branch
transfer to PO.
(c) Active Army and RC PO qualification training requirements with the exception of language are identical, but
they occur at different points in the officer’s time line. Officers who successfully complete the Active Army 37A
POQC as reservists do not have to repeat POQC training if accessed into the Active Army.
(d) The CG, USAJFKSWCS, is the final waiver authority for course prerequisites as well as PO qualification and
branch transfer requirements. All requests for waivers should be addressed to the CG, USAJFKSWCS, ATTN:
AOJK–SP, Fort Bragg, NC 28310–5200.
c. Deployment. PsO officers must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all times.
Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA organizations, all PO officers
must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. PO officers may deploy on short notice
with their units to conduct combat operations, deter potential adversaries, and to protect national interests, or as
individuals to support Joint and multinational combat operations or operations other than war such as humanitarian and
peace keeping missions. PO officers must prepare themselves and their Families for this most challenging life cycle
function.
d. Sustainment. OPMS changes the manner of execution of 3 major areas affecting officer career development.
(1) Promotion. PO Branch officers will compete for promotion as a basic Branch within the MF&E functional
category. This eliminates the double counting which occurred previously when officers competed in both their branch
and their FA.
(2) Command. The PO branch lieutenant colonel and colonel commanders will continue to be centrally selected for
command. All PO officer command opportunities are in the operations command and key billet category. Armywide
these commands are organized into 5 functional categories: operational, strategic support, recruiting and training,
installation, and key billet. The results of the command selection process are announced in the CSL. The PO personnel
proponent at the USAJFKSWCS closely monitors the number of commands available to PO officers in order to achieve
branch professional development on par with that of the other branches.
(3) OER. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and officer personnel management.
Starting with captain, the rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the functional category which best
suits his abilities and interests. PO raters and senior raters thus perform a critical function that helps ensure quality
officers are designated into both MF&E and into other functional categories.
e. Development. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in TOE units with troops, staff/TDA billets, Joint and coalition assignments, and institutional training positions.
Self-development continues to be an essential component of officer development. The goal is to professionally develop
officers to expertly conduct PsO in support of the combatant commanders. Development occurs through the Army
school system as well, with all officers selected for major completing some form of ILE training, in accordance with
OPMS and MF&E functional category guidelines.
f. Separation. The branch separation process remains the same as for the rest of the Army.
18–7. Psychological Operations Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. RC captain, major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel branch transfer and developmental requirements are the same as for Active Army officers.
b. Developmental opportunities. RC captain, major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel branch critical and developmental assignments as well as branch transfer requirements are the same as for Active Army officers, with fewer SOF
assignments. RC officers may not find a PO unit with openings at their grade or may be ineligible for promotion until
finding a troop unit position at the proper grade. RC officers’ civilian careers and other considerations may limit them

178

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

to serving in geographically available units. Other options for such officers include duty in the IRR with possible IMA
program positions or short-tour positions, AGR program positions, ARNG PO positions or positions in non-PO units.
Some officers may have to branch transfer. An RC officer may branch transfer several times during his/her career and
may not be able to follow the normal PO career model.
c. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for PO officers is consistent with the Active
Army model, with fewer assignments available in special operations.

Chapter 19
Civil Affairs Branch
19–1. Unique features of Civil Affairs Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Civil Affairs (CA) Branch. CA (38A) is a non-accession branch that is aligned with the
maneuver fires and effects functional category. The branch identifies Soldiers and units organized, trained, and
equipped to command and conduct CA operations, and support of civil-military operations. The mission of CA forces
is to engage and influence the civil populace by planning, executing, and transitioning CA operations in Army, Joint,
interagency, and multinational operations to support commanders in engaging the civil component of their operational
environment, in order to enhance civil-military operations or other stated U.S. objectives before, during, or after other
military operations. These operations are conducted through, with or by indigenous populations and institutions, interGovernmental organizations, non-Governmental organizations, or other Governmental agencies applying all instruments
of national power. CA forms the nucleus of the Army’s civil-military operations expertise for U.S. Special Operations
Command (USSOCOM), Army SOF, Forces Command (FORSCOM) and conventional forces. CA forces provide
military capabilities not available elsewhere in the armed forces such as regional orientation, language, cross-cultural
communication, and civilian acquired skills. CA Soldiers and units operate independently or in support of assigned
forces. They interact closely with indigenous populations and institutions, inter-Governmental, non-Governmental
organizations, or other Governmental agencies.
b. Unique functions performed by the CA Branch. The focus of CA is the civil component of the operational
environment. CA forces enhance a commander’s ability to plan and conduct civil-military operations. The CA officer is
an expert in the command and employment of Civil Affairs individuals, teams, and units in support of these missions.
Employment of civilian core competencies by the CA Functional Specialist, found exclusively in the USAR, enables
the force to assess, monitor, protect, reinforce, establish, and transition political, economic, social, and cultural
institutions, and capabilities to achieve U.S. national goals and objectives at the strategic, operational, and tactical
levels of operation. Application of civilian core competencies found within the USAR CA functional specialties make
the CA Branch unique. These functional specialties fall in the systems or organizations of: public health and welfare,
public safety/rule of law, public administration/governance, public works/infrastructure, business administration/economic stability, and public education and information. Knowledge of these areas, coupled with detailed study of a
country’s people, culture, history, politics, economy, language, institutions, and its involvement with inter-Governmental and non-Governmental organizations are developed in military and civilian education programs, regularly scheduled
unit training, and in the civilian workplace. CA forces support missions across the full range of military operations. CA
units are oriented toward a specific region of the world and assigned areas of responsibility to regional combatant
commanders, but retain the capability of worldwide deployment and operations. They provide support to conventional
forces, SOF units, and interagency organizations. CA officers integrate the diplomatic, information, military, and
economic principles into the operations of the combatant commander they are supporting and units they command.
c. Unique features of work in the CA Branch.
(1) CA core tasks. CA core tasks include—
(a) Populace and resources control (PRC).
(b) Foreign humanitarian assistance (FHA).
(c) Civil information management (CIM).
(d) Support to civil administration (SCA).
(e) Nation assistance (NA).
(2) CA officer roles. The CA officer develops, plans, coordinates, commands, controls, evaluates, and transitions
strategic, operational, and tactical CA operations/civil-military operations policies, procedures, doctrine, and activities
for Army and JJIIM environments and commands. The CA officer serves in CA units or as the civil-military operations
staff officer (S9 or G9) on a commander’s staff. These positions require—
(a) General military expertise and knowledge to interface with other special, general, combined arms JIIM staffs.
(b) Ability to plan, direct, execute, and transition CA operations and synchronize CA operations with the Information Operations Campaign Plan.
(c) Integration with the supported staff to facilitate maneuver operations, provide foreign humanitarian assistance,
and/or promote legitimacy of U.S. objectives.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

179

(d) Preparing a civil-military operations estimate, CA annex, and conducting CA assessments.
(e) Planning, establishing, and operating a Civil-Military Operations Center.
(f) Establishing and evaluating civil-military measures of effectiveness.
(g) Identifying, conducting, and transferring civil-military transition tasks to non-Governmental organizations, interGovernmental organizations, indigenous populations, and institutions or interagency organizations.
(3) Regional expertise. Regional expertise is a distinguishing characteristic of CA officers. CA officers maintain
individual and unit readiness to conduct CA operations in support of civil-military operations in their assigned region
of orientation. This is accomplished through continuing education, maintaining language proficiency, country studies,
and numerous operational and training deployments. This regional focus, coupled with specific cultural awareness,
ensures relevant CA support to theater operational plans, contingency plans, functional plans, combatant commanders,
and ambassadorial initiatives.
(4) Opportunities to lead and command. The CA officer may be selected to lead a variety of traditional and nontraditional formations. On deployment operations, forces routinely include individuals and teams from other branches,
Services, and other countries supporting the full spectrum of CA operations and civil-military operations.
19–2. Officer characteristics required
a. Unique skills. The core competencies for CA officers are cross-cultural communications, regional expertise,
language ability, interpersonal skills, personal lethality (Warrior Ethos), adaptive thinking and/or leadership, and
technical proficiency. The CA officer is an expert in the command and employment of functional specialists, CA
individuals, teams, and units in execution of these missions. CA officers are unique within CA forces because they
provide special or unique civilian core competency skills listed in paragraph 19–1b, above. Foreign language skills are
acquired through institutional training, self-development, or unit training. The CA officer must achieve a DLPT score
of 1/1/1 in their target language. They must have the ability to solve complex political-military problems and develop
and employ conventional and unconventional solutions. They also must be able to devise and execute non-standard and
non-doctrinal methods and techniques when applicable to remedy unforeseen circumstances, and capable of decisive
action for missions for which no doctrine exists.
b. Unique knowledge. The CA officer applies their civilian knowledge and cultural expertise to support or enhance
the military operation. The CA officer understands how to interact effectively with civilian representatives of foreign
and indigenous populace and institutions located in the operational area. He/she is trained to assess how civil areas,
structures, capabilities, organizations, people, and events will help, hinder, or affect U.S. and coalition military
operations.
c. Unique attributes.
(1) The human dimension is the differentiating factor that separates CA forces from all other military organizations.
CA forces are people-centric. Though fully comfortable and capable in high technology oriented operations, their
unique strength is their ability to accomplish the goals and objectives of the nation by operating through, with, or by
indigenous or surrogate populations and institutions. CA forces do not operate in an environment of black and white
with clearly delineated boundaries. Their operational ethos is not defined by mathematical equations, force ratios,
platforms, or equipment. The CA forces unique operational area is people; the human dimension, the human sensor,
force multiplication, and ground truth. The CA forces Joint battlefield framework is space, air, land, sea, and the mind.
(2) CA officers must have capacity for independent action. CA officers must be warfighters able to work in remote,
austere, and often hostile environments. They must be able to make important decisions with little or no immediate
supervision. They must be self-reliant team players that can function as leaders in tightly knit small groups.
(3) Due to the nature of work, CA officers must be extremely mature professionals. Even at junior grades, they are
required to work at the highest levels of command organizations on sensitive issues, often briefing and advising general
officers, media representatives, and senior U.S. and foreign government officials. Through their actions and words they
often represent U.S. policy.
(4) CA officers must be adaptable, flexible, and capable of independent operations in unstructured environments.
They must be able to thrive in complex and ambiguous situations and work in, and understand, the complexities
associated with JIIM operations.
(5) CA officers must be diplomatic in their approach and be able to influence and persuade persons from other
cultures. They must possess good interpersonal skills and display political awareness and cultural sensitivity.
(6) CA officers must possess unquestioned integrity.
(7) CA officers must be physically fit.
19–3. Officer developmental assignments
a. Development overview. CA officer development will continue throughout their career life cycle with progressive
assignments in troop units, staff, and institutional training assignments. In addition, officers complete their PME
requirements in order to remain competitive for HQDA selection boards and professional growth. All officers selected
for major must complete some form of ILE training or its equivalent. All officers selected for colonel should complete
SSC. In addition, self-development is key to all CA officers. The uniqueness of the branch requires officers to develop

180

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

regional expertise and a foreign language capability through self-development. The development goal is to access CA
officers at the tactical level and grow them to be CA campaign planners at the strategic level in support of combatant
commanders.
b. Career life cycle development. The Civil Affairs Branch is a non-accession branch that draws its officers from all
other U.S. Army branches. The USAREC special operations recruiting battalion (SORB) recruits Active Army PO, SF,
and CA volunteers, in accordance with the force stabilization procedures outlined in AR 600–35. CA officers are
expected to serve a successful initial tour as a small unit leader in one of the other U.S. Army branches as an lieutenant
in order to gain a working knowledge of conventional Army operations and tactics. Officers are accessed into CA as
senior first lieutenants, and captains. Upon completion of their CCC, they will attend the CA Qualification Course,

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

181

Army officers, this means completion of CCC, Airborne (if not already qualified), CA Qualification Course, Language
(1/1/1), and ARAC in order to branch transfer.
b. USAR TPU members. Upon acceptance for branch transfer, officers are managed as CA officers by AHRC–St.
Louis. The CA Branch assignments officer at AHRC–St. Louis will advise the officer on career progression, assignments, and will schedule the CA officer for PME as needed.
c. DIMA and IRR members. Upon acceptance for branch transfer, officers are managed as CA officers by AHRC–St.
Louis. The A Branch Assignments officer at AHRC–St. Louis will assign the officer to a CA position in a TPU or to a
CA DIMA position. The assignments officer will continue to advise the officer on career progression, assignments, and
will schedule the CA officer for PME as needed.
d. Assignment and schooling requirements. CA officers must complete their operational assignments and schooling
to be considered best qualified in the branch at each grade. By meeting these requirements the officer has acquired the
skills and knowledge to remain proficient in the CA Branch at that grade and is best qualified for promotion in the
branch. Officers are strongly encouraged, however, to attain exceptional qualification requirements in the CA Branch at
each grade. Meeting exceptionally qualified requirements will increase the officer’s probability of being selected for
promotion. Meeting exceptionally qualified requirements will also improve the possibility of command selection for
lieutenant colonel and colonel grades. Officers at all grades must recognize, however, the importance of performance in
all assignments.
e. KD assignments. The following list of assignments for first lieutenant/captains through colonel are recommendations to make the CA officer the best qualified in the CA Branch at each grade and exceptionally qualified for future

readings and mastery of branch skills. Complete a master’s degree in one of the CA disciplines; complete continuing
education programs in acquired civilian skills, if applicable; and meet special operations forces validation requirements.
19–5. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. The assignment of CA officers is based upon the needs of the Army, the regional alignment of the
officer and the desires of the individual officer. Worldwide assignments are available. The goal of CA officer
development is to produce officers that can assimilate into Army and JIIM staffs and immediately integrate CA plans
and principles into the deliberate planning process.
b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions has precedence, although there is flexibility on the
sequence of assignments. Ideally, CA branch officers should seek assignments in the following order: CA team, CA
company, and/or functional specialty team leader; staff officer at the battalion, brigade, CACOM, DRU, ASCC, or
ACOM level; executive officer, and command at the company, battalion, brigade, command level. In addition,
assignments at the Joint, SOCs, Joint theater staffs, HQDA, and OSD are important to Army and essential to
individuals officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions.
19–6. Duration of developmental officer life cycle assignments
a. CA KD assignments. Officers in the CA branch should serve ideally for a minimum of 12 months with a goal of
24 months in the following types of assignments:
(1) Commanders of CA commands, brigades, battalions, and companies.
(2) Primary CMO staff officer (S5/G9) in BCTs, SF groups, Ranger Regiment, or division HQs
(3) Staff officers, at all levels, in CA units.
(4) CA functional team and section leaders, at all levels, in CA units.
(5) CA instructors in Service schools, including Joint Service schools.
(6) Unified and specified command staff positions that plan civil-military operations and civil affairs operations.
(7) Members of CA support teams, for example, theater, operational, tactical in a theater of operations.
b. CA branch life cycle. Figure 19–1, below, displays the CA branch life cycle with KD positions.

184

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Figure 19–1. CA Developmental Model

19–7. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for CA branch officers. The numbers of CA authorized billets
allow adequate career progression for CA officers.
19–8. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Civil Affairs
a. Structure. Structure changes to CA MTOEs will be implemented in fiscal year (FY) 2007 through FY2009.
b. Acquire. Officers recruited into the branch should be in the grade of O–2 and O–3, have troop leading experience,
and as a minimum be a CCC graduate from a U.S. Army basic branch.
c. Distribute. Under OPMS, CA officers will only serve in CA and branch immaterial positions. Only Civil Affairs
officers are authorized to fill Civil Affairs positions and command Civil Affairs units. The CA Assignments Branch,
MF&E Division at AHRC-Alexandria, officer Personnel Management Directorate (OPMD) manages Active Duty CA
officer assignments. Team four, officer Management Division at AHRC-St. Louis manages USAR CA officer
assignments.
d. Development. The CA Qualification Course is the branch-producing course for all CA officers. ARAC further
prepares the officer to work in a specific area of the world with enhanced understanding of the diplomatic, political
military, and economic considerations for that region. ARAC is required for all officers (Active Army will complete as
captains, USAR will complete within three years of their graduating CA Qualification Course). Active Army officers
will be required to attain and maintain language proficiency at the 1/1/1 level. Officer development will continue to
occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in TOE units with troops, staff/TDA assignments,

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

185

JIIM, and institutional training assignments. Self-development continues to be an essential component of officer
development. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly conduct CA operations in support of the war
fighting combatant commanders. Development starts in the Army school system. All officers selected for major should
complete ILE and should work to obtain a master’s degree as discussed earlier. All lieutenant colonels should strive to
complete JPME II. All colonels should complete SSC.
e. Deployment. CA officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide
on short notice. All CA officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of operations. CA
officers may deploy with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests. CA officers and
enlisted Soldiers may be deployed as individuals to support operations in all JIIM environments. CA branch officers
must prepare themselves and their Families for this most challenging career development function.
f. Transition. The separation process is the same as for all Army officers.

Chapter 20
Information Operations Functional Area
20–1. Unique features of Information Operations functional area
a. Unique purpose of Information Operations FA.
(1) Information operations (IO) are the integrated employment of the core capabilities of electronic warfare,
computer network operations, PO, military deception, and operations security, in concert with specified supporting and
related capabilities, to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp adversarial human and automated decisionmaking while
protecting our own. IO engage enemy, adversary, neutrals, and others in the information environment to influence
perceptions, affect actions, and generate a range of effects in the information environment. IO includes the use of
capabilities to influence perceptions of foreign and friendly audiences. FM 3–13, when revised and published, will
contain detailed information about Army IO.
(a) The ultimate objective of IO is to achieve an operational advantage that contributes to mission accomplishment.
Military operations are undertaken to achieve national objectives. Army commanders understand they will plan,
prepare, and execute full spectrum operations as part of a JIIM team. Hence, their IO must be nested with and reinforce
the strategic communication themes and messages, to include performing tasks that may be assigned in support of
defense support to public diplomacy or military diplomacy.
(b) The success of Army full spectrum operations in general, and stability operations in particular, depends largely
on promoting positive perceptions and attitudes of a host population. This shapes the land AO for political, social, and
economic normalization. Commanders use IO and related activities to build trust and confidence, communicate
information, promote support, and counter effects from enemy IO propaganda, misinformation, rumors, confusion, fear,
and apprehension. Where the use of force is restricted or is not a viable option, IO can influence attitudes, reduce
commitment to a hostile cause, and convey the willingness to use force without actually employing it. Information used
in this manner allows friendly forces to accomplish missions faster, with fewer casualties and enduring effects.
(c) IO on land differs fundamentally from IO in the air and sea. Ground forces are immersed in the sociocultural
mosaic of native populations. Populations typically comprise diverse social groups, often with diametrically opposed
interests, objectives, cultures, and norms. Hence, in additional to employing the traditional capabilities of IO against
adversaries, land component commanders confront the challenge of orchestrating information engagement activities
among the disparate social groups in their AO. Army commanders think of IO in terms of effects they must generate to
achieve an operational advantage that leads to mission accomplishment rather than as a set of information-related tools.
(2) Army doctrine retains the definition, intent, and essence of Joint IO doctrine. Due to the nature and scope of
land operations, however, the Army discharges the IO capabilities a bit differently while still nesting them in the
context of JIIM operations. The responsibility, authority, and accountability for coordinating and synchronizing the
disparate IO capabilities is assigned to the staff principals. These principals have the capability, capacity, and expertise
to optimize the IO capabilities.
(3) Army IO tasks include military deception, operations security, command and control engagement, information
protection, and information engagement.
(a) Military deception. The G–5 has responsibility for military deception. It is coordinated and synchronized in the
plans cell. The responsibility for preparing, executing, assessing, and adapting military deception passes to the G–3
current operations cell in accordance with unit standing operating procedure or upon direction from the commander or
chief of staff.
(b) Operations security. The G–3 has responsibility for operations security and physical security. Operations security
is coordinated and synchronized in the protection cell. The G–2 has responsibility for counterintelligence. The G–2
coordinates and synchronizes counterintelligence in the protection cell.
(c) Command and control engagement. Command and control engagement are actions involving the use of computer
networks, electromagnetic and directed energy, and physical attack to degrade or destroy adversarial command and

186

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

control or neutralize adversarial attack capabilities; and, actions to search for, intercept, identify, and locate or localize
sources of radiated electromagnetic energy for the purpose of threat recognition, targeting, planning, and conduct of
future operations. Command and control engagement comprises electronic attack, electronic warfare support, computer
network attack, computer network exploitation, and physical attack capabilities. The G–3 has overall responsibility for
command and control engagement. Command and control engagement is coordinated and synchronized in the fires cell.
The DCS, G–2 has responsibility for computer network exploitation and electronic warfare support; the DCS, G–2
coordinates and synchronizes computer network exploitation and electronic warfare support in the fires cell.
(d) Information protection. Information protection are active or passive measures to protect and defend friendly
information and information systems to ensure friendly access to timely, accurate, and relevant information while
denying adversaries the opportunity to exploit friendly information and information systems for their own purposes.
Information protection comprises information assurance, computer network defense, and electronic protect capabilities.
The CIO/G–6 is responsible for all three IO capabilities under information protection. The CIO/G–6 coordinates and
synchronizes information protection in the command, control, communications, and computer operations (C4OPS) cell.
(e) Information engagement. Information engagement is the integrated employment of public affairs, psychological
operations, combat camera, civil-military operations, counterpropaganda, and other means necessary to inform and
engage key audiences in the land force commander’s operational environment in order to create, strengthen, or preserve
a tactical or operational advantage that contributes to the accomplishment of the mission, which may include military
diplomacy or defense support to public diplomacy. By intent and in its effects, information engagement is the
operational and tactical application of strategic communication in the land force commander’s operational environment.
(4) The G–7 chairs the information engagement working group and is directly responsible for three primary
functions; coordinating, synchronizing, orchestrating, assessing, and adapting the information engagement activities of
public affairs, psychological operations, counterpropaganda, combat camera, military diplomacy, and defense support to
public diplomacy in accordance with the commander’s intent and guidance; harmonizing information engagement
activities with all other lethal and nonlethal means; and integrating information engagement activities into plans and
orders.
(a) The three functions serve to inform and engage the disparate audiences in the unit’s AO. All three functions aim
to achieve an operational advantage that contributes to mission accomplishment. By intent and in its effects, information engagement is the operational and tactical application of strategic communication within a land AO.
(b) The G–7 responsibilities include producing materials to participate effectively in the operations process. These
include the information engagement working group synchronization matrix, information engagement working group
targeting and intelligence requirements, and the command engagement plan. The plan includes face-to-face engagements by the command group, staff, and subordinate commanders. Ever cognizant of the civil, cultural, and political
environment in the AO, the G–7 ensures the operations process considers how actions proposed by the staff may
impact disparate audiences and information engagement plans. The proposed actions may have unintended as well as
intended consequences.
(c) To achieve the full benefit of information engagement operations, the G–7 must understand all the capabilities
available to the Joint force, including other IO capabilities. The coordination, synchronization, orchestration, and
integration of other unit capabilities, however, rest with the staff principals who have the capacity, capability, and
expertise to discharge them. Hence, all staff principals must achieve the full potential of their own IO capabilities.
They share the responsibility for producing synergistic effects from all the IO capabilities via the operations process.
(5) The CGl, Combined Arms Center (CAC) is the Army proponent for IO and the FA 30 FA.
b. Unique functions performed by the IO FA. The FA 30 officer as the G–7 (S–7) has staff responsibility for
information engagement. Unique functions performed by the FA 30 officer include:
(1) Coordinating information engagement capabilities for the corps, division, or brigade through the Chief of Staff
or G–3.
(2) Integrating and synchronizing information engagement actions into the overall operation.
(3) Assessing the effects of information engagement throughout the operations process and recommending adjustments as required.
(4) Integrating and synchronizing information engagement with operational and theater strategic-level
communications.
(5) Monitoring the effects of IO tasks on information engagement.
(6) Preparing the information engagement portions of plans and orders and recommending priorities for accomplishing information engagement tasks.
(7) Recommending information engagement means to achieve desired effects.
(8) Staff planning and supervisory responsibilities for establishing and supervising a G–7 (S–7) section.
(9) Integrating intelligence from the G–2 (S–2) into information engagement.
(10) Exercising staff coordination over the conduct of the overall information engagement effort.
(11) Recommending priorities for accomplishing information engagement tasks identified during planning.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

187

(12) Leveraging the capabilities of higher echelon agencies and units providing connectivity with national- and
theater-level information engagement agencies.
(13) Participating in targeting meetings.
(14) Recommending information engagement effects to influence adversary perceptions, decisions, and actions.
(15) Coordinating information engagement with other agencies (such as the U.S. Information Agency, U.S. Agency
for International Development, and U.S. Embassies and missions).
c. Unique features of work in the IO FA. Unique features of work include—
(1) Understanding cultural implications and use of information as a means to influence target audiences and events
across full spectrum operations.
(2) Integrating and synchronizing strategic communications efforts into operational requirements.
(3) Possessing Intellectual flexibility and an operational focus.
(4) Possessing interpersonal skills to integrate both military and nonmilitary resources.
20–2. Officer characteristics required
The FA 30 officers must have a secret clearance with eligibility for Top-Secret Sensitive Compartmented Information
(TS/SCI) access based on assignment requirements. FA 30 officers must immediately initiate procedures to obtain the
proper level of clearance upon notification of the FA 30 functional designation. Additionally, there are FA unique

prior to FA designation by filling a position on an IO staff. However, the FA 30 Career Manager at AHRC manages
only FA designated officers.
a. Information Operations FA qualification and development. Generally, FA 30 officers will receive initial IO
training before they begin a FA 30 assignment. After selection into FA 30, officers will attend the USAIOP FA 30
Qualification Course (QC) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The FA 30 QC is the sole credentialing course for FA 30
designated officers. The FA 30 QC develops FA 30 officers with the requisite competencies to serve successfully on
staffs at a BCT through corps. FA 30 officer participation in other Army educational opportunities is based on duty
performance and Army needs. A limited number of officers will be selected for fully-funded ACS or TWI programs.
Although it is not required for promotion consideration, a graduate degree should be a goal of every FA 30 officer.
(1) Captain. After selection to captain, officers FA designate at the 4th or 7th YOS. Captains designated as FA 30
officer and successfully complete the FA 30 QC are fully qualified at the rank of captain and competitive for
promotion to major. FA 30 captains serve as a member of a BCT S–7 or division staff. To meet the operational needs
of the Army and required time for institutional development, FA 30 assignment experience as a captain is not required
for promotion to major. Captains not selected for FA 30 through the FA designation board may receive fully-funded
ACS programs with a follow-on FA 30 assignment. These officers are candidates for FA designation into FA 30 upon
their selection to major.
(2) Major. FA 30 majors serve as BCT S–7 officer or in staff organizations at division or corps. These assignments
ensure that FA 30 officers sustain their knowledge and understanding of the operational force. All FA 30 officers will
attend an ILE common core course at a course location determined by USAIOP and AHRC career counselor. FA 30
officers that successfully complete the ILE common core course are JPME 1 qualified. A limited number of FA 30
officers will attend the SAMS, TWI, or an ACS program. Majors that successful complete the FA 30 QC and ILE
common core course, and have served 24 months cumulative Service in an FA 30 assignment, are fully qualified and
competitive for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
(3) Lieutenant colonel. FA 30 lieutenant colonels serve as G–7 primary staff officers at Army division headquarters
or at Army corps headquarters on a G–7 staff. Additionally, FA 30 lieutenant colonel serve on a Joint staff, combatant
command staff, Army staff, ACOM staff, ASCC staff, or Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) staff. Lieutenant colonels that
successful complete the FA 30 QC and ILE common core course, and have served 48 months cumulative Service in an
FA 30 assignment are fully qualified and competitive for promotion to colonel.
(4) Colonel. FA 30 colonels serve as G–7 primary staff officers at Army corps headquarters. Additionally, FA 30
colonel serve as FA senior practitioners on a Joint staff, combatant command staff, ACOM staff, ASCC staff, or DRU
staff. If not selected for resident SSC, FA 30 colonels should apply for the non-resident AWC Distance Education
Course.
b. Branch/FA generalist assignments. Captains and above can serve in branch/FA generalist assignments such as
ROTC, USMA faculty and staff, and Inspector General. Although not associated with a specific branch or FA, these
assignments are important to the Army.
c. Joint assignments. Joint FA 30 positions are on the JDAL. Officers assigned to those billets will receive the Joint
officer specialty skill identifier upon successful Joint tour completion. FA 30 officers are generally not considered for
Joint duty assignments until selection to major. Although Joint experience is important to the Army, not all FA 30
officers will receive Joint assignments. This will not adversely affect their selection to the rank of colonel.
20–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
The assignment sequencing in a FA is not as rigid as that of a branch. FA assignments should professionally develop
FA 30 officers in a variety of IO environments. After receiving initial IO training, FA 30 officers should seek different
types of responsibilities within the FA 30 structure to provide breadth to their IO experiences.
a. Preferences. The IO FA has diverse opportunities allowing numerous career development paths. Officers will
attend the USAIOP FA 30 QC course prior to initial assignment to a FA 30 position. By exception, officers may be
given an assignment prior to completion the FA 30 QC to meet operational mission requirements.
b. Precedence. Assignments to FA 30 positions deployed in support of the GWOT will have precedence, although
there is flexibility on the sequence of assignments. Some FA 30 assignments will require ACS, such as a master’s
degree program in IO from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. FA 30 officers will complete an
Army FA 30 assignment before assignment to a Joint command.
20–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
Most assignments for FA 30 officers will be 24 to 36 months in length. Tours may be longer in areas with a high
concentration of billets, such as the National Capital Region. Locations outside the continental United States will
continue to require specific tour lengths. There is no single position that fully qualifies an FA 30 officer. Figure 40–2
depicts an IO FA life cycle development model for an Active Army (Active Army) officer.
20–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
The FA 30 career progression goal is to maintain a viable career path for FA 30 officers. To meet these requirements,

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

189

the field grade inventory is prioritized to fill FA 30 authorizations for the current and future force requirements. FA 30
officers are provided sufficient time in assignments to fully qualify them before consideration for promotion.
a. Acquire. The criteria for selecting an officer into FA 30 include needs of the Army, type of civilian degree, and
grade point average, foreign language aptitude, duty performance, and personal preference. Personnel preference will
be determined by using AHRC’s FA Assignment Interactive Module Web page. The FA designation board occurs each
year in September.
b. Distribute. After functional designation into the FA 30 at the rank of captain, the FA 30 career manager at AHRC
manages FA 30 officers. Assignment to FA 30 positions, ACS, or to branch/FA generalist positions will depend upon
needs of the Army, professional development considerations, officer preference, and officer qualifications at the time of
assignment.
c. Deploy. FA 30 officers are warfighters, personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all times.
Whether assigned to TOE or TDA organizations, all FA 30 officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across
the full spectrum of operations. FA 30 officers may deploy with their units or as individual support to various
worldwide operations.
d. Sustain. FA 30 officers will compete within the functional category of MF&E for promotion to major, lieutenant
colonel, and colonel. The FA 30 career manager will monitor and manage all FA 30 assignments.
e. Develop. FA 30 incorporates a professional officer development plan offering maximum diversity for assignment
and schooling. FA 30 officers apply and develop IO skills through a series of progressively challenging assignments.
As IO officers progress through their careers, FA 30s become eligible for additional educational training, preparing
them for positions of increased responsibility.
f. Train. FA 30 officers attend the ILE common core course in resident at a course location site determined USAIOP
and the AHRC career counselor. FA 30 officers are JPME 1 qualified after successfully completing the ILE common
core course. Additionally, FA 30 officers are fully credentialed after successfully completing the USAIOP FA 30 QC.
g. Separate. FA 30 officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
20–7. Information Operations Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. RC IO officer development objectives and qualifications parallel those planned for
their Active Duty counterparts. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation through assignments in their basic
branches before specializing in FA 30 assignments.
b. FA qualification and development opportunities. RC officers should strive for IO assignments that yield the same
development opportunities as their Active Army counterparts. RC officers retain their basic branch with a skill
identifier for IO, since they do not FA designate into FA 30 through an AHRC FA designation board.
(1) The qualification standards at each rank, PME, and length of Service in FA 30 assignments are the same as for
Active Army officers.
(2) RC officers with IO skill identifiers can expect to serve in a theater IO group, TPU, as an IMA, or in an IRR
assignment. These varying assignments bolster total Army IO capabilities, develop officer’s leadership skills, and
increase the individual’s knowledge of the RC roles and mission.
(3) RC officers with civilian acquired skills in communications, marketing, organizational behavior, or other IOrelated fields are a valuable Army resource. Officers with skills in these areas through employment or civilian
education will be competitive for promotion and selection to IO positions of increased responsibility.
(4) RC officers should attend the same residence education courses as their Active Army counterparts.
c. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for IO officers is the same as Active Army
(see fig 20–1, below).

Public Affairs Functional Area
21–1. Unique features of the Public Affairs functional area
a. Unique purpose of the Public Affairs (PA) FA. PA is a FA aligned under the MF&E functional category. PA is an
element of command policy and decisionmaking that provides trusted advice and counsel on the public implications of
organizational operations. Army public affairs programs play a vital role in the ability of a command to meet its
military objectives. PA officers develop strategies, lead, and supervise the conduct of community relations, command
information, and media relations in support of this role. The PA officer’s principle role is to advise and counsel the
commander on how the unit’s operations will be comprehended by the affected publics both internal and external. The
officer then develops and executes effective public affairs operations designed to articulate and explain the commander’s actions to those affected in such a manner that they are informed in peacetime, conflict, and war. PA officers
provide commanders with the expertise and guidance to conduct public affairs operations and enhance the command’s
ability to collect, process, and act on information. Because mass media and information technologies reach audiences
immediately, PA officers assist the commander to anticipate and address the media impact on internal (command
information) and external (public information) audiences. PA has a complementary role to CA, SOF, and associated
roles with PO and IO. Trained and experienced A officers operate in a rapidly evolving and adapting information
environment and their activities enhance the capabilities of the other MFE branches. The DA Chief of PA is the
proponent for FA 46.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

191

b. Unique functions performed by PA FA. PA fulfills the Army’s obligation to keep the American people and the
Army informed and helps to establish the conditions that lead to confidence in America’s Army and its readiness to
conduct operations in peacetime, conflict, and war. This mission includes planning for and providing information to
Soldiers and government and contract employees on their roles, keeping Family members informed, explaining to the
American public what the Army is doing, maintaining effective relationships with communities and stakeholder groups,
anticipating and responding to issues that arise from media coverage or community interaction.
c. Unique features of work in Public Affairs FA. Effective Army PA requires the application of professional and
technical skills from the military and civilian sectors. PA officers are personal staff officers or principals who supervise
PA staffs, advise senior commanders and leaders, lead PA units, or serve on higher command PA staffs. They serve on
the personal staff at brigade and higher. They serve as instructors at the Defense Information School (DINFOS), Fort
Meade, Maryland and other institutions. They provide PA coordination at all levels of command and are responsible
for effective execution of the PA core processes.
(1) Advisor to commander and staff. PA officers provide the advice and counsel regarding the public (internal and
external) implications of all major decisions and actions. This role includes—
(a) Counseling commander and staff as to strategies to achieve information dominance and reduce misinformation,
rumors, uncertainty, fear, and enemy disinformation efforts.
(b) Participating in boards, working groups, cells, and advisory groups.
(c) Contributing to the preservation of public support.
(d) Advising the commander on military support to public diplomacy activities and strategies.
(2) Public affairs planning. The process of continuously assessing operational situations for PA implications,

information needs.
(e) Monitoring ongoing PA campaigns and the PA aspects of military operations, assessing their effectiveness, and
making adjustments as required.
(f) Supervising and executing the public affairs planning, policy, research, and resource management functions. This
role involves anticipating PA issues, developing solutions, and conducting follow-up analyses and following up to
adjust strategies.
(3) Execute information strategies. The development and execution of synchronized campaigns using all available
and appropriate methods of communicating messages to inform internal and external audiences and maintain two-way
communication with those audiences. This role includes—
(a) Acquisition of information to support message development.
(b) Production of stories, news releases, digital and Web-based media products, or other information products from
acquisition source material, which includes all aspects of editing and producing a final product.
(c) Distribution of products to target audiences through an appropriate medium; leveraging all appropriate components of the information environment to achieve maximum desired audience penetration.
(d) Protection of classified and operational information from inadvertent public release, enforcing security procedures at the source and monitoring the operational security of PA operations.
(4) Conduct media facilitation. The process of assisting media representatives in covering Army and Joint operations; maximizing their access to Soldiers while also maximizing the commander’s access to the media. This process
includes—
(a) Assisting media entry into the area of operations.
(b) Registering media representatives.
(c) Orienting media on coverage ground rules and ensuring they understand security policies.
(d) Arranging interviews and briefings; coordinating unit visits and unit escorts.
(e) Analyzing and providing thorough and timely responses to media queries.

(5) Conduct public affairs training. This process provides or coordinates PA training for Soldiers, government
civilians, contract employees and Family members, as well as specialty training for PA professionals, which includes—

192

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(a) Training conducted at the installation or home station.
(b) Integration of PA training into scenario development, staff exercises, field exercises, and CTC rotations.
(c) Management and support of professional development programs and training to support lifetime career progression of PA Soldiers and civilians.
(6) Community relations and outreach. This process maintains effective community relations that contribute to the
morale of Soldiers and their Families, directly supports public understanding of America’s Army, enhances the
projection and sustainment capabilities of Army installations, and garners hometown support for Soldiers and their
Families. Specific community relations efforts include—
(a) Evaluating community relations programs and public attitudes through formal, developed feedback mechanisms.
(b) Developing and managing of community relations programs such as commander’s councils and speakers’
bureaus.
(c) Planning and arranging special events, open houses, tours, speaking engagements, exhibits, and demonstrations.
21–2. Public Affairs officer characteristics required
a. General. PA officers are tactically proficient because of their basic branch training and assignments. This
grounding in the tactical and operational Army is vital to success and credibility as PA officers. Because their roles and
duties require them to explain the Army and its operations to a wide range of external and internal audiences, PA
officers participate in ongoing operational professional military education and maintain a sound grasp of Army doctrine
and warfighting knowledge throughout their careers. All PA officers require security clearances and access to programs
to perform their duties at the level to which they are assigned.
b. Unique skills. FA 46 officers form a pool of highly qualified officers capable of supporting tactical, operational,
and strategic level requirements in peace and war. FA 46 officers are required to display a wide range of skills,
knowledge, and attributes.
(1) Interpersonal skills. PA officers are part of the combined arms and Joint and expeditionary teams. They must be
confident, informed, and skilled in building teamwork within their staff organization and recognize they often
simultaneously belong to many teams; facilitating development of those teams. In addition, they must—
(a) Be effective, exemplary communicators with highly developed speaking and listening skills.
(b) Demonstrate outstanding leadership skills in tactical and institutional environments; apply those skills in dealing
with military and civilian personnel.
(c) Have highly developed coaching, mentoring, and facilitation skills.
(2) Conceptual and decisionmaking skills. A officers must have sound judgment and be both critical and creative in
their thinking. They routinely operate in high-level staff assignments where guidance may be minimal and close
interaction with senior level decisionmakers is frequent. They work in a dynamic, high tempo environment and must be
tactically and technically skilled, effective staff officers with the ability to synthesize data, and to communicate
information clearly. PA officers work independently and make decisions with little or no immediate supervision. The
ability to work under pressure and deal positively with stress is essential.
(3) Tactical and technical skills. PA officers must exhibit proficiency in professional knowledge, judgment, and
warfighting. They apply skills from the military and private sectors and must—
(a) Master and apply a comprehensive set of communication, counseling and advising skills to accomplish PA and
military support to public diplomacy missions.
(b) Incorporate and apply advanced automation and information management skills to the Public Affairs FA.
(c) Be the Army’s experts in all forms of internal, external, interpersonal, organizational, intercultural, and mass
communications, to include training others in communications skills.
(d) Be innovative, adaptive, and at ease when operating in JIIM operations.
c. Unique knowledge. PA officers are well versed in current Army organization, structure, and doctrine. In addition,
they—
(1) Possess a comprehensive knowledge of public relations, organizational communications, and issue management.
(2) Remain current on developments in the civilian community for possible application to their area of expertise.
(3) Understand the implications of operating in the real-time and near real-time information battlespace and advising
commanders and staff in that aspect of operations.
(4) Observe, understand, assess, and operate in the greater geo-military political realm.
(5) Understand the impact of their actions and information strategies on the local, regional, theater-strategic, and
strategic battlespace.
d. Unique attributes. PA officers must exhibit intellectual honesty with superiors and be unafraid to state and defend
their convictions. PA officers must often deliver unpleasant news and persuade superiors to approve or accomplish
difficult or unattractive courses of action. They must—
(1) Possess a deep respect for the principles of Constitutional democracy. No one can effectively perform as an
Army PA officer without a thorough knowledge of the Bill of Rights and the conviction that the American people have
a right to know.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

193

(2) Realize they represent the Army and the commander first and have a specific mandate to help Army leaders gain
and keep public support for Army leadership goals.
(3) Understand a fundamental tenet of Army PA philosophy is that the best way to gain and maintain public support
is always tell the truth. Integrity is paramount.
(4) Be warfighters capable of leading change and accommodating ambiguity in the conduct of operations in the
global information environment.
(5) Be comfortable and confident in working in the Joint, combined, and interagency aspects of public information.
21–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. General. The goal of FA 46 development is to provide the Army a qualified, credentialed Public Affairs
professional and advisor to the commander and provide the individual officer a successful career within the MF&E
functional category. All FA 46 officers begin their careers in one of the Army’s accession branches and attend branch
basic and advanced courses. Officers who have served successfully in company grade positions are highly desired for
designation to the PA FA in their 8th YOS. A small number of officers will be provided the opportunity for early
functional designation at their 4th year of commissioned Service following the CCC. Designation is based upon the
needs of the Army, officer preference, military experience, and, in some cases, civil schooling. Most officers will not
receive a FA 46 assignment until selection to major and functional designation into the MF&E functional category as a
PA officer. The most competitive officers are those who have served successfully as the PA officer in operational units.
b. FA qualification and development. Attendance at the Defense Information School’s Public Affairs officer Qualification Course (PAOQC) is mandatory for all FA 46 officers prior to their first FA 46 assignment. FA 46 officers,
whose first Public Affairs assignment is with the American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS) or a
Broadcast Operations Detachment (BOD) for RC officers, attend specialized training in the management and administration of AFRTS networks after attending PAOQC. FA 46 officers assigned to AFRTS or BOD positions later in their
career will attend this training en route to the assignment.
(1) Captain. Experience in the PA FA at the rank of captain is not a requirement for promotion to major, but could
enhance selection to PA during the functional Designation Board (FDB) process. FA 46 captain positions are key
developmental billets, but in the current OPMS system are not crucial to career progression in the FA. At this level,
officers can serve as PA detachment commanders, mobile PA detachment team leaders, or division or higher PA staff
officers.
(2) Major. After selection to major, officers will be designated into one of the three OPMS CFs by an FDB. PA
officers in the MF&E functional category serve primarily in operational PA assignments. FA 46 majors should
aggressively seek key assignments in which they are the principal spokesperson for operational units or mobile PA
detachment commanders. Other qualifying jobs include nominative assignments on headquarters, DOD, and Joint
staffs. Majors who complete required developmental training and have served successfully for at least 24 months in a
PA assignment are considered qualified for promotion in the FA. They compete against other officers in the MF&E
functional category for promotion to lieutenant colonel. Completion of the ILE common core curriculum is essential for
all majors to be competitive for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
(3) Lieutenant colonel. Officers selected for lieutenant colonel should seek assignments of greater responsibility as
the primary PA officer in operational units. FA 46 lieutenant colonels are generally assigned to senior staff positions,
where they can fully use their knowledge of the Army and their FA. PA officers who have demonstrated high potential
will be assigned to flag-officer level commands and nominative positions on headquarters, DOD and Joint staffs, and
AFRTS network command positions. Lieutenant colonels are encouraged to seek PA assignments within Joint commands to gain the Joint and combined command exposure and experience.
(a) Professional development. A graduate degree in a public affairs related discipline is highly desired, but not
required, for FA 46 lieutenant colonels prior to primary zone consideration for promotion to colonel. Additionally, PA
officers are encouraged to seek professional accreditation through organizations such as the Public Relations Society of
America or the International Association of Business Communicators.
(b) FA qualification. FA 46 officers are considered FA qualified and eligible to compete in the MF&E functional
category for promotion to colonel if they have 48 months cumulative public affairs experience. They also must have
served in one of the following positions:
1. Principal PA officer. Principal PA officer for a 2-star or 3-star level commander for at least 18 months.
2. AFRTS lieutenant colonel level network commander. AFRTS lieutenant colonel level network commander for 24
months.
3. Director of an office of the Chief of PA field operating activity. All FA 46 officers should have served a
minimum of 18 months time in field grade operational or equivalent assignments, preferably as a primary PA officer,
prior to consideration for promotion to colonel.
4. Colonel. All FA 46 colonels should complete resident or nonresident SSC. As the senior practitioners in their FA,
they serve primarily on Joint, ACOM, ASCC or HQDA staffs. Key assignments include combatant commands and
ACOM or ASCC Public Affairs officer positions, director of Army Broadcasting Service, director of Army PA Center,
director of the Defense Information School, or division chief billets on the HQDA and DOD Public Affairs staffs.

194

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

c. Defense Media Center Assignments. The DMC was instituted by the 2005 Quadrennial Review Report to
consolidate the Services’ internal information efforts under one organization. The Soldiers Media Center, established in
2004 to consolidate the DA’s internal information effort, is the DMC Army element. The SMC includes—
(1) U.S. Army News Service.
(2) U.S. Army Soldiers Magazine.
(3) U.S. Army Soldiers Radio and Television.
(4) U.S. Army Element Army/Air Force Hometown News Service.
(5) Air Force Network (AFN)–Europe.
(6) AFN–South.
(7) AFN–Korea.
d. Office, Chief of Public Affairs (OCPA) field operating activities assignments.
(1) U.S. Army Office of the Chief of Public Affairs, Los Angeles.
(2) U.S. Army Office of the Chief of Public Affairs, New York.
(3) U.S. Army Office of the Chief of Public Affairs, Mid-West.
(4) Army Public Affairs Center.
e. Joint assignments. FA 46 officers will serve in Joint commands whether they are formally assigned to a JDAL
position. Officers assigned to JDAL positions will meet all JPME requirements. Pa units and officers routinely support
Joint operations. Pa officers should seek to attend all available Joint courses taught by DINFOS. Only officers who first
graduate the Joint and Combined Warfighting School prior to a follow-on Joint assignment will be designated as Joint
Specialty Officers (skill identifier 3L). FA 46 officers normally will not be considered for assignment to JDAL
positions until they have served an initial Army FA 46 assignment and been selected for promotion to major. Because
not all FA 46 officers will serve in JDAL assignments, the absence of a Joint assignment will not preclude their
selection to colonel.
f. Assignment preference and precedence.
(1) Assignment sequencing. Prior to their first FA 46 assignment, all officers will receive their initial FA training at
DINFOS. All PA officer assignments require graduation from the PAOQC. In addition to the PAOQC requirement, an
AFRTS assignment requires successful completion of the DINFOS Broadcast Management Course (BMC). It is
extremely important that an officer’s first FA 46 assignment be a position where the officer is personally supervised or
mentored by a senior PA officer and works with PA NCOs.
(2) Precedence. Some FA 46 billets will be designated as requiring ACS or TWI. Officers assigned to those jobs
must complete the required courses prior to reporting to their duty assignments. Officers selected for ACS should seek
degrees supporting strategic or mass communication and public diplomacy. Officers who have successfully completed
ACS and TWI programs will be assigned to jobs that provide the Army maximum benefit from this valuable training.
In some cases officers selected for ACS and TWI incur an additional Service obligation and designated assignment to
capitalize on that experience.
21–4. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. General. Most PA assignments are 36 months and will be synchronized with unit life cycle management to the
maximum extent possible. Tours could be longer in areas with a high concentration of PA positions. OCONUS
locations will continue to require tour lengths specific to those regions. This strategy will allow officers to attend
public affairs FA training en route to their PA assignments as required.
b. Key PA FA qualification assignments. PA detachment commanders should serve for 18 to 24 months. Mobile PA
detachment commanders should serve for 24 months. Unless assigned to a short tour area, PA assignments should be a
minimum of 24 months; however, the goal is to serve at least 36 months. AFRTS network commanders serve for 24 to
36 months per theater assignment policies.
c. PA FA life cycle. Figure 21–1, below, depicts the PA life cycle model.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

195

Figure 21–1. PA Officer Active Army Developmental Model

21–5. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is sustain a cadre of highly qualified PA officers while providing a viable career path to colonel
for high-potential FA 46 officers. FA 46 officer inventory must be optimized to fulfill PA requirements while providing
sufficient time for FA qualification prior to consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel and colonel.
b. OPMS implementation. The number of authorized FA 46 authorizations, by grade, will vary as force structure
decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more information on current authorizations or inventory should contact the AHRC FA 46 assignments officer. Figure 21–1, above, provides a good overview
of assignment opportunities. PA maintains a professional forum and collaboration site within Army Knowledge Online
with additional information.
21–6. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Public Affairs
a. Structure. PA officers serve in all echelons worldwide. FA 46 positions exist in Army operational units,
headquarters staffs, Joint commands, and national agencies.
b. Acquire. FA 46 officers comprising a particular year group are designated into the FA at their 4th year, for a
select few, and 8th YOS. The criteria for selecting an officer to the PA FA include manner of performance, civilian
degree concentration, grade point average, and personal preference.
c. Distribute. After designation into the MF&E functional category and FA designation as PA the AHRC Career
Management Division will manage FA 46 officer assignments. FA 46 officers will be assigned in accordance with
force stabilization strategies.
d. Deploy. PA is a high demand, low density CF. FA 46 officers are warfighters who remain personally and
professionally prepared to deploy worldwide. The majority of FA 46 officers are assigned to TOE units with high
levels of readiness. All FA 46 officers must be worldwide deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum

196

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

of peace and conflict. FA 46 officers may deploy tomorrow with their expeditionary units to deter potential adversaries
and to protect national interests or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than war, such as
humanitarian and peacekeeping missions. PA officers must prepare themselves and their Families for this challenging
life cycle function.
e. Sustain. Officers designated into the MF&E functional category will compete within their functional category for
promotion to lieutenant colonel and colonel.
f. Develop. PA officer development is based upon institutional training, operational assignments, cultural awareness,
and self-development. Effective development and sustainment of FA 46 skills and knowledge occurs throughout the FA
46 life cycle.
(1) Training. FA 46 institutional training includes the following elements:
(a) Initial specialty training. This training is conducted at DINFOS. All FA 46 officers attend the eight-week
PAOQC prior to their initial PA assignment. PAOQC provides the basic knowledge and skills required to perform
entry-level PA officer duties. Officers selected for their first broadcast assignment will attend the BMC at DINFOS.
(b) Graduate level ACS. Some FA 46 officers attend Army-funded graduate school in a PA-related discipline.
Selection is competitive and normally occurs after the 8th YOS. Following graduation, officers are assigned to Army
Educational Requirements System (AERS) designated utilization positions such as OCPA staff, Army Accessions
Command staff, and OCPA field operating agencies, unless Army needs dictate otherwise.
(c) TWI program. High-potential officers spend from 10 to 12 months training with leading print, broadcast or
public relations companies. Following graduation, they are assigned to AERS designated positions. The nomination
process for TWI is similar to the ACS program process, but officers should have completed ILE, have 24 months
public affairs experience and be highly competitive for promotion. Utilization tours are OCPA–NY, OCPA–MW,
OCPA–LA, AFN–Europe, AFN–South, AFN–Korea, and Army Accessions Command.
(d) Combined ACS/TWI program. This highly competitive program places an officer in a program that combines
graduate level schooling with a TWI assignment. At the completion of an 18-month program, the officer receives a
graduate degree in public communication along with TWI experience at a leading international Washington D.C. based
public relations firm. The officer then serves a utilization tour in the OCPA or as the PA assistant to a senior Army
leader.
(e) Joint Communications Course. Sponsored by DINFOS, this graduate-level course is taught at a major university
and is geared toward communication theory, research and evaluation. Credit earned can be applied toward a graduate
communication degree.
(f) ILE common core curriculum. Presently, FA 46 majors will attend the 12-week common core course in residence
at a course location (CL) site. After graduation at a CL site, officers are Intermediate Staff College (ISC) graduates and
credentialed JPME I qualification. Full ILE credit is awarded when the officer has completed the common core course.
Full ILE credit is not yet required prior to promotion to lieutenant colonel. RC officers can attend The Army School
System (TASS) classrooms located in CONUS and OCONUS CL sites.
(g) BMC. Taught at DINFOS for officers who are en route to an AFRTS or a BOD assignment. The course
familiarizes officers with AFRTS broadcast management principles, station management and broadcast policies.
(h) Senior PA Officer Seminar. The seminar is available for senior lieutenant colonels and colonels selected by the
Chief of Public Affairs to attend. The seminar provides a capstone experience for seasoned practitioners who will
occupy senior PA billets at the highest levels of military Service. Using a blend of top-flight outside speakers and
classroom discussion, this course will better prepare senior PA officers to become effective strategic communications
counselors to combatant commanders (for example, CJCS, Unified Commands, Service Chiefs, and so on).
(2) Operational assignments. PA officers should serve in operational and generating force assignments. PA officers
should have at least 48 months cumulative field grade PA experience prior to primary zone consideration for promotion
to colonel.
(3) Self-development. PA officers must pursue an aggressive self-development program. Membership and accreditation by a relevant professional organization is strongly encouraged. Professional reading and research is key to
maintaining strategic and tactical skills and knowledge. PA officers must maintain currency with doctrinal developments, Joint PA policies and procedures, and overall U.S. political, economic, and military strategies. All PA officers
must be familiar with HQDA level strategic communications programs and goals.
g. Separate. PA officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
21–7. Public Affairs Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. RC FA 46 officer development objectives and qualifications parallel those of their
Active Army colleagues. Because the majority of tactical PA assets are in the RC, RC PA officers can expect Active
Duty deployments in support of Army and Joint missions. This mandates an equivalent development program for RC
FA 46 officers. RC officers do not necessarily single track within CFD 46 due to the locations of various public affairs
units. However, recurring assignments and supporting education and deployments within PA are essential for qualified
and experienced RC leadership.
b. PA RC FA qualification and development. Development and qualification will be equivalent to the Active Army.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Greater use of distance learning approaches will be used to ensure delivery of required training and education to RC
officers. RC PA officers should seek the same developmental opportunities as their Active Army counterparts or
equivalent opportunities available in the ARNG or USAR. RC officers will not be awarded FA 46 until successful
completion of the PAOQC-distance learning (PAOQC–ADL) (Phase II) or the resident PAOQC. RC officers enrolled
in PAOQC–ADL may serve in a PA billet prior to completion. PAOQC–ADL must be completed within three years of
enrollment. Successful completion of PAOQC–ADL or PAOQC is required prior to assumption of PA TOE unit
command. Officers assigned to BODs should attend BMC following PAOQC–ADL or PAOQC completion. Qualification requirements may be waived only with the concurrence of the Chief, Army PA. FA 46 exception to policy
requests should be forwarded through the appropriate RC PA headquarters for review before reaching the Army PA
Center for a final decision. Contact the appropriate RC PA headquarters or the Army PA Center for current procedures.
c. PA RC assignments. RC FA 46 officer assignments parallel those of their Active Army colleagues with some
inherent component unique differences. These component unique positions include State Area Command PAO, BOD
commander/operations officer and unified command staff IMA. Because the majority of tactical PA assets are in the
RC, RC PAs officers can expect Active Duty deployments in positions of Coalition Press Information Center staff
officer/Director in support of ongoing Army and Joint missions. Many positions parallel the Active Army, to include
PA Operations Center commander, MPAD commander, BOD commander, PA detachment commander, BCT PAO,
division PAO, TSC PAO.

Part Three
Operations Support
Chapter 22
Signal Corps Branch
22–1. Unique features of Signal Corps Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Signal Corps Branch. The primary mission of the Signal Corps (Branch 25) is to provide
seamless, secure, continuous, and robust communication and information systems support at all levels from sustaining
military bases to forward-deployed fighting forces in support of Army, Joint, combined, and coalition operations
worldwide. Signal officers lead and manage Signal organizations, forces, and operations that enable globally-dispersed,
network-centric warfare. Signal WOs provide technical leadership and advice in planning and directing Signal operations. The Chief of Signal is the personnel proponent for two interrelated officer FAs; Telecommunications Systems
Engineering (FA 24) and Information Systems Management (FA 53). Both are vital to the Signal Regiment. The Signal
Regiment led by this team of branch, FA and WOs is the linchpin for the Army’s ability to achieve knowledge
dominance in the 21st Century.
b. The way ahead. From tactical to operational to strategic levels, the ability to process, store, and transport
information securely is one of the most critical elements in the effectiveness of today’s modern military force. Every
weapon, command and control, and Service support system is increasingly dependent on communications and information systems to function properly and securely. Modern warfare is immensely complex and requires interoperability and
synchronization of all systems across the full spectrum of operations. To accomplish these goals, the Signal Regiment
is leading the Army in transformation to better support the force in Joint and expeditionary operations. The regiment is
undergoing major transformations in personnel, doctrine, and equipment. The modularization of signal elements and
changes in doctrine and equipment will create a force that is tailorable to a Regional Combatant Commander’s (RCC)
requirements and operates in an autonomous, nonlinear, noncontiguous battle space that is no longer division based.
c. Unique features of work in the Signal Corps Branch. Signal branch and WOs are responsible for the Army’s
communication and information systems and serve as Joint command, control, communications and computers (C4)
systems integrators. It is the Signal Corps’ responsibility to provide and manage the communications and information
systems support that network the force across a multitude of battlefield platforms and mission areas. Signal support
encompasses all aspects of planning, designing, installing, maintaining, managing and protecting information networks
to include communications links, computers, and other components of local and wide area networks, and it includes the
integration of user owned and operated systems into the networks. Signal forces plan, install, operate, maintain, and
protect voice and data communications networks that employ single and multi-channel satellite (space-based), tropospheric scatter, terrestrial microwave, switching, messaging, video-teleconferencing, visual information, and other
related systems. Signal officers integrate tactical, strategic, and sustaining base communications, information processing, and management systems into a seamless Global Information Grid (GIG) that enables Network-Centric warfare for
Army, Joint and Coalition operations. In support of tactical operations, the Signal Corps provides a myriad of state-ofthe-art, real time voice and data tactical information systems to provide information services to all elements on the
battlefield and reach-back to the sustaining military base. At the strategic level, the Signal Corps is responsible for the
Army’s portion of the Defense Information System Network (DISN) and its interface with tactical signal elements at
theater and corps. Together with its Air Force and Navy counterparts, the Signal Corps manages and directs the Joint
operation of the GIG serving the DOD and the National Command Authority. At all levels, the Signal Corps provides
communications and information systems and networks to support the nation’s forces across the entire operational
spectrum.
d. Officer Tasks within the Signal Corps Branch. Signal Corps Branch and WOs encounter unprecedented challenges that test their tactical and technical abilities. Commensurate with these challenges are tremendous opportunities
for advancement and personal satisfaction. Roles inherent within the Signal Corps at the MTOE level are command,
supervisory, managerial, and technical leadership for the planning, installation, administration, management, maintenance, operation, integration, and securing of communications and information systems to support the aforementioned
task, the Signal Corps Branch officer works at all levels of command and staff to perform the following functions.
(1) Commands, directs, and controls Signal units.
(2) Within Signal units, serves as platoon leaders, company commanders, supply and maintenance officers, operations officers, XOs, other staff officers, and battalion/brigade commanders.
(3) Within maneuver units, such as BCTs, serves with their combat arms counterparts as Signal platoon leaders,
Signal company commanders and as principle coordinating staff (S6), and technical advisors to the commander.
(4) Plans, coordinates, and supervises the training, administration, management, operation, supply, maintenance,

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

transportation, information assurance activities, and allocation of resources for units and facilities in support of Army,
Joint, combined, and coalition operations worldwide.
(5) Provides detailed technical direction and advice to commanders, staffs, and other C4 users at all echelons.
e. Assignment opportunities other than MTOE within the Signal Corps Branch. To support the aforementioned task,
the Signal Corps officer works at all levels of command and staff to perform the following functions:
(1) At Army Command (ACOM), DA, and DOD levels, serves as staff and as Joint duty officers in support of
Army, Joint, and combined, and coalition tactical, theater, strategic, or sustaining base operations.
(2) Develops doctrine, organizations, and equipment for the signal mission area. Serve as instructors, combat
developers, and training developers at the Signal Center, other branch schools, and combat training centers.
(3) Serves as instructors at pre-commissioning programs, military academies, Service Signal schools, and Service
colleges.
(4) Performs duties as Signal Corps advisors to both the USAR and ARNG organizations.
(5) Plans, coordinates, and supervises the training, administration, management, operation, supply, maintenance,
transportation, information assurance activities, and allocation of resources for units and facilities in support of Army,
Joint, combined, and coalition operations worldwide.
22–2. Officer characteristics required
a. Unique skills.
(1) Decisionmaking skills. Signal officers are grounded in troop leading skills as well as managerial and technical
skills.
(2) Tactical, technical, and systems integration skills. Signal officers must also have an understanding of Army,
Joint, combined, and coalition information system networks and how to provide connectivity between different
information systems (other services) securely. To help in this understanding, Signal officers are encouraged to obtain
additional degrees in some type of information related discipline. Signal officers are technically proficient with branch
and mission unique equipment, tools, and systems. Signal mission success requires the proper balance between
technical skills and the ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactical skills. These skills are gained and
developed through repetitive operational assignments and continuous professional study and self-development.
b. Unique knowledge. The components of network operations (NETOPS) consist of enterprise systems management/
network management, computer network defense/information assurance, and content staging/information dissemination
management). These components comprise the core competencies of the Signal Regiment and all Signal Regiment
officers must possess knowledge of all three.
(1) Signal officers must aggressively pursue knowledge about existing and future information systems and technology. Additionally, all Signal officers should strive both on and off duty to learn as much as possible about technology
management, telecommunications, automation, and the Global Information Infrastructure.
(2) Signal officers must possess expert knowledge of Army, Joint, combined, and coalition signal support and
coordination principles. This knowledge includes practical experience in tactics, combined arms operations, and the
employment of direct and indirect fire weapon systems.
(3) Signal officers gain this knowledge through a logical sequence of continuous education, training, and experience,
sustained by mentoring.
(4) Individual officers sustain knowledge through institutional training and education, duty in operational assignments, TWI, and continuous self-development.
22–3. Signal branch officer developmental assignments
a. Branch development. Developmental assignments will develop and hone leadership skills and enhance the Signal
officer’s capability to plan, install, integrate, operate, maintain and defend the Army’s strategic, operational, tactical,
and sustaining base voice, video, and data communications networks, information systems, services, and resources for
peace, conflict, and wartime operations.
(1) Lieutenant.
(a) After completing the Signal Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC), lieutenants are normally assigned at company
level to gain troop-leading experience and to enhance technical and tactical competence. Inculcation of the Warrior
Ethos and Army core values is essential in the development of young officers. Second lieutenants entering life cycle
units will remain with the unit for the duration of the life cycle and will in some cases serve as a newly promoted
captain in a lieutenant position. Signal Corps lieutenants are fully developed after serving a minimum of 12 months as
a platoon leader or direct Signal support team (DSST) officer in charge (OIC) and after serving an additional 12
months as a company XO, or battalion primary staff officer.
(b) Lieutenants should expect to serve in company level positions to develop leadership and signal technical skills
and, when required gain additional skills by serving in staff positions at the battalion level or higher. Typical duty
positions include platoon leader, DSST OIC, company executive officer, or signal battalion staff officer. Assignments
are based on—
1. Needs of the Army.

200

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

2. Professional development requirements.
3. Officer’s preferences.
(c) Lieutenants should focus on acquiring and refining troop leading procedures, coordination, logistics, technica,l
and administrative skills, as well as Signal unique technical skills required to plan, install, operate, and maintain signal
equipment and systems. In addition to branch unique tasks, Signal lieutenants should also become proficient in
common core tasks. Before promotion to captain, officers should possess in-depth knowledge of the Signal operations
and its integration into combined arms operations. This includes practical experience in signal activities and missions
and in tactics and combined arms operations.
(d) The Signal Corps Branch Detail Program is an important part of officer accession process. This critical program
assigns newly commissioned Signal officers to branches with large lieutenant requirements. In accordance with AR
614–100, paragraph 3–1g, the branch detail period is 48 months including time spent in initial entry training (IET).
Upon return to the Signal Corps, branch detailed officers must attend the Signal Captains Career Course-Leveler
(SCCC–L), followed by the Signal Captains Career Course (SCCC). After completing both courses, detailed officers
are developed in the same manner as their non-detailed counterparts.
(e) By law, officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree before promotion to captain.
(2) Captain.
(a) Officers generally attend the SCCC between the 4th and 7th YOS. SCCC is a permanent change of station (PCS)
course. Captains must aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience for promotion to and success in the
rank of major.
(b) In preparation for the duties of a major, captains should have as a goal to serve at least 24 months in one or a
combination of the following KD assignments:
1. Company command.
2. Non-Signal battalion S6.
3. Transition team (TT) Signal mentor/advisor previous experience in these positions as a lieutenant is considered
developmental, but is not credited as key developmental as a captain. AHRC Network and Space Operations Branch
will make the final determination as to when an officer is determined to be a senior captain based off of experience,
timing, and acquired competencies.
(c) Upon completion of KD assignments as a captain, officers can be assigned in other developmental assignments
that are consistent with current Army requirements. These assignments include—
1. Combat training centers (CTC) observer controller (OC).
2. USAREC command or staff.
3. Active Army/RC Active Army/RC duty.
4. Signal battalion/brigade principal staff.
5. USMA staff.
6. ROTC instructor.
7. Service school instructor.
8. Education opportunity (ACS, TWI, Joint Chief of Staff Internship (JCS), and so on).
9. FA positions.
10. Other generalist positions.
(d) Captains must aggressively prepare for and seek the skills for success in the rank of major. Captains should
continue to gain an in-depth understanding of combined arms operations and be proficient in both Signal operations
and common core competencies. These competencies provide the foundation of knowledge required to serve in the
branch with tactical and technical proficiency, in addition to being a leader of Soldiers. Captains gain a working
knowledge of command principles, battalion-level staff operations, combined arms operations and signal operations at
the battalion at the battalion level and above.
(e) Functional designation is conducted at the 7th YOS and all officers will be functionally designated into one of
three functional categories. Signal Corps officers who stay in the Signal Corps will be functionally designated into the
operations support functional category. In addition, in the 3d YOS, officers may voluntarily submit a preference to
functionally designate into one of four FAs (FA 24, 30, 46, 53). The formal functional designation is based upon the
needs of the Army, officer skills and experience, and preference. The Chief of Signal is the proponent manager for
FA24 (telecommunications system engineer) and FA 53 (information systems management). For more information on
FA 24 and FA 53, see chapters 23 and 24, respectively.
(3) Major.
(a) Signal majors are encouraged to serve in KD assignments and other developmental assignments that will refine
their leader attributes, skills, and actions. Officers should strive to complete an aggregate of 24 months in KD
assignments before they will be considered for more senior majors’ assignments. Officers that have successfully
completed ILE and completed an assignment (goal of 24 months) in a KD assignment time will have built the right
competencies and knowledge required to prepare them to be successful in future Army, combined, and JIIM leadership
and staff positions.

(3) The focus during this phase is providing leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs, WOs

206

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

and branch officers. CW5s have special mentorship responsibilities for other WOs at all levels and providing essential
advice to commanders on Signal technical and WO issues. CW5s should sharpen their knowledge of personnel forceintegration functions for doctrine, training, and personnel as pertains to Signal Corps. In addition, CW5s should
become familiar with the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory basis for the force projection Army and the capabilities that are sustained through management of doctrinal, organizational, and materiel change; become familiar with
Army organizational roles, functions, and missions, especially at the ACOM/ASCC/DRU and Army Secretariat/Staff
levels; and with the force management processes, from the determination of force requirements through the resourcing
of requirements and the assessment of their utilization in order to accomplish Army functions and missions in a Joint/
combined environment.
(4) Typical assignments include—
(a) Personal proponent manager.
(b) Regimental chief warrant officer.
(c) Tactical operations network technician.
(d) Theater operations network advisor.
(e) Theater information systems advisor.
22–5. Signal Branch officer preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. Preferably, a Signal major should strive to serve in Joint assignments such as the Joint staff, Unified
Command staff, Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). Selected
majors are required to serve in a Joint position or branch/FA generalist assignment. Lieutenant colonels and colonels
should expect to alternate between command and ACOM/ASCC/DRU/Joint/DOD/multinational staff assignments.
Under OPMS, some technically qualified lieutenant colonels not selected for command are allowed to crossover to
another functional designation if the transfer fills a valid Army need. Crossovers to other functional designations are
minimal. Preferably, a Signal WO1 should serve a minimum of 24 months in a basic level MOS assignment. Under
OPMS, WOs are assigned by grade. WOs assigned to senior positions should receive training commensurate with the
duties and responsibilities of that position prior to arriving at the assignment
b. Precedence. It is crucial that officers receive an opportunity for company grade development with troops.
Typically, this is platoon leader time followed by battalion staff and/or battalion Signal officer (S6) for a tactical
combat/combat support/combat Service support battalion. At the field grade level, these positions are command,
battalion/brigade S3, XO, brigade S6, and deputy/assistant division G–6 before battalion command, and battalion
command and/or G–6 before brigade command. It is crucial that WO assignment oriented training (AOT) requirements
are evaluated once selected for assignment. The rapidly increasing complexity of networks, communications, and data
systems coupled with the dynamic changes to the Army present a unique challenge to Signal Corps WOs. Providing
Signal Corps WOs the ability to update their network, communications, and information systems skills, knowledge, and
abilities through timely AOT opportunities based on the requirements of their next assignment is crucial in this
environment.
22–6. Signal Branch officer critical life cycle assignments
a. Key Signal Corps positions. Company level command, battalion S6, battalion and brigade XO and S3, special
operations forces/regimental S6, separate and maneuver brigade S6, field grade command, and deputy/assistant G–6 are
the preferred positions. What is new under OPMS is the greater amount of time officers will spend in these jobs. It is
expected that these officers will remain on station for 3 years.
b. Signal branch life cycle. Figure 22–1, below, displays a Signal Branch life cycle with and other developmental
positions.

Figure 22–2. Signal WO Developmental Model

22–8. Signal officer requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for Signal officers.
(1) Signal Branch officers. To do this, the field grade inventory is optimized in order to meet branch authorizations,
to provide sufficient flexibility to support branch/FA generalist positions, and to provide majors with stabilization for
about 3 years as determined by the needs of the Army, developmental requirements, and officer preference.
(2) Signal WO. To do this the inventory is optimized in order to meet branch authorizations to provide sufficient
flexibility to support warrant positions and provide AOT opportunities with each new assignment.
b. Structure. The numbers of authorized Signal billets, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions are made and
actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more information on the Signal Corps Branch authorizations or
inventory are encouraged to contact the personnel proponent office at Fort Gordon (Office Chief of Signal) or their
assignment officer at AHRC.
22–9. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Signal Corps
a. Structure. The regiment is undergoing major transformations in personnel, doctrine and equipment. The
modularization of signal elements and changes in doctrine and equipment will create a force that is tailored to a RCC
requirements and fight in an autonomous, nonlinear, non-contiguous battle space that is no longer tied to a divisional
base.
b. Acquire.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

209

(1) Signal Branch officers are acquired as accessions from the USMA, ROTC, or Officer Candidate School. ROTC
is the primary commissioning source for Signal officers. While the Signal Corps remains open to all disciplines, the
increasing demand of information technology requires more officers with technical degrees. Additionally, the Signal
Corps is a donor branch to the branch detail program. This results in some Signal lieutenants working in another
branch (primarily combat arms) for a 4-year detail, depending on duty location, before returning to Signal Branch for
training and assignment.
(2) Signal WOs are accessed from the Enlisted Corps. Outstanding NCOs who meet the minimum prerequisites are
prime candidates for accession into Signal WO specialties.
c. Distribute.
(1) Stabilized installation assignments are as follows:
(a) Officers assigned to stabilized installations are initial entry officers from BOLC/WOBC. These officers are
assigned to an installation for approximately 3 years.
1. The branch officers will complete their platoon leader and lieutenant years during this time. The majority of these
officers will then proceed to the CCC unless they are a part of a current life cycle or considered stop loss/stop move
(SL/SM). Some of these officers will serve on an additional one year assignment so that they can come back to the
SCCC and do not become a part of a second life cycle.
2. The WO will complete their basic level MOS qualification during this time. They are eligible to attend the
WOAC after their first assignment as a CW2.
(b) Officers at all levels are assigned to life cycled units (generally the SBCTs and BCTs) will remain in the unit for
a minimum of 3 years. Branch detail officers will remain in their detail branch until after completion of the assignment
to the BCT.
(c) The majority of the installations and echelon above division (EAD) combat Service support (CSS) units are
managed on a cyclic manning system. Replacements are sent to these units and installations periodically to maintain
readiness of the units. Tour lengths and developmental positions opportunities can vary. Branch detail officers will
remain on standard branch detail time lines.
(2) WOs who are assigned to assignments at a higher grade band will attend the appropriate assignment oriented
training in route to the assignment (for example, a CW2 assigned to a position coded CW3 will attend the appropriate
WOAC). WOs assignments are by grade as follows:
(a) WO1/CW2 WOs are assigned to positions coded W2.
(b) CW3 WOs are assigned to positions coded W3.
(c) CW4 warrant Officers are assigned to positions coded W4.
(d) CW5 WOs are assigned to positions coded CW5.
d. Deploy. Signal officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at
all times. Whether assigned to TOE units or TDA organizations, all Signal Corps officers are deployable to accomplish
missions across the full spectrum of conflict. Signal officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential
adversaries and to protect national interests or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than
war such as humanitarian and peacekeeping missions. Signal officers must prepare themselves and their Families for
this most challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustain.
(1) OPMS changes the manner of execution of the following three major actions which affect branch officer career
development:
(a) Promotion. Signal Branch officers will compete for promotion only within the operations support functional
category.
(b) Command. Signal Corps commanders (battalion and higher) are centrally selected for command. All field grade
command opportunities are in the operations support functional category. Commands are organized into four categories: operations, strategic support, recruiting and training, and installation. Officers may still choose which category
and/or categories to compete, but once selected, officers can no longer decline without prejudice after selection.
(c) OER. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS. Starting with captain, the
rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the functional category which best suits his or her abilities
and interests.
(2) WO1s are promoted to CW2 after 2 years in grade on the recommendation of the first lieutenant colonel (O–5)
in the chain of command. All other WOs, CW2 through CW5, are normally considered for promotion to the next
higher grade by a DA promotion board, first below the zone (BZ) after two years in grade and then in the zone (IZ)
after three years in grade. DA publishes zones of consideration prior to each promotion board.
f. Develop.
(1) The development of Signal Corps officers will continue as it is today. The development through the company
grade years is expected to focus on the core signal corps competencies. Officers will undergo a functional designation
board at their seven year mark in their career. This HQDA board will decide in which of the three functional categories
each officer is best suited to serve. Decisions are based on needs of the Army, the officer’s preference, rater and senior

210

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

rater recommendations, and the officer’s skills and training. The three functional categories are: MF&E; operations
support; and force sustainment . In addition, a limited number of officers may electively choose to participate in a four
year functional designation (done in the 3d YOS). This board is not mandatory nor is it open to all FAs. After the
board convenes, each officer will be assigned a branch or FA within one of the three functional categories listed above.
Officers who are selected to serve outside of the Signal Branch will be then managed by their respective branch or FA
career manager. Promotions to the next higher grade for the major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel board will be done
according to the functional category to which the officer belongs.
(2) Prior to assignment, WOs assigned to CW3 positions will attend their MOS WOAC; WOs assigned to CW4
positions will attend their MOS WOSC; and WOs assigned to CW5 positions will attend their MOS WOSSC. WOs
must complete their formal military education upon selection for promotion, but not later than 1 year after promotion,
to the next higher grade at CW2(P)/CW3 (WOAC), CW3(P)/CW4 (WOSC and CW4(P)/CW5 (WOSSC).
g. Separate. The officer separation process remains unchanged under OPMS.
22–10. Signal Corps Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. The Army National Guard (ARNG) and U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) Signal Corps
officers serve the same role and mission as their Active Army (Active Army) counterparts. The unique nature of the
RC Soldier’s role as a citizen Soldier poses a significant challenge for professional development. To fulfill its wartime
mission of planning, installing, administering, managing, maintaining, operating, integrating, and securing the Army’s
strategic, operational and tactical communications infrastructure, and voice and data information systems, services, and
resources in support of wartime and peacetime operations, the Signal Corps is dependent upon extensive interaction
between the Active Army and the RC. The quality of the Signal Corps officers in the ARNG and USAR Signal Corps
units, as well as the IRR, is crucial in supporting this mission. For guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7.
b. RC officer MOS or branch development.
(1) The Signal Corps officers in the RC have a challenging and complex mission. Inherent with the Signal Corps
mission is command, supervisory, managerial, and technical leadership for the planning, installation, administration,
management, maintenance, operation, integration, and securing of communications and information systems in both
fixed and mobile configurations. RC Signal Corps officers are tactically and technically proficient and capable of
understanding the scope of a Signal officer’s duties. A requirement for proficiency in both peacetime and wartime
skills is a wide variety of educational opportunities and challenging assignments. Planned rotation into progressively
challenging Signal Corps related positions is essential to producing the best-qualified Signal Corps officers.
(2) Geographic dispersion of unit may constrain RC career progression within a specific MOS or branch. To meet
professional development objectives, RC Signal officers must possess a willingness to rotate between assignments with
TPUs, ARNG organizations, the IRR, and IMA positions. Often there are insufficient numbers of positions in a
geographic area to continue in Signal assignments. If geographic constraints are such that the assignment to a Signal
position is not possible, officers should seek qualification and assignment in another MOS, branch, or FA required in
the geographic region.
(3) Both TOE and TDA organizations host RC Signal officer assignments, with the vast majority of positions in
TOE organizations. Their duties and responsibilities are fundamentally the same as their Active Army counterparts
except for those personnel management, administrative, and operational requirements unique to the ARNG and USAR.
All RC Signal assignments are open to male and female officers.
(4) Officers are also assigned to IRR when unable to accept a TPU or ARNG unit assignment. Officers in the IRR
may request assignments in reinforcement training units (RTU), IMA positions in Active Army organizations, installations, or DA agencies, as well as tours of Active Duty for special work (ADSW), annual training (AT), or Active Duty
for training (ADT). They may also request ADT assignment to complete their professional military education (PME)
requirements. All RC officers, major and below and CW4 and below with less than 13 years of active Federal Service
(AFS), may request Active Guard Reserve (AGR) assignment.
c. Life cycle development model. There are five phases of professional development for RC Signal officers. (See fig
22–3, below, for branch officers and fig 22–4, below, for WOs). The phases relate to military rank and depict broadly
based goals and career opportunities at each rank so that an officer may expand capabilities and optimize performance.
The Signal Corps life cycle development objectives, RC requirements, and an officer’s own strengths, priorities,
civilian experience, private, and Service provided educational attainment and performance influence their professional
development
(1) RC Branch officer development. Company grade officers must continue to focus on developmental assignments
related to their basic branch. Field grade officers must seek jobs, experiences, and educational opportunities that will
help them become multi-skilled leaders. Some officers will also be given additional opportunities within the JIIM arena
in an effort to further broaden their experiences and skills.
(a) Lieutenant. Newly accessed officers will attend the BOLC by their 3rd year USAR or ARNG point of Service.
Upon graduation, selected officers will proceed to functional training as required by their first assignment. Assignments
for the majority of Signal officers are made to divisional, and echelons above corps level signal positions. All officers
are encouraged to actively participate in professional reading programs and continued corresponding studies.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

211

(b) Captain. For consideration for promotion to major, a Signal captain must successfully complete all five (5)
phases of the Signal Captains Career Course-RC (SCCC–RC). Officers must complete SCCC–RC for competitive
career progression (see chap 7). Officers are encouraged to pursue a specialty related graduate degree or specialty
related industry certification program. Captains should serve a minimum of 24 months in a signal operations position.
(c) Major. The primary professional development objective of a Signal Corps major in the RC is to continue to
strengthen Signal skills. During this phase, officers must enroll in ILE. Officers must complete ILE common core for
consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel. Officers are highly encouraged to pursue a specialty related graduate
degree or specialty related industry certification program during these years. Majors should serve a minimum of 24
months in a signal operations or operational support major position.
(d) Lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant Colonels can expect assignments to senior staff positions in a variety of both
branch related and branch/FA generalist positions in units, training centers and headquarters elements. State Area
Command (STARC) or Regional Readiness Command (RRC) designated position lists identify selected officers for
battalion command or their equivalents during this phase. Due to the limited number of command positions available,
STARC and RRC commands select very few eligible officers. Officers should seek professional military education at
the Senior Service College (SSC) level. Lieutenant colonels are eligible for selection to the rank of colonel upon
completion of the requisite Service requirements listed in chapter 7 of this pamphlet. Officers remain eligible for
promotion as long as they continue to serve in an active status and meet selection criteria. Lieutenant colonels should
strive to complete an aggregate of 24 months in a signal operations or operations support position.

(2) RC WO qualification and development.
(a) MOS qualification.
1. Basic level MOS qualification.
a. Newly accessed WOs who have not successfully completed a pre-commissioning course will attend an accredited
Warrant Officer Candidate School (WOCS), or an accredited Regional Training Institute (RTI). Upon course completion, the candidate is eligible for appointment to the grade of WO1, but is not yet MOS-qualified.
b. Upon completion of an accredited pre-commissioning course newly appointed WOs must complete an accredited
proponent MOS WOBC to continue serving in the Army as a WO. WO1 appointments are contingent upon successfully completing WOBC. WOBC requires completion within two years of appointment or an exception to policy is
requested and approved, otherwise, the WO will be discharged from the Service. This course is a requirement for
promotion to CW2. Upon successful completion of WOBC, the WO is awarded a Signal MOS and given an initial
operational assignment.
2. Advanced level MOS qualification. WOs must attend and complete a proponent accredited WOAC. USAR WOs
must successful complete WOAC for promotion to CW3.
3. Senior level MOS qualification. WOs must attend and complete a proponent accredited WOSC. USAR WOs must
successful complete WOSC for promotion to CW4.
4. Master level MOS qualification. Following selection for promotion to CW5, WOs must attend and complete the
Warrant Officer Senior Staff Course (WOSSC). USAR WOs must successful complete WOSSC for promotion to CW4.
(b) Professional development. RC WOs professional development goals are outlined in paragraph 22–3b(1)(b).
(c) Qualification and assignment.
1. WO1/CW2. Basic level, tactical, and technical experts who should expect to serve in brigade level positions, see
paragraph 22–4b(2)(b) for MOS 250N network management technician; paragraph 22–4b(3)(b) for MOS 251A information systems technician, and paragraph 22–4b(4)(b) for MOS 254A Signal systems support technicians.
2. CW3. Advanced level, tactical, and technical experts who should expect to serve in division level positions, see
paragraph 22–4b(2)(c) for MOS 250N network management technician; paragraph 22–4b(3)(c) for MOS 251A information systems technician, and paragraph 22–4b(4)(c) for MOS 254A Signal systems support technicians.
3. CW4. Senior level, tactical and technical experts who should expect to serve in corps/echelons above corps level
positions, see paragraph 22–4b(2)(d) for MOS 250N network management technician; paragraph 22–4b(3)(d) for MOS
251A information systems technician, and paragraph 22–4b(4)(d) for MOS 254A Signal systems support technicians.
4. CW5. Master level, tactical, and technical experts who should expect to serve in echelon above corps/theatre level
positions, see paragraph 22–4b(5)(b) for MOS 255Z Senior signal systems technicians. RC Soldiers should not rotate
into NGB positions and visa versa. They are constrained by TPU/retirement requirements, and must spend a certain
number of years in the component for retirement eligibility. Soldiers must remain aware of regulations pertaining to
transfers and their retirement requirements.

Chapter 23
Telecommunication Systems Engineering Functional Area
23–1. Unique features of the Telecommunication Systems Engineering functional area
a. Unique purpose of the Telecommunication Systems Engineering FA. Telecommunications Systems Engineering
(FA 24) is a FA within the network and space operations group of the operations support functional category. FA 24
provides the Army with a core of professional telecommunications systems engineers, who engineer, design, develop,
install, implement, integrate, test, accept, and upgrade tactical, strategic, and sustaining base wired and wireless
telecommunications systems and networks enterprise-wide at all levels of the GIG (terrestrial, air, and satellite) in
support of Army, Joint, interagency, and multinational operations worldwide. The FA 24 proponent office is located at
the U.S. Army Signal Center, Fort Gordon, Georgia.
b. Unique functions performed by the Telecommunication Systems Engineering FA. FA 24 officers perform the
following critical tasks in Army and JIIM units and environments:
(1) Engineer telecommunications systems into an integrated network.
(2) Engineer network security architectures.
(3) Assess a telecommunications network or network design plan.
(4) Validate a telecommunications network or network design plan.
(5) Conduct current network operations.

214

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(6) Plan future network operations.
(7) Manage a network and services design project.
(8) Prepare technical specifications documentation.
(9) Manage information technology contracts.
(10) Evaluate telecommunications technologies.
c. Unique features of work in the Telecommunication Systems Engineering FA. Work within FA 24 requires the
application of technical skills to plan, design, and install telecommunications systems and networks using existing and
future military and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) telecommunications systems and equipment. FA 24 officers
operate enterprise-wide, interfacing with and understanding the roles of Signal (Branch 25) and information systems
management (FA 53) officers in order to provide seamless, robust, and reliable communications and information
services to the warfighter.
d. Areas of concentration (AOC) in the Telecommunication Systems Engineering. There is one AOC 24A, Telecommunication Systems Engineering.
23–2. Officer characteristics required
Telecommunications Systems Engineering officers must have a Top Secret clearance with special compartmented
information access. FA 24 officers should initiate procedures to obtain the proper level of clearance immediately upon
notification of the FA 24 functional designation. Additionally, there are FA unique skills, knowledge, and abilities.
a. Desired officer background. Officers should possess an undergraduate or graduate degree in one of the following
disciplines:
(1) Electrical engineering.
(2) Telecommunication systems engineering.
(3) Telecommunication engineering.
(4) Telecommunications management.
(5) Information systems engineering.
(6) Computer systems engineering.
(7) Engineering.
(8) Computer science.
(9) Math.
(10) Physics.
b. Unique skills.
(1) Conceptual competence. FA 24 officers must possess the ability to synthesize information and to clearly
communicate information required to make timely decisions. The uncertain conditions of military operations will
demand mental endurance and agility, often under severe conditions and time constraints. FA 24 officers must
effectively develop and communicate their vision, purpose, and direction.
(2) Interpersonal competence. FA 24 officers are part of a network operations team. They are skilled in building
teamwork within their organization and recognize that they often simultaneously belong to many teams. They must
possess the ability to express themselves to their senior leaders and subordinate clearly, concisely, and accurately, both
orally and in writing.
(3) Technical competence. FA 24 officers must possess the necessary expertise to provide a seamless, secure, global
network that enables information superiority for the warfighter. FA 24 officers must leverage their system engineering
experience to assist in the development of the LandWarNet. They prepare and present clear and informative briefings
relating to their technical areas of expertise to their peers, subordinates and superiors.
(4) Tactical competence. FA 24 officers must show proficiency in required professional knowledge, judgment, and
warfighting. They must apply their doctrinal knowledge and understanding to the solution of tactical problems and
formulate and defend solutions to problems using current Army and Joint doctrine. These skills are gained and
developed through operational assignments and continuous professional study and self-development.
(5) Decisionmaking skills. FA 24 officers often work in an environment where sound and timely decisions are made
while time available for problem analysis is seriously constrained. Information gained in this environment will vary in
its completeness and ambiguity. An ability to operate under stress and make decisions is critical to success.
c. Unique knowledge. The components of network operations (NETOPS) consist of enterprise systems management/
network management, computer network defense/information assurance, and content staging/information dissemination
management). These components comprise the core competencies of the Signal Regiment and all Signal Regiment
officers must possess knowledge of all three. Additionally, FA 24 officers are responsible for maintaining specific
proficiency in the following:
(1) Know the underlying theory and concepts of telecommunications transmission technologies.
(2) Know current commercial, JIIM telecommunications systems, their employment, capabilities, interoperability,
and limitations.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

215

(3) Know current telecommunications regulations, policies and procedures as implemented by international agreement, Federal law, national policy, and DOD and Army regulations.
(4) Know integrated life cycle support plans for fielded telecommunications systems.
(5) Know and implement national, DOD, and Army policy for the protection and security of command and control
(C2) telecommunications.
(6) Know and apply the fault, configuration, accounting, performance and, security (FCAPS) management model of
telecommunications network management
(7) Know end-to-end analysis and engineering of telecommunications systems.
(8) Know technical frameworks for the test, evaluation, implementation, and validation of interoperable-telecommunications systems.
23–3. Officer development and assignments
a. FA development. Officers are functionally designated into FA 24 at their 7th YOS to reset the future field grade
officer inventory by anticipating future branch and functional officer requirements. Limited functional designation at
the 4th YOS will occur to fill operational requirements for specific FAs at the rank of captain. Officers interested in
functional designation as an FA 24 should visit the AHRC Web site via AKO and follow the FA 24 link. The FA 24
personnel proponent, in conjunction with the FA 24 assignments officer, will actively recruit quality captains to fill FA
24 requirements.
b. FA assignments. All FA 24 positions are considered FA developmental positions. As officers progress through
their careers, they are afforded a variety of FA assignments and Army unique training and educational opportunities
based on their performance of duties, educational background, and the needs of the Army. Captain.
(1) Captain.
(a) Officers generally attend the CCC at about their 4th year of commissioned Service in preparation for company
grade duties and responsibilities. Captains who are functionally designated at their 4th YOS will more than likely attend
the Signal CCC in conjunction with the Telecommunications Systems Engineering Course (TSEC). Those captains who
are functionally designated at their 7th YOS more than likely have already attended a CCC and thus, will only attend
TSEC. Special training necessary to support an officer’s follow-on assignment is scheduled after completing CCC.
(b) After completion of TSEC, captains are normally assigned to positions that will enable them to gain experience
and develop technical and tactical competence. Captains should aggressively prepare for and seek assignments that will
develop competencies as a network or system engineer. Officers should expect to serve in progressive positions to
develop leadership, FA skills, and complement this with experience at a level of division or higher.
(c) At the rank of captain, it is expected that assignments will give an FA 24 competencies in network engineering,
assessment, managing, and planning, as well as experience in conducting current network operations. Moreover,
assignments will allow captains to gain knowledge, skills, and abilities in accurately evaluating technologies and
preparing technical specification documents based on those evaluations. Typical developmental assignments include—
1. Network engineer in division G–6
2. Systems engineer in a Signal battalion/brigade/command.
3. Systems engineer at JIIM staff level.
4. Project manager at JIIM staff level.
5. Telecommunications test, evaluation, and integration officer.
(2) Major.
(a) Telecommunication Systems Engineering officers will attend the 14–week resident ILE common core course not
later than the completion of their 12th year of commissioned Service. ILE education for all FA 24 officers is essential
to their professional development. Officers completing the ILE curriculum and TSEC are ILE and Joint professional
military education (JPME 1) qualified. The TSEC is the second phase of ILE, although an FA 24 more than likely will
have already graduated from TSEC prior to attending ILE.
(b) Majors must exercise continuous self-development efforts to fully master all aspects of telecommunications
systems engineering to include Joint and multinational operations. Self-development may include correspondence
courses, civilian education, and institutional training. Officers must devote time to a professional reading program in
order to broaden their tactical and technical perspective; they should also conduct research and write articles for
professional, military publications. Skills and experience will drive an officer’s career path and future assignments.
Completion of ILE and successful Service in desirable positions of responsibility will best prepare majors for
promotion to lieutenant colonel. The optimal time line to provide officers with the opportunity to successfully serve in
positions that will develop the competencies gained at the rank of major is 18–36 months.
(c) At the rank of major, it is expected that assignments will give a Telecommunications Systems Engineer
competencies in validating telecommunication networks and network design plans. Assignments will additionally
enable majors to enhance competencies in planning, engineering, and assessing a network in support of future
operations. Moreover, majors will gain knowledge, skills, and abilities in managing network and services design
projects. Typical developmental assignments include—

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

1. Network engineer in division G–6.
2. Systems engineer in a Signal battalion/brigade/command.
3. Systems engineer/plans officer in JIIM staff-level.
4. Telecommunications Systems Engineer, TNOSC Network Management Division.
5. Project manager in JIIM staff-level.
6. Deputy Director, Theater Network Operations & Security Center (TNOSC).
7. Telecommunications test, evaluation, and integration officer.
8. Information assurance officer at JIIM staff-level.
9. Radio frequency engineer officer at JIIM staff-level.
(3) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Officers selected for lieutenant colonel should seek assignments of greater responsibility in FA positions. The
objective in lieutenant colonel assignments is to give officers the opportunity to enhance competencies and make a
greater contribution to the telecommunications systems engineering community for the Army.
(b) The majority of FA 24 lieutenant colonels should concentrate on seeking out and performing well in critical staff
positions at the Army level as well as in different JIIM environments. Lieutenant colonels benefit by having an
advanced degree and also gain an advantage by being selected for and attending a SSC or completing the AWC
Distance Education Course.
(c) At the rank of lieutenant colonel, developmental assignments will enable individuals to enhance competencies in
planning, engineering, assessing, and validating Army, JIIM strategic networks in support of current and future
operations. Additionally, lieutenant colonels will enhance their competencies of testing, evaluation, and documenting of
technical specifications. Moreover, lieutenant colonels will acquire competencies of managing information technology
(IT) contracts in support of IT projects. Typical developmental assignments include—
1. Director, TNOSC.
2. Deputy Director at Battle Command Battle Lab.
3. Chief, ACERT.
4. Systems engineer at JIIM staff-level.
5. Integration/interoperability officer at JIIM staff-level.
6. C4I staff officer/plans officer at JIIM staff-level.
7. Chief, Materiel Requirements Division, Combat Developments Directorate, SIGCEN.
8. Chief information officer/chief technology officer at JIIM staff-level.
9. Chief, Spectrum Management IT Division, Joint Spectrum Center (JSC).
(4) Colonel.
(a) Attendance at a SSC or completion of AWC Distance Education Course is advantageous and selective. Except
through an established resident program such as the AWC, the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF), and
similar senior Service courses, completion of the nonresident course is the only other means by which an Army officer
can receive credit for SSC training. However, once selected and enrolled in the nonresident course, an officer is no
longer eligible to attend a resident SSC. Therefore, it is recommended that the officer discuss this with his or her
assignment manager prior to applying for the correspondence course. The SSC selection board is responsible for
selection of all Active Duty officers for participation in the AWC Distance Education Course.
(b) Colonels should strive to hold leadership positions at the Army and Joint levels as well as in different JIIM
environments. Colonels may also serve in branch/FA generalist positions that contribute to their professional development, but are not specifically related to their AOC. Criteria for selection include overall manner of performance,
military experience, military and civilian education, and demonstrated potential to serve in positions of increased
responsibility. FA 24 officers are encouraged to seek Joint duty assignments and multinational forces assignments.
These assignments are viewed as key for career enhancement.
(c) Developmental assignments at the rank of colonel will enable a senior FA 24 to continue to enhance competencies in planning, engineering, assessing, and validating Army, JIIM strategic networks in support of current and
future operations. Additionally, colonels will continue to enhance their competencies of testing, evaluation, and
documenting of technical specifications. Lastly, colonels will continue to enhance competencies of managing IT
contracts in support of IT projects. Typical developmental assignments include—
1. Director/deputy director/chief at HQDA, JIIM level.
2. Director, JSC.
3. Director, ANOSC.
4. Director, Battle Command Battle Lab, Fort Gordon, Georgia.
5. Technical advisor for an acquisition program executive office.
c. Joint assignments. Many FA 24 field grade positions are on the DOD Joint duty assignment list (JDAL). Officers
assigned to JDAL billets may attend JPME II and are designated as a Joint specialty officer (skill identifier 3L) upon
successful tour completion. Telecommunications Systems Engineers are not generally considered for Joint duty
assignments until selected for major. Even though Joint experience is important to the Army and to individual officers
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

217

for advancement into senior leadership positions, not all FA 24s will receive Joint assignments. This will not preclude
their selection to the grade of colonel.
23–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
The assignment sequencing in a FA is not as rigid as that of a branch. An objective of professional development for
FA 24 officers is to expose them to a variety of environments in which telecommunication systems engineering is
performed. After receiving initial training, FA 24 officers should seek different types of jobs within the FA 24 structure
to provide breadth to their experiences.
a. Preferences. FA 24s have diverse opportunities, which allow for numerous career development paths. Individuals
should base their preferences on ensuring a variety of full spectrum operations at all levels of Army and Joint
organizations and in different JIIM environments. The goal of FA 24 professional development is to produce officers
skilled in planning, engineering, validating, and assessing telecommunication systems. Officers will attend the TSEC
prior to initial assignment to an FA 24 position. By exception, officers are also assigned to an assignment prior to
completion of TSEC to meet real-world mission requirements.
b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental FA positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility on the
sequence of assignments. Some FA 24 billets are designated as requiring advanced civilian education, such as a
master’s degree. Officers assigned into those jobs must have completed the necessary courses of instruction. If
possible, FA 24 officers should complete an Army FA 24 assignment before an FA 24 assignment to a Joint command.
23–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
The objective under force stabilization rules for most FA 24 assignments is 36 months. Tours are possibly longer in
areas with a high concentration of billets such as the National Capital Region. OCONUS locations will continue to
require specific tour lengths. Because there are no positions that specifically qualify an FA 24 officer, completion of
ILE, the TSEC, and FA 24 assignment experience fully develops an officer in this FA. Figure 23–1, below, depicts
FA24 developmental assignments by grade.

218

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Figure 23–1. FA 24 Active Army Developmental Model

23–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for FA 24 officers. To do this, the inventory is
optimized in order to fill FA authorization requirements and to provide FA 24 officers sufficient time for development
prior to consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel and colonel. In order to enhance specialization and development, FA 24 officer participation in generalist (01A) assignments are minimized.
b. Officer Personnel Management System (OPMS) implementation. The number of FA 24 authorizations, by grade,
will vary as force structure decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more
information on current authorizations or inventory should contact either the FA 24 personnel proponent office or the
FA 24 assignments officer at AHRC.
23–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Telecommunication Systems Engineering
a. Structure. FA 24 officers serve at division echelons and above, to include JIIM environments. The chief of the
Signal Corps is the proponent for FA 24 and guides its development.
b. Acquire. FA 24 officers are accessed in the following ways:
(1) DA G–1 has approved changing functional designation from a single point at the 10th YOS to multiple
functional designation points: a limited designation at the 4th YOS and full designation at the 7th YOS. Officers
interested in being designated FA 24 can learn more by visiting the AHRC Web site via AKO.
(2) The FA 24 personnel proponent will actively recruit quality captains to fill FA 24 requirements. Officers

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

219

accessed in this manner are managed by both their basic branch and the FA, if given an assignment, and until the FDB
at the 4 or 7 year point in an officer’s career. Officers who serve in a FA24 position prior to functional designation are
not guaranteed functional designation as an FA 24. The pools of available officers identified in this manner are used to
select those officers who will receive training and an assignment in FA 24. This process replaces the Functional Area
Designation Board (FADB) that we utilized under OPMS 3. Officers will undergo a functional designation board at
their seven year mark in their career. This HQDA board will decide in which of the three functional categories each
officer is best suited to serve. Decisions are based on needs of the Army, the officer’s preference, rater and senior rater
recommendations, and the officer’s skills and training. The three functional categories are: maneuver, fires, and effects
(MF&E); operations support; and force sustainment. In addition, a limited number of officers may electively choose to
participate in a four year functional designation (done in the 3d YOS). This board is not mandatory nor is it open to all
FAs. After the board convenes, each officer will be assigned a branch or FA within one of the three functional
categories listed above. Officers who are selected to serve inside of FA24 will be then managed by their FA career
manager. Promotions to the next higher grade for the major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel board will be done
according to the functional category to which the officer belongs.
c. Distribute. The Operations Support Division, Officer Personnel Management Directorate (OPMD) at AHRC,
manages all officers serving in FA 24 assignments. Officers who complete an FA 24 assignment and are not
functionally designated as an FA 24 will return to the control of their basic branch manager at AHRC. All functionally
designated FA 24s (captain - lieutenant colonel) remain under the control of operations support. FA 24 colonels are
managed by the senior leaders development office (SLD).
d. Compensate. FA 24 officers receive the same pay, entitlements, and benefits as all other officers.
e. Deploy. Telecommunication Systems Engineering officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all times. Whether to TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA
organizations, all FA 24 officers are deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of operations.
Telecommunication Systems Engineers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to
protect national interests; or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations. FA 24 officers must prepare
themselves and their Families for the most challenging functional designation.
f. Sustain. All officers designated FA 24 will compete within their functional designation for promotion to major,
lieutenant colonel, and colonel. Officers who functionally designate into the operations support functional category as
FA 24s are eligible to change their regimental affiliation to the Signal Regiment. This can be accomplished through the
officer’s local military records officer or by contacting the FA 24 personnel proponent office.
g. Develop. FA 24 incorporates a professional officer development career plan offering significant opportunity for
schooling and assignments. As FA 24 officers progress through their careers, they should seek advanced military
schooling and education opportunities to stay abreast of the rapidly changing telecommunication technology field. FA
24 officers should diversify their assignments to broaden their operational experiences and increase their skills,
knowledge, and abilities in information technology. FA 24 officers are encouraged to complete professional training
and technical certification programs or obtain a license as a professional engineer related to telecommunication systems
engineering technology.
h. Training. FA 24 institutional training includes the following elements:
(1) Information Systems Operations Leveler Course (ISOL), Fort Gordon, GA.
(2) Telecommunications Systems Engineering Course (TSEC), Fort Gordon, GA.
(3) FA 24 senior captains and majors will attend the ILE common core in residence at a course location (CL) site.
Normally, the CL site for FA 24 is at Fort Gordon, GA. Upon completion of the common core course, FA 24 officers
are Intermediate Staff College (ISC) graduates. Full ILE credit is awarded an FA24 officer upon completion of the ILE
common core, the ISOL, and the TSEC and credentialed JPME I. The ILE common core can be taken before, after, or
in conjunction with the ISOL/TSEC course sequence. In select cases, an appropriate graduate degree program may take
the place of ISOL/TSEC for ILE credit. RC officers can attend The Army School System (TASS) classes located in
CONUS and OCONUS as well as CL sites.
(4) National Defense University (NDU) offers several professional development programs which apply to FA 24.
These include the Chief Information Officer (CIO) Certificate Program and the Information Assurance Certificate
Program.
(5) Civilian training and education programs below are available for FA 24 officers to enhance their skills within
their functional designation.
(6) Training with industry (TWI) is a work-experience program to provide an extensive exposure to managerial
techniques and industrial procedures within corporate America to competitively selected officers and NCOs. Training
received is normally not available either through the military school system or civilian university system. An officer is
assigned to a one-year tour with an approved industry partner, followed by a two year utilization assignment. FA 24
officers can apply for TWI by contacting their assignments officer at AHRC.
(7) Signal Regiment Graduate Education Program (SRGEP) and the U.S. Army Signal Center partners with civilian
universities to provide information technology related graduate degree programs for FA 24 officers. These programs

220

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

are available worldwide online. Selected graduate classes are also available in residence at Fort Gordon, GA. Interested
officers should contact the FA 24 proponent for more information.
(8) Information Assurance Scholarship Program (IASP) is a competitive, fully-funded scholarship program open to
officers and civilians throughout the DOD. Selected officers attend graduate school full-time and earn a master’s or
doctorate degree in the field of information assurance. Officers interested in this program should contact their
assignments officer at AHRC.
(9) FA 24 officers should pursue an aggressive self-development program throughout their careers that includes such
elements as industry certifications, academic certificates, professional licenses, and memberships in professional
organizations. Self-development information is obtained by visiting LandWarNet eUniversity via the AKO portal.
i. Separate. FA 24 officers separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
23–8. Telecommunication Systems Engineering Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. Army National Guard (ARNG) and U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) Telecommunication Systems Engineering officers serve the same role and mission as their Active Army counterparts. The unique
nature of the RC Soldier’s role as a citizen Soldier poses a significant professional development challenge. To fulfill
their wartime mission of planning, engineering, and managing the integration of diverse telecommunication equipment
into interoperable systems and enterprise networks, Telecommunication Systems Engineering officers are dependent
upon extensive interaction between the Active Army and the RC. The quality of the Telecommunications Systems
Engineering officers in the RC is important to support this mission. For guidance on RC officer development, see
chapter 7. FA 24 has one AOC, 24A Telecommunications Systems Engineer.
b. FA qualification and development opportunities.
(1) FA 24 officers in the RC have challenging and complex missions. Inherent with these missions are specific
managerial and technical attributes for developing and employing telecommunications systems in both fixed and
mobile configurations. FA 24 officers are tactically and technically proficient and capable of understanding the scope
of a Telecommunications Systems Engineering officer’s duties. A requirement for proficiency in both peacetime and
wartime skills will provide significant educational and experiential challenges. Planned rotation into progressively
challenging FA 24 related positions, while considered essential to producing the best-qualified Telecommunications
Systems Engineering officer, are limited to geographical considerations.
(2) Geographic dispersion of Telecommunications Systems Engineer positions constrains RC career progression in
FA 24. Few RC FA 24 officers are afforded an opportunity to meet minimum career progression goals of the Active
Army. To meet professional development objectives, RC Telecommunication Systems Engineering officers are willing
to rotate between assignments with USAR TPU organizations, ARNG units and IMA positions. Usually there are
insufficient numbers of positions within a geographic area to continue in Telecommunication Systems Engineering FA
assignments. If geographic constraints are such that assignment to a Telecommunication Systems Engineering position
is not possible, officers should seek assignment in their basic branch or in a related FA required in the geographic
region.
(3) Telecommunication Systems Engineering officer assignments in the RC are almost split evenly between TOE
and TDA organizations. Their duties and responsibilities are fundamentally the same as their Active Army counterparts
except for those personnel management, administrative, and operational requirements unique to the ARNG and USAR.
(4) Officers are assigned to the IRR when unable to accept a TPU or ARNG unit assignment. Officers in the IRR
may request assignment to a RTU, IMA position, a tour of ADSW, AT, or ADT. Officers in the IRR may meet
professional military education (PME) requirements by requesting ADT. All RC officers, major and below with less
than 15 years of active Federal Service (AFS), may request AGR assignment.
(5) RC FA 24 authorizations will vary as force structure decisions are made and actions to implement them are
taken. USAR officers desiring more information on current authorizations or positions may contact the Combined FA
Management Office (CFAMO) at the AHRC–St. Louis, Missouri. ARNG officers desiring more information on current
authorizations or positions may contact the ARNG personnel office of the state or territory in which they reside.
(6) RC officers (captain and above) who acquire telecommunication systems engineering skills, knowledge, and
attributes in a civilian workplace or through education and training may apply for constructive credit to award FA 24.
Awarding constructive credit is based on documented experience in telecommunications systems engineering; professional certifications, advanced degrees, and civilian workplace experience. Candidates should submit requests for
constructive credit with supporting documents through their USAR or ARNG component chain of command to
Commander, USASC&FG, Office Chief of Signal, ATTN: ATZH–POO, Fort Gordon, Georgia 30905. Supporting
documents include (as applicable)—
(a) Cover letter outlining qualifications.
(b) Resume.
(c) DA Form 2–1/officer record brief (ORB) or biographical record brief (BRB).
(d) Transcripts (graduate and/or undergraduate).
(e) OERs/civilian job evaluations.
(f) Civilian training certificates.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

221

(g) Industry certification certificates (MCSE, MCP, CCNA, and so on).
(h) Letter(s) of recommendation.
c. Professional development. There are four phases of professional development for RC Telecommunication Systems
Engineering officers. The phases relate to military rank and include broadly based goals and career objectives at each
rank so that an officer may expand capabilities and optimize performance. Telecommunication Systems Engineering
life cycle development objectives, RC requirements, and an officer’s own strengths, priorities, civilian experience,
private and Service provided education, and performance influence their professional development. FA qualification
standards by grade, along with typical RC duty positions are as follows:
(1) Captain.
(a) For 24A qualification as well as consideration for promotion to major, Telecommunications Systems Engineer
officers should have a hard skill undergraduate degree in one of the following:
1. Electrical engineering (communications).
2. Telecommunication systems engineering.
3. Telecommunication engineering.
4. Telecommunications management.
5. Information systems engineering.
6. Computer systems engineering.
7. Engineering.
8. Computer science.
9. Math.
(b) Officers must complete the ISOL (ATRRS Course Number 7E–F70) followed by the TSEC (ATRRS Course
Number 4C–24A) for initial qualification as a FA 24. Attendance at the ISOL is waived based on prior equivalent
education/experience. Typical TOE positions include communications-electronics engineer, systems engineer, and
communications-electronics staff officer. Typical TDA positions include Signal support officer, systems engineer, and
communications-electronics staff officer.
(2) Major. The primary professional development objective of a Telecommunication Systems Engineering major in
the RC is to continue to strengthen telecommunication systems engineering skills. During this phase, officers must
enroll in and complete ILE common core or its equivalent (50 percent completion required for promotion to lieutenant
colonel). Selected RC officers may attend the ILE common core course at a CL site such as Fort Gordon, GA. FA 24
majors are highly encouraged to pursue a specialty related graduate degree and obtain a professional engineering
license. Telecommunication systems engineering majors should serve a minimum of 24 months cumulative Service in a
Telecommunication Systems Engineering operations or operational support major position.
(3) Lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels can expect assignments to senior staff positions employing them in a
variety of diverse and challenging FA related positions. FA 24 officers should seek PME at the SSC level. Telecommunication Systems Engineering RC lieutenant colonels are eligible for selection to the rank of colonel upon completion
of the requisite Service requirements listed in chapter 7 of this pamphlet. Lieutenant colonels remain eligible for
promotion as long as they continue to serve in an active status and meet selection criteria. FA 24 lieutenant colonels
should serve a minimum of 48 months cumulative Service in a Telecommunication Systems Engineering support
position.
(4) Colonel. The primary objective for officers during this phase is maximum use of the officer’s technical and
tactical capabilities, managerial skills, and executive skills in positions of higher responsibility. RC Telecommunication
Systems Engineering colonels should serve a minimum 72 months cumulative Service in an FA 24 operations or
operational support position.

224

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

b. Unique skills.
(1) Conceptual competence. FA 53 officers must possess the ability to synthesize information and to clearly
communicate information required to make timely decisions. The uncertain conditions of military operations will
demand mental endurance and agility, often under severe conditions and time constraints. FA 53 officers must
effectively develop and communicate their vision, purpose, and direction.
(2) Interpersonal competence. FA 53 officers are part of a network operations team. They are skilled in building
teamwork within their organization and recognize that they often simultaneously belong to many teams. They must
possess the ability to express themselves to their team members clearly, concisely, and accurately, both orally and in
writing.
(3) Technical competence. FA 53 officers must possess the necessary expertise to accomplish all tasks and functions
of the FA. They are able to apply their technical knowledge and skills to solve problems associated with network. They
are able to prepare and present clear and informative briefings relating to their technical areas of expertise to their
peers, subordinates, and superiors.
(4) Tactical competence. FA 53 officers must show proficiency in required professional knowledge, judgment, and
warfighting. They must apply their doctrinal knowledge and understanding to the solution of tactical problems and
formulate and defend solutions to problems using current Army and Joint doctrine.
(5) Decisionmaking skills. FA 53 officers often work in an environment where sound and timely decisions are made
while time available for problem analysis is seriously constrained. Information gained in this environment will vary in
its completeness and ambiguity. An ability to operate under stress and make decisions is critical to success.
(6) Tactical and technical skills. FA 53 officers are warfighters who are technically proficient with information
systems and network management tools. FA 53 mission success requires that officers understand the capabilities the
network offers and can leverage their capabilities to enhance unit proficiency. FA 53 officers must leverage their
network experience to assist in the development of the LandWarNet. These skills are gained and developed through
operational assignments and continuous professional study and self-development.
c. Unique knowledge. FA 53 officers are responsible for maintaining proficiency in the information system management discipline due to the rapid change of technology and operational concepts. They also understand—
(1) The tenets of enterprise system management/network management, information assurance/computer network
defense, and information dissemination management/content staging.
(2) Emerging COTS technologies and design methodologies for possible adaptation to military purposes.
(3) The capabilities and limitations of full spectrum operations tactical, theater, and strategic information systems.
(4) The interfaces of JIIM information systems.
(5) Information management responsibilities, policies, procedures, and regulations as detailed in Federal law, DOD,
and Army regulations.
(6) How to manage information systems facilities.
(7) The requirements for documenting support for information management.
(8) How to implement information assurance requirements to include defense-in-depth strategies.
(9) Fault management, configuration management, accounting/administration, performance management, and security management (FCAPS) concepts and principles.
(10) Total cost of ownership.
(11) Quality of service and assurance.
24–3. Officer development and assignments
a. Officers are functionally designated into FA 53 at their 7th YOS to reset the field grade inventory by anticipating
future branch and functional officer requirements. Limited FD at the 4th YOS will occur to fill operational requirements
for specific FAs at the rank of captain. Officers interested in functional designation as an FA 53 should visit the AHRC
Web site via Army Knowledge On-line and follow the FA 53 link. The FA 53 personnel proponent in conjunction with
the FA 53 assignments officer will actively recruit quality captains to fill FA 53 requirements.
b. All FA 53 positions are considered FA KD positions. As officers progress through their careers, they are afforded
a variety of FA assignments and Army unique training and educational opportunities based on their performance of
duties, educational background, and the needs of the Army. FA 53 officers receive training in any of the following
methods:
(1) Primary means of FA 53 training. Officers are trained as an FA 53 by completing the Information Systems
Operations Leveler (ISOL) Course followed by the Information Systems Management (ISM) Course.
(2) Alternate means of FA training. Officers who complete a graduate or Ph.D. degree either through the fullyfunded advanced civil schooling (ACS) program or through other means are considered initially qualified in FA 53.
Non-branch 25 officers are required to attend the ISOL upon graduation from an FA 53 directed ACS assignment. The
graduate degree must align with computer science, information technology, information systems management, or
related disciplines.
(3) FA 53 officers. Selected FA 53 officers may complete graduate school or other civilian training opportunities to

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

225

prepare them for FA 53 assignments requiring additional skills. All officers are encouraged to pursue a specialty related
graduate degree or specialty related industry certification program.
c. Once an officer is FD FA 53, development and training by rank is designed to increase officer’s technical and
tactical competencies through the officer education system (OES) and through breadth and depth of assignment.
(1) Captain. Developmental assignments will enable captains to acquire network management, information assurance, and information dissemination management competencies in support of an immediate headquarters. After
acceptance and approval for FA 53, captains are assigned to developmental and utilization tours in an FA 53 coded
position after completing KD jobs in their basic branch. FA 53 captains are encouraged to pursue development and
utilization in Information Systems Management to gain training and experience prior to functional designation at 7th
YOS. Captains accessed and who are released by their basic branch will receive their FA 53 training primarily by
attending the ISOL Course followed by the ISM Course. Some captains are selected for fully-funded ACS or TWI with
a follow-on utilization assignment in an Army Education Requirements Systems (AERS) coded position. Typical
developmental assignments include:
(a) Information Systems Management officer in a brigade/BCT/SBCT S–6.
(b) Information Systems Management officer in Signal brigade/command.
(c) Information Systems Management officer in a division G–6.
(d) Information Systems Management officer in a support battalion.
(e) Information Systems Management officer in NETCOM.
(f) Information Systems Management officer in organizational staffs in all JIIM environments.
(g) Information Systems Management officer at Army or Joint staffs.
(h) Information assurance officer at Army or JIIM staffs or in organizational staffs in all JIIM environments.
(2) Major. Developmental assignments will allow majors to enhance competencies to implement and maintain local
area networks, develop and plan information technology architectures, and implement information assurance concepts
and principles. Additionally, majors will acquire competency in performing system analysis, developing response
procedures, performing accreditation processes, and integrating IT systems in all JIIM environments. Typical developmental assignments include—
(a) Information Systems Management officer in division G–6.
(b) Information Systems Management officer in Signal brigade/command.
(c) Information Systems Management officer in support brigade.
(d) Information assurance manager, division G–6.
(e) Information Systems Management officer in NETCOM.
(f) Information Systems Management officer/C4I systems officer at Army or Joint staffs or in organizational staffs
in all JIIM environments.
(g) Computer systems analyst at Army or JIIM staffs or in organizational staffs in all JIIM environments.
(h) Network plans officer/security officer/manager in organizational staffs in all JIIM environments.
(3) Lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels are generally assigned to senior staff positions of increased responsibility
where they can fully use their knowledge of the Army and their information systems management experience. At this
grade, developmental assignments will enable lieutenant colonels to enhance competencies in developing and planning
information technology architectures, and implementing information assurance concepts and principles. Lieutenant
colonels will enhance competencies in performing system analysis, developing response procedures, performing
accreditation processes, and integrating IT systems with JIIM organizations. Typical developmental assignments at
lieutenant colonel include—
(a) Information Systems Management officer at Army or Joint staffs or in organizational staffs in all JIIM
environments.
(b) Information Systems Management officer in support command.
(c) Director/Chief in Signal brigade/command.
(d) Director/Chief at Army or Joint staffs, or in organizational staffs in all JIIM environments.
(e) Deputy, CIO/chief technical officer (CTO).
(f) Network plans officer/security officer/manager at Army or Joint staffs or in organizational staffs in all JIIM
environments.
(g) Information assurance officer at Army or Joint staffs or in organizational staffs in all JIIM environments.
(h) System analyst at Army or Joint staffs or in organizational staffs in all JIIM environments.
(4) Colonel. Colonels are generally assigned to senior staff positions of increased responsibility where they can fully
use their knowledge of the Army and their information systems management experience. At this grade, developmental
assignments will enable colonels to enhance competencies in developing and planning information technology architectures, and implementing information assurance concepts and principles. Colonels will enhance competencies in performing system analysis, developing response procedures, performing accreditation processes, and integrating IT systems
with organizations operating in the different JIIM environments. Typical developmental assignments at colonel
include—

226

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(a) Deputy Chief of Staff for Information Management (DCSIM), sustaining base Active Army
(b) Director/Deputy/Chief at Army, JIIM staff level.
(c) Director, Leader College of Information Technology, SIGCEN.
(d) CIO/CTO at Army and Joint staffs or in organizational staffs in all JIIM environments.
(e) Plans/program developer at Army and Joint staffs or in organizational staffs in all JIIM environments.
d. Many FA 53 field grade positions are on the DOD JDAL. Officers assigned to JDAL billets may attend JPME II
and are designated as a Joint specialty officer (skill identifier 3L) upon successful tour completion. Information systems
managers are not generally considered for Joint duty assignments until selected for major. Even though Joint experience is important to the Army and to individual officers for advancement into senior leadership positions, not all FA
53s will receive Joint assignments. This will not preclude their selection to the grade of colonel.
24–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
The assignment sequencing in a FA is not as rigid as that of a branch. An objective of professional development for
FA 53 officers is to expose them to a variety of environments in which information systems management is performed.
After receiving initial training, FA 53 officers should seek different types of jobs within the FA 53 structure to provide
breadth to their experiences.
a. Preferences. FA 53 has diverse opportunities, which allow for numerous career development paths. The goal of
FA 53 professional development is to produce officers skilled in leading Soldiers both tactically and technically and
managing the integration of diverse forms of enterprise services. Officers will attend the ISM Course prior to initial
assignment to an FA 53 position. By exception, officers are assigned to an assignment prior to completion of ISM to
meet real-world mission requirements.
b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental FA positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility on the
sequence of assignments. Some FA 53 billets are designated as requiring advanced civilian education, such as a
master’s degree. Officers assigned into those jobs require completion of the necessary courses of instruction. If
possible, FA 53 officers should complete an Army FA 53 assignment before an FA 53 assignment to a Joint command.
24–5. Duration of developmental officer life cycle assignments
The goal under force stabilization rules for most FA 53 assignments is 36 months. Tours are longer in areas with a
high concentration of FA 53 billets such as the National Capital Region. OCONUS locations will continue to require
specific tour lengths. Figure 24–1, below, depicts the FA qualification requirements and developmental assignments by
grade.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

227

Figure 24–1. FA 53 Active Army Developmental Model

24–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for FA 53 officers. To do this, the inventory is
optimized in order to fill FA authorization requirements and to provide FA 53 officers sufficient time for development
prior to consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel and colonel. In order to enhance specialization and development, FA 53 officer participation in generalist (01A) assignments are minimized.
b. OPMS implementation. The number of FA 53 authorizations, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions are
made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more information on current authorizations or
inventory should contact either the FA 53 personnel proponent office or the FA 24 assignments officer at AHRC.
24–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Information Systems Management
a. Structure. FA 53 officers serve at division echelons and above, to include organizations in most JIIM environments. The chief of the Signal Corps is the proponent for FA 53 and guides its development
b. Acquire. FA 53 officers are accessed in the following ways:
(1) Officers are functionally designated into FA 53 at their 7th YOS. The full functional designation will occur at the
th
7 YOS and is used to reset the future field grade officer inventory by anticipating future branch and functional officer
requirements. Limited functional designation at the 4th YOS will occur when required to fill operational requirements
for specific FAs at the rank of captain. Officers interested in designation as an FA 53 should visit AHRC via the AKO

228

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

portal and follow the FA 53 link. The FA 53 personnel proponent in conjunction with the FA 53 assignments officer
will actively recruit quality captains to fill FA 53 requirements.
(2) The FA 53 Personnel Proponent will actively recruit quality captains to fill FA 53 requirements. Officers
accessed in this manner are dual tracked and are not guaranteed an assignment nor functional designation as an FA 53.
The officers identified in this manner are used to select officers who will receive training and an assignment in FA 53.
This process replaces the FADB.
c. Distribute. The Operations Support Division, Officer Personnel Management Directorate (OPMD) at AHRC,
manages all officers serving in FA 53 assignments. Officers who complete an FA 53 assignment and are not
functionally designated as an FA 53 will return to the control of their basic branch manager at AHRC. All FD FA 53s
(captain - lieutenant colonel) remain under the control of OS. FA 53 colonels are managed by the SLD office.
d. Compensate. FA 53 officers receive the same pay, entitlements, and benefits as all other officers.
e. Deploy. Information Systems Management officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally
prepared to deploy worldwide at all times. Whether to TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA
organizations, all FA 53 officers are deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of operations.
Information systems managers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect
national interests or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations. FA 53 officers must prepare
themselves and their Families for the most challenging functional designation.
f. Sustain. All officers designated FA 53 will compete within their functional designation for promotion to major,
lieutenant colonel, and colonel. Officers who functionally designate as FA 53 are eligible to change their regimental
affiliation to the Signal Regiment. This is accomplished through the officer’s local military records officer or by
contacting the FA 53 personnel proponent office.
g. Develop. FA 53 incorporates a professional officer development career plan offering significant opportunity for
schooling and assignments. As FA 53 officers progress through their careers, they should seek advanced military
schooling and education opportunities to stay abreast of the rapidly changing information technology field. FA 53
officers should diversify their assignments to broaden their operational experiences and increase their skills, knowledge, and abilities in information technology. FA 53 officers are encouraged to complete professional training and
technical certification programs or obtain a license as a professional information systems manager or related information technology disciplines.
h. Training. FA 53 institutional training includes the following elements:
(1) ISOL Course, Fort Gordon, GA
(2) ISM Course, Fort Gordon, GA
(3) FA 53 senior captains and majors will attend the ILE common core at a CL site. Normally, the CL site for FA
53 is at Fort Gordon, GA. Upon completion of the common core course, FA 53 officers are Intermediate Staff College
(ISC) graduates. Full ILE credit is awarded an FA 53 officer upon completion of the ILE common core, the ISOL
Course, and the ISM Course, and credentialed JPME I. The ILE common core is taken before, after, or in conjunction
with the ISOL/ISM Course sequence. In select cases, an appropriate graduate degree program may take the place of
ISOL/ISM Course for ILE credit. RC officers can attend The Army School System (TASS) classes located in CONUS
and OCONUS as well as CL sites.
(4) NDU offers several professional development programs which apply to FA 53. These include the CIO Certificate
Program and the Information Assurance Certificate Program.
(5) Civilian and training education described in the programs below are available for FA 53 officers to enhance their
skills within their functional designation.
(6) TWI is a work-experience program to provide an extensive exposure to managerial techniques and industrial
procedures within corporate America to competitively selected officers and noncommissioned officers. Training received is normally not available either through the military school system or civilian university system. An officer is
assigned to a one-year tour with an approved industry partner, followed by a two year utilization assignment. FA 53
officers can apply for TWI by contacting their assignments officer at AHRC.
(7) The U.S. Army Signal Center partners with civilian universities to provide IT related graduate degree programs
for FA 53 officers. These programs are available worldwide online. Selected graduate classes are also available in
residence at Fort Gordon, GA. Interested officers should contact the FA 53 proponent for more information about the
Signal Regiment Graduate Education Program (SRGEP).
(8) The Information Assurance Scholarship Program (IASP) is a competitive, fully-funded scholarship program open
to officers and civilians throughout the DOD. Selected officers attend graduate school full-time and earn a master’s or
doctorate degree in the field of information assurance. Officers interested in this program should contact their
assignments officer at AHRC.
(9) FA 53 officers should pursue an aggressive self-development program throughout their careers that includes such
elements as industry certifications, academic certificates, professional licenses, and memberships in professional
organizations.
i. Separate. FA 53 officers separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

24–8. Information Systems Management Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. ARNG and USAR Information Systems Management officers serve the same role
and mission as their Active Army counterparts. The unique nature of the RC Soldier’s role as a citizen Soldier poses a
significant challenge for professional development. To fulfill the wartime mission of managing information systems
and providing information systems expertise at all levels of command including multinational and Joint Service, the
Information Systems Management officer is dependent upon extensive interaction between the Active Army and the
RC. The quality of the Information Systems Management officers in the ARNG, USAR, and in the individual ready
reserve (IRR) is vital to support this mission. For guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7.
b. FA qualification and development opportunities.
(1) Information Systems Management officers in the RC have challenging and complex missions. Inherent with
these missions are specific managerial and technical attributes for supervising information management activities,
translating mission needs to computer systems requirements, budgeting for information systems requirements, and
developing/managing information systems. FA 53 officers are tactically and technically proficient and capable of
understanding the scope of an Information Systems Management officer’s duties. A requirement for proficiency in both
peacetime and wartime skills will provide significant educational and experiential challenges. Planned rotation into
progressively challenging FA 53 related positions, while considered essential to producing the best qualified Information Systems Management officer, are limited due to geographical considerations.
(2) Geographic dispersion of Information Systems Management positions constrains RC career progression. To meet
professional development objectives, RC Information Systems Management officers may require rotating between
assignments with USAR TPU, ARNG units, and IMA positions. Often there are insufficient numbers of positions in a
geographic area to continue in Information Systems Management FA assignments. If geographic constraints are such
that the assignment to an Information Systems Management position is not possible, officers should seek assignment in
their basic branch or a related FA required in the geographic region.
(3) TDA organizations host most RC Information Systems Management officer assignments and all Active Guard
Reserve (AGR) FA 53 positions. Their duties and responsibilities are fundamentally the same as their Active Army
counterparts except for those personnel management, administrative, and operational requirements unique to the ARNG
and USAR.
(4) Officers are assigned to the IRR when unable to accept a TPU or ARNG unit assignment. Officers in the IRR
may request assignment to a RTU, IMA position, a tour of ADSW, AT, or ADT. Officers in the IRR may meet PME
requirements by requesting ADT. All RC officers, major and below with less than 15 years of AFS, may request AGR
assignment.
(5) RC FA 53 authorizations will vary as force structure decisions are made and actions to implement them are
taken. USAR officers desiring more information on current authorizations or positions may contact the CFAMO at the
AHRC–St. Louis, Missouri. ARNG officers desiring more information on current authorizations or positions may
contact the ARNG personnel office of the state or territory in which they reside.
(6) RC Officers (captain and above) who acquire information systems management skills, knowledge and attributes
in a civilian workplace or through education and training may apply for constructive credit to award FA 53. Awarding
constructive credit is based on documented experience in information systems management; professional certifications,
advanced degrees, and civilian workplace experience. Candidates should submit requests for constructive credit with
supporting documents through their ARNG or U.S. Army RC chain of command to Commander, USASC&FG, Office
Chief of Signal, ATTN: ATZH–POO, Fort Gordon, Georgia 30905. Supporting documents include (as applicable)—
(a) Cover letter outlining qualifications.
(b) Resume.
(c) DA Form 2–1/officer record brief (ORB) or biographical record brief (BRB).
(d) Transcripts (graduate and/or undergraduate).
(e) OERs/civilian job evaluations.
(f) Civilian training certificates.
(g) Industry certification certificates (MCSE, MCP, CNA, and so on).
(h) Letter(s) of recommendation.
c. Professional development. There are four phases of professional development for RC Information Systems
Management officers. The phases relate to military rank and depict broadly based goals and career opportunities at
each rank so that an officer may expand capabilities and optimize performance. Information Systems Management life
cycle development objectives, RC requirements and an officer’s own strengths, priorities, civilian experience, private
and Service provided educational level, and performance influence his or her professional development. In addition to
the typical duty assignments found in paragraph 24–8b, RC officers are also assigned to other developmental positions,
some of which are listed within the FA qualification standards by grade, as follows:
(1) Captain. Initial entry qualification in Information Systems Management requires officers to complete the ISM
Course at Fort Gordon or obtain a graduate degree as outlined in paragraph 24–8a, above. During this phase, officers
are encouraged to pursue a specialty-related graduate degree. Officers should seek an FA 53 assignment at captain but

230

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

it is not required. Additional typical RC captain positions include systems automation officer, automation management
officer, software engineer officer, and systems operations officer.
(2) Major. The primary professional development objective of Information Systems Management majors in the RC
is to continue to strengthen information systems management skills. During this phase, officers must enroll in and
complete ILE, or its equivalent (50 percent completion required for promotion to lieutenant colonel). Selected RC
officers may attend the ILE common core course at a CL site such as Fort Gordon, GA. FA 53 majors are highly
encouraged to pursue a specialty related graduate degree. Information Systems Management majors should serve a
minimum of 24 months cumulative Service in an Information Systems Management operations or operational support
major position for consideration for FA qualification. Additional typical RC major positions include Information
Management officer and systems analyst.
(3) Lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels can expect assignments to senior staff positions employing them in a
variety of diverse and challenging FA related positions. FA 53 officers should seek PME at the SSC level. Information
Systems Management RC lieutenant colonels are eligible for selection to the rank of colonel upon completion of the
requisite Service requirements listed in chapter 7 of this pamphlet. Lieutenant colonels remain eligible for promotion as
long as they continue to serve in an active status and meet selection criteria. Information Systems Management
lieutenant colonels should serve a minimum of 48 months cumulative Service in FA 53 positions for FA qualification.
Additional typical RC lieutenant colonel positions include assistant DCSIM, automation support officer, and information management plans officer.
(4) Colonel. RC FA 53 colonel positions are limited and reserved for qualified FA 53 officers. The primary
objective for officers during this phase is to use previously developed technical and tactical capabilities, as well as
managerial and executive skills and experience to accomplish the RC information management mission at the Regional
Support Command, State Adjutant General, National Guard Bureau, and DA levels.
d. The RC life cycle development model for FA 53 officers is shown in figure 24–2, below.

(b) Understand highly technical space concepts used to support military operations. These include, but are not
limited to—
1. Remote sensing across the entire electromagnetic spectrum to include, but not limited to radio frequency, electrooptical, infrared, hyper-spectral, radar, change detection, and moving target indicator (MTI).
2. Geospatial sensing.
3. Communications architecture and networks.
4. Missile warning
5. Information operations that support or require the support of Space Operations.
(c) Conduct force and crisis intervention planning and operations as related to space.
(d) Leverage current and future space-based technologies in non-traditional ways to solve new and emerging
military problems.
(2) Astronauts must understand, acquire, and apply the highly complex, technical skills specified and required by
NASA.
(3) In addition to the skills outlined above, all Space Operations officers will be called upon to—
(a) Write and present in-depth briefings at all levels; therefore, be capable of clearly and accurately communicating
technical information and concepts.
(b) Educate and train others about space.
(c) Systematically analyze problems and develop alternative solutions.
(d) Implement plans and orders.
(e) Be adept at organizing workload, assigning tasks, and mentoring civilian and military subordinates.
c. Unique attributes. Space Operations officers are imbued with the Army Values and the Warrior Ethos as
warfighters who will—
(1) Understand abstract issues and employ unique techniques to solve complex problems.
(2) Possess the ability to apply decisionmaking theory to optimize the decision making process.
(3) Think creatively and reason critically.
(4) Be able to translate complex technical information into operational applications.
(5) Be able to operate and interact within Army and JIIM organizations and environments.

25–3. Officer developmental assignments
Officers desiring designation into Space Operations are encouraged to seek space-related assignments and educational
opportunities (FA 40 or requiring the skill identifier (SI), 3Y, space activities) at the earliest opportunity. When
captains are given the option to indicate a FA preference, those who indicate Space Operations as a FA of interest can
be identified by the FA 40 personnel proponent office and FA 40 CF manager for further assistance.
a. Space Operations, 40A, FA qualification and development. Officers who successfully complete the educational
requirements below and successfully perform in a Space Operations FA assignment are qualified in the FA. Officers
are then afforded other Army, Joint, and civilian space-related educational opportunities based on their performance of
duties and the needs of the Army.
(1) Qualifying education. Space Operations officers have certain requirements to ensure they are developed and well
grounded in Army and Joint operations.
(a) All officers must complete the basic functional qualification training, the Space Operations officer Qualification
Course (SOOQC), which is the FA 40 phase of ILE (FA 40 ILE). Officers serving in select areas (for example, NASA)
may submit a request for waiver identifying comparable training and/or experience and by completing space training
specified by the FA 40 personnel proponent office. “SPACE OPNS OFF QUAL CR” will be entered into Section VI,
Military Education, of the ORB.
(b) Completion of SOOQC is highly desired prior to the initial FA 40 assignment and must be completed prior to
consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
(c) Completion of National Security Space Institute Space 300 course is highly desired for senior officers and
required prior to consideration for promotion to colonel beginning with year group 1998.
(2) Professional development. Officers are encouraged to pursue educational opportunities as part of lifelong
learning and to enhance their professional competence and personal development.
(a) Select Space Operations officers will have the opportunity to attend an advanced military studies program (for
example, SAMS, SASS), participate in ACS or TWI.
(b) All officers are encouraged to pursue graduate-level degrees in a space-related or other proponent-approved field
to improve performance and contributions in the highly technical field of space-based operations. Specifically—
1. In order to ensure optimized support to warfighting commanders, Space Operations officers must possess an indepth understanding of all aspects of space-based capabilities. Warfighting commanders and their staff will rely on the
FA 40 to be the expert in all space-related technologies.
2. Experienced Space Operations officers may be called on to serve in the research and development field for future
space capabilities during assignments at such places as the NRO or battle labs. The nature of these assignments
requires advanced academic training to ensure Army space needs are adequately addressed.
3. Space officers will be called on to develop the curriculum, educate, and train the next generation of Army Space
Cadre beginning at the Service academies and continuing through the FA 40 training process.
(c) To stay highly knowledgeable of up-to-date developments in space, all Space Operations officers are encouraged
to attend the periodic space operations training conference and to complete training updates as announced by the FA 40
personnel proponent office.
(3) KD experiences. To be fully considered fully developed in the FA, officers optimally will serve for 24 months in
a FA 40 or space-related position (to include space-related schooling or training) at each rank, beginning at major. 12
months experience is desired for captains. Success will depend not on the number or type of positions held, but rather
on the quality of duty performance in every assignment.
(4) Officer generalist (01A) assignments. Space Operations officers can expect to serve in officer generalist (formerly branch immaterial) assignments. These duty positions require a broad understanding of Army leadership, doctrine,
policy, force structure, and management and are not identified with or limited to one specific branch or FA. These
billets ensure Space Operations officers sustain the knowledge and understanding of the operational force and include
but are not limited to Joint, ROTC, USMA, Army Staff, and Inspector General.
(5) Joint assignments. Space Operations FA positions may be on the JDAL. Officers assigned to those billets may
attend JPME and will be designated as a Joint specialty officer (SI 3L) upon successful tour completion. Space
operations are inherently Joint. As members of the Army and DOD Space Cadre, FA 40 captains and above can expect
to serve in JIIM environments. Even though Joint experience is important to the Army and to individual officers for
advancement into senior leadership positions, lack of such assignment will not preclude their selection to the rank of
colonel.
b. FA 40C FA qualification, development, and assignment. After nomination by the U.S. Army Human Resources
Command (AHRC) and upon selection by NASA, Army astronaut candidates are assigned to NASA Johnson Space
Center per the DOD and Army MOU with NASA referenced in paragraph 25–1b(1). Astronaut candidates complete
12–18 months of technical NASA-specified training and education. After completion of the candidate course of
instruction, they are automatically functionally designated 40C and are eligible for assignment to space shuttle or ISS
missions. As astronauts, they will perform duties as assigned by the Chief, Astronaut Office, and NASA Johnson Space
Center. Duties will include flight assignments, training, and collateral technical assignments. lthough most astronaut
candidates will enter the program at the grade of major or lieutenant colonel, NASA’s selection process is irrespective

236

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

of military rank. Levels of responsibility in assignments generally increase with space flight experience and demonstrated performance. Some astronaut colonels will serve in the advanced capacities listed in paragraph 25–1b(1).
25–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. The Space Operations FA has diverse opportunities that enhance the development of multi-skilled
officers. Officers should balance assignments in order to gain a breadth and depth of operational and staff experience
across all echelons of command and types of units. Assignments in the Space Operations FA are made to develop the
officer’s ability to achieve that goal and include both operational and staff positions. Since space and space operations
are inherently Joint, officers are encouraged to pursue assignments which develop expertise in support of JIIM
environments. Astronauts will serve in functions as dictated by NASA’s needs.
b. Precedence. Officers will serve primarily in the FA, but may serve at least one assignment outside the FA as part
of their professional development. Assignment to FA positions will have precedence. The design of assignments should
develop the multi-skilled and creative senior leader highly desired in today’s Army, capable of operating across the full
spectrum of operations. FA assignments are all equally important and one does not take precedence over another.
25–5. Duration of developmental officer life cycle assignments
Most assignments for Space Operations officers will be 24 to 36 months. Tours could be longer in areas with a high
concentration of space billets such as the National Capital Region or Colorado Springs, Colorado, but not for excessive
rotations. OCONUS locations will continue to require specific tour lengths. Astronauts, FA 40C, will be assigned to the
NASA Army detachment at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, per the DOD/Army/Navy/Air Force, NASA
MOU referenced in paragraph 25–1b(1).
a. Key space operations FA positions. Assignments are all equally important and one assignment does not take
precedence over another. An officer is expected to design his/her career path to include a variety of assignments as
discussed in paragraph 25–4, above. Space Operations officers typically complete an Army FA assignment before
being assigned to a Joint command. As key members of the Army Space Cadre, FA 40s can expect to serve either in
support of or assigned to various space organizations within the Army and JIIM environments and organizations.
b. Space operations FA life cycle. Figure 25-1, below, depicts a Space Operations FA life cycle with examples of
some FA assignments.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

237

Figure 25–1. FA 40 Active Army Developmental Model

25–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for Space Operations officers. The inventory must be
optimized in order to fulfill FA and officer generalist (01A) authorization requirements and provide officers sufficient
time to be fully qualified in the FA.
b. Fluctuation of structure. The number of Space Operations authorizations, by grade, will vary as force structure
decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. As noted in 25–3, during OPMS implementation, Space
Operations officers may serve in space-related organizations and in positions where duties qualify them as Space
Operations positions, but had not been coded as an FA 40 position. Officers desiring more information on current
authorizations or inventory should contact either the SMDC/ARSTRAT FA 40 personnel proponent office or the FA 40
CF manager at the AHRC Operations Support Division.
25–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Space Operations
a. The sustainment of FA 40s is largely achieved through routine communication within the FA on all space and
professional development issues. To facilitate this, officers are encouraged to subscribe to professional development
periodicals such as the Army Space Journal. Additionally, Web-based knowledge centers have been established as a
repository for space-related documents and as a Web-based, collaborative medium to interface within the space
community. Officers are encouraged to contribute articles, briefings, and information papers to these initiatives to
exchange space related information and ideas.
b. FA 40s are authorized to wear a distinctive Air Force skills badge per agreement with U.S. Air Force Space

238

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Command and the Army, after completing specified criteria. The FA 40 personnel proponent office approves awarding
of the badge and coordinates changes to badge wear policies.
c. FA 40s are the core of the Army’s Space Cadre and a key element of DOD’s Space Cadre. The Space Cadre was
created per the 2001 DOD Commission to assess U.S. National Security Space Management and Organization. The
Army Space Cadre, as part of the DOD Cadre, must be managed, trained, and professionally developed to meet criteria
established by the Executive Agent for Space to ensure space professionals across the Services are trained, experienced,
and qualified to meet Service obligations. The Army participates as part of the Space Human Capital Resource
Working Group and the Space Professional Oversight Board to ensure FA 40s are integrated as part of the Space
Cadre.
d. Select FA 40s are afforded opportunities for full-time ACS programs for space related masters degrees at the
Naval Post Graduate School, Air Force Institute of Technology, and other civilian institutions. Selection for these
programs is accomplished by AHRC in coordination with the FA 40 personnel proponent office on an annual basis.
Additionally, officers may receive graduate level credit hours for completing SOOQC. Information about additional
ACS opportunities is available through the FA 40 personnel proponent office or the AHRC FA 40 Career Manager.
e. FA 40s also have the opportunity for experiences in the TWI program. Upon selection through a centralized
process at AHRC, officers spend a year working at a civilian company in order to gain knowledge and experience in
management and development of space capabilities. Officers then serve in a designated follow-on assignment related to
the experience they gained during that year.
25–8. Space Operations Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. RC Space Operations officers serve in the same role as their Active Army (Active
Army) counterparts. Therefore, the development objectives and qualifications for the RC Space Operations officer
basically parallel those planned for their Active Army counterparts. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation
through assignments in their basic branches before specializing in FA 40. They may also establish credentials relevant
to Space operations in their civilian careers and should keep their career managers apprised of specific competencies
with potential application to their future as Army Space professionals. The quality and quantity of training that RC
Space Operations officers receive prior to mobilization dictates, to a large extent, their wartime effectiveness. For more
guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7.
b. FA qualification and development opportunities. RC officers should strive for Space Operations assignments that
yield the same developmental opportunities as their Active Army counterparts even though they are limited by
geographical considerations. The Citizen-Soldier’s dual role presents a unique challenge in pursuing such an ambitious
development program. To meet professional development objectives, RC Space Operations officers may be required to
rotate among ARNG and USAR TPUs, the IRR, the IMA, IRR–Augmentee, the Army Joint Reserve Element (ARE),
or AGR programs.
c. Intent. The intent is to provide as many officers as possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and
staff positions due to the limitations imposed by geographical considerations, which necessitates these transfers.
Additionally, there may be occasions when RC officers will be transferred to the trainee, transient, holdee, student
(TTHS) account while they complete mandatory educational requirements. Such transfers should not be seen as
impacting negatively on the officer’s career. The success of an RC officer is not measured by the length of Service in
any one component or control group, but by the officer’s breadth of experience, duty performance, and adherence to
the requirements described herein. Every attempt will be made to assign RC officers to FA 40 or a branch space-related
position. Unlike their Active Army counterparts, geographic constraints limit the ability of RC officers to stay in FA 40
positions throughout their career. When barriers such as this deny the opportunity to successfully participate in the
USAR, officers are encouraged to seek qualification and utilization in related FAs (FA 24, FA 30, or FA 34). RC FA
40 qualification standards are as follows:
(1) Lieutenant. N/A.
(2) Captain.
(a) Become fully qualified in their basic branch.
(b) Complete the CCC.
(3) Major.
(a) Successfully complete ILE common core.
(b) Successfully complete either the resident or Reserve Version of the Space Operations officer portion of ILE.
(c) Serve in a FA 40 position for a minimum of 24 months (may include some space-related schooling or training
with on-the-job experience preferred).
(d) Officers are encouraged to obtain a master’s degree from an accredited college or university in a space-related
discipline to reinforce additional skills required for certain Space Operations assignments.
(4) Lieutenant Colonel. Serve in a FA 40 position for a minimum of 24 cumulative months (may include some
space-related schooling or training with at least 12 months of job experience) as a field-grade officer.
(5) Colonel. All Space Operations officers selected for colonel should be enrolled or have applied for the AWC

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

239

(Distance Education Course, nonresident, if not selected for the resident course). They will primarily serve as Space
Operations officers on ACOM or HQDA staffs as senior practitioners in their FA or may be assigned to an officer
generalist (01A) position.
d. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for FA 40 officers is shown at figure 25–2.
below.

Chapter 26
MI Branch
26–1. Unique features of the Military Intelligence Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Military Intelligence (MI) Branch. The principal focus of MI is to provide timely, relevant,
accurate, predictive, and actionable intelligence and electronic warfare (IEW) support to commanders. MI reduces
uncertainty and risk to U.S. and Allied forces and permits effective application of combat power. MI officers lead
Soldiers and civilians in directing, collecting, processing, producing, and disseminating intelligence across the entire
operational spectrum. The intelligence requirements of a predominantly CONUS-based, force projection Army dictate
that all echelons focus on the needs of contingency forces during any crisis, deployment, or actual military operation.
This eliminates the traditional distinction between tactical, operational and strategic intelligence. The entire Army
intelligence effort must focus on support to the warfighter.

240

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

b. Unique features performed by MI Branch. All MI officers must know, understand, and be able to function in all
intelligence disciplines; human intelligence (HUMINT), imagery intelligence (IMINT), measurement and signature
intelligence (MASINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT), and open source intelligence (OSINT). Additionally MI officers
must understand the counterintelligence (CI) function and how it provides multidiscipline support to force protection
through operations security, deception, and rear area operations. It is crucial for the MI officer to be able to
communicate with and integrate products from each of the disciplines into their own intelligence products, so a more
accurate picture of ground truth can be painted for commanders and decisionmakers. Officers within the MI Branch are
assigned throughout the force from maneuver battalion level to Joint, unified and specified commands. MI officers
perform numerous tasks ranging from intelligence preparation of the battlespace (IPB) in a tactical battlefield situation,
to strategic intelligence collection management and analysis. The processes involved are refined through continuous
improvement, often in a high volume production environment. Intelligence work requires the ability to interpret
patterns associated with complex situations, as well as the ability to synthesize and interpret such activities. Intelligence
production requires the transformation of data into applicable and usable information. Analytical proficiency at the
tactical level requires an understanding of the tactical concepts of both friendly and threat operations. Some other
unique features performed by MI officers and WOs include—
(1) Command or lead, direct, and control intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations.
(2) Provide MI coordination at all levels of command.
(3) Synchronize the MI collection management process with targeting in JIIM operations.
(4) Develop doctrine, organization and equipment for the MI mission.
(5) Instruct and evaluate MI skills at Service schools and combat training centers.
(6) Serve in positions requiring general combat skills such as staff officers in military headquarters and activities
requiring combat expertise.
(7) Serve in ACOM, ASCC, DRU, HQDA, and/or JIIM levels of command.
c. Levels of intelligence. The levels of intelligence correspond to the established levels of war: strategic, operational,
and tactical. Like the levels of war, the levels of intelligence serve as a framework in which commanders and MI
personnel visualize the logical flow of operations, allocation of resources, and assignment of tasks. The levels of
intelligence are not tied to specific echelons but rather to the intended outcome of the operations which they support.
Echelons and levels of intelligence vary. The relationship is based upon the political and military objectives of the
operation and the commander’s needs. At all levels, MI officers and WOs direct, supervise, coordinate, and participate
in the planning and performance of collection and analysis of raw information. They use that information to produce
actionable intelligence and disseminate intelligence products for commanders and intelligence consumers.
(1) Tactical intelligence supports the execution of battles and engagements. It provides the tactical commander with
the intelligence he needs to employ combat elements against enemy forces and achieve the objectives of the operational
commander.
(2) Operational intelligence supports the planning and execution of campaigns and major operations and reflects the
nature of the theater of war itself. Intelligence at this level serves as a bridge between strategic and tactical levels.
Intelligence at this level supports friendly campaigns and operations by predicting the enemy’s campaign plans,
identifying their military centers of gravity, lines of communication, decisive points, pivots of maneuver, and other
components necessary for campaign design. It focuses primarily on the intelligence needs of commanders from theater
through corps and task force.
(3) Strategic intelligence supports the formation of strategy, policy, and military plans and operations at the national
and theater levels. Strategic intelligence concentrates on the national political, economic, and military considerations of
states or nations. It identifies a nation’s ability to support U.S. forces and operations (for example, ports and the
transportation infrastructure). It also predicts other nations’ responses to U.S. theater operations.
26–2. Military Intelligence officer areas of concentration
All MI officers begin their career as 35D (all-source intelligence officer) and may acquire additional AOC training
upon completion of the MI CCC (MI CCC). This provides the Army with a corps of intelligence generalists possessing
a common skill set that can succeed at all echelons. All AOCs accomplish their mission through six primary tasks
which generate intelligence synchronized to support the commander’s mission and intelligence requirements. These six
tasks; Indications and warnings, intelligence preparation of the battlespace, situation development, target development,
force protection, and battle damage assessment can be thought of as the mission essential task list for intelligence.
a. All-source intelligence officer (35D). All MI officers receive initial and advanced training as a 35D. Duties
include directing, supervising and coordinating the planning, collection, processing, production, and dissemination of
all-source intelligence (HUMINT, IMINT, MASINT, SIGINT, OSINT, and CI) at all echelons (to include JIIM). They
perform multidiscipline collection management, coordination of surveillance, and reconnaissance activities and provide
advice on the use of intelligence resources at all echelons. They supervise and perform IPB using automated
intelligence data processing systems and advise the commander and subordinate units on the enemy, weather, and
terrain.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

241

b. IMINT officer (35C). Duties include planning, directing, managing, coordinating and participating in the collection, production, analysis, exploitation, and dissemination of optical, infrared, and radar IMINT from national, operational, and tactical sensors to support reconnaissance and surveillance operations at all echelons (to include JIIM).
c. CI officer (35E). Duties include planning, directing, managing, coordinating and participating in the collection,
production and dissemination of CI information and conducting CI investigations and operations at all levels. Provide
CI input and assistance to force protection planning and execution by limiting the effectiveness of foreign multidiscipline collection directed against Army operations, activities, technology, and personnel at all echelons (to include
JIIM).
d. HUMINT officer (35F). Duties include directing, coordinating and participating in controlled collection operations
to obtain intelligence information in support of Army and DOD requirements. Senior captains may apply and must
have 35D experience prior to selection.
e. SIGINT/electronic warfare officer (35G). Duties include planning, directing, managing, coordinating, and participating in the collection, production, and dissemination of SIGINT and conducting electronic warfare at tactical,
operational, and strategic levels (to include JIIM).
f. All-source intelligence aviator (15/35). These officers serve in both Aviator and MI officer positions. As aviators,
they command platoons, companies, and battalions employing Special Electronic Mission Aircraft (SEMA) in support
of tactical, operational, and strategic intelligence missions. They perform duties as the aviation battalion and brigade
S2. They may also perform in any 35D position. As staff officers in MI aviation units, they plan for, direct, and control
SEMA units to accomplish assigned intelligence and electronic warfare missions. These officers also direct and control
the training, safety, administration, communication, supply, maintenance, transportation, and force protection activities
of SEMA units. As MI officers, they are responsible for IEW planning and operations at all levels.
g. MI WO MOSs. MI WOs are technical experts whose technical and tactical expertise and experience provide
valuable leadership throughout the MI community at all levels of command. The following are MOSs for MI WOs:
(1) All-source intelligence technicians (350F). Duties include planning, supervising, and conducting the analysis,
fusion, production, dissemination, and evaluation of all-source intelligence. All-source intelligence technicians leverage
information from all sources to include HUMINT, IMINT, MASINT, SIGINT, OSINT, and CI and leverage automation to conduct trend, pattern, and comparative analysis at all echelons. Their key function is to provide commanders
with predictive analysis regarding an enemy’s most probable course of action or reaction.
(2) Imagery intelligence technicians (350G). Duties include planning, supervising, and conducting the collection and
exploitation of IMINT from various sources. IMINT technicians participate in planning and coordinating analysis and
exploitation of tactical level imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles to leveraging national level imagery intelligence
products that support reconnaissance and surveillance operations at all echelons. Their key function is to provide
imagery-related evidence in graphic or report format to support the intelligence process.
(3) Attaché operations technicians (350Z). Duties include coordinating operations and providing operational support
in a defense attaché office. Their key function is to ensure the effective management of defense attaché operations
worldwide.
(4) CI technicians (351L). Duties include planning, supervising, and conducting security-sensitive and CI investigations operations and analysis in support of both the force protection mission and the predictive intelligence process.
Their key function is to protect the force.
(5) HUMINT collection technicians (351M). Duties include planning, supervising, and conducting HUMINT collection through interrogations, de-briefings liaison, sensitive operations, and document exploitation (DOCEX). Their key
function is to collect HUMINT information in support of the predictive intelligence process.
(6) Area intelligence technicians (351Y). Classified duty description (see AR 614–115).
(7) SIGINT analysis technicians (352N). Duties include planning, supervising, and analyzing SIGINT data in
support of the predictive intelligence process. SIGINT technicians actively participate in planning the placement and
determining the effectiveness of tactical SIGINT collection assets in support of the combat commanders. Their key
function is to provide the SIGINT portion of the all-source intelligence product.
(8) Voice intercept technicians (352P). Duties include planning, supervising, and collecting voice communications in
support of the predictive intelligence process. Their key function is to provide data on current or planned activity based
on communications interceptions.
(9) Non-morse intercept technicians (352S). Duties include planning, supervising, and conducting non-morse collection operations in support of the strategic SIGINT mission. Their key function is to provide identification and analysis
of unknown signals in support of the strategic SIGINT mission.
(10) IEW systems maintenance technicians (353T). Duties include supervising and performing IEW maintenance
operations at all echelons. Their key function is to ensure that intelligence equipment and systems are operational.
26–3. Characteristics required of officers and warrant officers
a. Unique attributes. All officers must be physically and mentally fit, maintain and display self-control, remain calm
under pressure and adhere to published standards and regulations. Officers and WOs commit to gaining experience at

242

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

all levels of command and to the lifelong pursuit of professional and civilian education. There is general agreement on
the attributes required of MI leaders:
(1) Decisive, with integrity, and character.
(2) Confident and competent decision-maker in uncertain situations.
(3) Prudent risk taker.
(4) Innovative.
(5) Adaptive thinker.
(6) Empathetic.
(7) Professionally educated, lifelong learner.
(8) Effective communicator.
b. Unique skills. The following are a core set of skills, common to all MI officers and taught at varying levels
throughout the MI education system. These skill sets have applicability to all officers, regardless of AOC—
(1) ISR synchronization. An action that integrates the planning and operation of sensors, assets, processing, exploitation, and dissemination systems in direct support of current and future operations.
(2) Collection. The acquisition of information and the dissemination of this information to processing elements.
(3) Analysis/assessment. The conversion of processed information into intelligence through the integration, evaluation, and interpretation of all source data and the preparation of intelligence products in support of known or
anticipated user requirements. Must understand military doctrine, capabilities, and order of battle of foreign states or
non-state entities
(4) Presentation. The method used to present intelligence data to the commander for decisionmaking purposes.
(5) Cultural awareness. Developing sensitivity and understanding of another ethnic group or peoples.
c. Generic skills. The MI officer and WO must also maintain expertise of the following generic Army officer skills:
(1) Understand the organization, structure, and doctrine of the warfighting Army.
(2) Retain competency in basic warfighting skills.
d. Active Army MI officer KD assignments.
(1) Defining career path success. All MI officers regardless of echelon or AOC must seek out a series of KD
assignments at each grade. KD assignments are defined as a series of assignments which, when added to institutional
training and personal development prepare an officer for promotion to the next grade. The preferred amount of time
spent in a KD assignment is 12–24 months. officer careers are driven by past skills and experiences, but officers should
strive for positions at the tactical, operational and strategic levels. Joint experience is important as the Joint expeditionary mindset becomes embedded across the Army. MI Branch does not require command for a successful career, but
officers should seek both command and key staff positions.
(2) Lieutenant.
(a) Directly accessed into MI Branch. After completing the MI Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC), Phase III
(proponent institutional training) MI lieutenants are usually assigned to serve with troops in leadership developmental
positions (that is, platoon leader, executive officer (XO), or in other assignments such as assistant S2, combat support
battalion S2, assistant brigade S2, or staff officer in an MI battalion. MI lieutenants should serve as an intelligence
officer at echelons corps and below.
(b) Branch detail lieutenant. MI Branch details approximately 60 percent of their lieutenants to the Infantry, Armor,
Artillery, Air Defense, and Chemical Branches under the Branch Detail Program. After completing their detail branch
BOLC III, officers should serve initially with troops in leadership positions (that is, platoon leader or XO).
(c) Focus. The focus of effort during the lieutenant years is to acquire, reinforce and hone troop leading, technical,
tactical, logistical, and administrative skills. Inculcation of the Warrior Ethos and Army core values is essential in the
development of young officers. Prior to promotion to captain, officers must possess an in-depth knowledge of
combined arms and intelligence operations gained through on the job training. By law, officers must obtain a
baccalaureate degree before promotion to captain.
(3) Captain. Officers generally attend the combined MI officer’s Tactician Course (MIOTC) and the MI CCC at
their 4th YOS. All Officers will attend the MIOTC and the MI CCC. Captains must then aggressively prepare for and
seek the skills and experience that will qualify them for promotion. Optimally an officer should serve for an aggregate
of 12–24 months in a KD assignment. The following are considered KD assignments for MI captains:
(a) Battalion S2.
(b) BCT A/S2 S2X/electronic attack officer.
(c) Analysis and control element.
(d) Collection manager/targeting officer/watch officer.
(e) Company or detachment command.
(f) CTC observer/controller (OC).
(g) MI advisor-combat (foreign nation TT).
(h) Developmental branch specific assignments will provide captains with exposure to the Army and in some cases,

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

243

to JIIM organizations: MI officers should get maximum exposure by serving in multiple MI assignments. Officers can
submit, via AHRC Web site, their preference for FA and be recruited by that FA for possible change of functional
designation during their 7th year of commissioned Service.
(4) Major.
(a) Upon completion of ILE, majors must aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience that will
prepare them for duties as a lieutenant colonel. The following are considered desired KD assignments for MI majors:
(b) S2 of a BCT/Regiment/SF/group.
(c) Brigade S2.
(d) Division Analysis and Control Element (ACE) Chief.
(e) Deputy G2/G2 planner.
(f) G2X division/BCT S2X.
(g) XO or S3 of any battalion/brigade/goup.
(h) Joint staff (35 coded positions).
(i) Army Staff (35 coded positions).
(j) Training teams (TTs); division MTT, brigade MTT, regional MTT, and Joint MTT.
(k) Majors must actively pursue self-development opportunities to fully master all aspects of operations including
JIIM operations. Self-development includes correspondence courses, civilian education, institutional training, and
completion of ILE or equivalent.
(l) Skills and experience will drive an officer’s career path and future assignments at this level.
(5) Lieutenant colonel. Officers selected for lieutenant colonel and CSL positions must seek assignments within the
branch and with JIIM positions that directly contribute to, and develop the Army intelligence profession. While the
opportunities for continuing Service and success broaden for the branch’s senior intelligence officers, continued
performances at multiple echelons (corps, Army Joint, and national) in the following KD assignments is essential for
future select for promotion and senior Service college selection:
(a) Key billet division G2.
(b) CSL battalion level command.
(c) G2X (corps and above).
(d) ACE Chief (corps and above).
(e) CTC senior intelligence officer.
(f) Deputy brigade commander.
(g) Deputy corps G2.
(h) Joint staff (35 coded or branch generalist).
(i) Army Staff (35 coded or branch generalist).
(j) Completion of a 2 year assignment in a specific position is preferred. Ideally, MI lieutenant colonels will serve at
multiple echelons and types of positions throughout their tenure. MI lieutenant colonels should seek the opportunity for
Joint qualification, as well as Intelligence broadening assignments and Intelligence focused civilian and institutional
training, as well as professional development through progressive assignments.
(6) Colonel. Colonels contribute to the branch by serving in critical assignments to include the following:
(a) Corps G2.
(b) Army G2.
(c) J2 (JSOC, JTFs, and so on).
(d) MI Brigade Commander.
(e) TRADOC capabilities manager.
(f) Joint staff (35 coded or branch generalist).
(g) Army Staff (35 coded or branch generalist).
e. Branch and branch generalist assignments. The goal for assigning MI officers is to assign them to both tactical
and strategic units in order to give them expertise in both. MI officers (captain and above) can also expect to serve in
branch generalist assignments. These assignments may consist of recruiting or IG positions allowing officers to develop
wider perspectives of the Army or other Services.
f. Joint assignments. MI officers can expect to be assigned to Joint duty beginning at the rank of major. Joint
experience is important to the Army and is essential to individual officers for their advancement into senior leadership
positions.
g. Active Army MI WO development. A generic career development model consists of the four primary levels of WO
utilization:
(1) Entry level. WOs are accessed according to the needs of the Army, previous MOS, education, and experience.
Once accepted, the applicant must attend Warrant Officer Candidate School (WOCS) conducted by the Warrant Officer
Career Center at Fort Rucker, Alabama. This is a course which tests the mental, emotional, and physical stamina of
candidates to determine their acceptability into the WO corps. The focus of the course is common material that

244

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

provides the skills, knowledge, and behaviors required of all warrant officers, regardless of specialty. Upon course
completion, the candidate is eligible for appointment to the grade of WO1 but is not yet MOS-qualified.
(2) Basic level (WO1/CW2). After graduating from WOCS, the new WO1 must attend the MI WOBC conducted by
the U.S. Army Military Intelligence Center at Fort Huachuca, AZ. WOBC provides functional training in the applicable
MI MOS and reinforces the leadership training provided in WOBC. Upon successful completion of WOBC, the WO is
awarded an MI MOS and given an initial operational assignment. Operational assignments continue for the next several
years. Throughout this period, warrant officers should continue their self-development, to include the pursuit of civil
education goals. At approximately the 4th year of WO Service, warrant officers will be enrolled in prerequisite studies
for the WOAC, an MOS-immaterial course administered by the Distributive Education Section of the Warrant Officer
Career Center. Completion of this course renders the officer eligible to attend the resident MI WOAC upon selection to
the grade of CW3.
(3) Advance level (CW3/CW4). Warrant officers should attend the resident portion of the MI WOAC not later than
one year after promotion to CW3. WOAC must be completed prior to promotion to CW4. Upon completion, warrant
officers are normally assigned to positions established for the grade of CW3. At this point, warrant officers should
actively pursue the next civil education goal. WOs should attend the Warrant Officer Staff Course (WOSC) conducted
at the Warrant Officer Career Center not later than one year after promotion to CW4. WOSC must be completed prior
to promotion to CW5. Upon graduation from WOSC, the WO will serve in positions designated for the grade of CW4.
(4) Senior level (CW5). WOs will attend the Warrant Officer Senior Staff Course (WOSSC) at the Warrant Officer
Career Center not later than one year after promotion to CW5. Upon promotion to CW5 and completion of the
WOSSC, the WO will serve the remainder of their career in positions designated for the grade of CW5.
(5) Branch generalist assignments. WOs can expect to serve in branch generalist or staff assignments that may or
may not relate directly to their MOS, but which are important to the Army.
(6) Joint assignments. Given the increased emphasis for Joint duty experience, advanced level, and master level
WOs can expect consideration for assignment to Joint organizations. Joint experience is important to the Army and is
essential in the professional development of individual officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions.
(7) Other assignments. MI WOs may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated above. Such
assignments may include White House, duty with the United Nations, and support to the RC. The spectrum of possible
assignments is vast, and these assignments are highly important, requiring mature, skilled, and well-grounded officers.
26–4. Military Intelligence officer assignment preferences and skill producing programs
a. Officer preferences. MI officers follow multiple career patterns to meet the needs of the Army. There is no single
ideal career pattern for MI officers as they may choose skills and experiences that drive towards commanding units or
skills and experiences that develop them to be G2s or senior intelligence officers for their organizations. MI requirements and resulting officer career patterns reflect a wide range of training and duty assignment responsibilities.
b. Additional skill producing programs. MI officers, and in certain instances warrant officers, may apply for a
number of skill producing programs that award a skill identifier (SI). As a rule, selected MI officers may participate in
only one of the following programs:
(1) National Systems Development Program (NSDP) (SI 3F). The NSDP is a one year intensive academic program
comprised of various courses offered throughout the intelligence community. This program is designed to develop a
cadre of space smart collection managers who understand and have the ability to harness national intelligence systems
and capabilities and incorporate national level support into tactical intelligence collection plans. Graduates serve an
initial 12–24 month utilization tour applying their newly acquired skills as a division or corps intelligence collection
manager in an Army priority unit upon completion. Selectees PCS to Fort Meade, Maryland, and are positioned to
serve as future ACE Chiefs, battalion S3/XOs and deputy G2s.
(2) Junior officer Cryptologic Career Program (JOCCP) (SI 3W). The JOCCP is a 3 year program conducted at the
National Security Agency at Fort Meade, Maryland. Graduates serve six-month operational tours in up to six National
Security Agency work centers and 1,000 hours of formal instruction at the National Cryptologic School The three-year
program develops each officer’s cryptologic and management skills to prepare them for future leadership roles as
battalion S3/XOs in essential cryptologic assignments. Selectees PCS to Fort Meade, Maryland, and follow-on
assignments are to operational priority units throughout the Army.
(3) ACS programs. Some MI officers may receive the opportunity to participate in fully-funded ACS programs that
support MI requirements. Officers demonstrating superior performance and potential can be awarded fully-funded
master’s degrees by their ACOM/ASCC/DRU during their 8th - 12th YOS. Officers obtaining Army funded graduate
degrees incur three days Service obligation for each day enrolled in schooling.
(4) Postgraduate Intelligence Program (PGIP). PGIP is a 12-month graduate degree producing program earning
officers and warrant officers a Master of Science in Strategic Intelligence. The curriculum consists of nine core
courses, five electives, and a thesis covering subjects over the National Intelligence Architecture. The MSSI curriculum
emphasizes developing the student’s understanding of intelligence at the national level, military strategy, national
security policy, and the planning and execution of Joint and combined operations. Officer and WO selectees PCS to
Fort Belvoir, Virginia for attendance at the Joint Military Intelligence College at Bolling AFB, and will have follow-on

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

245

assignments to serve as brigade S2s, ACE Chiefs, battalion S3/XOs, and deputy G2s throughout the Army. WOs will
have follow-on assignments usually to Corps and above units to leverage knowledge and skills gained while attending
PGIP.
(5) Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). NPS is an 18-month graduate degree producing program with several
curriculums geared towards MI/SFs specialties. The Regional Studies curricula, Security Studies curriculum, Defense
Analysis curriculum, and the already approved ILE-equivalent SOLIC model for current 18 series and FA 39 officers
based on the Defense Analysis Course are recommended for MI officers. Selectees PCS to Monterrey, California for
attendance at the NPS, and will have a follow-on assignment to serve as a group or regimental S2 within USASOC.
26–5. Duration of developmental officer life cycle assignments
a. MI Branch officer KD positions. Officers should strive for a vast array of experience gained through varied
assignments at all echelons. This ensures the officer has acquired the skills to remain proficient in MI Branch at each
grade, and is qualified for promotion and retention in the branch. The preferred amount of time spent in individual key
developmental assignments and CSL positions is 12 to 24 months.
b. MI WO KD positions. Once they have completed MI WOBC, MI WOs normally begin their career serving in
tactical positions at division or below as WO1s or CW2s. Not later than one year after promotion to CW3, warrant
officers attend the WOAC. Upon completion, CW3s spend about 5–6 years serving in positions at corps and echelons
above corps. Not later than one year after promotion to CW4, WOs attend the WOSC, and upon completion, CW4s are
often assigned to EAC or staff positions. Not later than one year after promotion to CW5, warrant officers attend the
WOSSC and spend the rest of their career in key staff, national, or Joint positions.

247

Figure 26–2. Military Intelligence WO Developmental Model

e. Key Active Army officer life cycle initiatives.
(1) Structure. Based on Army transformation (modularity) there will be a growth in requirements at all levels.
However, the number of and type of assignments available will fluctuate as force structure decisions are made. During
this time of realignment, MI officers and warrant officers should focus on gaining experience at all levels.
(2) Acquisition.
(a) Officers will continue to be accessed into the MI Branch through the United States Military Academy (USMA),
Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC), and Officer Candidate School (OCS). MI officer accessions are based on
preference, qualifications, and needs of the Army. MI Branch will also continue to provide lieutenants to the branch
detail program.
(b) WOs will continue to enter into the MI through NCO accessions, both in traditional and non-traditional feeder
MOSs. Accessions are based on the needs of the Army.
f. Officer distribution.
(1) Officer. MI Branch officers will be provided assignment opportunities to develop the skills and experience
necessary for Service at the next higher grade. The sequencing and timing of assignments is driven by Army priorities.
The Global War on Terror (GWOT) and Army transformation are currently the driving forces behind the distribution of
officers. Officers must be ready to go on any contingency as it arises. Force stabilization will also continue to influence
officer distribution.
(2) WO. The distribution pattern for MI WOs continues to be a combination of assignments between TOE and TDA

248

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

units in CONUS and OCONUS. This will ensure that MI WOs gain the requisite technical skills across a broad
spectrum of assignments.
g. Deployment.
(1) Officer. MI Branch officers are warfighters who must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to warfighter centric units or training organizations, readiness is imperative to
success of the mission. Officers must prepare themselves and their Families for planned and no notice deployments. In
today’s fast-paced and uncertain operating environment, Families must be ready for multiple deployments of unknown
duration.
(2) WO. MI WOs are technicians and leaders who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA organizations,
all MI WOs must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. MI WOs may deploy with
their units or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and
peace keeping missions.
26–6. Sustainment Office Personnel Management System
a. Officer.
(1) Promotion. Skills and experience, duty performance, and adherence to branch requirements are all factors that
influence promotion. MI officers are granted options in pursuing a career that benefits the Army yet allows them the
option of pursuing either the command track or the intelligence practitioner track. Officers should strive for a series of
KD assignments at each rank that prepares them for success at the next level while maintaining grounding in both the
tactical and strategic Army. MI officers compete for promotion in the operations support functional category. Promotion rates will be determined by Army needs/Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) goals.
(2) CSL. The CSL identifies MI lieutenant colonels for the most critical leadership and analytical positions
throughout the Army. The board selects officers in four MI functional categories, as well as four branch immaterial
categories. In addition to the MI positions, MI lieutenant colonels unique skills, attributes, and experience provide an
exceptionally qualified officer for the diverse branch immaterial commands, specifically special troops battalions. MI
categories include:
(a) MI key billets, division G2.
(b) MI operational command.
(c) MI strategic support command.
(d) MI training command.
b. WO.
(1) Promotion. WOs will compete for promotion based on the needs of the Army, branch requirements and the fully
and best-qualified methods. Active and RC WOs will maintain their respective systems.
(2) Assignments. MI WOs should strive to develop a career pattern to maximize their technical expertise and
leadership growth. This would include assignments at the tactical, operational, and strategic level as well as Joint,
national, and in the training base. Solid performance at various levels of assignment is highly desirable strategic level
as well as Joint, national, and in the training base. Solid performance at various levels of assignment is highly
desirable.
26–7. Military Intelligence Reserve Component officers
a. The MI total force includes officers within the ARNG and the USAR. There are significant opportunities for RC
officers in troop units and as selected reserve in the IMA program. The opportunities range from lieutenant to general
officer positions.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

249

Figure 26–3. MI RC Developmental Model

c. Required training and recommended branch developmental assignments by grade are as follows:
(1) Lieutenant.
(a) Complete resident MI BOLC III (within 24 months for USAR, 18 months for ARNG).
(b) Complete a tour in an MI officer position.
(2) Captain.
(a) Complete the MIOTC.
(b) Complete the MI CCC.
(c) Complete a tour in an MI officer position graded for captain or higher.
(3) Major.
(a) Complete nonresident ILE common core. (ARNG officer refer to NGR 600–100.)
(b) Complete a tour in an MI officer position graded for major or higher.
(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Complete ILE. (ARNG officers refer to NGR 600–100.)
(b) Complete a tour in an MI officer position graded for lieutenant colonel or higher.
(5) Colonel. Complete a tour in an MI officer positions graded for colonel or higher.
d. Emphasis is on serving in MI positions regardless of unit. RC commands are encouraged to assign MI company
grade officers to S2 positions in artillery, engineer, or similar RC troop units.

250

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

e. RC officers (major and below) who are not MI, but are selected to hold MI positions because there are no MI
officers available, must commit to branch transfer and must attend MIOTC and MI CCC. RC officers who branch
transfer to MI must pass a special background investigation (SBI) with eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented
information (SCI) as this is a requirement for commissioning in MI Branch.
f. There are RC configured versions of MIOTC and MI CCC that permit RC officers to complete the courses while
maintaining their civilian jobs. All AGR MI officers will attend the Active Army resident MI CCC.
26–8. Military Intelligence Reserve Component warrant officers
a. General career development. RC WO development objectives and qualifications basically parallel those planned
for their Active Army counterparts. Junior WOs must develop a strong foundation through assignments in their branch.
b. Branch development opportunities. Even though geographical considerations limit some RC WOs, all should
strive for MI assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as their Active Army counterparts.
c. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for MI WOs is at figure 26–2. See chapter 7
for a detailed discussion of RC WO professional development issues.

Chapter 27
Strategic Intelligence Functional Area
27–1. Unique features of the Strategic Intelligence functional area
a. Unique purpose of the Strategic Intelligence FA. The Strategic Intelligence FA (FA 34) provides focused, trained
corps of strategic intelligence professionals to Army organizations, combatant commands, DOD, the Joint staff, and
interagency communities with tailored intelligence required for the development of national security policy and theater
strategic plans and operations. The Strategic Intelligence officer acts as the premier expert on strategic and global
intelligence activities that accomplish U.S. Strategic objectives developed through unique training, education, and
recurring assignments at theater, national, Joint, DOD, and interagency communities. The Strategic Intelligence officer
translates national security strategy into intelligence strategies. Providing premier intelligence in a strategic context, the
Strategic Intelligence officer enables decisionmakers and warfighters to dominate the battlespace. The Strategic
Intelligence officer represents Army interests at the Joint and interagency communities. The Commanding General,
U.S. Army Intelligence Center is the proponent for FA 34.
b. Unique functions performed by the Strategic Intelligence FA. Strategic Intelligence officers work primarily at
echelons above corps worldwide. FA 34 positions exist in intelligence units, headquarters, national agencies and unified
commands. FA 34 officers will participate in all phases of the intelligence cycle. The Strategic Intelligence officer is an
agile, national and theater level and interagency expert - who leads, plans and directs all-source analysis, intelligence
systems, and intelligence policy and programs - supporting key decisionmakers, policymakers and warfighters in an
interagency, Joint, coalition, and combined environment. Exercising broad responsibility and authority, the Strategic
Intelligence officer is capable of integrating interagency activities and interacting with the foreign intelligence services
to produce predictive strategic intelligence to advise policymakers and combatant commanders to deliver overwhelming
advantage to our warfighters, defense planners, and national security policymakers.
c. Unique features of work in the Strategic Intelligence FA. Work within FA 34 requires the transformation of raw
data into processed intelligence and the application or integration of that intelligence into plans, operations, or
situational awareness. A team effort (Army, DOD, interagency) is often required to solve long-term or technical
problems. The work requires the ability to interpret patterns in complex situations as well as the ability to synthesize
and analyze both concrete and abstract activities and intentions. An understanding of tactical skills and concepts
applied to both friendly and enemy capabilities is critical for success. FA 34 officers could have a moderate to long
time to conduct analysis and make good decisions resulting from in-depth knowledge, analysis, and study; however,
they could also be required to react rapidly in providing intelligence to support a crisis action situation.
27–2. Officer characteristics required
a. Possess highly specialized knowledge pertaining to one or all phases of the intelligence cycle; intelligence law
and management; Joint and Army intelligence and communications architectures; Army, Joint and national intelligence
systems; information security principles; national agency functions; and aspects of intelligence planning which have
been gained through attendance at specialized academic training or over a significant period of time.
b. Understand the organization, structure, and doctrine of the warfighting Army.
c. Understand the organization, structure, and doctrine of the Joint force. Know how to integrate Army and Joint
intelligence and systems.
d. Understand domestic political context in which the Army seeks to fulfill its Title 10 responsibilities and the DOD
seeks to provide for national security.
e. Understand issues related to the international geopolitical arena and their implications for developing the national
security policy and the national military strategy.
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

251

f. Understand the organization of the Army, its Title 10 responsibilities and the missions, roles and functions of its
ACOMs, ASCCs, and DRUs.
g. Understand the organization of the DOD and the national intelligence community; the defense intelligence
programs; developing the national military strategy; and the missions, roles, and functions of its warfighting commands
and various agencies.
27–3. Officer developmental assignments
a. General. FA 34 officers are not considered for FA 34 assignment until they have completed the required FA 34
training. Upon selection for FA 34, officers will be scheduled for training at the earliest possible time.
b. FA development. All FA 34 positions are considered key and essential to professional development. There are no
specific FA 34 assignments to qualify an officer as a Strategic Intelligence officer, rather in addition to the required
training, a good mix of Strategic Intelligence positions at different echelons and manner of performance will demonstrate the officer’s ability to perform at the next rank. All FA 34 officers should pursue Joint qualification (SI 3A) as a
professional development goal. Strategic Intelligence officers will be considered developed at each grade based on their
manner of performance in their assigned FA 34 positions and appropriate schooling detailed as follows:
(1) Major. Officers selected for FA 34 will receive the necessary training and will be either captains or promotable
captains when they arrive at their first FA 34 assignment. Additional specialized training may be needed for specific
assignments. FA 34 training and assignment requirements are—
(a) Successful completion of the FA 34 Strategic Intelligence Officer Course (SIOC) conducted at the U.S. Army
Intelligence Center, Fort Huachuca, AZ (required for non-MI Branch officers only).
(b) Successful completion of the Post Graduate Intelligence Program (PGIP), or equivalent, with a Master of
Science in Strategic Intelligence (MSSI), conducted by the Joint Military Intelligence College, Bolling Air Force Base
(AFB), Washington, DC.
(c) Attend the ILE common core (ISC and JPME 1 qualification).
(d) Will optimally serve at least 24 months in any FA 34 coded position.
(e) Successful completion of JPME II is desirable (see para 3–13d).
(2) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Will optimally serve at least 36 months in any FA 34 coded lieutenant colonel or colonel position.
(b) Successful completion of JPME II is desirable (see para 3–13d).
(3) Colonel.
(a) Will optimally serve at least 24 months in any FA 34 coded colonel position.
(b) Successful completion of SSC (resident or nonresident).
(c) Successful completion of JPME II (see para 3–13d).
c. Joint assignments. The vast majority of FA 34 positions are Joint. Many of these Joint positions are on the JDAL.
Officers assigned to JDAL positions may attend the JPME II course and could qualify for Joint specialty officer (JSO)
designation (SI 3L).
27–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. The goal of professional development of FA 34 officers is to provide the intelligence community with an officer
who is technically competent in many aspects of strategic intelligence. Therefore, FA 34 assignments are aimed at
increasing the officer’s specialization in one or several fields. These assignments coupled with selected additional
schooling will provide the Army world-class Strategic Intelligence officers.
b. The preferred assignment pattern is to assign officers to an FA 34 position after they have completed the FA 34
training; however, Army requirements may dictate an officer’s assignment prior to completing training.
27–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Key Strategic Intelligence FA positions. Ideally, FA 34 officers should serve at least 36 months in each FA 34
assignment, however, the FA 34 officer may be assigned to different positions during a tour to give him/her better all
around strategic intelligence experience and expertise. Given the density of assignments in the National Capital Region,
officers could serve back-to-back tours there. OCONUS locations will continue to require specific tour lengths.
Examples of FA 34 positions are—
(1) Strategic Intelligence officer.
(2) Intelligence staff officer.
(3) Deputy director for intelligence.
(4) Watch officer.
(5) Warning officer.
(6) Intelligence plans officer.
b. Strategic Intelligence FA life cycle. Figure 27–1, below, depicts the FA 34 career life cycle with key positions.

252

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Figure 27–1. FA 34 Active Army Developmental Model

27–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for FA 34 officers. To do this, the field grade
inventory must be optimized in order to fulfill FA requirements and provide junior FA 34 officers sufficient time for
FA training and experience prior to promotion.
b. OPMS implementation. The number of FA 34 authorizations, by grade, will fluctuate as force structure decisions
are made. Officers desiring information on current FA 34 authorizations and inventory should contact the FA 34
proponency office or the AHRC OPMD FA 34 assignments officer.
27–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Strategic Intelligence
a. Structure. FA 34 derives its structure from former Military Intelligence billets at echelons above corps, with a
large majority of the positions at Joint commands and national agencies. The Chief of the Military Intelligence Corps is
the proponent for FA 34 and guides its development.
b. Acquire. Officers who have completed or are attending the PGIP and/or the Strategic Intelligence Officer Course
(SIOC) will be likely candidates for functional designation to FA 34. Additionally, officers with a background in
geography, political science, government and social studies should also be considered likely candidates. Officers must
possess the demonstrated aptitude to obtain an advanced degree, therefore they must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 or a
GRE of 500/500/4.0. All FA 34 personnel must qualify for a top-secret security clearance based on a single scope
background investigation (SSBI) and for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI). Some FA 34 officers
may be selected for special training later in their careers based on the needs of their specific positions.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

253

c. Distribute. The MI Branch, Operations Support Division in Human Resources Command, OPMD will manage all
FA 34 assignments. All FA 34 positions are at echelons above corps. Many FA 34 positions are included on the JDAL,
and many others are on headquarters staffs or within defense agencies. Consequently, many FA 34 positions are high
priority either by law or by policy, have prescribed tour lengths, and will receive personnel replacements when
required.
d. Deploy. FA 34 officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at
all times. Whether assigned to deployable TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA organizations, all
FA 34 officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. FA 34 officers may
deploy tomorrow with their units/commands to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests or as
individuals to support Joint and multinational operations. FA 34 officers must prepare themselves and their Families for
this most challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustain. FA 34 officers will compete for promotions within the operations support functional category. Promotion
numbers and percentages will be consistent with both FA 34 requirements and other branches and FAs within the
operations support functional category.
f. Develop.
(1) All non-MI officers designated into FA 34 will complete the SIOC at the U.S. Army Intelligence Center and
Fort Huachuca, Fort Huachuca, Arizona. All FA 34 officers will attend the PGIP, conducted by the Joint Military
Intelligence College, Bolling Air Force Base, Washington, DC and be awarded the MSSI. FA 34 officers will receive
additional training qualifying them for ILE and JPME 1. Some FA 34 officers will receive further specialized training
and professional development opportunities, depending on the specific requirements of their duty position. Many FA 34
officers serving in Joint positions will attend JPME II training and could subsequently qualify for JSO designation.
(2) FA 34 majors will attend the 14 week common core course at a CL site. At a CL site, officers are intermediate
staff college (ISC) graduates. Full ILE credit is awarded when the officer has completed the common core and the
PGIP and is than credentialed JPME I qualified. Full ILE credit should be completed prior to promotion to lieutenant
colonel. RC officers can attend the Army Schools System (TASS) classrooms located in CONUS and OCONUS CL
sites.
27–8. Strategic Intelligence Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. The FA 34 officer is a world class strategic intelligence specialist. The majority of
the FA 34 positions are found in TDA echelons above corps units. FA 34 officer duties and responsibilities are
fundamentally the same for the Active and RCs. The RC Strategic Intelligence officer serves the same role and
missions as his or her counterpart. The unique nature of the RC Soldier’s role as a citizen Soldier poses a significant
challenge in the combat support mission of FA 34. A RC officer is expected to follow Active Army officer
development patterns as closely as possible, except in some cases where an RC officer has increased windows to
complete mandatory education requirements. For more guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7.
b. FA qualification and development. RC development and qualification will be equivalent to the Active Army. RC
officers (non-MI) must successfully complete the SIOC and the PGIP for award of FA 34 and assignment to FA 34
coded positions.
c. FA 34 RC assignments. There are three phases of professional development for RC FA 34 officers. The following
phases relate to military rank and depict broadly based goals and career opportunities at each rank so that an officer
may expand capabilities and optimize performance. FA 34 life cycle development objectives, RC requirements, and an
officer’s own strengths, priorities, and performance influence his or her professional development. FA professional
development standards by grade are as follows:
(1) Major.
(a) For award of FA 34, officers must successfully complete the PGIP and the MSSI conducted at the Joint Military
Intelligence College at Bolling AFB. Non-MI officers must attend the SIOC prior to PGIP.
(b) They must successfully complete at least 50 percent of the ILE common core or its equivalent.
(c) They must complete a tour in any FA 34 coded position.
(2) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) They must successfully complete ILE common core or its equivalent within 3 years after promotion to lieutenant
colonel.
(b) They must complete a tour in a lieutenant colonel or higher FA 34 coded position.
(3) Colonel. FA 34 colonels serve in both FA 34 and selected MI (35D) positions.
d. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for FA 34 officers is shown at figure 27–2,
below.

Chapter 28
Foreign Area Officer Functional Area
28–1. Unique features of Foreign Area Officer functional area
a. Unique purpose of the Foreign Area officer FA. Foreign Area Officers (FAOs) are commissioned officers
deliberately accessed, trained, educated, and developed to meet worldwide Army requirements for officers possessing a
unique combination of strategic focus, regional expertise, foreign language proficiency, and professional military skills
and experience. FAOs can best be described as the Army’s Soldier-statesmen. FA 48 provides the Army with—
(1) Expert military knowledge of a designated region combined with a cultural and political understanding, enabling
leaders to increase success and reduce risk across the full spectrum of operations from stability operations to major
combat.
(2) The capability to foster understanding and interface with foreign militaries and governments at all levels.
Enhanced capability to operate decisively, and often independently, in uncertain environments.
(3) A cadre able to function across the Army and the JIIM), within combatant commands, with foreign armies and
armed forces, with foreign governments, with non-Governmental organizations (NGOs), and with non-state representatives of indigenous populations.
(4) Officers capable of effectively representing the Secretary of Defense, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Secretary of the Army, CSA, combatant commanders, ASCCs, and the United States in foreign settings.

(5) Senior officers with a broad understanding of the global security environment able to apply their skills in any
region and at the highest levels of the Army, the DOD, and other USG agencies.
b. Unique functions performed by the FAOs. Work within the FAO FA requires the application of learned skills and
specialized knowledge in critical positions worldwide. FAOs are often the sole Army and/or DOD representatives in
foreign countries, executing national security policies, or serving as key advisors to senior level commanders and chiefs
of mission. They—
(1) Serve at embassies worldwide as Defense and Army attachés.
(2) Serve in critical positions, both CONUS and OCONUS, as security assistance officers.
(3) Provide critical advice to senior commanders while serving as political-military advisers in corps HQs and
ASCCs; political-military officers in combatant commands (COCOMs), ACOMs, and Joint staffs; as well as to senior
civilian leaders within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Defense Agencies, the State Department, and the White
House.
(4) Serve around the world as arms control specialists.
(5) Represent DOD and Army interests and policies as liaison officers to foreign armies and armed forces.
(6) Serve as Planners on the Joint staff, in Defense agencies, combatant commands, corps HQ, the ASCCs, and on
the Army Staff.
(7) Serve as analysts at Defense Agencies and on Joint staffs.
(8) Train the leaders of the future while serving as instructors at the USMA, CGSC, NDU, AWC, and other U.S.
and international military schools.
c. Unique features of work in the FAO FA.
(1) FAOs serve worldwide in critical and sensitive positions requiring extensive regional expertise and experience.
The FAO FA provides the Army with a cadre of officers with in-depth experience and knowledge in political-military
affairs focused on specific regions of the world.
(2) FAOs provide specialized expertise concerning political-military considerations in support of senior Army, Joint
force, and national decisionmakers. The FAO’s role combines professional military knowledge, regional and politicalmilitary expertise, and language competency.
(3) FAOs use their regional expertise and cultural awareness to advance United States interests in their regional
areas of concentration. A FAO’s knowledge and skills amplify and build on the foundation of professional military
knowledge, experience, and values that an officer gains through basic soldiering. The FAO program provides officers
with opportunities to develop skills required for conducting and analyzing the interrelation between military activities
and economic, social, cultural, or political realities within a region or country.
(4) FAOs are trained as regional experts in one of the following nine AOCs. In some cases, officers trained in one
AOC may be assigned to work in another, based on their language, experience, and/or the needs of the Army.
(a) Latin America (AOC 48B). Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama,
Venezuela, Colombia, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Guyana, French Guiana,
Suriname, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Cuba, and the Caribbean.
(b) Europe (AOC 48C). United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Norway, Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark,
Luxembourg, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Slovak
Republic, Poland, Albania, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro (including Kosovo), Macedonia,
Finland, Romania, Greece, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, Andorra, San Marino, Liechtenstein, Slovenia, Cyprus,
Turkey, and Iceland.
(c) South Asia (AOC 48D). India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan Burma, and the
Maldives.
(d) Eurasia (AOC 48E). Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.
(e) China (AOC 48F). China, Taiwan, and Mongolia.
(f) Middle East/North Africa (AOC 48G). Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Sudan, Syria, Jordan, Israel,
Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Yemen, Qatar, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates.
(g) Northeast Asia (AOC 48H). Japan, North Korea, and South Korea.
(h) Southeast Asia (AOC 48I). Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Brunei,
Singapore, Papua New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand, East Timor, and Oceania (Tonga, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall
Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, French Polynesia,
Tuvalu, and Western Samoa).
(i) Sub-Saharan Africa (AOC 48J). Republic of Congo, Malawi, Botswana, Ivory Coast, Somalia, Namibia, Niger,
South Africa, Mauritania, Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe,
Cameroon, Nigeria, Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Burundi, Mali, Rwanda,
Angola, Swaziland, Lesotho, Mozambique, Central African Republic, Gabon, Madagascar, Equatorial Guinea, Togo,
Sao Tome and Principe, Seychelles, The Gambia, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Comoros, Mauritius, and Djibouti.
d. Unique relationships. The Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&R)) is the proponent

256

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

for FAO programs at DOD. DOD Directive 1315.17, dated 28 April 2005, directs all Services to establish FAO
programs and sets minimal standards to which FAOs are trained, managed, and utilized. While the Army’s FAO
program is established to support the needs of the Army, it must be recognized that currently most FAO positions
worldwide exist in organizations other than the Army. The Defense Language Office (DLO), specifically, established
policy on FAO programs for the USD (P&R) while recognizing that the FAO programs belong to the Services and that
each must maintain its Service ethos.
28–2. Officer characteristics required
a. The FAO FA requires officers who are multi-skilled leaders. These leaders should possess a solid grounding in
Army doctrine and branch tactics, techniques, and procedures. They embody strong Army Values, leader and warrior
attributes, and fully understand the key leadership actions that must be taken to assure mission success. FAOs are
expected to remain well-rounded in Army skills while operating for extended periods of time outside of Army
organizations.
b. FAOs possess the following unique skills:
(1) Language proficiency at an Interagency Language Roundtable level 3 Listening/3 Reading, and have a goal of
attaining a 3 Speaking, per DOD Directive 1315.17.
(2) Regional Expertise at a level 3 (professional), 4 (advanced professional), or 5 (expert), per Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs Instruction 3126.01.
(3) Advanced degrees with a regional focus.
(4) Exceptional English verbal and written communication skills.
(5) Ability to operate across the JIIM environment.
c. FAOs possess the following unique knowledge:
(1) In-depth understanding of culture gained from experience living, traveling, and working in a region.
(2) Expert knowledge of regional military forces.
(3) Well-versed in U.S. foreign policy and regional security cooperation initiatives.
(4) Politico-military, economic, and social issues relevant to their regional AOC.
d. FAOs typically conduct and analyze military activities that have an economic, social, cultural, and political
impact. FAOs combine regional expertise, language competency, politico-military awareness and professional military
skills to advance U.S. interests. FA 48 officers are able to apply learned skills and specialized knowledge in critical
positions worldwide, and are able to operate in foreign settings and cultures, often as the sole Army, DOD, or USG
representative.
28–3. Officer developmental assignments
a. FA qualification and development. The life cycle of the FA 48 FA is based on the three domains of leader
development; institutional training, operational assignments and self-development. These three leader development
concepts focus and shape FAO management in terms of accession, training, utilization and professional development.
FAO careers begin with a lengthy, five-phased education and training period that includes the FAO Orientation Course
(FAOOC), basic language training, in-country training (ICT), ACS, and ILE. These phases may occur in any order,
though FAO proponent prefers that language training come before ICT and ACS. Only the Chief of the FAO proponent
may waive completion of any phase except ILE. The Army makes a considerable investment in training FAOs. It will
take an officer 3 to 4 1⁄2 years to complete FAO training. Once trained, the officer gains experience through multiple
and varied FAO assignments, both in region and in CONUS. Paragraph 28–4, below, provides more detail on this
topic. Lastly, FAO skills, once obtained, must be continually maintained and improved throughout the FAO’s career.
Self-study and attendance at sustainment and refresher courses/conferences for both language and regional expertise are
vital to keeping FAOs current in their region of expertise and broadening their knowledge to gain a global perspective.
b. Training requirements. All FAOs must complete the following unless granted a waiver or constructive credit by
the FAO proponent (ILE is non-waiverable by the FAO proponent). Officers selected for FAO training who do not
satisfactorily complete or receive constructive credit for the FAOOC, language training, ICT and/or ACS, may be
returned to their basic branch or redesignated into another FA.
(1) Language training. FAOs are provided with basic language training in at least one of the predominant languages
in their assigned AOC. The language assigned in training and subsequent ICT site will be designated by the FAO
proponent based on National Security Strategy, the unique abilities of the accessed FAO, and the needs of the Army.
This training will be conducted at the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center (DLIFLC) or the Defense
Language Institute Washington (DLI–W). The duration of these courses range between 6 and 18 months, depending
upon the level of difficulty of the targeted language. The FAO must achieve minimum language proficiency during this
entry-level training in order to continue in the program. Minimum language proficiency at the end of basic language
training for FAOs will be 2/2/1+.
(2) ACS. A fully-funded graduate education is a privilege made available only to officers with demonstrated
potential for continued Service. ACS may be denied or deferred if an officer cannot meet requirements of AR 621–1
(or gain a waiver from those requirements), or if an officer is deemed to have limited potential.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

257

(a) FAOs attend graduate schools approved by the FAO proponent as published in the annual list of approved
graduate degree programs. Requests to attend graduate programs not on the approved list must be submitted to the
FAO proponent with appropriate supporting documentation well in advance of the ACS application process. It is the
prospective FAO student’s responsibility to demonstrate that the program is accredited and will provide at least 60
percent of its required credits in the appropriate regional focus. Exceptions to this standard must be approved by the
Chief of the Proponent.
(b) To ensure a robust and high quality graduate education base for the FAO corps, proponent supports the goal that
at least one third of Army FAOs will attend medium cost graduate programs while the remainder attends low cost
institutions. In some years this is not feasible due to Armywide resource limitations. If an officer can demonstrate that
the institution to which he/she aspires will meet medium or low cost thresholds, the chief of the FAO proponent may
grant an exception to policy. Often, this means that the institution has agreed in writing to offset the cost of tuition to
the lower threshold by way of a scholarship or other agreement.
(c) Those officers entering the FAO program who have already completed a graduate degree in a FAO-related
discipline may apply for constructive credit from the chief of the FAO proponent, and if approved, will not attend
further graduate schooling at Army expense as part of the formal FAO training process.
(d) FAOs attending graduate schooling via the Army’s ACS program will obtain a master’s degree in an appropriate
FAO-related discipline with a strong regional focus. Appropriate FAO-related disciplines include: international relations/affairs, area studies, international economics, international security studies, geography, geopolitics, government,
regional history, Master of Military Arts and Science (MMAS) (with a FAO related concentration), national security
studies, political science, social science, and strategic intelligence (from the Joint Military Intelligence College
(JMIC)). Any exceptions to this list of disciplines must be coordinated with the FAO proponent prior to declaration at
the ACS location.
(e) FAOs in ACS are required to maintain or improve their language skills. The officers must meet the language
requirement for degree completion for their institution. If there is no language requirement for degree completion, the
officer must maintain language proficiency through elective course work or independent study with a member of the
faculty. Language training will be conducted at no cost to the Army.
(f) FAOs in ACS are required to maintain contact with their respective regional managers in the FAO proponent
throughout their attendance at the institution. Regional managers will review curricula prior to every quarter or
semester to ensure that these instructions are followed. FAOs will provide copies of all grade reports, receipts, and so
on per established procedures.
(3) ICT.
(a) ICT is designed to immerse the officer in the local language and culture through attendance at a host nation
PME course and living on the economy where possible. It is designed to also provide advanced language studies and
develop in-depth knowledge of the region through a program of travel, research, and study. FAOs are expected to
conduct extensive familiarization travel throughout the region and attain first-hand knowledge of national and regional
cultures, geography, political-military environments, economies, and societal differences. In many cases, ICT includes
FAO attendance at a foreign military or civilian course of instruction. Officers who attend foreign military schools are
recognized as performing an Army mission as well as training for future assignments. Relationships developed during
ICT at a foreign military school or via other contact with host nation military professionals are frequently maintained
for years and enhance capability and effectiveness in future assignments. The duration of ICT varies, but is generally
no longer than one year. During ICT, a FAO must continue to improve language capability with the goal of attaining
general professional level (level 3) proficiency.
(b) Eurasia FAOs (48E) attend either a traditional one-year ICT or a 12 or 18-month course of instruction at the
George C. Marshall Center for Security Studies in Garmisch, Germany, focusing on advanced language skills, in-depth
military representative assignments and representing the U.S. in the international security studies courses held at the
Center. FAO internships in the 48E region are key elements of the curriculum of the Marshall Center. During these
internships, officers will have the opportunity to work and travel throughout Eurasia while serving in operational
military representative positions.
(4) Foreign Area Officer Orientation Course (FAOOC). The FAOOC is a mandatory, one-week course designed to
provide new FAOs-in-training with an introduction to the FAO FA. Topics generally include FAO roles and responsibilities, subsequent FAO developmental phases, Family issues, the JIIM–E environment, the FAO life cycle, personal
security, and an orientation to each regional AOC. This course also affords an opportunity for FAOs to establish their
personal training path, develop working relationships with their proponent managers and assignment officers, and
understand the varied roles played by FAOs around the world. The FAOOC is conducted semi-annually at the
DLIFLC. It is the FAO proponent’s responsibility to organize and conduct a similar, local FAOOC for officers
conducting their language studies in the Washington, DC area. Because FAOs often serve in remote locations and
Families are placed in very difficult cultural situations, spouses are encouraged to attend the FAOOC to better
understand the lifestyle/career choice into which the FAO is entering. Spouse attendance is not mandatory.
c. MEL–4 PME. FAOs will have several options to choose from to attain MEL–4 or their ILE. A FAO may be able
to attend the 10-month Advanced Operations Warfighting Course (AOWC) at Fort Leavenworth once this initiative is

258

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

approved. Select Latin American FAOs (48B) may have the opportunity to attend the WHINSEC. The above two
options would follow completion of basic language, in-country training and advanced civil schooling. These courses
will reorient the FAO to Army operations after being away for an extended period of time and prepare the FAO for
potential Service at a numbered Army while completing JPME I. FAOs should identify their preference for this course
at the beginning of their training tours. Other FAOs not selected to attend AOWC or WHINSEC could attend a 14week ILE common core course conducted at any of the approved ILE course locations. The course is designed to
provide the officer a JPME I education. A FAO can attend ILE at any point in the training cycle after completion of
basic language training. Schools of other nations (SON) programs, as outlined in AR 350–1, may provide additional
training; however, current policy requires that all officers still must attend ILE common core prior to the SON.
28–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. The new security environment requires a different type of leader, the multi-skilled leader, and an Army that is
culturally aware, language enhanced, and regionally knowledgeable. FAO is transforming to better support the Army’s
mission and the changed security environment. FAO majors and lieutenant colonels focus mainly on their technical
competencies through breadth and depth of FAO assignments. These skills are refined as the officer moves into the
senior leader level at the rank of colonel. Sequencing of the type and location of assignments is not critical. FAOs
should avoid “homesteading,” and alternate between overseas and CONUS tours as much as possible. Repetitive
assignments to any one type of work or in any one location typically reduce an officer’s utility as a FAO. Therefore, a
FAO should ideally complete at least one assignment from three of the following four categories before promotion to
colonel:
(1) Overseas U.S. country team. Assignments include Defense attaché, Army attaché, assistant Army attaché, and
security cooperation positions in a Security Assistance Office, Office of Defense Cooperation, or military group.
(2) Army operational. Assignments include positions at the ASCC, corps, and Army Staff.
(3) Political-military. Assignments include OSD Staff, Joint staff, National Security Council, Department of State,
Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DIA, and combatant commands.
(4) Institutional. Assignments include AHRC, Defense Language Institute, USMA, TRADOC, Fort Leavenworth,
Carlisle Barracks, and WHINSEC.
b. FAO assignments Branch at AHRC will primarily consider skills and experience, and, most importantly, the
needs of the Army when assigning officers. FAO Assignments will also consider timing, geographic rotation, job
rotation, language, strength of performance file, officer’s preference, and special considerations (exceptional Family
members, retirement, and so on).
c. FAO assignments will be made with the goal of developing the officer’s professional competence while meeting
the Army’s officer personnel requirements. Requests from officers for assignments that do not contribute to achieving
these goals will not be formally considered.
d. Positions outside of FA 48 will be rare, but may be available as a means of developing multi-functional FA 48
officers via an AHRC initiative titled “position sharing.” AHRC position sharing opportunities will be limited to 10–15
percent of all FAs billets and are opened when a particular branch cannot fill its own requirements. These positions are
open to officers with similar skill and experiences from basic branches or FAs. Officers should not anticipate receiving
additional training to prepare them for these assignments.
28–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
Most assignments for FAOs will be 24 to 36 months in length. OCONUS locations will continue to require specific
tour lengths. Officers desiring to become FAOs must recognize that a large portion of FA 48 positions are located
OCONUS.
a. Key FAO FA qualification positions. Completion of training as listed in paragraph 28–3, current language
proficiency, and successful completion of, or assignment in, a FA 48 tour for at least 12 months are the prerequisites
for FA qualification at each grade.
b. FAO FA life cycle. Figure 28–1, below, depicts a FA 48 life cycle. Additionally, it identifies development
assignments within the FA.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

259

Figure 28–1. FAO Active Army Developmental Model

28–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for FAOs. To do this, the field grade inventory must
be optimized in order to fulfill FA and generalist requirements and to provide field grade officers sufficient time for
FA qualification prior to promotion to the next grade.
b. OPMS implementation. The number of FAO authorizations, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions are
made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more information on current authorizations or
inventory should contact either the FA 48 proponent at DAMO–SSF, G–35 or the FA 48 assignment officers at AHRC
OPMD.
28–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Foreign Area Officer
a. Structure. FAOs serve at all echelons worldwide. FAO positions exist in ASCC, Joint commands, national
agencies, and the institutional army. The Active Army life cycle development model for FAOs is shown at figure 28–1,
above. It depicts FA qualification requirements and key developmental assignments.
b. Acquire. Officers are accessed into the FAO program as part of their cohort year group’s (YG) 7-year FDB. FAO
proponent establishes the minimum criteria the DA-level FDB will use in selecting officers for FA 48. Minimum
criteria for FA48 are—
(1) Demonstrated aptitude for learning foreign languages by attaining an acceptable score on the Defense Language
Aptitude Battery (DLAB). The minimum DLAB score for designation as a FAO is 95. The minimum scores for
officers designated to study in different categories (CAT) of language are as follows: CAT I languages - 95, CAT II

260

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

languages - 100, CAT III languages - 105, and CAT IV languages - 110. These requirements may be waived by the
FAO proponent for those officers who have a current (less than one year old) Defense Language Proficiency Test
(DLPT) score of 2/2 or higher.
(2) FAOs are required to obtain an advanced degree, and must be able to meet ACS eligibility requirements
prescribed in AR 621–1.
(3) Officers must have a time in Service (TIS) of less than 17 years AFCS by the start of ACS in accordance with
AR 621–1.
(4) No officer is selected for FAO training without having first successfully completed company grade leader
development and having obtained quality experience in basic branch assignments.
(5) All officers must be eligible for a Top Secret security clearance based upon an SBI under AR 380–67.
(6) If the officer’s spouse and other dependent Family members are not U.S. citizens, they must begin the
naturalization process when the officer begins the FAO accessions process.
(7) The officer’s spouse and other dependent Family members must be free of serious or chronic medical problems
that would preclude worldwide assignment. If a Family member is enrolled in the Exceptional Family Member
Program (EFMP) with a condition that prevents them from living overseas, the officer must be prepared to serve
repetitive unaccompanied overseas tours.
(8) Given the nature of FAO assignments, Joint domicile needs can be extremely difficult to accommodate. Officers
with military spouses should carefully consider the potential personal costs in terms of Family hardship prior to
choosing a FAO career.
c. Distribute. FAO assignments, operations support functional category division at AHRC OPMD manages FAO
assignments. Distribution of FAO-coded billets throughout the Army, the Joint force, and the interagency is the
responsibility of FAO proponent.
d. Deploy. FAOs are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all
times to support combatant commanders and in support of other requirements. All FAOs must be deployable to
accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. FAOs may deploy with their units or as individuals as the
mission demands. FAOs must prepare themselves and their Families for this reality.
e. Sustain. Officers designated into the operations support functional category will compete within their functional
category for promotion to lieutenant colonel and colonel.
f. Develop. Throughout their FAO career, officers will have the opportunity for training and further professional
development. This starts with a FAO’s initial training, followed by continued development through assignments and
required courses, and lastly by the officer’s self-development efforts.
(1) Initial training. All FAOs will generally conduct the five phases of training as addressed above.
(2) Continued development. Officers may receive further education through training required for positions they may
fill. Some examples include language training, JPME II, Defense Institute for Security Assistance Management
(DISAM), Individual Terrorism Awareness Course (INTAC), and so on. In addition, officers will be assigned to
positions that will further their professional development.
(3) Self-development. All FAOs will carry the burden of self-development as they serve in positions of increased
responsibility. This includes the fact that a FAO is expected to remain a resident expert in subjects regarding U.S.
Army, JIIM topics of relevance.
g. Separate. FAOs will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
28–8. Foreign Area Officer Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. RC FAO development objectives and qualifications essentially parallel those of the
Active Army. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation through assignments in their basic branches before
specializing in the FA. For specific information about the process and pre-requisites for designation as a RC FAO, refer
to AR 135–11.
b. FA qualification and developmental opportunities. Even though RC officers are limited by geographical considerations, they should strive for FA 48 assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as their Active Army
counterparts.
c. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for FAOs is shown at figure 28–2, below. It
depicts FA qualification requirements and KD assignments.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

261

Figure 28–2. FAO RC Developmental Model

28–9. Future Foreign Area Officer initiatives
a. FAO proponent is committed to continuing the development of current and future generations of multi-skilled
leaders and Army statesmen. FAOs are strategic thinkers and multi-skilled leaders working at the most senior levels of
the Army, Joint, and DOD positions.
b. Current and future FAOs will continue to serve the nation with their unique skills. Extensive regional expertise
gained from Army units, on the ground experience, and advanced academic achievement forms a foundation for
success. Senior leaders must master a broad understanding of the global environment and apply their skills at the
highest levels of the Army and the DOD.
c. Future FAOs will develop key multi-skilled attributes through increased “Greening” opportunities at the International Military Affairs Division in ASCCs. These new organizations will allow our colonel and lieutenant colonel
multi-skilled leaders to provide regional expertise at division and corps headquarters. majors will have the opportunity
to support BCT commanders and ground operations. These critical jobs will better support our ongoing operations,
enhance FAO skills, and help prepare these officers for future high-level positions of increased responsibility.
d. The need to conduct operations across non-traditional boundaries is a reality that the current and future Army
must face. To prepare for these challenges, FAOs will increasingly participate in JIIM assignments, exposure, and
experiences. JIIM opportunities will broaden the FAO experience and further develop senior multi-skilled leaders for
high-level positions of increased responsibility.
e. The above initiatives will ensure that FAOs remain critical assets which support success on the battlefield and

262

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

provide high quality advice to the nation’s senior leadership. These initiatives support the Chief of Staff’s broad-based
multi-skilled leader development objectives and prepare FAOs for challenging assignments throughout their careers.
FAO proponent envisions coding several critical O–6 positions as key billets in the near future. These positions will
require colonels who possess exceptional qualities and who have clearly excelled throughout their careers. Colonels
will compete for these positions through a CSL. Key billets will be designed to indicate that officers selected for these
billets are fully qualified to serve in positions of increased responsibility and provide a metric by which the Army can
measure potential performance at grades above colonel.

Chapter 29
Strategic Plans and Policy Functional Area 59
29–1. Purpose
a. Unique purpose of the Strategic Plans and Policy FA. FA 59 officers provide combatant commands, Army
organizations, the Joint staff, and other Government agencies (OGA) with strategists who specialize in the development, translation, and implementation of national strategic plans and policies. FA 59 officers conduct strategic
assessment, campaign planning, Joint/interagency integration, and strategic education. They leverage extensive training
and experience to integrate economic, political, and social considerations into planning and execution. They also
provide continuity and long-term perspective to facilitate effective decisionmaking for senior leaders.
b. Unique functions performed by the Strategic Plans and Policy FA. FA 59 officers execute critical institutional and
operational assessment and planning vital to the formulation and implementation of effective strategy, concepts, and
policies. Key functions performed by FA 59 officers include—
(1) Conducting strategic appraisals of complex problems.
(2) Development of operational and institutional campaign plans, with emphasis in later stages of a career on the
formulation of national security policies and strategies in support of senior military and civilian decisionmakers.
(3) Integrate inter-Service and interagency capabilities and contributions to exploit interdisciplinary approaches.
(4) Teaching and curriculum development to support education in military theory, the strategic arts, and national
security strategies and policies.
c. Unique features of work in the Strategic Plans and Policy FA.
(1) Scope of work. Army strategists develop and execute policies and plans that enable U.S. military forces to fight
and win wars. To effectively accomplish this, they must work across the full spectrum of military operations and in
multiple professional disciplines as advisors, integrators, planners, and policy developers. FA 59 officers ensure that
Army capabilities are fully integrated with other military services and government agencies to enable effective
decisionmaking for commanders and civilian leaders. Strategists strive to maximize the effectiveness of military power
in conjunction with other instruments of national power. Therefore, officers in FA 59 specialize in the development and
implementation of national level strategic plans and policies, theater strategy and planning, and concepts for deploying
and employing military forces at the strategic, operational and tactical (this recognizes that tactical actions and
outcomes have strategic implications) levels of warfare. In addition, FA 59 officers are experts regarding the political
implications of military actions. They possess a deep understanding of how national defense issues can influence both
domestic politics and the international security environment.
(2) Typical assignments. Strategists serve primarily at the ACOM level and above. However, many newly accessed
FA 59 majors will serve in assignments at division and corps. Mid-career and senior strategists serve on the Joint staff,
OSD, Regional Combatant Commander Staffs, multinational staffs, and various staffs and interagency working groups
in the Government, where they support the formulation and implementation of national security strategy and national
military strategy. Officers in FA 59 also support development of future concepts and doctrine for employing military
forces at both the operational and strategic levels of warfare. FA 59 officers may also serve as instructors across the
Army, Joint, and interagency communities.
(3) Duties and responsibilities. FA 59 officers diagnose complex problems, develop initial and ongoing strategic
assessments, shape and develop commander’s intent, and author plans and strategies at operational and strategic levels
of command. They regularly work within fluid environments of high volatility and uncertainty, immature organizational responsibilities, and incomplete senior leader guidance. Under such conditions they are expected to coherently
communicate and articulate alternative points of view that may run counter to prevailing beliefs or conventional
wisdom FA 59 officers provide decisionmakers with additional and credible options to enhance chances of success. To
achieve credibility in this environment, FA 59 officers must develop themselves in three broad areas. First, they should
be grounded in the Soldier arts at the tactical unit level to give them a solid foundation of military experience. Second,
they should pursue advanced civilian education (MA, Ph.D.) to sharpen their literary and analytic skills and broaden
their scope of knowledge Third, strategists are expected to progressively serve in organizations and agencies that will
advance their experience and proficiency in the strategic arts within the JIIM environment. Developing skills within
these three broad areas will give FA 59 officers the skills and credibility to effectively organize and conduct planning
and coordination within and between Army and Joint commands and headquarters, U.S. government agencies, nonDA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

263

Governmental agencies, other national governments, and academic institutions. Much of the work performed by the FA
59 officer requires a broad outlook and strategic vision: the ability to think several steps beyond short-term or
immediate results. Therefore, when diagnosing complex problems that require strategic re-evaluation, the duty of the
Army strategist is to evaluate the utility of short-term goals of one particular command in relation to longer and more
lasting objectives of other commands and the broader national effort in order to achieve both operational victory and
strategic triumph.
29–2. Officer characteristics required
a. Competencies and actions common to all. As framed by the 2005 Secretary of the Army (SA) and Chief of Staff
(CSA) vision, all Army officers should develop as multi-skilled leaders with capabilities that may have only previously
existed outside of their current branch and FA designation. FA 59 officers demonstrate mastery of the attributes and
leader competencies common to all Army officers.
b. Unique skills. With these skills, FA 59 officers have the capability to—
(1) Operate effectively in high-pressure senior-level staff assignments where guidance may be minimal and close
interaction with senior-level decisionmakers is frequent.
(2) Communicate clearly, concisely, accurately, and persuasively (both orally and in writing) highly technical,
complex, or conceptual subjects to support senior leader strategic decisionmaking.
(3) Apply analytically rigorous methods to develop feasible, suitable, acceptable, and innovative solutions to
complicated strategic challenges across the spectrum of conflict.
(4) Establish and sustain an effective collaborative network of personal contacts within large military staff organizations and with other Governmental departments and agencies and NGOs.
(5) Lead staff/working groups consisting of U.S. and coalition partners, DOD civilians, other interagency government employees, and civilian NGOs.
c. Unique knowledge. Strategic Plans and Policy officers require specialized knowledge in strategic matters that
include the following:
(1) Dynamics of organization, structure, doctrine, and the operating environment of the institutional and operational
Army and that of the other Services, to include the geographic combatant commands and the Joint staff.
(2) Inter-disciplinary problem solving and assessment techniques that complement senior leader decisionmaking and
appraisal.
(3) Understand how the Army’s capabilities can be integrated with other services and government agencies to enable
the prosecution of effective Joint, combined arms, and interagency operations by use of Joint and inter-Governmental
planning, resourcing and war fighting systems at the strategic, theater strategic, and operational levels of war.
(4) Understand the domestic political and constitutional context in which DOD provides for national security and in
which the Army must fulfill its Title 10 USC and Title 32 USC responsibilities; particularly the formal and informal
systems which operate the USG, emphasis on Army force generation capabilities.
(5) Broad understanding of the formal and informal procedures and processes for resourcing DOD and for developing the national security strategy and national military strategy to include the Joint Strategic Planning System (JSPS),
and the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS).
d. Unique attributes. FA 59 strategists must display the following personal attributes and abilities:
(1) Highly developed analytical and problem solving skills to enable rapid conceptualization and development of
creative, feasible, and suitable solutions to complex strategic challenges.
(2) Ability to clearly and concisely convey complicated conceptual or analytical material in a manner that is easily
understood by senior military and civilian leaders.
(3) Intellectually inquisitive; taking initiative to understand rapidly evolving international situations, and mastering
topics across the spectrum of strategy-related fields through continuous learning and self-development.
(4) Poised, confident, and unflinchingly honest in dealing with senior leaders. Able to operate effectively in sensitive
high-pressure situations: to retain a strategic perspective, objectively analyze and assess complex issues, while
demonstrating the moral courage to articulate and defend positions.
29–3. FA 59 developmental life cycle (education and utilization)
Experience gained by lieutenants and captains during basic branch assignments serve as the foundation for future
effectiveness for FA 59 officers. All officers will attend a branch CCC and are strongly encouraged to seek a key
developmental experience prior to functional category designation (FD) at the 7th year of commissioned Service.
a. FA experience and development overview. FA 59 officers will serve in positions of increasing responsibility
throughout their careers. In order to execute this, the Officer Education System (OES) outlines that ILE is a critical
aspect of field grade officer development. For YG 2000 and beyond, FA 59 senior captains and junior majors will
attend either the ILE common core, or the Advanced Operational Warfighting Course (AOWC). Attendance is based
upon projected FA 59 requirements, previous civilian education, background, skill-sets, and officer preference. In
addition, all FA 59’s (YG 1997 and younger) will complete the Defense Strategy Course (DSC) within two years of
FD.

264

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

b. Core military education (FD captains through lieutenant colonels). In accordance with the CSA’s vision for
OPMS, there are no prescriptive developmental paths for the future Army officer corps. FA 59 officers may complete
any combination of MEL–4 producing opportunities and the Basic Strategic Arts Program to become educationally
qualified as an Army Strategic Plans and Policy officer. The FA 59 career manager will work with individual officers
to enhance their professional development and meet Army requirements. FA 59 majors who have not completed ILE
will not be considered for additional developmental opportunities until this requirement is met.
(1) DSC. The DSC is a six-month distance education program provided by the AWC. The course improves student
understanding of the role of the DOD in the development of national security strategy. The DSC addresses the national
security policymaking process and the relationship of the national elements of power to defense strategy. Enrollment
for FA 59s is open to FD captains and above. FA 59 officers transferring into the CF after 2006 are required to
complete the DSC within two years of FD. Completion of DSC will confer SI 6Z (Army strategist).
(2) ILE: ILE is a 16-week common course taught by Command and General Staff officer College (CGSOC) at
selected distance education (DE) locations ILE inculcates all field grade officers with a Warrior Ethos and warfighting
focus and prepares them for positions in the Army and JIIM environments executing full spectrum operations.
Currently, all FA officers attend the 16 week ILE common core. Dependent on officer development time lines and
Army requirements, FA 59 officers will attend either the 16 week ILE common core at a CGSOC satellite campus or
they will attend the nine month resident program at CGSC.
(3) AOWC. The nine month resident AOWC program includes the 16 week ILE common core and improves field
grade officers’ abilities to conduct full spectrum operations in JIIM environments. The course also provides the
requisite competencies to serve successfully on staffs at division level and above. FA 59 officers who attend AOWC
take the 6Z (Army strategist) and 3H (Joint operations planner) electives and any available University of Foreign
Military and Cultural Studies (UFMCS) courses that may be offered in the elective phase of study. Officers who attend
AOWC are also expected to attain a master’s degree while assigned to the CGSC.
(4) Service command and staff colleges. Due to extensive FA 59 Joint requirements, FA 59 officers are encouraged
to attend MEL–4 producing programs and to enroll in Service-unique electives while attending those programs. Due to
its unique content, FA 59 will send qualified officers to Naval Command and Staff College each year. Officers
attending this program will receive a master’s degree in strategy and policy.
(5) Basic Strategic Arts Program (BSAP): All FA 59 officers YG 94 to present and those who FD to FA 59 after
2006 will attend BSAP. FA 59s YGs 93 and older are strongly encouraged to attend BSAP. However, due to
competing requirements for student seats, not all FA 59 officers will attend. BSAP is an intensive 14-week program,
conducted at the graduate level by designated faculty members of the AWC in Carlisle, PA. The course educates newly
designated FA 59s in the fundamentals of national strategy and fills a critical educational requirement which provides
the tools for junior majors to bridge the gap between their tactical/operational background and the challenges of
operating at the grand-strategic and theater-strategic levels of war and policy. It also introduces the officers to the
unique skills, knowledge, and attributes needed as a foundation for their progressive development as Army strategists.
c. Elective military education (FD captains through lieutenant colonels).
(1) Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP). Usually following AOWC or later in their careers, some FA 59s
may attend AMSP. AMSP is a graduate-level program of the School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) emphasizing military art and science of planning, preparing and executing full spectrum operations in JIIM contexts. Curriculum
combines integrated study of military history, military theory, and execution-based practical exercises. It also enhances
officers’ cognitive problem-solving skills regarding operational challenges at the tactical and operational levels of war.
The course emphasizes both command and staff perspectives on military decision making, doctrine, and force
employment. Graduates earn a master’s degree in Military Arts and Sciences (MMAS). In addition, FA 59s who
choose to attend the SAMS will have the opportunity to obtain a Masters of Arts in Security Studies from a civilian
institution partnered with the CGSC. Upon graduation, FA 59 officers at the grade of major will serve 12-to-36 month
utilization tours in critical battle staff positions within division or corps headquarters. These positions are traditionally
known as Tier 1 assignments. Distribution of these FA 59 officers will be managed within AHRC based upon HQDA
guidance for utilization. Officers who are major (promotable) and higher may expect to serve in utilization tours at
Joint task forces, army Service component commands, or regional combatant command staffs. These tours are known
as Tier II and are also in accordance with HQDA guidance to AHRC. Officers completing AMSP are still required to
complete BSAP later in their careers. Attendance at AMSP may preclude other ACS (MA) opportunities, but
attendance does not preclude future fellowship participation and other developmental opportunities.
(2) Service and Joint equivalents to AMSP. Because of extensive FA 59 Joint requirements, FA 59 officers are
encouraged to attend MEL–4 producing programs and to enroll in Service-unique electives while attending those
programs. FA 59 officers who meet stringent selection criteria are encouraged to apply for the Joint Advanced
Warfighting School (JAWS) at the Joint Forces Staff College (JFSC). Attendance at these schools may preclude other
ACS opportunities, but attendance does not preclude future fellowships and other developmental opportunities.
(3) University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies Red Team University (UFMCS RTU): Often offered as an
elective at CGSOC, UFMCS RTU attendance is not mandatory; however, officers who wish to attend UFMCS TDY en

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

265

route should contact the FA 59 career manager and request attendance to the 8 week introductory course. Graduation
will award them an appropriate SI and enable them to work as red team members at the division/corps/ASCC level.
d. Senior military education (senior lieutenant colonels through colonels).
(1) SSC: An HQDA board determines selection for resident or nonresident SSC for eligible lieutenant colonels and
colonels. SSC selected officers should consider competing for fellowships that would further develop their skills,
experience base, and FA 59 qualifications. FA 59 officers who attend AWC are required to apply for the Advanced
Strategic Arts Program (ASAP). Officers attending other SSCs are encouraged to enroll in similar programs or
electives. Any FA 59 attending SSC or MEL–1 fellowship that has not completed a Master’s degree must complete an
advanced degree program in conjunction with SSC or their fellowship experience.
(2) National Security Management Course (NSMC): NSMC is reserved for FA 59 colonels. This six-week resident
course explores the range of management challenges in the field of national security and assists leaders in devising
strategies to carry out policy. In addition, FA 59 colonels improve their management skills regarding allocation of
scarce defense resources and complex institutional relationships, both internal and external to DOD. These responsibilities have profound implications in determining national security strategy and are the primary focus in the National
Security Management Course. Interested FA 59 colonels should contact the FA 59 proponent manager.
e. Civilian education (ACE). Army strategists combine excellence in military planning and policy development with
broad, liberal education backgrounds. Most Army strategists embrace lifelong learning and possess graduate degrees in
strategy-related fields (history, international relations, economics, national security, public affairs, foreign policy, and
regional studies). Their unique skills and operational experiences enable strategists to diagnose complex issues, develop
viable strategies, lead execution, and assess effectiveness. To prepare FA 59 officers for this challenge, the CF offers a
diverse and rich variety of civilian education opportunities and educational paths to complement its robust military
education requirements.
(1) Civil schooling. Beginning with YG 2000, all FA 59 captains will have the opportunity to receive some form of
fully-funded ACS. These programs include the Army G–35 Harvard Strategist Program (JFK School of Government),
Johns Hopkins University (School of Advanced International Studies), and other public and private institutions which
provide masters level degrees in public policy, history, political science, and international relations FA 59 officers
wishing to attend other institutions should contact the AHRC career manager for guidance on school selection. The
AHRC career manager will guide officers during the application process.
(2) Instructors. Prior to the FD board (6th year), some officers will be selected as instructors at the USMA and will
attend ACS programs at the purview of USMA. The proponent for this process is USMA and any instructors who wish
to become Army Strategists should coordinate through the FA 59 career manager. Officers who are assigned to USMA
and FD FA 59 are strongly encouraged to attain PhDs and complete non-resident ILE and DSC while at West Point. In
certain cases, the AHRC career manager will work with officers to facilitate completion of Ph.D. programs and in
matching Ph.D. complementary disciplines with follow-on assignments.
(3) Harvard Strategist Program. Captains who apply for the HQDA G–35 Army Harvard Strategist Program will be
selected by an HQDA panel. Upon graduation from the JFK School of Government, they serve a two-year utilization
tour on the Army Staff within HQDA G–35. Upon graduation, officers will FD into FA 59.
(4) Seminar XXI. Strategic Plans and Policy Officers may also compete for two fully-funded educational opportunities hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Syracuse University. Seminar XXI (MIT) is a
fully-funded educational program for senior military officers, Government and NGO officials, and executives in the
national security policy community. The program provides leaders with enhanced analytic skills for understanding
foreign countries and the relations among them. Seminar XXI explores key policy issues by examining countries and
problems critical to American interests through a variety of paradigmatic lenses. At each session, eminent speakers
present alternative perspectives from which the given country or problem can be understood. The seminar provides
concrete frameworks for examining how different paradigms suggest fundamentally different, even conflicting, answers
to the questions American policymakers must resolve. Senior FA 59 majors through colonels are invited to contact the
FA 59 proponent manager for further information.
f. Civilian education (fellowships). Upon completion of FA 59 education requirements, FA 59’s can pursue several
unique training/fellowship opportunities designed to enhance previous educational experiences. In addition to the
centrally-selected Army fellowships, FA 59s may request assignment to one of four OSD-approved fellowships
designed exclusively for FA 59. These Non MEL–1 assignments (1 year) are located within the National Capitol
Region and are designed to provide broadening opportunities and expose FA 59’s to policy development at the national
strategic level. FA 59’s selected to attend are designated as U.S. Army Fellows and act as ambassadors for the CSA.
Senior FA 59 majors and lieutenant colonels are encouraged to apply and will be selected by a panel of HQDA G–35
FA 59s at the beginning of each academic year. Officers interested in applying should contact the FA 59 career
manager. In accordance with appropriate regulations, a three to one Active Duty Service obligation (ADSO) is
incurred.
g. Utilization.
(1) Captain. As of publication, there are no FA 59 authorizations for captains. However, the OPMS now FD’s
Active Army officers during their 7th year of commissioned Service. Upon designation, follow-on assignments and

266

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

developmental opportunities are managed by the gaining AHRC career manager. Officers within life cycle manning
units will remain on station until released by their command. Captains accessed into FA 59 should understand that
there is not one best “track” or preferred path, but rather a menu of choices which the FA5 9 career manager uses to
synchronize education with future Army requirements. Regardless of current assignment at FD, captains are strongly
encouraged to enroll in the on line DSC and initiate a rigorous self-development program. The FA 59 career manager
will help to set newly designated FA 59s on immediate education and assignment paths that prepare them for future
assignments as Army strategists.
(2) Major. Most FA 59 majors will serve in assignments in plans or policy positions on staffs within divisions,
corps, theater armies, ACOMs, HQDA, regional combatant commands, and allied headquarters. Majors that complete
AMSP should anticipate assignments as strategic planners within the division/corps HQ, ASCofS, and G–5 future
plans. All FA 59 billets are KD billets where manner of performance is the key to success at all phases of an officer’s
career. Positions outside FA 59 will be rare, but may be available as a means of developing multi-functional FA 59
officers. Position sharing opportunities will be limited to 10–15 percent of all FAs billets and are opened when a
particular branch can not fill its own requirements. These positions are then opened to officers with similar skills and
experiences from basic branches or FAs.
(3) Lieutenant colonel. FA 59 lieutenant colonels serve on higher level staffs in Army, Joint, and nominative
assignments. FA 59 lieutenant colonels will progress via a variety of planning, strategy, and policy-related staff
assignments (throughout DOD) to develop as multi-skilled officers. FA 59 lieutenant colonel positions are also
available for limited position sharing based on needs of the Army. As with the previous paragraph, assignment outside
FA 59 will be rare and officers may receive training to prepare for billet sharing.
(4) Colonel. With the exception of select transfers, FA 59 colonels must have successfully completed at least two
previous Strategic Plans and Policy assignments before being assigned into a FA 59 position. Only those FA 59
Colonels with ASCC, or higher, and Joint experience will be recommended for anticipated assignments within other
Governmental agencies. In addition, the FA 59 proponent manager anticipates that by 2009, FA 59 colonels will be
able to voluntarily compete for key billet selection programs (Army Centralized Selection System). As defined by
AHRC and approved by the VCSA, a key billet is a job that requires specific, highly developed skills and experience
that are deemed so critical to a unit’s mission that an officer is selected for assignment by HQDA. These positions will
be limited to between 10–15 percent of all FA 59 colonel authorizations and are considered to be our most rigorous
and demanding assignments. They will span the full spectrum of available authorizations including Army, Joint, and
any future interagency authorizations. Key billets will be designed to indicate that officers selected for these billets are
fully qualified to serve in positions of increased responsibility. The intent is to provide a metric by which the Army can
measure potential performance at grades above colonel.
h. Officer developmental assignments. With the exception of key billets at the colonel level, all FA 59-coded
positions are KD billets. Manner of performance and fulfillment of military education requirements determine officer
promotion and selection. All officers are highly encouraged to seek assignments across the operating and generating
forces, Joint, and combined to maximize professional development. Officers should also balance planning and policy
assignments in order to fully develop as strategists. Breadth of experience enables strategists to effectively plan at the
national strategic level.
i. Branch/FA generalist assignments. As previously noted, a very limited number of FA 59 officers (major and
lieutenant colonel only) may serve outside of the FA depending on needs of the Army or for developmental purposes.
Branch immaterial assignments such as ROTC and USMA staff and faculty, and Inspector General, will always be by
exception only and is not supported by the proponent.
j. Joint assignments. All assignment rules concerning Joint positions apply to FA 59 officers. Joint qualification is
not a prerequisite for promotion to any field grade rank. Nonetheless, due to the developmental benefits of such
assignments, all FA 59 officers should seek JIIM assignments.
k. Select planning assignments. A few assignments, particularly those regarding director of plans billets at regional
combatant commands, may require a unique mix of previous operational experience and military education backgrounds. The AHRC FA 59 career manager maintains descriptions of those requirements.
29–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. As discussed in paragraph 29–3, the Strategic Plans and Policy FA has diverse opportunities that
allow for numerous viable career development paths. Specific assignments in the FA are made to develop well-rounded
highly qualified strategists that can effectively serve anywhere within DOD, OGA, or with coalition partners.
b. Precedence. Assignments to Strategic Plans and Policy positions begin after FA 59 designation and upon release
from units. FA 59 officers receive repetitive assignments within the FA. Job sequencing is not critical, however,
strategists should seek a variety of assignments at various levels in both planning and policy development to broaden
their experience and knowledge base.
29–5. Duration of developmental officer life cycle assignments
a. Strategic Plans and Policy FA experience. Non-hardship assignments within Strategic Plans and Policy will

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

267

normally be 36 months in length. FA 59 officers provide continuity to their commands and they are discouraged from
leaving before the end of their assignment cycle. Examples of these assignments are shown in figure 29–1, below.
b. Strategic Plans and Policy FA life cycle. Figure 29–1, below, displays the FA 59 life cycle with FA developmental positions.

Figure 29–1. FA 59 Active Army Developmental Model

29–6. Requirements, authorizations, and Inventory
a. Goal. To maintain a sustainable, viable career path for FA 59 officers, the field grade inventory adjusts through
constant accessions (captains FD boards/appeals and limited field grade transfers) to fulfill Army requirements while
providing sufficient educational opportunities. The experience gained through such a variety of assignments strengthens
their files prior to consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel and colonel.
b. OPMS implementation. The number of Strategic Plans and Policy authorizations, by grade, will vary as force
structure decisions are made and implemented. Officers desiring more information on current authorizations or
inventory should contact either the FA 59 proponent manager or the FA 59 career manager. Current authorizations and
requirements are posted to the FA 59 proponent manager Web page http://www.fa-59.army.pentagon.mil/.
29–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Strategic Plans and Policy
a. Structure. As with other FA based CFs, FA 59 reflects the field grade structure of the OPMS CF based
management system. All FA 59 authorizations are in the field grades.

268

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

b. Acquire. The principal method of accessing FA 59 officers will be the functional category FD process. FA 59
accessed captains will have successfully completed critical basic branch experiences, attained educational backgrounds
in policy-related fields, and, where applicable, acquired language skills. Although not required for accession into FA
59, company level command is an important developmental assignment that provides indicators of an officer’s aptitude
for successful Service as a strategist. Officers already accessed into other FAs who may be considering a FA transfer
into Strategic Plans and Policy should contact the FA 59 Proponent Manager and the FA 59 career manager at AHRC.
Senior majors and junior lieutenant colonels with strong files and relevant experience (planning and policy) will be
favorably considered. For Strategic Plans and Policy officers, undergraduate or graduate degrees in political science,
international relations, history, government, economics, regional studies, and other social sciences are desirable.
Because of the need for a very broad grounding in the Army, direct commissioning into FA 59 is currently not an
option. FA 59 also encourages officers to gain language skills that support operations in long-standing allied headquarters: German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Japanese, Korean, and Arabic.
c. Distribute. The Operations Support Division (OSD), OPMD, at AHRC will manage all Strategist FA officer
assignments after designation into FA 59.
d. Deploy. Regardless of current assignment, Strategic Plans and Policy officers must remain personally and
professionally prepared to deploy worldwide.
e. Sustain. Promotions are based upon Army requirements and FA 59 promotions are projected to be at or near
DOPMA rates. FA 59 officers are eligible for below-the-zone promotions and selection if they clearly exhibit superior
long-term performance. FA 59 officers are not currently eligible for field grade level command selection.
f. Develop. All FA 59 officers (YG 1994 to YG 1999) will complete the ILE common core course and the BSAP
after FD. Limited ACS authorizations are available for these year groups and they are encouraged to achieve graduate
degrees on their own initiative. All FA 59 officers (YG 2000 to present) will have the opportunity to attend fullyfunded ACS and attend ILE/AOWC, BSAP and or AMSP. All FA 59 YGs are encouraged to consider fellowships,
professional seminars, and continuing personal development to strengthen their professional backgrounds and prepare
them to serve as multi-skilled officers.
g. Separate. FA 59 officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
29–8. Strategic Plans and Policy Reserve Component officers
a. Career development. RC FA 59 Strategic Plans and Policy officer development objectives and desired experiences will generally parallel Active Army FA 59 officers. The challenge for the Army is to match the unique skills and
expertise of civilian professionals with mission needs and requirements. RC FA 59 officers must be afforded military
education and assignment opportunities so that senior military and civilian leaders can leverage the unique capabilities
that exist among RC FA 59 officers. The goal is to build a talented and fully integrated FA 59 community within the
Total Army, the Joint force, and the U.S. Government.
b. Assignment opportunities. RC Strategic Plans and Policy officers can expect assignment opportunities similar to
those of Active Army officers (RC Strategic Plans and Policy officers include National Guard officers). In addition,
there are positions exclusive to the Reserves and National Guard that exist in response to the changing geo-strategic
environment. Whether through mobilization of TPUs, mobilization tours for IMAs, extended Active Duty assignments,
or the limited call to Active Duty program (see below), RC FA 59 officers will serve at all levels within the Army,
Joint community, and the Department of Defense. The success of an RC strategist is not measured by length of Service
in any one component or control group, but by the officer’s experience, abilities, and performance. FA 59 assignments
are made based upon the USAR, AGR, and IMA officers available and qualified coupled with military necessity and
requirements. Civilian acquired skills, advanced military and civilian education, and demonstrated abilities to function
in a strategic environment exist among a diverse pool of RC strategists.
c. Limited call to Active Duty (LCAD). Interested RC strategists are encouraged to pursue the LCAD program. This
enables RC strategists to re-enter the Active Army while maintaining continuity of Service. Once accessed into the
Active Army, LCAD officers are assigned, promoted, and educated in the active Army. Those officers who are
interested should contact the Active Duty FA 59 career manager.
d. FA 59 development opportunities.
(1) A diverse and fluid career. The competing demands of civilian and military life pose a challenge for the
professional development of the FA 59 RC strategist. RC strategists should follow Active Army officer development
patterns as closely as possible. However, a FA 59 RC officer’s development and assignment progression can be
characterized by its ability to adapt to changes. Civilian professional development can benefit the Total Army, and
should be leveraged. To meet military career development objectives, RC officers must be willing to rotate between
ARNG and USAR TPU, IRR, IMA program, and the AGR programs. These transfers are necessitated by individual
career paths, military requirements, geographical considerations, and the need to provide as many officers as possible
the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions. The RC strategist should expect numerous and
rewarding transitions from civilian to military life. It is important to be flexible and weigh various options as
assignments and schools come available. FA 59s should seek TDY assignments and/or mobilization as an IMA.
Mobilized TPUs will present opportunities. Transferring to the IRR may be necessary while completing mandatory

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

269

military educational requirements necessary to build a career and advance as a FA 59 RC officer. RC strategists should
contact the FA 59 RC career manager to review options and opportunities.
(2) Education and training. Due to the complexity and diversity of assignments in the FA 59 field, RC officers must
continually develop their knowledge and analytical skills. RC strategists will be offered opportunities to pursue
continuing education and training (civilian and military) and government internship programs to improve skills.
Strategists in the grade of major should attend resident BSAP and complete the DSC. RC officers will have increased
time windows to complete requirements.
e. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for FA 59 RC Strategic Plans and Policy
officers mirrors that for Active Army officers, except that assignments are not limited to one component or control
group. Figure 29–2, below, illustrates a typical RC FA 59 career.

Nuclear and Counterproliferation Functional Area
30–1. Unique features of the Nuclear and Counterproliferation functional area
a. Purpose of the Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA. The Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA within the plans
development group of the operations support functional category provides trained, educated and experienced officers
who apply knowledge and expertise in nuclear related combating weapons of mass destruction (WMD) mission areas to
support the development of national and military strategy, plans and policy; conducting nuclear weapons effects
research and analysis; analysis of nuclear weapons consequences of execution; nuclear consequence management;
international treaty formulation and verification; characterization and elimination of nuclear-related facilities and
infrastructure; and planning the employment of nuclear weapons to support theater and strategic operations.
b. Unique functions performed by the Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA. The mission of FA 52 is to provide
technical advice and support in developing national and military strategy, plans, and policy recommendations to Army,
combatant command, DOD, and interagency leadership in nuclear related combating WMD mission areas. To accomplish this mission, the Nuclear and Counterproliferation officer performs the following FA 52 functions:
(1) Conducts research and analysis of nuclear and related weapons effects.
(2) Assists in forming national and military nuclear weapons strategy, plans, and policies.
(3) Assists in identifying requirements for the development, operation, and sustainment of nuclear weapons systems.
(4) Serves as a staff officer in support of warfighting forces in nuclear weapons employment and nuclear related
combating weapons of mass destruction.
(5) Provides technical expertise to assure the operational effectiveness, survivability, and endurance of our forces
based upon nuclear and other threats.
(6) Provides technical assistance in target analysis and employment planning of nuclear and advanced conventional
weapons.
(7) Assists in international arms control treaty formulation and verification.
(8) Assists in coordinating the interagency (that is, Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security, and
Intelligence Community) and DOD nuclear-related research and operational activities.
(9) Assists in the formulation of multinational nuclear standardization agreements.
(10) Educates USMA cadets and other Government personnel in nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons effects, and the
nuclear sciences.
(11) Conducts analysis of personnel, equipment, and mission vulnerability to nuclear effects.

programs (for example, cooperative threat reduction (CTR) and proliferation security initiative (PSI)).
(15) Operates, oversees, and regulates research or testing nuclear reactors and weapons effects simulators.
(16) Provides technical oversight and management of nuclear modeling and simulation efforts.
(17) Participates in the characterization and elimination of nuclear-related facilities and infrastructure.
c. Unique features of work in the FA. Work within the Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA requires the application
of technical skills in their military applications. Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers are frequently the sole subject
matter experts within their command or organization. They will—
(1) Serve as staff or liaison officers in Army, Joint, Defense, and interagency organizations.
(2) Serve as instructors in the Department of Physics and Department of Chemistry and Life Sciences at the USMA,
the Department of Engineering Physics at the Air Force Institute of Technology, the NATO School, and the Defense
Nuclear Weapons School.
(3) Serve as Military Research Associates at Department of Energy National Laboratories.
(4) Serve in fellowship positions within interagency organizations and through the TWI program.
30–2. Officer characteristics required
The Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA requires officers who are skilled in leadership at all levels; who are proficient
in branch tactics, techniques, and procedures; who possess strong Army Values, leader attributes, and skills; and who
fully understand the key leadership actions that must be taken to assure success. There are skills, knowledge, and
attributes unique to this FA that require professional development and FA 52 candidates must acquire or possess them
to ensure success.

(2) Think in the abstract and be able to apply the engineering approach to problem-solving.
(3) Be able to obtain a Top Secret clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).
30–3. Critical Nuclear and Counterproliferation Functional Area Officer development and assignments
a. General. Officers are functionally designated into the Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA by a FDB during their
7th YOS based upon the needs of the Army, officer preference, military experience, and, in some cases, civil schooling.
However, they are not generally considered for a Nuclear and Counterproliferation assignment until they have served in
a captain-level basic branch developmental assignment. Most officers will not receive a Nuclear and Counterproliferation assignment until undergoing the FDB and attendance of ILE and advanced civil schooling, as required.
b. FA Qqualification and development. Officers who are functionally designated into FA 52 should complete the FA
52 qualification course, the Nuclear and Counterproliferation Officer (FA 52) Course (NCP52), taught at the Defense
Nuclear Weapons School of the Defense Threat Reduction University, to gain the basic skills necessary for success in
the FA. NCP52 provides FA 52 officers with an introduction to the planning skills related to combating WMD, an
overview of the U.S. nuclear weapons program, an introduction to current WMD issues, and an orientation on the
nuclear weapons and combating WMD communities. As officers progress through their careers, they will be afforded
other FA-related and Army-unique educational opportunities based upon their performance of duties and the needs of
the Army.
(1) Captain. There are only limited FA 52 requirements for captains, therefore, a FA 52 assignment as a captain is
not a requirement for promotion to major, but could enhance selection into FA 52 at FD. The years following
successful completion of a branch developmental assignment are an opportunity for an officer to attend advanced civil
school or begin a FA assignment prior to functional designation. FD normally occurs in an officer’s 7th YOS. Officers
who are functionally designated into FA 52 can expect to serve primarily in Nuclear and Counterproliferation
assignments for the remainder of their careers.
(2) Major. After selection for major, Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers will then serve primarily in their FA,
with an occasional opportunity for assignment to a branch immaterial position. These billets ensure that FA 52 officers
continue to sustain the knowledge and understanding of the operational force. All Nuclear and Counterproliferation
officers must complete the requirements of ILE. ILE, for FA 52 officers consists of the completion of the command
and general staff officer’s course common core curriculum (ILE Phase 1) and the FA 52 Qualification Course (NCP52)
(ILE Phase 2). There is no required sequence for the completion of the two phases of ILE. Some will complete
graduate school to prepare for Nuclear and Counterproliferation officer assignments requiring additional skills. FA 52
majors serve primarily in entry-level positions in Defense agencies and ACOMs, where they work in staff positions
across all of the mission areas of combating WMD. Typical FA 52 developmental positions at the grade of Major
include—
(a) Combating WMD planner, Defense Threat Reduction Agency.
(b) Nuclear research officer, Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

272

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(c) Proliferation policy analyst, Defense Threat Reduction Agency.
(d) Operations officer, at Joint staff J3.
(e) Combating WMD Planner, at U.S. Strategic Command.
(f) Nuclear policy analyst, at Combatant Command Headquarters.
(g) Nuclear research officer, Defense Intelligence Agency.
(h) Plans and operations officer, Joint Task Force Civil Support.
(i) Plans and operations officer, 20th Support Command (CBRNE).
(3) Lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels are generally assigned to senior staff positions, where they can fully use
their knowledge of the Army and their FA. A limited number of opportunities exist for FA 52 officers to attend
graduate school, at both the master’s and Ph.D. levels, to prepare them for FA 52 assignments requiring additional
skills. Officers who serve successfully in a FA 52 lieutenant colonel developmental positions and have the required
time in grade are qualified to compete for promotion to colonel. Typical FA 52 developmental positions at the grade of
lieutenant colonel include:
(a) Branch Chief, Defense Threat Reduction Agency.
(b) Defense Threat Reduction Agency LNO to combatant command.
(c) Combating WMD planner, Defense Threat Reduction Agency.
(d) Branch Chief, Defense Intelligence Agency.
(e) Combating WMD plans and policy officer, DCS, G–3/5/7.
(f) WMD operations officer, Joint staff, J3.
(g) Nuclear weapons staff officer, Army Nuclear & Chemical Agency.
(h) WMD plans and policy officer, combatant command J3 or J5.
(i) Nuclear planner, U.S. Strategic Command.
(4) Colonel. As senior practitioners in their FA, they will primarily serve as Nuclear and Counterproliferation
officers on Army, Joint, or Defense staffs or may be assigned to branch immaterial positions.
c. Branch immaterial and FA generalist assignments. Captains and above can expect to serve in branch immaterial
assignments and be afforded the opportunity to broaden their experience by serving in positions outside of FA 52 and
their functional category. As a minimum, officers can expect to complete one assignment outside of FA 52 prior to
selection for colonel.
d. Joint assignments. During their careers, most FA 52 will be afforded the opportunity for an assignment that
provides them a JIIM experience. A majority of Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA positions are on the Joint Duty
Assignment List (JDAL). Officers assigned to those billets may attend JPME and may be designated as a JSO (SI 3L)
upon successful tour completion. Additionally, a number of FA 52 positions are found in Joint and Defense agencies,
even though those positions may not be listed on the JDAL. Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers are not generally
considered for Joint duty assignments until selected for major. Even though Joint experience is important to the Army
and individual officers for advancement into senior leadership positions, not all FA 52 officers will receive Joint
assignments. This will not preclude their selection to the rank of colonel.
30–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
The assignment sequencing in a FA is not as rigid as that of a branch. However, the professional development of
Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA officers has certain requirements to ensure all of the Army’s FA 52 officers are
well grounded in operations. Officers will receive their initial FA training through attendance of the Nuclear and
Counterproliferation Officer (FA 52) Course at the Defense Nuclear Weapons School, Kirtland, AFB, NM. FA 52
officers, less those assigned as instructors at USMA, can anticipate that their first assignment will be with the Defense
Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). As the organization with the largest number of assigned FA 52 officers, an entrylevel assignment at DTRA will serve as a foundation for future assignments within the nuclear weapons and combating
WMD communities. As part of their continued development, they may also serve at least one assignment in a position
outside of FA 52.
a. Preferences. The Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA has multiple opportunities that allow for numerous career
development paths. The goal of the professional development of FA 52 officers is to produce officers with a broad base
of skills in multiple areas of nuclear research, nuclear operations, and combating WMD and to apply those skills across
the full spectrum of WMD operations. Assignments in the Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA will be made to
develop the officer’s ability to achieve that goal. Requests from officers for assignments that do not contribute to
achieving this goal will likely be rejected.
b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental FA positions will have a precedence, although there is flexibility on
the sequence of assignments. Most Nuclear and Counter-proliferation FA billets will be designated as requiring
advanced education, either military or civilian. Officers assigned to those jobs must complete the required courses prior
to reporting to their duty assignments.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

273

30–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
Most assignments of Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers will be 24–36 months in length. Officers serving their
initial, entry-level assignment at DTRA can anticipate that it will be 48 months in length, with the goal for the officer
to serve 24 months in two different directorates in DTRA. Tours could be longer in areas of high concentration of
billets such as the National Capital Region. OCONUS locations will continue to require specific tour lengths.
a. Key Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA Qualification Positions. There are no specific Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA assignments required for FA qualification. Completion of the applicable-level courses as outlined in
paragraph 30–3, and successful completion of a Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA tour are the only requirements for
continued FA development at the field grade level. Officers are encouraged to broaden their individual and professional
skills by seeking alternating assignments in positions that vary both in type and echelon of organization. This variation
will provide a balance between the technical and operational aspects of FA 52 and provide the officer with a
perspective than spans from the operational to strategic levels. Though preferred, there is no requirement for a Nuclear
and Counterproliferation officer to have completed a previous FA assignment prior to assignment to a Joint command
or agency.
b. Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA life cycle. Figure 30–1, below, depicts a Nuclear and Counterproliferation
FA life cycle and the range of developmental assignments within the FA.

Figure 30–1. FA 52 Active Army Developmental Model

274

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

30–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers. To do
this, the field grade inventory must be optimized in order to fulfill FA, branch immaterial, and multi-functional
authorization requirements and to provide field grade officers sufficient time for FA development prior to promotion to
lieutenant colonel and colonel. Sufficient inventory must be available to meet authorization requirements, while
allowing sufficient FA 52 officers to attend professional military education, functional training, and advanced civilian
education required for the positions in which they will later serve.
b. Implementation. The number of FA 52 authorizations, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions are made
and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more information on current authorizations or inventory, by
grade, should contact either the FA 52 personnel proponent or the FA 52 assignments officer at AHRC.
30–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives/alternatives for the Nuclear and Counterproliferation functional
area
a. Structure. FA 52 positions exist in Army agencies, headquarters staffs, Joint commands, and defense and national
agencies. The majority of Nuclear and Counterproliferation-related billets will be in Joint and defense agencies.
b. Acquire. Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers comprising a particular year group are functionally designated
into FA 52 in their 7th YOS. The criteria for selecting an officer to the Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA include:
type of civilian degree, grade point average, personal preference, WMD operational experience, and manner of
performance.
c. Distribute. After functional designation into FA 52 at the 7th YOS, all Nuclear and Counterproliferation officer
assignments will be managed by the OSD, OPMD, at AHRC.
d. Develop. FA 52 incorporates a professional officer development career plan offering maximum diversity for
schooling and assignment. As Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers progress through their careers, in addition to
advanced military schooling opportunities, they become eligible for ACS in nuclear-related fields. These are available
at a wide variety of academic institutions, and prepare them for positions of increased responsibility and augment their
technical expertise.
e. Sustain. Officers in the Operations support functional category will compete within that functional category for
promotions to major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel.
f. Compensate. Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers will be financially compensated in the same manner as all
other officers. A majority of Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA billets requires officers with specialized degrees.
Therefore, fully-funded ACE opportunities exist for FA 52 officers at both the Master’s and Ph.D. levels.
g. Separate. FA 52 officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
30–8. Nuclear and Counterproliferation (FA 52) Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. RC describes both the USAR and ARNG and, unless otherwise indicated, references
to the RC are applicable to both. RC Officers serve the same roles as their Active Army counterparts. The unique
circumstances within the RC pose a challenge for professional development. RC officers are expected to follow Active
Army officer development patterns as closely as possible, except that RC officers have, in some cases, increased
windows to complete mandatory education requirements. To meet professional development objectives, RC FA 52
officers must be willing to rotate among ARNG and the USAR TPU, IMA program, and the AGR program. For more
guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7.
b. RC officer qualification and development. RC Nuclear and Counterproliferation (FA 52) officers can expect
assignments that are similar to their Active Army counterparts. The exception is that these assignments will also
include those separate RC FA 52, administrative, and operational reporting requirements unique to the ARNG and
USAR. The success of an RC officer is not measured by the length of Service in any one component or control group,
but by the officer’s breadth of experience, duty performance, and adherence to the requirements described herein.
Every attempt will be made to assign RC Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers to FA 52 or branch immaterial
positions. Unlike their Active Army counterparts, geographic constraints limit the ability of RC officers to stay in FA
52 positions throughout their career. When barriers such as this deny the opportunity to successfully participate in the
USAR, officers are encouraged to seek qualification and utilization in another FA. RC qualification standards will
mirror those of the Active Army whenever possible. They are as follows:
(1) Lieutenant. N/A.
(2) Captain. There are limited requirements for RC FA 52 captains and these are considered entry level. Nuclear
and Counterproliferation FA experience as a captain is not a requirement for promotion to major, but would enhance
selection to the operations support functional group. RC officer do not currently undergo FD and are designated into
FA 52 after successful completion of the FA 52 qualification course.
(3) Major. Currently, RC Majors are not functional designated, but may serve in any specialty for which they have

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

275

the requisite background and/or experience. FA 52 major positions can be found in TPU, IMA, and AGR programs. All
RC FA 52 officers should complete 50 percent of CGSC. RC FA 52 officers should attend the Nuclear and
Counterproliferation Officer (FA 52) Course (NCP52) during their first year of assignment to a FA 52 entry level
position.
(4) Lieutenant colonel. RC FA 52 lieutenant colonels should complete CGSC within 3 years of promotion to
lieutenant colonel. FA 52 positions can be found in TPU and IMA programs, with positions in the AGR program
anticipated.
(5) Colonel. All Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers selected for colonel should apply for SSC (non-resident)
Corresponding Studies Course if not selected for the resident course. Currently, because there are only RC FA 52
colonel positions in the IMA program, officers selected for colonel can expect to serve primarily in branch immaterial
positions.
(6) Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for FA 52 officers is shown at figure 30–2,
below, for USAR AGR officers, ANG M–Day officers, and USAR TPU/IMA officers.
(7) Civilian acquired skills. Many RC officers are qualified to serve in FA 52 based upon their civilian education
and civilian job experience. RC individuals with educational backgrounds in physics or nuclear engineering or work
experience in the nuclear weapons, nuclear power, emergency response, or related areas are strongly encouraged to
apply for FA 52.

Chapter 31
Force Management Functional Area
31–1. Unique features of the Force Management functional area
a. Purpose of the the Force Management FA. Force Management is a critical operating function for the Army. The
Force Management FA provides distinctively skilled officers who are primarily integrators for requirements determination, combat development, organizational development and documentation, program development and funding, and
materiel solutions development and fielding at operational and strategic levels of the Army and Joint forces. Force
Management officers are trained, educated, and qualified in critical aspects of the force management process to ensure
that forces are shaped and provided with the capabilities necessary to support the missions of geographic combatant
commands.
b. Unique functions. Force Management officers (FA 50s) are experienced in managing the organizational and
materiel changes that are fundamental to an evolving modular Army. These officers are critical to accomplishing the
Army’s Title 10 responsibilities of organizing, manning, training, equipping, and supporting land combat forces. FA
50s are highly educated, trusted advisors at all levels who serve as the SMEs on the technical processes of force
management. Force Management officers are experts at force development; the process which involves determining
warfighting requirements, designing operational and institutional force structure, identifying, and allocating authorized
resources, and analyzing second and third order effects of changes to requirements, structure, and resources. FA 50s at
division, corps, ACOMs, and ASCCs provide the warfighting command the flexibility to adapt to unforeseen organizational and materiel challenges. The Force Management officer is also an expert at force integration; the process that
manages the integration and synchronization of Army requirements across most of the Doctrine, organizations, training,
materiel, leader development and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) domains. FA 50 proponency falls
within the operations support functional category within OPMS.
c. Work in the Force Management FA. Force management is demanding, challenging, and rewarding, providing
officers the opportunity to directly affect development of the Army of the future. A Force Management officer is
involved in—
(1) Designing organizations to support Army and Joint warfighting concepts and doctrine.
(2) Supporting the development of tables of organization and equipment (TOE), Basis-of-Issue Plans (BOIP), and
Manpower Requirements Criteria (MARC).
(3) Determining the structure and composition of Army operating and generating forces through the Total Army
Analysis (TAA) Process.
(4) Determining manpower and equipment allocations for the planned, programmed and budgeted forces and related
organizations and equipment within the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) System.
(5) Developing, allocating, synchronizing documentation and executing organizational authorizations (Modified
TOEs, (MTOEs)) and tables of distribution and allowances (TDAs)); conducting affordability, supportability, and
executability assessments; and monitoring and adjusting execution of programs through concept plan and command
plan processes.
(6) Coordinating activation/inactivation/reorganization of units, processing and analysis of operational needs statements (ONS), and fielding of new equipment and systems.
(7) Analyzing cost effectiveness of personnel and materiel solutions.
(8) Analyzing and developing requirements for training programs, training devices, and simulations in support of
new systems.
(9) Determining cost effectiveness and risk mitigation factors associated with establishing the Army’s program
objective memorandum (POM).
31–2. Officer characteristics required
The Force Management FA requires officers who are skilled in leadership at all levels; who understand military
operations; who possess strong Army Values, leader attributes and skills; and who fully understand the key leadership
actions that must be taken to adapt the Army as change occurs. Force Management officers also have the technical
aptitude necessary to grasp complex, abstract ideas.
a. Required skills. Force Management officers at all levels must be able to—
(1) Operate routinely in high level staff assignments where guidance may be minimal and close interaction with
senior level decisionmakers is frequent.
(2) Express their ideas clearly, concisely, and accurately in both oral and written communication.
(3) Thoroughly develop issues and clearly articulate recommendations and their potential second and third order
effects to senior level decisionmakers.
(4) Reduce raw data for effective use by senior level decisionmakers.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

277

(5) Organize, integrate, and lead work groups of military and civilian specialists to solve specific force management
problems.
(6) Conduct innovative research on evolving force management processes or developmental Army systems or
capabilities.
b. Specialized knowledge. Force Management officers require specialized detailed knowledge of Army organization,
structure, and doctrine to be SMEs in managing organizational and materiel change. Force Management officers must:
(1) Possess a thorough understanding of Army force management processes, gained through specialized education
and training courses and through repeated duty assignments at operational and strategic levels of command.
(2) Understand the organization of the Army, ARNG and USAR, their Title 10 USC (Armed Forces) and Title 32
USC (Army National Guard) responsibilities, and the missions, roles, and functions of their major commands.
(3) Understand, in broad terms, the organization of the DOD; the principal strategic planning documents (National
Military Strategy (NMS), National Defense Strategy (NDS), National Security Strategy (NSS), Defense Planning
Guidance (DPG), and the formal and informal procedures and processes for resourcing the DOD and the Services.
(4) Understand Joint warfighting concepts and the integration of Joint and Service systems (planning and resourcing) at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.
(5) Understand both formal and informal systems of the U.S. Government, interagency processes, Joint Strategic
Planning System (JSPS), and PPBE.
(6) Understand how national issues, including political, military, economic, social, inter-Governmental, and international/multinational challenges affect Army and Joint force management.
31–3. Critical officer development and assignments
a. General. Force Management officers possess significant skills in organizing, equipping, and resourcing the Army
and are the creative managers of change for the Army and within DOD. Officers at the grade of O3 or higher who are
interested in the Force Management FA or who will be required to serve in positions coded for SI 3R should complete
initial force management training prior to performing duties in any position coded for SI 3R. This training is open to
any officer and can be completed regardless of the officer’s rank. Attending the 4-week Advanced Force Management
Course (AFMC) at the Army Force Management School (AFMS) at Fort Belvoir, VA, results in award of the SI 3R
(Force Management) indicating familiarity with force management processes. Officers selected for Functional Designation into FA 50 will attend this AFMC training together with the follow-on FA 50 Qualification Course (QC) to
designate them as FA 50 officers. Ideally, the Force Management officer will begin his/her FA career at HQDA level
to ensure a solid grounding in DA force management processes and to enhance future utility when assigned to units at
operational Army level. Following initial assignment, the Force Management officer must seek to broaden and hone
his/her skills, knowledge, and experiences at every grade. Force Management officers will increase their expertise and
broaden their skill sets by seeking subsequent assignments that alternate between organizational and materiel orientation and cross echelons between ARSTAF, ACOM, operational units (ASCC, corps, division), and Joint levels as they
progress through their careers.
b. FA qualification and development. All officers functionally designated into FA 50 attend the 4-week AFMC.
Officers in YG 92 and earlier are considered qualified if they have completed the 4-week AFMC. Officers in later year
YGs must complete the follow-on FA 50 QC (implemented in 2005) to complete their qualification in the FA. The FA
50 QC provides an understanding of the logical flow of operational concepts, requirements determination, capabilitiesbased assessments, organizational design and documentation, equipment and manpower resourcing, and materiel
acquisition and fielding. The QC blends the principles of Army force management with liberal practical exercises on
the component systems of force management as it builds on the AFMC foundation throughout the 10 week curriculum.
Taken together, the ILE core course, the AFMC, and the FA 50 QC will provide the officer the required training and
education for intermediate career education requirements and JPME 1 qualification. Following this qualification,
officers may complete a brief but focused assignment oriented curriculum to prepare them with the skills specific to
their first assignment in force management. Additionally, opportunities outside the typical FA professional development
path do exist for some officers. Pursuing an advanced degree (see table 31–3, below) is highly recommended and very
desirable anytime in a Force Management officer’s career. Officers may apply for the SAMS at Fort Leavenworth, KS.
Interested officers should submit requests for attendance and exception to policy to their branch manager and the FA
50 proponency office. Force Managers at the lieutenant colonel rank that are competitive for selection for SSC should
consider ranking the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF) the top consideration for slating. Force managers
should actively pursue TDY opportunities in order to increase their operational exposure in major theaters and JIIM
experience as well. JIIM is an evolving set of opportunities. Officers should ensure that experiences outside traditional
branch or FA positions, even for short periods, should be documented by supervisors in performance evaluations.
Future revisions to this manual will contain more specific guidance on tracking and crediting JIIM type exposure or
experience.
(1) Captain.
(a) Qualification. There are currently no FA requirements for captains; however, captains have the opportunity to

278

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

attend the initial SI 3R producing force management training (AFMC) and serve in 3R-coded positions once they have
completed any basic branch requirements and required schooling.
(b) Development. Officers indicate their preferences for FD at their 7th YOS or prior to the Major Selection Board.
Generally, officers who are designated FA 50 will be eligible for a force management assignment after they have met
all the basic branch requirements as a captain and completed the ILE and JPME 1 qualification training. Captains
desiring to serve in a force management assignment should work directly with the AHRC FA 50 assignment officer
concerning options for their last company grade assignment prior to consideration for promotion to major. This will
allow sufficient time to coordinate the scheduling of initial force management training and a follow-on force management assignment to an authorized billet. Although no requirements for FA qualification exist at the rank of captain,
training and experience in operational assignments provide the officer with a solid foundation for force management
work. Additionally, a 3R-coded assignment as a captain may enhance the officer’s chances of functional designation
into the Force Management FA. FD occurs normally at the 7th YOS, but not later than selection for promotion to
major. Officers who are designated to come to FA 50 in the FD process may serve in Force Management assignments
for the remainder of their careers.

(2) Major.
(a) Qualification. In order to be well qualified at the rank of major an officer must complete the following
requirements:
1. Complete ILE curriculum.
2. Complete the FA 50 QC.
3. Serve successfully in a FA 50 major authorized KD or developmental position. The above criteria combined with
time in grade make the officer eligible for consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel. FA 50 majors serve
primarily as a force management specialist or as individual action officers with specific focus in force management
areas of responsibility. Officers should seek force management assignments that provide additional breadth to their
experiences and skill sets, and should strive to serve in positions that exercise force development or force integration
processes at several levels. Majors, as a minimum, should successfully serve in one or more of the following 6 KD
positions:
a. Requirements synchronization officer, at the Army G3.
b. Force management officer, at ACOM / ASCC or the Army G3.
c. Force modernization officer, at Division, Corps, or ACOM/ASCC.
d. System synchronization officer, at the Army G8.

4. Serve successfully in one of these 4 developmental positions:
a. Force structure officer, at ACOM / ASCC, or Army G3.
b. Force structure analyst at ACOM or Army G8.
c. Force design officer at ACOM.
d. Combat developer at ACOM.
(b) Utilization. Force Management majors can expect utilization at either HQDA or at the operational level
(division, corps, and ASCC). Some majors could be utilized as force managers at ACOM level headquarters. Majors
should work toward the completion of a master’s degree in a primary or associated discipline (see tables 31–2 and
31–3, below) either through fully-funded programs or on their own initiative.
(3) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Qualification. In order to be well qualified at the rank of lieutenant colonel, an officer should complete the
following requirements:
1. Complete the FA qualifications for major.
2. Serve successfully in a FA 50 lieutenant colonel authorized key developmental or developmental position. The
above criteria combined with time in grade qualify the officer for consideration for promotion to colonel. FA 50
lieutenant colonels are generally assigned to supervisory positions or to positions on senior level staffs. Lieutenant
colonels are expected to understand the programmatic underpinnings of requirement determination, materiel solutions,
force design, and resource programming and funding. They guide and review the force management work of subordinates and apply analytical assessment techniques to a wide range of military force management and managerial issues.
Force Management lieutenant colonels should successfully serve in one or more of the following 6 KD positions:
a. Deputy division chief at the Army G3.
b. Branch or team chief at ACOM, the Army G3 or G8.
c. Force integration officer at corps, ACOM or the Army G3.
d. Force developer at corps or ACOM.
e. Requirement synchronization officer/system synchronization officer at the Army G3 and G8.
f. Joint force manager at Joint staff or the Army G8.
3. Serve successfully in one of these 3 developmental positions:
a. Force manager at ACOM or the Army G3.
b. Force analysis manager at ACOM, Army G3 or G8.
c. Command manager at the Army G3.
(b) Utilization. Force Management lieutenant colonels can expect utilization at either HQDA, ACOM, or at the
operational level (division, corps, ASCC) and should aggressively seek different types of jobs within Force Management authorizations and structure to broaden their force management experience. Additionally, it is in the best interest
of the officer to work in FA 50 authorized positions that increase their experiences in leadership. It is highly
recommended that lieutenant colonels complete a master’s degree program in a primary or associated discipline (refer
to tables 31–2 and 31–3, below). Assignments outside of the FA do exist and the opportunities to compete for
nominative assignments are available to the Force Management officer.

(4) Colonel. As senior force managers, colonels serve in assignments that require both technical force management
and managerial skills. They should be able to oversee and direct diverse force management efforts and analytical
studies in order to determine the best feasible force management solution. All FA 50 coded colonel billets are critical
assignments and will require a trained force management officer to fill the authorization. Colonels should have a broad
background in analytical processes, and possess the following qualifications:
(a) Joint qualified (3A or 3L).
(b) SSC graduate.
(c) Serve successfully in a FA 50 colonel FA authorized position. These required educational and duty assignment
milestones qualify the officer for consideration for promotion to brigadier general.
c. FA generalist assignments. Assignments outside of the functional category do exist and the opportunities to
compete for nominative assignments are available to the Force Management officer. However, the intent of the Army is
to utilize its senior level force managers in positions that make the best use of their force management experience.
d. Joint assignments. FA 50 FA positions exist on the JDAL for major and above. Joint experience, while highly
encouraged, is not required for an FA 50 officer to be promoted to colonel. Officers seeking assignment opportunities
within the JCS or OSD should first successfully complete at least one Army Force Management assignment, preferably
at the DA or ACOM staff level.
e. ACS. FA 50 majors and lieutenant colonels can compete for a fully-funded Masters in Business Administration or
System Engineering with a concentration in Force Management once they are FA qualified. FA 50 sends selected
officers to attend a 16 month curriculum at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia or the Naval Postgraduate
School at Monterey, California. The curriculum year begins in August and ends in December of the following year.
Officers assessed into the ACS program will incur a three-year commitment upon completion of the degree studies. To
compete for the ACS program, the officer must meet the minimum standards outlined in AR 621–1. Interested officers
are asked to contact the FA 50 branch manager at AHRC no later than 31 May of the current year to ensure timely
preparation of their ACS packets.
f. Fellowships. FA 50 majors and lieutenant colonels can compete for a RAND Arroyo Center Fellowship. RAND is
a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) with its headquarters in Santa Monica, California. FA
50 sends one officer a year to serve a 12-month tour with RAND Arroyo Center in Alexandria, Virginia. The
fellowship offers the officer the opportunity to conduct in-depth research and analysis on critical force management
issues at the DA and DOD levels, as well as to become a published author as a part of this fellowship. Interested
officers undergo a rigorous interview and selection process to ensure that the best qualified officer represents the force
management community. Upon successful completion of the one-year tour, the officer incurs a three-year commitment.
Officers interested in competing for this Fellowship must meet the requirements outlined in AR 621–7. Interested
officers and should contact the FA 50 branch manager at AHRC no later than 31 May of the current year to ensure
timely preparation of their fellowship packets. It will be advantageous for officers to complete a master’s degree in a
primary or associate discipline (see tables 31–2 and 31–3, above) prior to competing for the RAND Fellowship. Further
information on fellowships may be obtained by contacting the FA 50 personnel proponency office.
31–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
The professional development of a Force Management officer requires that the officer be exposed to a variety of force
management related work. The fundamentals of force management procedures and processes do not change rapidly
over time, but their application varies to meet the needs of contemporary operating environments. After receiving their
initial training, FA 50 officers should seek various types of force management assignments in different types of
organizations to foster their professional development and to broaden and hone the critical skills necessary for success
at senior levels.
a. Preferences. Force Management officers manage and lead change; they become an invaluable tool for the
commander from requirements determination to organizational and materiel solutions. The goal of the FA is to produce
officers skilled in the technical processes of force management, but retaining their broad understanding of the
operational Army. The Force Management officer is capable of managing the processes of requirements determination,
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

281

organizational development and documentation, fielding and integration of new equipment and systems, and integrating
these processes to facilitate Army evolution. Officers should also develop skill at quantitative and qualitative analysis
throughout their careers. Assignments in the FA provide the officer exposure to a number of organizations that require
force management skills and attributes so that the officer develops a fuller understanding of the application of force
management techniques throughout the military.
b. Precedence. The sequencing of assignments within the FA is flexible; although, in some instances, precedence for
assignments exists. Officers who have not yet met KD or developmental requirements at their respective rank may be
given the precedence for assignment to FA 50 authorized positions. An officer’s first field grade assignment is in a FA
50 authorized coded developmental position, and officers can expect subsequent FA 50 assignments throughout the
Army and Joint staffs.
31–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
Officers assigned to the FA 50 FA will normally spend 24 to 36 months in a specific position. An officer may spend a
longer period assigned to a geographical area where there is a high concentration of billets such as the National Capital
Region. Force Management officers should seek to diversify the types of jobs they fill if the tour length in a particular
area exceeds three years in order to broaden the scope, skill set, and experiences obtained through repetitive assignments. OCONUS locations will continue to require specific tour lengths.
a. Key Force Management developmental positions. A field grade officer is expected to perform successfully in a
specific FA 50 position to be considered properly experienced in a particular facet of force management. Officers are
encouraged to broaden their individual and professional skills by seeking alternating assignments in positions that vary
both in type and echelon of major headquarters and achieve a balance between strategic and operational levels.
However, it’s important to understand that the value of an assignment is tied more closely to the skills and experience
gained at each rank versus the specific position an officer holds.
b. Force Management FA life cycle. Figure 31–1, below, depicts a Force Management FA life cycle and the range
of developmental assignments within the FA.

282

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Figure 31–1. FA 50 Active Army Developmental Model

31–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The FA 50 goal is to have a field grade officer mix of Force Management authorizations that provide
challenging assignments for professional development while maintaining an inventory of officers that enables each
Force Management officer to be competitive for promotion at rates that meet or exceed Army averages.
b. OPMS re-design and evolution. The number of FA 50 authorizations, by grade, will vary as force structure
decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more information on current authorizations or inventory should contact either the FA 50 proponency office or the FA 50 assignments officer at AHRC.
31–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Force Management officers
a. Structure. Officers serve primarily on Army, Joint, or DOD staffs and in their field operating activities, in
dedicated organizations (for example, Force Design Directorate, TRADOC combat developments, and so on). Force
Management officers have an equally important role as part of the warfighting team within the ASCC, corps, and
division levels serving as the primary advisor to the commander on issues relating to force management, structure, and
synchronizing requirements with solutions.
b. Acquire. There are two points in an officer’s career when the officer may acquire the FA 50 designation. The first
is a result of the FDB that may come as late as the officer’s selection for promotion to major. The second is later in the
officer’s career pattern depending on their performance of duty. The criteria for selecting an officer during the FD
process includes needs of the Army, officer preference, commander’s input (OER), undergraduate degree, and graduate

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

283

degree. Prior training and experience in force management as a captain does not guarantee selection to the FA 50 FA at
the time of FD, but may enhance the officer’s chances of being designated into the CF.
c. Distribute. The FA 50 assignments officer within AHRC OPMD, and the FA 50 assignments officer at the
Colonels Management Office (CMO), SLD Office, HQDA, both manage FA 50 officer assignments. Assignment to FA
50 authorized positions, to ACS, fellowships, or to branch/FA developmental positions depends upon the needs of the
Army, officer preference, and officer competencies at the time of assignment.
d. Deploy. FA 50 officers can be deployed worldwide at any time. FA 50 officers may deploy with their units in the
course of normal operations, or as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations when their special expertise
is called for across the range of military operations.
e. Sustain. Officers designated into the operations support functional category compete for promotions with other
operations support officers for lieutenant colonel and colonel promotions. The FA 50 assignments officers in CMD and
CMO monitor the officers’ careers, and the FA 50 proponency office provides the directive policies for the FA.
f. Develop. Officers develop their force management skills through a series of progressively more difficult assignments and supporting assignment oriented training that provides the officer an opportunity to apply his or her skills to a
wide range of Army and DOD problems. Additional development of the officer occurs through Service in branch and
FA developmental positions. In these developmental positions, officers are exposed to varied Army organizations and
functions while allowing FA 50 officers the ability to hone their skills. Development also includes ACS for completion
of a master’s level degree and a Fellowship with RAND Arroyo Center. Officers should complete a master’s degree in
a primary or associate discipline (refer to tables 31–2 and 31–3) prior to consideration for the RAND Fellowship.
g. Separate. FA 50 officers separate from the Army in accordance with applicable regulatory guidance.
31–8. Reserve Component Force Management officers
a. General. RC Force Management officers in the AGR) program in an active status may serve the same role and
mission as their Active Army) counterparts. Officers in a reserve status perform similar but not identical roles
dependent upon the type and level of the organizations they support. The unique nature of the reserve status RC
officers’ roles as citizen Soldiers poses challenges for professional development. Despite these challenges, RC officers
are expected to follow Active Army officer development patterns as closely as possible, with the exception that RC
officers have increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. To meet professional development
objectives, RC officers in a reserve status (ARNG and USAR) must be willing to, whenever feasible, rotate among
TPUs, IRR, and IMA programs both within and outside of their respective components. AGR professional development
assignments are managed separately by each component’s full-time support branch. Geographical considerations, as
well as the need to provide as many officers as possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff
positions necessitate these transfers. Every attempt will be made to assign RC Force Management officers in developmental positions, but opportunities are limited. Unlike their Active Army counterparts, RC Force Management officers
may have to revert to basic branch assignments to continue their reserve participation and career development. For
guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7.
b. Assignment opportunities. RC Force Management officers can expect assignment opportunities that mirror those
of Active Army officers, as well as positions applicable exclusively to the RC. RC FA 50 officers serve at all levels
within the DOD, and consequently must fully understand and be conversant with the roles, missions and composition
of the RC as an integral component of the total Army. The success of a RC Force Management officer is not measured
by length of Service in any one component or control group, but by the officer’s breadth of experience, duty
performance, and adherence to FA requirements. Assignments in FA 50 are available throughout the RC (AGR, TPU,
and IMA).
c. Qualification and professional development. RC Force Management officers satisfy FA qualification requirements
and become competitive for promotion when they attend military schools and then seek assignments in positions of
increased responsibility.
(1) Qualification. Requirements for qualification depend upon component and status. For RC officers of the USAR
in the AGR program, qualification requirements are the same as for Active Army FA 50 officers and are outlined
above in paragraph 31–3b. For ARNG officers in a reserve status, constructive credit may be used to award the FA 50
AOC. Constructive credit consideration requirements are—
(a) Have completed the Advanced Force Management Course (4 week).
(b) Have completed the Army National Guard Force Management Course (2 week).
(c) Have accumulated two of the past five years of Force Development/Force Integration experience.
(d) Receive endorsement from the Director, Force Management (NGB–ARF) Requests for constructive credit award
of FA 50 AOC can be made through NGB–ARF to the FA 50 proponent office.
(2) Professional development. The following standards listed below must be met in order to prepare RC officers to
be considered qualified for promotion to the next higher rank unless otherwise noted (length of Service in a given
position should not be narrowly construed; key is assignment diversity, level of participation, diverse experiences, and
skill set and sufficient time within each assignment to develop competence; USAR AGR officers will be single tracked
to the extent possible)—

284

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(a) Captain. There are no FA requirements for captains; however, captains have the opportunity to attend the initial
SI 3R producing force management training AFMC and serve in 3R-coded positions once they have completed any
basic branch requirements and schooling.
(b) Major.
1. Majors will successfully complete the CCC and common core ILE course,
2. Serve successfully in a 50A coded position, with optimally qualified officers serving for 24 or more months in
such a position.
3. Complete the four-week AFMC. Further professional development opportunities include the 14-week FA 50 QC
and ACS/TWI fellowships.
4. FA 50 coded positions at the U.S. Army Reserve Command are considered equivalent to battalion executive
officer or battalion S3 positions within a basic branch.
(c) Lieutenant colonel.
1. Successfully complete common core ILE course and the AFMC.
2. Serve a successfully in a lieutenant colonel grade level Force Management position. Optimally qualified officers
will have 36 months in a coded 50A position of which 12 months should be in an O5 position. KD positions are those
at HQDA, OCAR, Joint staff, or USARC Staff. Civilian Force Management Service such as time spent as a career
program (CP) 26 series, Manpower and Force Management, employee will be taken into consideration. Civilian Force
Management Service must be annotated on the biography submitted to promotion boards.
(d) Colonel.
1. Successfully complete ILE and the AFMC.
2. Serve successfully in at least one 50A coded position. Optimally qualified officers will have served 48 months in
50A positions of which they should serve 12 months in an O5 50A position and 12 months in an O6 50A position. As
senior force managers, colonels serve in assignments that require both technical Force Management and managerial
skills. They should be able to oversee and direct diverse force management efforts. They should pursue an advanced
civilian degree, completion of resident SSC, and potential senior level fellowships.
3. Certain jobs in for Army Reserve AGR officers are critical for career progression. At the O4 level, OCAR
organizational integrator is considered the equivalent of battalion XO or battalion S3 positions. At the O5 level,
division chief, branch chief, or deputy director of force programs are considered battalion command equivalent
positions. At the O6 level, the director of force programs is considered a brigade command equivalent position.
d. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for FA 50 officers is shown at figure 31–2,
below.
e. Civilian acquired skills. Many RC officers are qualified force management officers in their civilian profession, yet
they don’t possess FA 50 qualifications. These officers are strongly encouraged to apply for FA 50. The FA 50
proponency office through AHRC–St. Louis will be the approval authority for all requests. Civilian Force Management
assignments will be considered as developmental equivalents when qualifying these officers for positions of increased
responsibility.
f. RC training participation and credit. See chapter 7.

Chapter 32
Operations Research/Systems Analysis Functional Area 49
32–1. Unique features of the Operations Research/Systems Analysis functional area
a. Purpose. The Operations Reserach/Systems Analysis (ORSA) FA provides uniquely skilled officers-problem
solvers-who produce the analysis and logical reasoning necessary to inform and underpin critical decisions by leaders
and managers at all levels of the DOD. These officers recommend potential solutions for complex strategic, operational, tactical, and business issues. ORSAs are an integral part of the Army and Joint leaderships’ decisionmaking
processes to organize, man, train, equip, sustain, and resource transformation from the current to the future force and
conduct analysis in support of the GWOT and other war fighting operations.
b. FA 49 is managed within the operations support functional category. The FA 49 proponent office resides in the
Program Analysis and Evaluation Directorate, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G–8, HQDA.
c. Functions. The FA 49 officer uses analytic methods and mathematically based procedures to enable leadership
decisions in a constantly changing global environment. ORSAs introduce quantitative and qualitative analysis to the
military’s decisionmaking processes by developing and applying probability models, statistical inference, simulations,
optimization, and economic models. The ORSA FA encompasses diverse disciplines that include personnel management, doctrine and force development, training management, system testing, system acquisition, decision analysis, and
resource management, as well as tactical, operational, and strategic planning from division through combatant command and from ACOM/ASCC/DRU through the highest levels of the DOD.

286

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

d. Unique features of ORSA work. The FA 49 officer integrates military knowledge and experience with the
scientific and managerial fields. They serve as SMEs in designing forces, allocating resources, analyzing effects,
performing course of action and trade-off analysis, and they effectively communicate potential solutions to complex
problems to decisionmakers. The ORSA officer will typically serve in one of several general assignments as—
(1) An analyst on an Army, Joint, or Defense agency staff.
(2) An analyst in an organization whose principal mission is to provide analysis that supports the organizing,
equipping, manning, training and operations of military forces. Such organizations include Center for Army Analysis
(CAA), TRADOC Analysis Center (TRAC), the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), branch battle labs and
combat development organizations.
(3) An instructor teaching ORSA and/or mathematics courses at the U.S. Military Academy (USMA), Army
Logistics Management College (ALMC), Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), or Air Force Institute of Technology
(AFIT).
(4) A combat analyst on a division, corps, ASCCs, or equivalent Joint headquarters staff.
32–2. Officer characteristics required
The ORSA FA requires officers with the potential to lead at all levels, who understand military operations, and who
possess strong Army Values, a Warrior Ethos, and leader attributes and skills described in FM 6–22. The ORSA FA
also requires officers who have the technical aptitude necessary to grasp complex, abstract ideas.
a. Unique skills. An FA 49 officer must be able to—
(1) Formulate solutions to complex problems and design research and study approaches whose conclusions affect
positive change.
(2) Apply technical analytic skills to military issues.
(3) Infer causal relationships from observed events.
(4) Conduct and supervise quantitative and qualitative analyses.
(5) Communicate complex ideas, analysis, and recommendations to decisionmakers at all levels in terms appropriate
to the audience.
(6) Organize workload, assign tasks, and lead and mentor civilian and military subordinates.
(7) Plan, evaluate, coordinate, and integrate actions with other staff elements and functions.
(8) Conduct research to acquire sufficient knowledge of new or unfamiliar processes or systems requiring
assessment.
(9) Develop tools and processes that focus on planning, executing, and assessing military operations for the effects
produced to achieve objectives.
(10) Assist staff and commands at all levels in the development of metrics and in conducting assessments to ensure
they are "effectiveness" and "performance" based.
b. Unique knowledge. The ORSA field requires the application of quantitative and qualitative methods to a wide
variety of military problems. Therefore, an ORSA officer should strive to—
(1) Understand military strategy and operations, program costing, force structure, combat developments, requirements analysis, human resource management, system testing evaluation, modeling, simulation, economics, political
military integration, and wargaming.
(2) Understand the applications of the principles of scientific inquiry, mathematical models, and analytical software
programs.
(3) Keep pace with technology and methodology developments in the operations research field.
c. Unique attributes. FA 49 officers bring scientific approaches to solving complex military problems. An FA 49
officer should strive to—
(1) Attain operational experience to complement analytical skills in order to understand the military context of the
analysis.
(2) Work and excel at quick-turn analyses in dynamic high-tempo environments, as well as thorough long-term
studies.
(3) Communicate and defend analytic work and results in technical and non-technical terms at all levels of interest,
from peers to senior officers and officials.
(4) Identify, understand, and solve complex problems.
(5) Work as part of a team with other members who may or may not be analysts.
(6) Be mathematically oriented and possess an inquiring mind.
(7) Assist decisionmakers to validate assumptions.
(8) Filter and present data in intuitive and meaningful forms.
d. Officer developmental assignments.
(1) FA qualification. Generally, ORSA officers complete initial FA 49 qualification training prior to performing
duties in a FA 49-coded position. This training is completed regardless of the officer’s rank. Credit for initial FA 49
qualification training can be obtained by one of the following two means:
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

287

(2) ORSA Military Applications Course (ORSA–MAC). This two-phase course is a 14-week intense immersion into
the basics of Operations Research and Management Science offered at Fort Lee, Virginia through the Army Logistic
Management College (ALMC). Officers will generally attend this course while PCS in route to an initial FA 49
assignment.
(3) ACS. Officers may also receive credit for initial FA 49 qualification training via ACS by completing a master’slevel graduate degree in a primary or associated discipline listed in tables 32–2 and 32–3, below. Since advanced
education is a hallmark or the ORSA CF, all FA 49 officers may compete to attend ACS. Those who have completed
ORSA–MAC are not restricted from applying.
e. Additional FA development. ORSAs are expected to continue their education beyond the initial ORSA–MAC and/
or ACS qualification. This can be done through participation in additional advanced civilian education, Army funded
programs, professional societies and fellowships. Some examples of Army funded programs are the ORSA Technologies and Applications Course and other continuing education programs, offered by the ALMC Systems Engineering Department. Professional societies include, but are not limited to, the Military Operations Research Society
(MORS), Army Operations Research Society (AORS), and the Institute for Operations Research and the Management
Sciences (INFORMS). Each of these societies holds recurring symposia that provide opportunities to share studies and
analyses within the ORSA community. Fellowships such as the RAND Arroyo Center Fellowship offer unique
opportunities for continued education.
f. Development by rank. The qualification criteria listed below are the minimum requirements for an FA 49 officer
to qualify for promotion to the next higher rank.
(1) Captain.
(a) Key development (KD). There are no FA qualification requirements for captains; however, captains have the
opportunity to attend initial FA 49 qualification training and serve in FA 49-coded positions.
(b) Other development. At their 7th year of Service (YOS), officers are offered the opportunity to select a preference
to a FDB. AHRC selects officers to serve in FA 49 assignments based on individual preference, needs of the Army,
and undergraduate degree discipline (see table 32–1, below). Generally, captains will be eligible for an ORSA
assignment after they successfully complete assignments designed to gain the requisite skills and experiences required
by their basic branch. Captains desiring to serve in an ORSA assignment should contact the AHRC FA 49 assignment
officer as soon as possible after establishing their preference to allow sufficient time to coordinate initial FA 49 FA
qualification training and a follow-on FA 49 assignment. ORSA captains normally serve as members of analytical
study teams or as ORSA staff officers, where they apply the skills gained through initial training. Officers functionally
designated FA 49 will serve primarily as ORSAs in subsequent assignments.
(2) Major.
(a) KD. An officer must complete ILE requirements to be qualified at the rank of major. Additionally, the officer
must successfully serve in a FA 49-coded position optimally for two years. As an exception, an officer who completes
a master’s level graduate degree in a primary or associated discipline as listed in tables 32–2 and 32–3, below, must
serve at least one year in a FA 49-coded position to be qualified as a major. Officers in cohort year groups affected by
full implementation of universal ILE (1994 and later) are required to complete the FA 49 QC and the ILE common
core course to successfully complete ILE requirements. The FA 49 QC is designed to prepare field grade officers to
serve successfully in FA 49 positions through the rank of lieutenant colonel as senior analysts on Army and Joint
staffs.
(b) Other development. All FA 49-coded positions are considered FA qualifying. Officers should seek assignments
that provide additional breadth to their FA 49 experience. FA 49 majors serve primarily as ORSA analysts on study
teams or as individual action officers with specific analytical areas of responsibility. Assignments to combatant
commands, Joint task forces, division, corps, or Army Headquarters, other operational-level staff positions and JIIM
environments are encouraged. Majors should continue their professional development through continuing education and
self-development with the ultimate goal of completing a master’s level graduate degree in a primary or associated
discipline (see tables 32–2 and 32–3, below). Officers are encouraged to apply for the School of Advanced Military
Studies (SAMS).
(3) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) KD. An officer who has a total of 5 years field grade experience in FA 49-coded positions is considered fully
developed at the rank of lieutenant colonel.
(b) Other development. All FA 49-coded lieutenant colonel positions are FA qualifying. FA 49 lieutenant colonels
are generally assigned to supervisory positions or to positions on senior level staffs. Lieutenant colonels are expected to
develop analytic requirements, design studies and establish appropriate methodologies, guide and review the analytic
work of subordinates, and apply ORSA techniques to a wide range of military and managerial issues. Some ORSA
lieutenant colonels fill branch/FA generalist authorizations. FA 49 lieutenant colonels should seek a broad range of
experiences to provide breadth to their professional competence, including department-level, Joint staff, corps, or
ASCC, other operational level staff positions, and JIIM environments. It is highly recommended that lieutenant
colonels complete a master’s degree program in a primary or associated discipline (see tables 32–2 and 32–3, below).
(4) Colonel. As senior analysts, colonels serve in assignments that require both technical ORSA and senior

288

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

leadership skills. They must be able to oversee and direct diverse studies and analytical efforts. To be developed at the
grade of colonel an officer must—
(a) Have completed all requirements for FA qualification at the Lieutenant Colonel level.
(b) Have been trained as an ORSA via ORSA–MAC or ACS and earned a master’s level degree in an OR discipline
listed in tables 32–2 and 32–3, below.
(c) Will optimally serve for 24 months in an FA 49 colonel position. Colonels should have a broad background in
analysis throughout the Army, having served in a variety of previous FA 49 field grade assignments. Their military
education goal should be completion of resident SSC, the AWC Distance Education Course, or a fellowship.
g. Branch/FA generalist assignments. These billets, such as ROTC professor of military science and certain faculty
and staff positions, while not identified with a specific branch or FA are important to the Army. The frequency that FA
49 officers fill branch/FA generalist positions depends on FA 49 inventory and the needs of the Army.
h. Joint assignments. ORSA FA positions exist on the Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL) for majors and above.
Joint experience, while highly encouraged and desirable, is not required for FA 49 field grade promotions. Completion
of a Joint assignment and JPME (Phases I and II) is mandated by law for selection to O–7. Officers seeking assignment
opportunities within the Office of the Secretary of Defense or the Joint staff should first successfully complete at least
one FA 49 assignment, preferably at DA or ACOM level.
i. ACS. FA 49 offers several opportunities for fully-funded ACS as described in AR 621–1. These are typically
opportunities for fully-funded master’s degrees. Some FA 49 officers may be selected for additional ACS to earn a
doctoral degree. Those officers that do not complete a master’s degree through the fully-funded ACS program are
highly encouraged to seek advanced degrees through the Army’s tuition assistance program or cooperative degree
programs offered by some analytical organizations. Interested officers should visit the AHRC FA 49 assignment
officers’ Web page at https://www.hrc.army.mil/site/protect/Active/opfamis/49/current/education.htm for more information. (Note: An AKO username and password are required to access this site.)
j. Fellowships. FA 49 majors and lieutenant colonels may compete for a RAND Arroyo Center Fellowship. RAND
is a Federally Funded Research and Development Corporation (FFRDC) headquartered in Santa Monica, California.
The RAND fellowship is 12 months long and, upon completion, officers are usually assigned to HQDA, the Joint staff,
or OSD. The RAND fellowship invokes a 3-year ADSO. Interested officers should contact the FA 49 AHRC
assignment officer for more information. All applicants must meet the minimum requirements specified in AR 621–7.

32–3. Assignment preferences and precedence
The professional development of an ORSA officer requires that the officer be exposed to a variety of ORSA-related
work, preferably in a number of challenging assignments. The fundamental theories behind ORSA techniques do not
change rapidly over time, but the environments and problems to which the tools are applied may vary greatly, as well
as the implementation of software tools available. After initial FA 49 training, officers should seek a variety of ORSA
assignments in diverse organizations to support their professional development and broaden their experience. ORSA
assignments are filled to meet the critical needs of the Army. Assignment outside the FA is rare and will be addressed
in a case by case basis.
a. Preferences. FA 49 has diverse opportunities that allow for numerous career development paths. The goal of FA
49 professional development is to produce operationally competent officers skilled in conducting quantitative and
qualitative analysis on a wide variety of military issues. Assignments in the FA should provide the officer exposure to
a number of organizations that require FA 49 skills so the officer develops a broader understanding of the application
of ORSA techniques throughout the military.
b. Precedence. The sequencing of assignments within the FA is flexible, although in some instances there is
assignment precedence. Officers who have not met qualifying requirements at their respective rank are given precedence for assignment to FA 49 authorized positions. An officer’s first field grade assignment is generally to an FA 49
authorized position or to initial FA 49 graduate education rather than to a branch/FA generalist position. Additionally,
an officer’s initial assignment should be to a location with multiple ORSA positions and mentors to facilitate growth
and development. Some FA 49 authorizations require advanced education. Officers assigned to these positions must
complete the required education prior to their assignment. Prior to serving on the Joint staff or in OSD, officers should
plan to serve in at least one FA 49 assignment, preferably at Army Staff level, on a corps or equivalent staff, or on a
COCOM or JTF staff.
32–4. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
Most FA 49 tour lengths are 24 to 36 months. An officer may be assigned longer to a location with a large FA 49
concentration, such as the National Capital Region ORSA officers should seek assignment diversity if their tour length
in a particular area exceeds 3 years. OCONUS assignments will continue to require specific tour lengths.
a. Key ORSA qualification positions. There are no specific assignments required for FA 49 qualification at any rank.
The only FA qualification requirements are outlined in paragraph 32–3, above.
b. Branch/FA generalist positions. Branch/FA generalists positions within analytic or resource management organizations offer “hard skill” development. Positions in non-analytical organizations may offer more leadership development. Duty in one of these positions should augment or develop skills missing from previous assignments leading to a
more broadly skilled officer.
c. ORSA FA life cycle. Figures 32–1 and 32–2, below, depict the ORSA FA life cycle with FA qualifying
requirements for both active and RCs. They also identify developmental assignment examples within the FA.

292

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Figure 32–1. FA 49 Active Army Developmental Model

32–5. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. Provide a sufficient variety and number of FA 49 authorizations that provide challenging assignments and
multiple career paths for professional development while maintaining an inventory that enable officers to be competitive for promotion at rates consistent with Army averages.
b. OPMS and personnel transformation. The number of FA 49 authorizations, by grade, will vary as force structure
changes. Officers desiring more information on current authorizations or inventory should contact either the FA 49
personnel proponent or the FA 49 assignments officer at AHRC.
32–6. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Operations Research/Systems Analysis
a. Structure. FA 49 officers serve primarily on Army, Joint or DOD staffs and in their field operating activities, in
dedicated analytical organizations, such as the Center for Army Analysis or TRADOC Analysis Center, or as
instructors. Approximately 90 percent of FA 49 authorizations are in the Army generating force. The remaining FA 49
structure is in the operating force from combatant command and ACOM/ASCC/DRU-level down to division. FA 49s
may deploy forward from the generating force to support employed forces or support their commanders’ analysis
requirements through reach-back to CONUS.
b. Acquire. There is one programmed point in an officer’s career at which they may enter FA 49. Permanent entry
into FA 49 is made in conjunction with a FDB held at the 7th year mark. In addition to the programmed point in a
career, an officer may request a transfer to FA 49 at any time. The request for transfer is adjudicated by AHRC’s
internal review mechanisms and approval is based on Army needs. The criteria for selecting an officer during the FDB

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

293

process include officer preference, Army requirements, rater and senior rater OER recommendations, undergraduate
degree, and graduate degree, if applicable.
c. Distribute. The Operations Support Management Division (CMD), OPMD, AHRC manages FA 49 officer
assignments after functional designation. Assignments to FA 49 authorized positions or other assignments depend on
the needs of the Army, officer preference, and officer qualifications at the time of assignment.
d. Deploy. ORSAs are operationally proficient officers who remain personally and professionally ready to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to the operating force or generating force, all FA 49 officers must be
prepared to deploy to support missions across the full range of military operations.
e. Sustain. FA 49 officers designated into the operations support functional category compete for major, lieutenant
colonel, and colonel promotions with other operations support officers. AHRC FA 49 assignment officers monitor
officers’ careers, and the personnel proponent provides FA policies.
f. Develop. Officers develop FA 49 skills through a series of progressively more challenging assignments and
education that provide officer opportunities to apply their skills to a wide range of Army and DOD problems.
Additional officer development accrues through Service in branch/FA generalist positions. In generalist positions, FA
49 officers are exposed to varied Army organizations and functions, allowing officers opportunities to apply their skills
outside normal areas of application. Schools include the standard Army education opportunities, ILE, SAMS, and SSC,
as well as ORSA–MAC and ACS to complete a master’s or doctoral degree. Officers should complete a master’s
degree in either a primary or associated discipline (see tables 32–2 and 32–3, above). FA 49 majors will generally
attend ILE through the 14-week common core course in residence at a CL site. After successful course completion at a
CL site, officers are Intermediate Staff College (ISC) graduates. Full ILE credit is awarded when the officer has
completed the FA 49 QC and ILE common core which awards ILE and JPME I. Officers in all year groups are
required to complete ILE. Officers in YG 94 and later must also attend the FA 49 QC. Officers should have all phases
of ILE complete prior to the lieutenant colonel board. Failure to do so will exclude them from consideration for SSC.
An alternative is attendance at TASS classrooms located in CONUS and OCONUS CL sites
g. Separate. FA 49 officers separate from the Army in the same manner as other officers.
32–7. Operations Research/Systems Analysis Reserve Component officers
a. General. RC ORSA officers fulfill similar roles and missions as their Active Army counterparts. The range and
scope of possible RC assignments is somewhat more limited than those found within the Active Army, due, in part, to
differences in force structure and partly because there are no RC organizations comparable to the TRADOC Analysis
Center or the Center for Army Analysis. Nevertheless, every attempt will be made to assign RC ORSA officers either
in FA 49 or branch/FA generalist positions, given available opportunity. Unlike their Active Army counterparts, RC
ORSA officers may be expected to revert to basic branch assignments to continue reserve participation and career
development. For additional guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7.
b. Assignment opportunities. RC ORSA assignments are similar to Active Army assignments with a few exceptions.
Generally, USAR entry-level positions are in the accessions system area. USAR analysts have two other areas of
activity in which to gain experience toward becoming a well-rounded senior analyst. The first is in resourcing and
represents all assignments relevant to the PPBE process. The second is in the operations, plans, and doctrine area,
which include operational deployments, COCOM and ARCOM assignments, and basic branch/branch generalist
assignments relevant to strategy and doctrine development. ARNG analysts are primarily assigned to organizations in
the National Capital Region and to ARNG staffs.
(1) Captain. USAR entry-level positions include several captain billets, most managed under the AGR program.
Almost all USAR captains serve as marketing officers at USAREC brigade headquarters. They are supervised and
mentored by senior civilian analysts, work alongside their Active Army peers, and complete their tours prepared for
personnel, strength management, or accessions system policy assignments at USARC, USAREC, OCAR, RTD,
AHRC–St. Louis, and HQDA.
(2) Major and lieutenant colonel. Most RC ORSA positions are field grade and are governed by the IMA and AGR
programs, and most authorizations for senior majors and above are in the National Capital Region. Two ARNG ORSA
majors are authorized for the division, corps, and Army Headquarters Staff.
(3) Colonel. There are few colonel positions and senior analysts should seek branch/FA generalist positions.
Colonels should maintain broad perspectives and should seek experience throughout the analytical community.
c. Significant numbers of mobilization requirements exist for FA 49 qualified officers. AHRC–St. Louis manages
pre-trained individual manpower to fill shortfalls in Active Army, USAR, and ARNG units using officers assigned to
the IRR.
d. Qualification and professional development. RC ORSA officers satisfy FA qualification requirements and become
competitive for promotion when they attend military schools and serve in positions of increased responsibility. The
following standards must be met to be considered qualified for promotion to the next higher rank unless otherwise
noted (length of Service in a given position should not be narrowly construed; key is assignment diversity, level of
participation, and sufficient time within each assignment to develop competence):
(1) Captain.

294

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(a) Successfully complete basic branch captain’s Officer Education System (OES) courses (either Active Army or
RC curriculum).
(b) Serve in at least one basic branch position for a minimum of 24 months to gain the requisite skills and
experiences required by their basic branch.
(c) Complete ORSA–MAC or obtain a master’s degree in a primary or associated ORSA discipline listed in tables
32–2 or 32–3, above.
(d) Serve in at least one entry level ORSA position for a minimum of 24 months.
(e) ACS is available to both captains and majors, but the Naval Postgraduate School is the only fully-funded ACS
opportunity and these opportunities are limited. Officers should develop a plan to obtain a relevant master’s degree.
(2) Major.
(a) Successfully complete at least ILE common core. Attendance of the FA 49 qualification course is highly
encouraged.
(b) Serve a minimum of 24 months in at least one ORSA position. Best-qualified officers will serve 36 or more
months in ORSA positions.
(c) Continue development through CEP or various civilian education venues with the ultimate goal of obtaining a
master’s degree in a primary or associated ORSA discipline listed in tables 32–2 or 32–3, above. A master’s degree is
not a requirement for promotion to lieutenant colonel, but is highly encouraged. Some assignments, including HQDA
staff and OSD, may require a master’s degree in an ORSA discipline.
(d) If a second ORSA assignment is not available, serve a minimum of 36 months in a branch/FA generalist or basic
branch position. AGR officers will be single tracked FA 49 to the maximum extent possible.
(3) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Successfully complete ILE within 3 years after promotion to lieutenant colonel.
(b) Serve a minimum of 6 years at the field grade level in an ORSA position Time spent obtaining a master’s degree
listed in tables 32–2 or 32–3, above, as a full time duty may be included as part of the 6-year minimum. Civilian
ORSA Service such as time spent as a GS 1515 series employee will be considered towards meeting the 6-year
minimum as well. Civilian ORSA Service must be annotated on the biography submitted to promotion boards.
(c) Be selected for SSC.
(4) Colonel.
(a) Serve in at least one ORSA position for a minimum of 24 months.
(b) As senior analysts, colonels serve in assignments that require both technical and managerial skills. They should
be able to oversee and direct diverse studies and analytical efforts. Colonels should have a broad background in
analysis throughout the Army, having served in a variety of different FA 49 authorizations in previous field grade
assignments.
e. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for FA 49 officers is shown at figure 32–2,
below.
f. Civilian acquired skills. Many RC officers possess education and/or work experience through their civilian
profession comparable to that of ORSA officers but are not designated FA 49. These officers are strongly encouraged
to seek FA 49 designation through AHRC–St. Louis. Civilian ORSA-related work experience will be considered for
developmental equivalency when qualifying these officers for positions of increased responsibility.
g. RC training participation and credit. See chapter 7.
(1) CCC required for promotion to major.
(2) Must complete ILE common core for promotion to lieutenant colonel. LEDC counts as 50 percent completion of
CGSC.
(3) ILE must be completed within 3 years after promotion to lieutenant colonel (see fig 32–2, below).

completion of ILE (MEL 4); academic achievement including a master’s degree; and potential for completion of an
earned Ph.D. in an appropriate field.
a. Competencies and actions common to all. Army officers must be premier warfighters who can effectively apply
the four core dimensions of leadership: values, attributes, skills, and actions. (For additional discussion of these
leadership dimensions, see FM 6–22.)
b. Unique skills. FA 47 officers are required to have outstanding records of military performance and solid academic
credentials. In addition, they must show evidence of, or demonstrated potential for—
(1) Superior teaching ability at the college level.
(2) Active engagement, participation, and growth in an academic discipline.
(3) Contributions to the academic growth of junior faculty.
(4) Contributions to the growth and development of cadets outside formal academic courses.
c. Unique knowledge. FA 47 officers are required to have a Ph.D. in their designated academic discipline, or to have
a master’s degree and be able to obtain a Ph.D. within 3 years of appointment.
d. Unique attributes. FA 47 officers must—
(1) Possess the highest standards of integrity and professional ethics.
(2) Show evidence of, or demonstrate potential for, Service to the Military Academy, Government agencies, and/or
the academic discipline through participation in professional organizations and societies.
33–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
Officers must have extensive experience and sustained exemplary performance with the Army, typically reflected by
basic branch or FA professional development and assignments, as well as the successful completion of ILE (MEL 4).
They must also complete a Ph.D. in an appropriate discipline and have the appropriate professional experience to
engage in teaching activities at the undergraduate level.
a. FA professional development.
(1) Captain. There are no FA 47 authorizations at the grade of captain.
(2) Major. There are no authorized FA 47 positions at the grade of major. However, officers selected for Academy
Professor positions while in the grade of major must focus on earning a Ph.D..
(3) Lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels are generally assigned within their respective organizations to significant
academic, administrative, and leadership positions such as program directors, division chiefs, and directors of centers of
excellence. Lieutenant colonels with a Ph.D. are considered eligible to compete for promotion to colonel.
(4) Colonel. Colonels are generally assigned within their respective organizations to significant academic, administrative, and leadership positions such as program directors, division chiefs, directors of centers of excellence, and
deputy heads (in academic departments not authorized 47A deputy head positions).
b. Branch/FA generalist assignments. FA 47 officers do not serve in branch/FA generalist assignments.
c. Joint assignments. FA 47 officers do not serve in Joint assignments.
33–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. FA 47 assignments are at the USMA and USMA Preparatory School.
b. Precedence. Developmental assignments will have precedence within an academic hierarchy.
33–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
Duration of stabilized faculty assignment is through mandatory retirement for Academy Professors (28 years for
lieutenant colonels and 30 years for colonels) and for Professors, USMA (age 64).
33–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a faculty, sensitive to both Army needs and academic standards, which support the
USMA mission to provide the Army with commissioned leaders of character.

298

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

b. OPMS implementation. Officers desiring more information on current authorizations or inventory, by grade,
should contact either the FA 47 personnel proponent or the FA 47 assignment officer at AHRC.
33–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Academy Professor
a. Structure. FA 47 positions exist only at the United States Military Academy and United States Military Academy
Preparatory School.
b. Acquire. USMA-stabilized faculty positions are normally filled through a USMA faculty search committee
process. FA 47 vacancies are advertised in the Army Times newspaper (worldwide), on various computer bulletin
boards, and computer Web sites to include the USMA Adjutant General homepage (http://www.usma.edu/adjutantgeneral). The advertisement will include specific criteria that an officer must meet to be considered for appointment. Applications are forwarded to a selection committee composed of both stabilized and rotating faculty members,
civilian faculty and, in some cases, representatives appointed by HQDA. The committee considers all applicants;
evaluating the breadth of the applicant’s military experience, depth achieved in military specialties and evidence of
leadership. A list of the top qualified applicants is forwarded to the Dean of the Academic Board, to the Superintendent, and to the Academic Board. The Academic Board will make a final recommendation. Professor, USMA (AOC
47A) appointments require presidential nomination and congressional approval. HQDA has approval authority for
Academy Professors (AOC 47*).
c. Distribute. After designation into FA 47, officers are managed by the operations support Division, officer
Personnel Management Directorate, at AHRC.
d. Deploy. FA 47 officers are stabilized and normally not considered for worldwide deployment.
e. Sustain. FA 47 officers will compete within operations support functional category for promotion to lieutenant
colonel and colonel.
f. Develop. Orderly progression for USMA stabilized faculty includes completing military schooling; training with
military units; completing a Ph.D. not later than 3 years following assignment to USMA faculty as an Academy
Professor; teaching; developing and implementing courses, programs, and curricula; assessment; conducting research
and participating in scholarly activities; and conducting outreach activities in support of the Army. Conducting research
and participating in scholarly activities provide continued growth and development opportunities within the officer’s
selected academic discipline. Outreach activities in support of the Army provide continued military growth and
professional development opportunities within the officer’s selected academic discipline. FA 47 officers are not
considered for selection by Army competitive boards for attendance at SSC. The Dean of the Academic Board has
developed a military schooling program that provides SSC opportunities for USMA stabilized faculty. USMA stabilized faculty perform outreach Service, to include Service with Army laboratories and consultation with HQDA and
DOD agencies, related to their academic and military expertise and special duty with units in the Army. USMA
stabilized faculty members normally remain on the USMA faculty until retirement and follow a career pattern that is
necessarily directed toward academics, teaching, and research. These activities are necessary to ensure that the
stabilized faculty continues to develop mastery of their academic disciplines and possesses the latest, as well as
emerging techniques and information.
g. Separate. Upon retirement, any Professor, USMA (47A) of the USMA whose grade is below brigadier general,
and whose Service has been long and distinguished, may, at the discretion of the President, be retired in the grade of
brigadier general. Academy Professors (FA 47*) officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other
officers.
33–8. Academy Professor Reserve Component Officers
Academy Professor, USMA, is an Active Army FA.

Chapter 34
Simulation Operations Functional Area
34–1. Unique features of the Simulation Operations functional area
a. Unique purpose of the Simulation Operations FA. High operational tempo (OPTEMPO), Army transformation,
GWOT, operational requirements, digitization, new weapon systems, and emerging threats have increased our reliance
on simulations for force readiness. The Army requires a group of officers who understand the application of Battle
Command, and can exploit its capability for training and military operations. Simulation Operations (FA 57)
proponency falls within the operations support functional category within OPMS. The Director, Battle Command
Directorate is the personnel proponent for Simulation Operations (FA 57).
b. Unique functions performed by Simulation Operations FA. Simulation Operations (FA 57) FA officers apply
models and simulations to create the training environments that prepare Soldiers, leaders, and battle staffs for current
and future battles. FA 57 officers plan and employ a mix of live, virtual, and constructive simulations in support of

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

299

training and military operations. FA 57 officers integrate modeling and simulation with battle command systems.
Additionally, FA 57 officers assist in the development of current and future simulations and battle command systems.
c. Unique features of work in Simulation Operations FA. FA 57 officers work at all levels, and perform the
following functions and tasks:
(1) Provide simulation operations support to Soldiers, leaders and battle staffs at all levels of command; Army
(Active Army/RC), JIIM team.
(2) Develop doctrine, organizations, and equipment for the FA 57 mission area.
(3) Provide simulation operations support at Service schools and Combat Training Centers (CTCs).
(4) Provide subject matter expertise in the acquisition and development of models and simulations.
(5) Experts who develop, plan, coordinate, and execute exercises at all levels of command; Army, JIIM
organizations.
(6) Experts in Battle Command and the integration of simulations for both training and military operations.
(7) Serve in a wide range of activities to include management of training simulation systems, simulation operations
management and the application of simulation within the training exercises and military operations (TEMO).
(8) Serve as advisors to assist research, development, and acquisition (RDA), advanced concepts, and requirements
(ACR) domains.
34–2. Officer characteristics required
a. General. The Simulation Operations FA requires officers with Warrior Ethos that understand Battle Command
systems, military operations, and training. An FA 57 is steeped in tactics, techniques and procedures; a dynamic,
competent, and multi-skilled leader who is effective in managing, leading, and changing the future training
environments.
b. Competencies and actions common to all. Army officers must be warfighters who can effectively apply the four
core dimensions of leadership: values, attributes, skills, and actions. (for additional discussion of these leadership
dimensions, see FM 6–22) The four core leadership dimensions provide the basis for what a leader must be, know, and
do. The values and attributes set the basis for the character of the leader - what a leader must be. The skills developed
by leaders establish his or her competence - what a leader must know. The actions that leaders conduct and execute
constitute leadership - what a leader must do. The leadership framework describes a leader of character and competence who acts to achieve excellence across the spectrum of operations from total war, to operations other than war, to
disaster relief and in times of peace.
(1) Leader values. Values are at the core of everything the Army is and does. The Army is an institution of people
with unique and enduring values. These values must be a part of the men and women (officer, enlisted, and civilian
personnel) who are the Army. These values provide the sense of purpose necessary to sustain Soldiers in combat and
help resolve ambiguities in operations other than war. Officers must establish and maintain an environment in the
Army where Soldiers and civilians do what is right; where we treat each other as they should be treated; and, where
everyone can be all they can be. There are seven Army Values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless Service, honor,
integrity, and personal courage (LDRSHIP).
(a) Loyalty. Bear true faith and allegiance to the U.S. Constitution, the Army, their unit and other Soldiers.
(b) Duty. Fulfill their obligations.
(c) Respect. Treat people as they should be treated.
(d) Selfless Service. Put the welfare of the nation, the Army, and their subordinates before their own.
(e) Honor. Live up to all the Army Values.
(f) Integrity. Do what’s right, legally and morally.
(g) Personal courage. Face fear, danger, or adversity (physical or moral) with the spirit and determination of a
warfighter.
(2) Leader attributes. Attributes are fundamental qualities and characteristics. Attributes assist in defining what an
officer should be and contribute to leader actions. Army leader attributes are described in three categories; mental,
physical, and emotional.
(a) Mental attributes describe aptitudes and capacities for learning that leaders should possess and develop. Included
in this category are will, self-discipline, initiative, judgment, confidence, intelligence, and cultural awareness.
(b) Physical attributes specify physical dispositions or aptitudes that can be nurtured and developed. Included in this
category are health fitness, physical fitness, stamina, military bearing, and professional bearing.
(c) Emotional attributes are those affective aptitudes or capacities that contribute to how one feels and substantially
contribute to leadership. Included in this category are self-control, balance, and stability.
(3) Leader skills. Skills are synonymous with competencies. They are abilities or competencies that one develops
and uses with people, with ideas and with things. Competence is of primary importance for all Army officers. The
Army recognizes that officers must develop four types of skills.
(a) Interpersonal skills reflect competence in communicating with people.
(b) Conceptual skills refer to competence in handling ideas.

300

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(c) Technical skills reflect competence with things.
(d) Tactical skills refer to the ability to put together technical, interpersonal, and conceptual skills and apply them to
warfighting tasks.
(4) Leader actions. Officers provide purpose, direction, and motivation as they influence their subordinates, operate
to accomplish their mission, and strive to improve their unit or organization. Leader actions are how Army officers act
to achieve excellence and get the job done. These actions are applicable across all levels of leadership.
(a) Influencing refers to the use of appropriate people skills to guide subordinates or teams toward mission
accomplishment. Influencing subdivides into communicating, decisionmaking, and motivating.
(b) Operating or accomplishing the mission refers to the relative short-term actions of getting the job done.
Operating subdivides into planning, executing, and assessing.
(c) Improving refers to the long-term investment-type actions essential to improving everything the leader influences. Improving subdivides into developing (people), building (teams), and learning.
c. Unique skills.
(1) Tactical and technical skills. FA 57 officers must be warfighters who are technically proficient with modeling
and simulation tools, command and control systems, collaborative planning, and mission rehearsal systems. Possess
expert knowledge on Battle Command concepts and procedures. Understand how to leverage mission planning and
rehearsal collaborative systems in an operational environment. FA 57 mission success requires that officers understand
the capabilities simulations offer and can leverage their capabilities to enhance unit proficiency. FA 57 officers must
leverage their simulation experience to assist in the development of the Army’s future simulations environments. These
skills must be gained and developed through operational assignments and continuous professional study and selfdevelopment.
(2) Tactical competence. FA 57 officers must show proficiency in required professional knowledge, judgment, and
warfighting. They must apply their doctrinal knowledge and understanding to the solution of tactical problems and
formulate and defend solutions to problems using current Army and Joint doctrine.
(3) Conceptual competence. FA 57 officers must possess the ability to synthesize information and to clearly
communicate information required to make timely decisions. The uncertain conditions of military operations will
demand mental endurance and agility, often under severe conditions and time constraints. FA 57 officers must
effectively develop and communicate their vision, purpose, and direction.
(4) Interpersonal competence. FA 57 officers are part of a combined arms team. They must be skilled in building
teamwork within their organization and recognize that they often simultaneously belong to many teams. They must
possess the ability to express themselves to their team members clearly, concisely, and accurately, both orally and in
writing.
(5) Technical competence. FA 57 officers must possess the necessary expertise to accomplish all tasks and functions
of the FA. They must be able to apply their technical knowledge and skills to solve problems within the TEMO
domain and assist in both the ACR and RDA domains. They must be able to prepare and present clear and informative
briefings relating to their technical areas of expertise to their peers, subordinates, and superiors.
(6) Decisionmaking skills. FA 57 officers often work in an environment where sound and timely decisions must be
made while time available for problem analysis is seriously constrained. Information gained in this environment will
vary in its completeness and ambiguity. An ability to operate under stress and make decisions is critical to success.
d. Unique knowledge. FA 57 officers must—
(1) Retain competency in the basic warfighting skills of their basic branch.
(2) Understand the organization, structure and doctrine of the warfighting Army, other DOD simulation organizations, as well as other national, civil commercial, and allied simulation activities.
(3) Possess expertise and knowledge to support military units and staffs at all levels in planning and executing
realistic simulation training in dynamic, synthetic environments.
(4) Create a synthetic training environment for commanders, battle staffs, and Soldiers to conduct structured,
interactive training sessions linked through technology.
(5) Design and implement unique simulation/C4I system federations to support training, exercises, and military
operations.
(6) Possess expert knowledge of Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS) and their employment.
(7) Possess expert knowledge of various simulation systems and their employment.
(8) Understand how to design and support experimental efforts to test Battle Command configurations, C3I design
concepts, doctrinal techniques, and so on, through well-designed and properly controlled experiments.
(9) Understand how to integrate technology with training and combat developments.
(10) Understand DOD and Army policies that govern the development and use of simulations.
e. Unique attributes. FA 57 officers must—
(1) Display systems management skills and the ability to understand, monitor, and improve systems.
(2) Work and excel in a dynamic, complex, and high-tempo environment performing functions that are typically not
intuitive to the majority of their contemporaries.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(3) Integrate technology and training principles to accomplish the mission/task.
(4) Be familiar with the overall requirements for comprehensive integration of software, hardware, networks, and
communications to support simulation training activities.
(5) Be multi-skilled and creative thinker and have a well-developed ability to reason both critically and intuitively.
(6) Analyze and solve complex technical problems.
(7) Demonstrate intellectual honesty with superiors and be unafraid to state and defend convictions. Translates
complex technical concepts and terms into language that the tactical warfighting commander/operator understands.
34–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. General. FA qualification and development.
(1) Captain. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop proficiency as
a company commander and staff officer prior to selection as a FA 57. Captains will undergo a FDB during their 7th
YOS. This board of senior officers will decide in which CF each officer is best suited to serve. Captains selected for
the Simulation Operations FA will be designated into the functional category of operations support, and functional
group of forces development. Many FA 57 officers will complete training during this period of their career and then
begin serving in FA assignments. An officer selected for FA 57 is eligible for a FA 57 assignment after completing
their branch experience assignment (usually successful command) or successful completion of ACS, and developmental
training. Captains designated FA 57 will receive developmental training prior to any FA 57 assignment. FA 57
experience as a captain is not a requirement for promotion to major.
(2) Major.
(a) Officers requesting functional designation to FA 57 after their selection to major should have completed an
operations assignment as an S3, S3 air, assistant S3, assistant G–3, FSO, support operations officer, CTC observer/
controller or some other equivalent branch experience assignment. Some FA 57 officers will complete training during
this period of their career and then begin serving in FA assignments. All majors must complete a resident or
nonresident ILE course. YG 94 and younger officers will attend residence ILE/AOWC or equivalent ILE school. FA 57
majors are eligible to compete for and attend sister Service/foreign CGSCs and SAMS.
(b) FA 57 majors will attend the Simulation Operations QC prior to a FA 57 assignment. Most FA 57 majors will
attend ILE schooling prior to initial major FA 57 assignments.
(c) FA Qualification for FA 57 majors is completion of the Simulation Operations QC, ILE/AOWC schooling, and
one or more of the following FA 57 assignments:
1. Two years as a brigade, BCT, regiment, division, or corps S3/G3, Simulation Operations/Battle Command officer.
2. Two years as a echelons above division/echelons above corps Simulation Operations officer, or FA 57 position.
3. Tour completion in a Joint duty FA 57 position.
4. Two years in any other FA 57 position.
5. Successful completion of ACS plus one year in any FA 57 position.
(d) Numerous FA 57 billets (predominately lieutenant colonel) are located within Joint commands. FA 57 officers
will be assigned within the Joint community as they progress through increasing levels of responsibility and gain FA
57 experience.
(e) FA 57 assignments for majors may include: Brigade/BCT/Regimental FA 57 staff officers, division, echelons
above division/echelons above corps, Joint, HQDA Battle Command Directorate, ACS, and proponent FA 57 representative at branch schools.
(f) Majors should continue their professional development to become an expert in all aspects of simulation operations. Self-development may include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training. Officers
should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their technical and warfighting skills and knowledge.
(3) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Officers selected for lieutenant colonel FA 57 are generally assigned to more senior level positions where they
can fully use their knowledge of the Army and FA. The objective of lieutenant colonel professional development is
greater contribution to the FA and the Army.
(b) FA 57 FA qualifying assignments for Lieutenant Colonels consists of two years in a FA 57 coded lieutenant
colonel billet. Typical assignments may include—
1. CTC Simulation Operations officer or Deputy Director of Simulation.
2. Chief, Battle Simulation Center/Battle Command Training Center/Mission Support and Training Facility.
3. Joint duty position FA 57 staff officers.
4. Branch Chiefs at the National Simulation Center.
5. Director of Operations at the Warrior Preparation Center or Deputy Director of Simulations USAREUR Battle
Command Training Center (UBCTC).
(c) Lieutenant colonels who have not previously attended the FA qualification course will attend the course at the
earliest opportunity after FA designation. Those selected to attend SSC must complete the Simulation Operations QC
prior to SSC attendance.

302

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(4) Colonels.
(a) The professional development objective for colonels is greater contribution to the FA and the Army.
(b) FA 57 qualification assignments for colonels consists of two years in a FA 57 coded colonel billet. Typical
assignments may include—
1. Corps Chief Exercises and Training.
2. Director, National Simulation Center.
3. Director, Joint Multinational Command Training Center.
4. Senior Military Fellow, NDU.
5. Deputy Director, Aviation Battle Lab.
6. Deputy Director or Technical Advisor, Battle Command Directorate.
(c) Colonels who have not previously attended the FA qualification course will attend the course at the earliest
opportunity after FA designation. Those selected to attend SSC must complete the Simulation Operations QC prior to
SSC attendance.
b. Joint assignments. FA 57 officers can expect to be considered for nominative Joint duty assignments worldwide.
Even though Joint experience is important to the Army and to individual officers for advancement into senior
leadership positions, not all FA 57 officers will receive Joint assignments. This will not preclude their selection to the
rank of colonel.
c. Other assignments. FA 57 FA officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated above.
These other assignments may include White House Fellows, duty with the National Security Council, the United
Nations, as well as FA 57 FA representatives at Allied Service schools. The spectrum of possible assignments is large
and these assignments require mature, skilled, and well-grounded officers.
d. Multi-functional positions. In accordance with the Chief of Staff, Army’s vision for an officer corps with greater
depth and breath of assignments and creating multi-skilled leaders, the Simulation Operation proponent has identified a
limited number of FA 57 positions accessible by branches or FAs other than FA 57. These positions will be managed
by AHRC and the AHRC FA 57 assignments officers to ensure officers have the requisite knowledge, skills, and can
attain the scheduled training opportunities to ensure success for a single assignment.
34–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. The Simulation Operations FA has diverse career development path opportunities. The goal of the
professional development of FA 57 officers is to produce a talented group of officers who have developed operationally and as simulation and battle command specialists. Assignments in the FA will be made to develop the FA 57
officer’s ability to achieve that goal. Requests from FA 57 officers for assignments that do not contribute directly to
this goal must be fully justified and approved.
b. Precedence. All officers will attend the Simulation Operations QC prior to their initial FA 57 assignments. Some
FA 57 billets are designated as requiring advanced education. Generally, officers assigned to those assignments will
have completed the necessary education requirements.
34–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Key Simulation Operations FA qualification positions. FA qualification for FA 57 officers is defined by grade as
stated above.
b. Simulation Operations FA life cycle model. Figure 34–1, below, displays a FA 57 FA time line with qualifying
developmental and utilization assignments.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

303

Figure 34–1. FA 57 Active Army Developmental Model

34–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for FA 57 FA officers. To do this the field grade
inventory must be optimized in order to meet FA authorizations.
b. OPMS implementation. The numbers of authorized FA 57 billets, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions
are made and implemented. Officers desiring more information on FA 57 authorizations and inventory are encouraged
to contact the Simulation Operations proponent division or the AHRC, FA 57 career manager/assignments officer.
34–7. Key life cycle initiatives for Simulation Operations
a. Structure. The FA 57 force structure has gone through significant changes in the last several years, and will see
modest growth through FY 09, primarily in the ranks of lieutenant colonel and colonel.
b. Acquire. Captains will be functionally designated into the Simulation Operations FA at their 7th YOS. Majors and
lieutenant colonels may opt to become FA 57 officers through transfer requests in accordance with AHRC procedures
and guidelines (see AHRC Web site).
c. Distribute. The FA 57 (Simulation Operations) career manager/assignments officer within AHRC, and the FA
Assignments officer at the Colonels Management Office (CMO), manage FA 57 assignments. FA 57 assignments to
ACS, TWI, fellowships, and branch/FA developmental positions depend upon the needs of the Army, officer skills and
experience, and officer preferences at the time of assignment.
d. Deploy. Simulation Operations officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to

304

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

deploy worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to MTOE units with high levels of readiness or TDA organizations,
all FA 57 officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of military operations. FA 57
officers may deploy with their units in the course of normal operations, or as individuals to support Joint and
multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping missions.
e. Sustain. Continuous OPMS evolution will determine future FA 57 officer career development and structure.
(1) Promotion. FA 57 FA officers compete for promotion within the operations support functional category.
Promotion numbers and percentages will reflect Army and FA requirements which advance the best qualified multiskilled leaders able to meet the future requirements.
(2) OER. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS. Starting with captain, the
rater and senior rater will recommend on the officer’s OER the CF which best suits his or her abilities and interests.
f. Develop. FA 57 will offer some diversity for assignment and professional development. The increasing complexity
of the technical skills required will mandate that some officers attend ACS or TWI. officer development will continue
to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments. Self-development continues to be an essential
component of officer development.
g. Separate. FA 57 officers separate from the Army in accordance with applicable regulatory guidance.
34–8. Simulation Operations Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. RC describes both the ARNG and USAR and, unless otherwise indicated, references
to the RC are applicable to both. RC Simulation Operations officer development objectives are to follow the Active
Army officer development pattern as closely as possible. However, the unique nature of the RC Soldier’s role as a
citizen-Soldier poses a significant challenge for professional development. Due to the complexity and detailed understanding of Army systems and functions required to serve effectively in this FA, junior officers must develop a strong
foundation through assignments in their basic branch before FA specialization begins (see chap 7 for more guidance on
RC officer development).
b. Assignment opportunities. RC Simulation Operations officers can expect assignment opportunities that mirror
those of Active Army officers as well as those positions applicable exclusively to the RC. The success of an RC
Simulation Operations officer is not measured by length of Service in any one component or control group, but by the
officer’s breadth of experience, duty performance, and adherence to FA requirements. Simulation Operations assignments for the ARNG are MTOE while USAR are primarily TDA or TPU within Battle Command training divisions;
there are limited amount of positions for AGR and Drilling Individual Mobilization Augmentee (DIMA) personnel.
Civilian acquired skills, advanced military and civilian education, and demonstrated abilities to function in a simulation
environment are highly desirable for assignment to any RC FA 57 position.
c. FA qualification and development opportunities.
(1) The unique nature of the RC Soldier’s role as a citizen Soldier poses a challenge for professional development.
RC officers are expected to follow Active Army officers development patterns as closely as possible, except that RC
officers have increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. To meet professional development
objectives, RC officers must be willing to rotate between ARNG and USAR TPU, IRR, IMA program, and the AGR
programs. These transfers are necessitated by geographical considerations, as well as the need to provide as many
officers as possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions. Additionally, there may be
occasions when RC officers will be transferred to the IRR while they complete mandatory educations requirements.
Such transfers will be temporary and should not be seen as impacting negatively on the officer’s career.
(2) RC FA 57 officers assigned to these positions must continually develop their knowledge and analytical skills.
RC officers awarded FA 57 will be offered the opportunity to pursue continuing education opportunities (civilian and
military), and Government internship programs.
(a) Lieutenant. NA
(b) Captain. NA
(c) Major. Successfully complete the CCC and not less than 50 percent common core ILE course. Assignments
could include Simulation Training officer and Operations officer positions within Battle Projection groups. Upon
assignments to a FA 57 position, the Simulation Operations QC must be completed, if not previously completed and
serve in a FA 57 position for twelve months. In addition, officers should strive to obtain ACS compatible with FA 57
position requirements.
(d) Lieutenant colonel. Successfully complete Command and General Staff College and common core ILE course.
Must complete the Simulation Operations QC if not previously complete and serve in a FA 57 position for twenty-four
months. Should strive to complete the SSC and obtain ACS compatible with FA 57 position requirements.
(e) Colonel. All FA 57 officers selected for colonel should be enrolled or apply for the SSC non-resident course if
not selected for the resident course. Colonels should attend the Simulation Operations QC. The professional development objective for colonels is greater contribution to the FA and the Army
d. Simulation Operations FA life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for FA 57 is
shown in figure 34–2, below.

Chapter 35
Logistics Corps Officer Branches
35–1. Introduction to the Logistics Corps
The Logistics Corps consists of Soldiers (officers, WOs, and enlisted) in four logistics branches: Ordnance, Quartermaster, Transportation, and Logistics (LG). This chapter explains how logistics officers are accessed, assigned, and
professionally developed, as well as describes the skills, knowledge, and attributes needed for all four logistics officer
branches to succeed in today’s Army as logistics pentathletes. Previous versions of DA Pam 600–3 listed the Ordnance,
Quartermaster, and Transportation branches and FA 90 (multifunctional logistician) as separate chapters.
a. History and background. In 1993, FA 90 was created within the operations CF in order to support the
development of multifunctional logisticians. Since then, FA 90 designation has been used to signify officers skilled
across the functional branches. In 2005, as part of an OPMS review, an effort was undertaken to examine how to
further advance the notion of multi-skilled logistics leaders. The result was the creation of a LG Branch for officers in
the grade of captain through colonel and the formal recognition of a “Logistics Officer Corps” as approved by the
Army Chief of Staff in May 2006.

306

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

b. Logistics Officer Corps concept. “Logistics Officer Corps” is the term used to describe all officers (commissioned
and warrant) who hold a branch or military occupational specialty (MOS) within the Logistics Corps. Commissioned
officers accessed as lieutenants into one of the three Logistics Corps functional branches (Ordnance, Quartermaster,
Transportation) will develop functional logistics skills in their assigned functional branch for the first 3–4 years of their
careers. Upon promotion to captain and successful completion of the Combined Logistics Captains Career Course
(CLC3), these officers will be inducted into the Logistics Branch (LG). Their original functional branch (Ordnance,
Quartermaster, Transportation) will, unless they indicate preference otherwise, become the secondary area of concentration (AOC) and will qualify them for functional assignments into positions calling for that specific functional expertise.
Officers will continue to be associated with the Ordnance, Quartermaster, or Transportation regiments based on their
secondary AOC. Each officer will maintain proficiency in their secondary AOC through periodic developmental
assignments, continued military education, and self-development. In general, officers in the grades of captain through
colonel will be multifunctionally focused as opposed to functionally focused. Having primacy as a multifunctional
logistician and at the same time holding a particular FA of expertise will allow logisticians to operate successfully at
all levels. As the Logistics Corps technical experts, WOs will only have functional specialties. All four Logistics Corps
officer branches are in the force sustainment functional category.

c. End state. The Army expects its logistics officers in the grades of captain through colonel to be, first and
foremost, multifunctionally educated, skilled, and experienced. Logistics officers will be able to pursue any FA of
expertise regardless of the basic branch into which they were accessed, based on the needs of the Army. Command
opportunity will be greatest in multifunctional units.
d. Chapter organization. This chapter is organized into an introductory section and four branch sections. The
Commanding General, U.S. Army Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM) is the proponent for this chapter
and the LG Branch section. The Ordnance, Quartermaster, and Transportation Branch proponents are responsible for
their particular sections within this chapter. Functional branch officer training and development will be covered in
sections II, III and IV. LG Branch training and development for captains through colonels will be covered in section V.
Logistics Corps officer requirements, assignments, and life cycle initiatives will be covered in section VI. RC
development will be covered in all four sections.
35–2. The Ordnance Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Ordnance Branch. If the Army drives it, shoots it, loads it, speaks into it, picks it up,
recovers it, welds it, arms it, and renders it safe, there is an Ordnance Soldier involved. The Ordnance Branch consists
of 119,000 Soldiers with 36 enlisted MOSs, 9 WO specialties and 2 officer AOCs. Ordnance Soldiers are found in
every Army unit, whether infantry, armor, aviation, and so on that arms and fixes Army weapons and equipment.
b. Unique functions performed by the Ordnance Branch. Ordnance officer functionalities exist at all levels of the
Army from platoon and detachment to DA staff to sustain the life cycle of the Army’s materiel from cradle to grave
and protect the Army’s forces through the following explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) operations:
(1) Maintenance manager at company, battalion, squadron, group, regiment, brigade, division, corps HQ, or theater
sustainment command.
(2) Course developer, Service school instructor, and/or action officer in combat developments involved in planning
and development of doctrine, organizations, and equipment required to support Army weapon systems and EOD
operations.
(3) Commander, staff officer, XO, materiel officer, ammunition officer, EOD officer, maintenance officer, support
operations officer, or platoon leader of a unit or activity in support of tank/automotive, missile/electronics, or munitions
materiel.
(4) Observer/controller at a combat training center (NTC, JRTC, CATC, or BCTP) and advisors to USAR and
ARNG organizations.
(5) Army or Joint staff maintenance, ammunition, and EOD staff officer.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(6) Ammunition depot commanders.
c. Unique features of work in the Ordnance Branch. Life cycle management offers a unique perspective to the
Ordnance officer. Responsibilities include developing, testing, fielding, maintaining, and disposing Army’s materiel.
When sustaining the life cycle of the Army’s materiel or protecting the Army’s forces through EOD operations,
officers will serve with a variety of personnel from Soldiers to civilians and from other Services and nations. Required
officer characteristics (skills, knowledge, and attributes).
d. Competencies and actions. Ordnance Branch maintains three core competencies; maintenance, ammunition, and
EOD. All AOCs and the skill identifiers are open to male and female officers.
e. Unique skills. Officers work in one of two AOCs that cover the three core competencies. The 91A officer works
in maintenance and ammunition; the 89E officer works in EOD. WOs work in one of nine MOSs.
(1) Materiel maintenance and munitions management (AOC 91A). Officers working in this AOC manage Ordnance
Soldiers and the Army maintenance process that ensures weapon systems are operational, ready, and available. Officers
are responsible for integrated maintenance and repair parts supply support of Army conventional weapon systems,
small arms, artillery, fire control equipment, missile systems, and their associated ground support equipment; electronics; track and wheel vehicles; and engineer and power generation equipment. Maintenance functions include metalworking, fabrication, welding, inspection, test, Service, calibration, repair, overhaul, and reclamation. They will also be
involved in the Army’s test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment (TMDE) program. Duty positions require a
comprehensive knowledge of maintenance management techniques and integrated logistics support. Officers must be
technically competent in production control and quality assurance techniques. The technical sophistication of today’s
Army weapon systems; the high dollar cost of production, fielding, and maintaining; and their tactical importance
require officers with the highest managerial and leadership skills. Officers also participate in the management of the
Army’s munitions inventory. These officers lead, manage, plan, and direct ammunition supply, storage, transportation,
maintenance, surveillance, inspection, stock control, safety, and security, including maintenance of associated test and
handling equipment. The increasing technical sophistication of the various munitions in the Army’s inventory, along
with the rapid expenditures of ammunition across the force, requires officers to be closely involved in managing the
precious ammunition commodity that the Army uses and trusts these officers to provide for the fight.
(2) EOD (AOC 89E).
(a) Officers must volunteer to become qualified for EOD. All Logistics officers are eligible to apply for EOD. There
are two opportunities to enter into the EOD field; after completion of Ordnance Basic Officer Leader Course III
(BOLC III) or CLC3. Procedures for volunteering are located at ATRRS online and in AR 611–105. Officers must
complete an intense two-phased EOD course prior to being awarded this designation. EOD Phase I is conducted at
Redstone Arsenal, AL, and EOD Phase II is at the Joint EOD course, at Eglin Air Force Base, FL. Upon completion of
EOD training, the officer will be affiliated with the Ordnance Regiment.
(b) EOD officers provide a unique and critical Service to the Army, U.S. Federal agencies, and local law enforcement and inherently operate within the full spectrum of JIIM operations. EOD officers plan, develop, and integrate
EOD operations for all types of contingency operations. These officers advise, integrate, and execute the render safe
operations of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive ordnance disposal (CBRNE) functions stemming from threats posed by unexploded ordnance (UXO), improvised explosive devices (IED), and WMD. These
officers lead, manage, plan, and direct activities and organizations concerned with identification, location, rendering
safe, handling, removal, and disposal of U.S. and foreign unexploded conventional, nuclear, and chemical munitions
and IEDs. Additionally, EOD officers provide support/protection to the President of the United States, senior American
officials, military and foreign dignitaries, and support intelligence activities through analysis of foreign munitions,
technical and biometric exploitation of IEDs, and perform the forensic analysis of post-blast explosive materials.
(3) Ammunition WOr (MOS 890A). Manage, supervise, and coordinate the receipt, storage, issue, surveillance
testing, maintenance, modification, destruction, and demilitarization of conventional ammunition, to include missile,
missile explosive components, and non-nuclear explosive items. They investigate and analyze conventional ammunition
accidents, failures, and malfunctions.
(4) Armament systems maintenance WO (MOS 913A). Manage, supervise, and coordinate the maintenance and repair
of small arms, forward Field Artillery pieces, and armor weapon systems to include tank turret, electronic, electrical,
hydraulic, fire control, and instrument systems repair. This MOS is merged with 915E at the CW5 level.
(5) Allied trades WO (MOS 914A). Manage, supervise, and coordinate allied trades repair shop maintenance
activities. They direct the fabrication and repair of parts, auto body, frame and hull repairs, vehicle painting, radiator
repairs, auto glass replacement, canvas repairs, and welding, machining, and woodworking shop operations. They also
direct ground vehicle recovery operations and are responsible for the employment and maintenance of tracked and
wheeled vehicle recovery equipment. This MOS is merged with 915E at the CW5 level.
(6) Automotive maintenance WO (MOS 915A). Manage, supervise, and coordinate the maintenance of wheeled and

merged with 915E at the CW5 level.
f. Unique knowledge. Ordnance officers are first and always warfighters, technically proficient with Ordnance
competencies and mission-unique equipment, tools, and systems. Mission success requires the proper balance between
technical skills and the ability to apply appropriate tactical skills at the right moment. These skills must be gained and
developed through multiple operational assignments and continuous professional study and self-development. Ordnance
skills and competencies are required everywhere on a nonlinear, noncontiguous battlefield. While operating in this
environment, Ordnance officers must negotiate asymmetric threats to accomplish the ongoing mission.
g. Unique attributes. Ordnance officers work in environments where time or problem analysis is seriously constrained and sound decisions are urgent. Knowledge and skills gained in this environment will vary in its completeness
and ambiguity. Logistics and the sustainment of forces under duress of combat require the ability to operate under
stress, make decisions, and act in austere field conditions to generate mission success. Ordnance officers need to set the
foundation of understanding the science and doctrine of Ordnance competencies of full spectrum maintenance,
ammunition, and EOD operations and develop the skills and experience to artfully apply the competencies in the fight.
Also, in the application of Ordnance competencies, officers must conduct and lead organizations based on Army
Values. These values appear as Army doctrine and most are familiar with the words; however, these values must be
internalized and part of the officer’s consciousness. A strong sense of Army Values helps Soldiers adapt to changing
environments. Critical officer developmental assignments The goal of professional development of Ordnance officers is
to produce and sustain technical experts in the Ordnance field, who will use this knowledge later on as officers make
the transition to the LG Branch after CLC3. Officers may use the Ordnance Branch training and development model
(see fig 35–1, below) as a guideline for maintaining functional expertise throughout their career.

Figure 35–1. Active Army Ordnance Developmental Model

(1) Lieutenant. At the grade of lieutenant, officers commonly lead and manage platoons and sections with 40–80
Soldiers in semi-autonomous activities in the fight or in support of the fight. Officers must rapidly set the foundations
for leadership, communicative, management, technical, and tactical skills. Upon graduation from Ordnance BOLC III,
officers should expect to serve at the company level in order to execute Ordnance competencies, such as field and
sustainment maintenance operations, workload management, use of Standard Army Management Information Systems
(STAMIS), requisition, stock control, and flow of repair parts and ammunition, and to dispose of and render safe
unexploded ordnance. lieutenants will serve in one or more of the following positions; platoon leader, XO, ammunition
operations officer, or maintenance control officer. The focus is acquiring and refining troop leading skills, logistics
principles/operations, tactics and administrative skills. Also, when appropriate, complement these competencies with
staff experience at battalion level. Because all initial assignments are important, an officer should be primarily
concerned with manner of performance, development of professional attributes, enthusiasm for the job, and demonstration of potential.
(2) Captain. At this level the privilege is extended to command troops. Along with command, captains continue to
gain an in-depth understanding of the multiple aspects of logistical operations and are more involved with battalionand brigade-level staff operations. Ordnance competencies are resident in the following positions:
(a) Company commander; field maintenance, ammunition, EOD, support maintenance, and component repair.
(b) Multifunctional battalion/brigade staff requiring an ammunition or maintenance officer.
(c) Staff positions in functional ammunition or EOD battalions.

310

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(d) Combat training center maintenance, ammunition, and EOD trainer.
(e) Ordnance or Service school instructors/writers. In order to effectively serve in these positions officers require a
solid foundation of Ordnance functional knowledge. All Ordnance officers should seek opportunities available to them
within the Ordnance competencies. For example, officers who have worked ammunition should seek opportunities in
maintenance positions.
h. Major. majors continue their self-development efforts to become an expert in all aspects of logistics and the
application of Ordnance competencies to include application within the context of JIIM operations. The goal for
officers is to increase their span of Ordnance knowledge as well as how to support combined arms and Joint logistics
operations. Self-development should include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training.
Officers should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their warfighting perspective. Ordnance
competencies are embodied in the experience of the following positions:
(1) Primary staff in an ammunition battalion or EOD battalion/group.
(2) Corps and theater ammunition officer, support operations officer/materiel officer (MATO), sustainment command materiel readiness branch, ammunition materiel management officer.
(3) Senior observer/controller, maintenance, ammunition, or EOD positions, or major-level commands.
(4) Staff requiring ammunition or maintenance officer; division, corps, Joint-level commands.
(5) Command and General Staff College (CGSC) faculty and staff, Ordnance or Service school instructor, or RC
maintenance and ammunition support evaluators.
i. Lieutenant colonel. The spectrum of possible assignments at this level and above is large, and these assignments
can be characterized as highly responsible and important and require mature, skilled, and well-grounded officers.
Critical Ordnance competencies are found in the following assignments:
(1) Commander of a functional ammunition or EOD battalion.
(2) Staff requiring ammunition, maintenance, EOD expertise; theater sustainment, HQDA/DOD/Joint.
(3) Commander of ammunition plant/depot.
(4) Ordnance schools battalion commander or training director.
j. Colonel. Critical Ordnance competencies are found in the following assignments:
(1) Commander of an EOD group, depot, Ordnance training brigade.
(2) Maintenance, ammunition, EOD coordinators at echelons above corps, such as the Joint/DOD/ Army Staff.
(3) Selected positions in the Ordnance school or combined arms support command.
(4) Selected positions within the U.S Army Materiel Command (AMC).
k. Critical WO developmental assignments. Ordnance WOs must meet certain standards in terms of professional
development and operational assignments to evolve as a well-rounded senior WO within their specialty. Meeting these
standards ensures the WO has acquired the skills, knowledge, and attributes to remain proficient in their specialty and
serve at all levels within the Army. The Warrant Officer Education System (WOES) requires specific training designed
to prepare WOs for competitive positions of greater responsibility to serve at all levels in the Army. Ordnance Branch
requires WOs who are skilled technicians in their specialty. Every WO learns and trains to be a well-rounded
logistician while gaining expertise in their specialty through progressive levels of assignments. The WO developmental
model is shown at figure 35–2, below, for MOSs 913A, 914A, 919A, 915A, and 915E and figure 35–3, below, for
MOSs 890A, 948B, 948D, and 948E.

(1) WO1 and CW2. After completing the Warrant Officer Candidate Course (WOCC), WO1s attend their MOS
Warrant Officer Basic Course (WOBC). Appointment to WO1 is contingent upon successfully completing the WOBC
for the officer’s respective MOS. WO1 and CW2s are junior-level tactical and technical experts who should expect to
serve at the TOE platoon, company, and battalion level, with some brigade and higher level support positions in the
following type units; forward support company, maintenance section/company (brigade troops battalion, brigade
support battalion, engineer company/battalion, CSSB), Patriot/Avenger support teams, ammunition transfer holding
detachment, modular ammunition company (heavy or light), Ordnance company ammunition/maintenance and/or Signal
company/battalion. The type of assignment is MOS dependant and gives the junior Ordnance WO a solid base of
experience, depth, and breadth on systems and processes that ultimately prepares them for assignments at the higher
levels. The junior WO should focus on acquiring and refining tactical and administrative skills as well as MOS-unique
technical skills. WOs should devote time to self-development, which should include correspondence courses, institutional training, and civilian education. Junior WOs should utilize a professional reading program to broaden both their
warfighting perspective and technical comprehension. Upon promotion to CW2, the WO will be eligible to attend the
Warrant Officer Advanced Course (WOAC) and must attend their MOS WOAC not later than 1 year after promotion
to CW3. CW2s can expect assignment to CW3 positions, but attend their MOS WOAC prior to assignment. Although
not a requirement for promotion, all officers in the grade of WO1 and CW2 should set as a goal the completion of an
associate’s degree. Successful completion of every duty assignment is important and will determine promotion
potential.
(2) CW3. Upon promotion to CW3, the WO will be eligible to attend the Warrant Officer Staff Course (WOSC) and

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

313

must attend the WOSC not later than 1 year after promotion to CW4. All officers in the grade of CW3 are advanced
level tactical and technical experts who normally serve as the senior WO in TOE platoon-, company-, battalion-, and
brigade-level positions in the following type units; ammunition transfer holding detachment, sustainment brigade/
sustainment command distribution management center, forward support company, maintenance section/company (brigade support battalion, engineer company/battalion/brigade, CSSB), Ordnance company missile and/or Signal company/battalion, component repair platoon. The type of assignment is MOS dependant. CW3s at this level should provide
leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs, WOs, and officers and advice to commanders on
Ordnance technical and WO issues. In addition, WOs may serve in TDA units in supervisory, advisory, and training
positions that are MOS-specific. CW3s can expect assignment to CW4 positions, but attend the WOSC prior to
assignment. CW3s should continue to acquire and refine advanced technical and administrative skills as well as MOSunique technical skills. Although not a requirement for promotion, all officers in the grade of CW3 should set as a goal
the completion of a baccalaureate degree.
(3) CW4. Upon promotion to CW4, the WO will be eligible to attend the Warrant Officer Senior Staff Course
(WOSSC) and must attend the WOSSC not later than 1 year after promotion to CW5. CW4s are senior-level tactical
and technical experts who should expect to serve in the sustainment brigade/sustainment command Distribution
Management Center; logistics support test, measurement, diagnostic evaluation (branch, detachment, company, activity); maintenance control section or maintenance section (Ordnance, maintenance, support, supply company); brigade
support battalion; Ordnance battalion; Service school; branch proponency; or CASCOM. CW4s may serve in supervisory, advisory, staff, and logistics positions in the theater army, AMC, Army Staff or separate operating agency, and
MOS non-specific positions. CW4s should continue acquiring and refining advanced technical and administrative skills
as well as MOS-unique technical skills. CW4s at this level should provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and
counsel to NCOs, WOs, and branch officers. CW4s have special mentorship responsibilities for other WOs and provide
essential advice to commanders on Ordnance technical and WO issues.
(4) CW5. Ordnance CW5s should complete the Warrant Officer Senior Staff Course (WOSSC) not later than 1 year
after promotion to CW5. CW5s are master-level tactical and technical experts who serve in senior supervisory,
advisory, staff, and logistics positions in brigade and higher level units, AMC, NGB, USARC, ARNG Joint staffs,
USAR RRCs, or Army Staff or separate operating agency. CW5s may serve in positions that are MOS non-specific.
CW5s at this level should provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs, WOs, and branch
officers. CW5s have special mentorship responsibilities for other WOs at all levels and are responsible for providing
essential advice to commanders on Ordnance technical and WO issues. CW5s should sharpen their knowledge of
personnel force integration functions for doctrine, training, and personnel as pertains to the Ordnance Branch. CW5s
should become familiar with the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory basis for the force projection Army and the
capabilities that must be sustained through management of doctrinal, organizational, and materiel change. CW5s must
become familiar with Army organizational roles, functions, and missions, especially at the ACOM and Army staff level
and with the force management processes, from the determination of force requirements through to the resourcing of
requirements and the assessment of their utilization in order to accomplish Army functions and missions in a Joint/
combined environment.
35–3. Ordnance Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. RC Ordnance officer development objectives and qualifications basically parallel
those planned for their Active Army counterparts, with the difference being the RC TIS/TIG requirements. Junior
officers must develop a strong foundation through assignments in their branch before specialization begins.
b. KD opportunities. Even though RC officers are limited by geographical considerations, they should strive for an
initial assignment within the Ordnance competencies of ammunition, maintenance, and, when possible, EOD. The RC
Ordnance officer training and development model is shown at figure 35–4, below.

314

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Figure 35–4. RC Ordnance Developmental Model

(1) Lieutenant. At the grade of lieutenant, the officer should concentrate on developing leadership abilities and
communicative, management, technical, and tactical skills. This is the stage where officers develop their basic
foundation for the rest of their careers. If there is a limited leadership opportunity available within the Ordnance
competencies in an officer’s initial assignment, the officer should strive to seek to increase logistics knowledge within
the Transportation or Quartermaster competencies and pursue an Ordnance-related position when available as a followon assignment. In all assignments, lieutenants should concentrate on learning the basics of how the Army works, how
to lead Soldiers, and how to maintain a motivated and positive outlook.
(a) During the second lieutenant years, RC officers are required to complete Ordnance BOLC III and complete a
bachelor’s degree. Second lieutenants should strive to become technical and tactical experts by training with the WOs
and senior enlisted Soldiers in their units. Second lieutenants must learn the intricacies of how to best lead and take
care of troops to support their commands and manage the maintenance process, such as manage work order flow,
common equipment failures and repair, repair parts management, and tracking work orders and parts status through
automated systems.
(b) During the first lieutenant years, the focus is on acquiring and refining troop-leading skills, Ordnance competencies, coordination abilities, and increasing logistics and administrative skills. Typical positions may include, but
are not limited to, platoon leader, maintenance control officer, company XO or detachment commander. Within 2 years
of consideration for promotion to captain, RC officers should enroll and begin the RC CCC (Ordnance) and continue to
hone troop leading procedures. Because all initial assignments are important, an officer should be primarily concerned
with manner of performance, development of professional attributes, enthusiasm for the job, and demonstration of

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

315

potential. Before promotion to captain, officers should possess an excellent knowledge of the Ordnance competencies
and have basic knowledge of other logistics competencies.
(c) Branch Transfer. lieutenants that have completed other than Ordnance BOLC III must take the Ordnance Officer
Branch Qualification Course, available on line on the Army distributed learning Web site. Student assistance; students
need to go to the Army Training Support Center (ATSC)/TRADOC Educational Data System-Redesign (TREDS–R)
Web site at Fort Eustis, VA, URL, https://www.aimsrdl.atsc.army.mil/secured/accp_top.htm, which gives them the
ability to access their active and history data and update their personal data, thus, ensuring they receive all materials for
the course.
(2) Captain. Emphasis begins at the grade of captain on achieving KD assignments, such as the privilege of
commanding troops. Throughout this period, the officer continues to develop leadership, tactical, technical, and
management skills. This foundation of knowledge is required to effectively serve as a leader at the company and
battalion level. Captains gain a working knowledge of command principles, battalion-level staff operations, and
logistical operations at the battalion to brigade levels.
(a) For promotion to the rank of captain, a bachelor’s degree is required. Officers will complete the RC CCC
(Ordnance). Additionally, it is recommended they complete the Support Operations Course (SOC) to prepare captains
for the transition into the Logistics (LG) Branch. Prior to enrolling in ILE, officers must complete the combined arms
exercise (CAX). CAX prepares officers for staff duties at the battalion or higher levels.
(b) Captains should seek the responsibility of commanding troops. When not in command, typically captains will
occupy assignments as battalion staff officers, battalion-level primary staff officers, training division staff officers,
JFHQ staff officers, or school instructors.
(c) Captains should continue to gain an in-depth understanding of logistics operations and become proficient in other
Ordnance competencies, if they have not the opportunity to do so. The Associate Logistics Executive Development
Course (ALEDC), advanced maintenance or supply courses, Support Operations Course Phase I and II, or an advanced
degree in engineering, physical science, business, or logistics management all contribute to the Ordnance officer’s
professional development. However, job performance, completion of KD assignment requirements, and logistics
experience are required to prepare the officer for advancement to the next grade.
(3) Major. At the grade of major, an officer is focused on developing upper level staff skills, completing KD
assignments, and successfully completing the ILE course. Majors must complete at least 50 percent of ILE before they
will be considered eligible for promotion to lieutenant colonel. Majors should seek multifunctional logistics battalion
XO, S3, materiel management officer, support operations officer, materiel officer, and brigade S4 positions. Majors
should continue self-development efforts to become expert in Ordnance competencies and other logistics competencies
and understanding of Joint and combined operations. Self-development should include correspondence courses, civilian
education, and institutional training. Officers should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their
warfighting perspective.
(4) Lieutenant colonel. At the grade of lieutenant colonel, an officer’s career reaches the full utilization stage.
Emphasis is placed on an officer successfully completing lieutenant colonel-level command and/or serving in key
multifunctional logistics headquarters staff positions. Lieutenant colonel career objectives:
(a) Complete a pre-command course (PCC) when selected for battalion command.
(b) Key assignments include battalion commander of a multifunctional logistics, ammunition, or EOD battalion; key
staff in sustainment brigades; maintenance division chief at USAR command headquarters; Joint staff in a state
command; director for maintenance at area readiness support groups; deputy assistant chief of staff materiel; materiel
maintenance officer; plans officer at a materiel management center; or maintenance evaluation team leader at a training
division.
(c) Officers should complete resident RC or advanced distributed learning (ADL) ILE. Officers should further their
military education by enrolling in courses like the RC National Security Course.
(5) Colonel. At the grade of colonel, officers reach the maximum utilization period of their career. Such officers
should have a broad background in Ordnance and logistics with highly developed skills in materiel management.
Colonel career objectives include the following: complete a PCC for group/brigade if selected for command, successfully complete colonel-level command of a group or activity, serve on general staff, serve as assistant chief of staff for
materiel or operations at a support command, and attend Senior Service College (SSC) or enroll in the Army War
College (AWC) Distance Education Course. Completion of ILE is a requirement for promotion to colonel.
c. Branch transfer. Officers who wish to branch transfer at the rank of captain–colonel who have already completed
a non-logistics CCC must transfer into the LG Branch (see para 35–10, below). Officers who wish to hold an Ordnance
AOC within the LG Branch must take the Ordnance Officer Branch Qualification Course, available on line on the
Army distributed learning Web site. Student assistance; students need to go to the ATSC/TREDS–R Web site at Fort
Eustis, VA, URL, https://www.aimsrdl.atsc.army.mil/secured/accp_top.htm, which gives them the ability to access their
active and history data and update their personal data, thus, ensuring they receive all materials for the course.

35–4. The Quartermaster Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Quartermaster Branch. Quartermaster Soldiers have a proud legacy of sustaining Soldiers
since 1775 and Quartermasters are the Army’s logistics warriors who provide supply and Service support to America’s
forces anywhere in the world at anytime. Quartermasters are key to generating combat ready units. Combat readiness is
achieved with logistical readiness; the timely delivery of serviceable materiel and sufficient resources with the systems
to sustain operations on a fluid battlefield is critical to generating the capabilities to fight and win the Joint fight. The
officers, WOs, and enlisted Soldiers of the Quartermaster Branch sustain military operations by providing timely
supply support, field services, aerial delivery support, materiel, and distribution management. They are responsible for
doctrine, training, and professional development of Active Army, RC, civilian personnel, other Services and allies in
U.S. Army Quartermaster skill areas. Quartermasters, combined with logistics warriors from Ordnance and Transportation, are the key to sustaining Soldiers, directing logistics plans, and operations across the entire operational spectrum
of conflict.
b. Unique functions performed by the Quartermaster Branch. The primary functions of the Quartermaster Branch is
to provide general supply support, field services, mortuary affairs, petroleum and water support, supply distribution
management, subsistence, and logistics sustainment at the right time, place, and quantity to support Soldiers, their units,
and systems across the entire spectrum of conflict. Functions include the following tasks:
(1) Command and control, manage, estimate, and supervise activities of Army and Joint logistics units and
organizations engaged in the requisition, receipt, storage, preservation, distribution and issue of equipment, repair parts,

318

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

maps, fortification and construction materiel, subsistence, petroleum products, water, and other general supplies
(excluding procurement of ammunition, medical, and the management of cryptographic material).
(2) Command and control, manage, supervise airdrop and airdrop equipment maintenance activities that store, repair,
maintain, distribute, and dispose of air items, pack parachutes, and prepare supplies for sling load or aerial delivery.

(11) Command and control, manage, and supervise the development of DOTMLPF for the Quartermaster mission
area.
(12) Command and control, manage, supervise, and instruct Quartermaster skills at Service schools, Service colleges, pre-commissioning programs, and combat training centers.
(13) Command and control, manage, and supervise as Quartermaster advisors to USAR and ARNG organizations.
USAR/ARNG officers also serve as liaisons to ARCOMs Active Army organizations.
c. Unique features of work in Quartermaster Branch. Quartermaster officers find themselves serving in both
operational and generating force structures. They also serve in command/staff positions in multifunctional logistics
units. Quartermaster Branch functions are performed by company and field-grade officers at all levels of command and
staff positions. Required officer characteristics (skills, knowledge, and attributes).
d. Competencies and actions.
(1) Quartermaster officers must be highly qualified, tactically and operationally oriented professionals who provide
seamless logistical support in combat and other missions. Quartermaster officers must be warrior logisticians skilled in
warfighting tactics, techniques, and procedures; possess strong Army Values; and be technically competent in Quartermaster functions. They must be strong leaders with the skills and attributes necessary to assure success in a dynamic,
complex, and often hostile environment. Quartermaster officers are builders of leaders and teams focused on the
profession of military logistics. A Quartermaster officer is a lifelong learner dedicated to obtaining and building
throughout a career on the unique skills and knowledge of supply distribution, fuel, water, subsistence, aerial delivery,
field services, and mortuary affairs. These functions set the foundation for the Quartermaster officer to build upon as
they move from functional assignments to multifunctional assignments. Every officer learns and trains to be a wellrounded logistician, gaining expertise and experience in diverse specialties and skills. This section describes the skills,
knowledge, and attributes required by the Quartermaster officer in order to successfully transition the Quartermaster
officer to the LG Branch after CLC3.
(2) Quartermaster WOs are expert technicians who manage and maintain the Army’s property accounting systems,
supply accounting systems, airdrop support systems, food Service programs, petroleum, and water systems. They are
self-aware and adaptive Quartermaster technical experts, leaders, trainers, and advisors. Through progressive levels of
expertise in assignments, training, and education, Quartermaster WOs administer, manage, maintain, operate, and
integrate Quartermaster systems and equipment across the Army at all levels. Quartermaster WOs are innovative
integrators of emerging logistical technologies, dynamic teachers, confident warfighters, and developers of specialized
teams of Soldiers. All AOCs and the skill identifiers are open to male and female officers.
e. Unique skills. Officers serve in one of three AOCs and one SI. WOs serve in one of five MOSs. Officers gain and
develop these skills through multiple operational assignments and continuous professional study and self-development.
(1) Quartermaster, supply and materiel management (AOC 92A). The officer commands, directs, plans, and/or
manages units engaged in the production, acquisition, receipt, storage, issue, and distribution of equipment, repair parts,
fortifications, and construction material, to include tactical distribution of fuel, water, and general supplies. The officer
serves as the focal point for property management and accountability procedures.
(2) Aerial delivery and materiel (AOC 92D). The officer commands, directs, plans, and/or manages units engaged in
storage, packing, preparation, and delivery of materiel by air drop means. The officer determines requirements for and
plans the employment of aerial delivery systems in support of tactical and special operations.
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

319

(3) Petroleum and water (AOC 92F). The officer commands, directs, plans, and/or manages units or activities
engaged in petroleum and water operations. The officer directs acquisition, storage, inspection, testing, issue, and
distribution of petroleum products and purification, storage, testing, and distribution of water.
(4) Mortuary affairs (SI 4V). The officer commands, directs, plans, and or manages mortuary affairs support
including search, recovery, tentative identification, and evacuation of deceased personnel, collection, and disposition of
personal effects of decedents.
(5) Logistics management officer (MOS 920A). The WO supervises and manages the Army’s organizational property
accounting systems at all levels. The officer monitors and evaluates subordinate supply operations while performing
financial inventory accounting and advice to commanders on proper property accounting procedures.
(6) Materiel management officer (MOS 920B). The WO manages the requisition, receipt, storage, and distribution of
supplies and equipment at direct, general, or installation supply support activities (SSA). The WO plans stockage levels
and controls the management of operational float stocks.
(7) Airdrop systems technician (MOS 921A). The WO manages the Army’s airdrop and airdrop equipment maintenance activities. The WO supervises the inspection and packing of parachutes and ensures that unserviceable, nonrepairable, and overage parachutes are retired from the inventory.
(8) Food service technician (MOS 922A). The WO manages the Army Food Service Program, advises the commander on all matters relating to nutrition, food preparation, service, accountability, and sanitation.
(9) Petroleum systems technician (MOS 923A). The WO supervises the acquisition, storage, inspection, testing,
issue, and distribution of petroleum products and/or water and petroleum and water storage and distribution equipment.
f. Unique knowledge. Quartermaster officers must be warfighters who are technically proficient with Quartermaster
equipment and tools, and certain STAMIS systems, such as property book-unit supply enhanced (PBUSE). Quartermaster mission success requires the proper balance between these technical skills and the ability to understand and apply
the appropriate tactical skills at the right moment.
g. Unique attributes. Quartermaster officers often work in an environment where time available for problem analysis
is seriously constrained but where sound timely decisions are urgent. Information gained in this environment will vary
in its completeness and ambiguity. An ability to operate under stress, make decisions, and act in austere field
conditions is critical to mission success. Quartermaster officers are functional, supply-oriented logisticians capable of
developing their skills and experiences in the diverse profession of multifunctional military logistics. They support
victory by living the Army Values and enforcing high standards of training, physical fitness, and discipline. They are
warfighters extremely well versed in doctrine. However, they are also adaptable to changing environments and can
update logistics estimates and apply non-text book solutions to unique situations during full-spectrum operations. The
dynamics associated with training and operational missions require a sense of ingenuity, foresight, stamina, and
sustained physical endurance. These standards require officers to know and routinely execute drills and operate within
established SOPs. Critical officer developmental assignments Officers must meet certain requirements in terms of
schooling and operational assignments to be proficient at each grade. These requirements are met through developmental assignments demonstrating the officer has the required skills, knowledge, and attributes in order to remain
competitive for promotion. Each officer, with support from mentors, should develop career goals and clearly articulate
those goals to their assignments officer at AHRC. Always remember that an officer is his or her own best career
manager. By actively participating in the management of career decisions, officers will improve the likelihood of a
successful career. Officers may use the Quartermaster Branch training and development model (see fig 35–7, below) as
a guideline for maintaining functional expertise throughout their career.

(1) Lieutenant. Newly accessed officers into the Quartermaster Branch are designated AOC 92A, supply and
materiel management. Quartermaster BOLC III is a functional course designed to train lieutenants on the unique
functions performed by Quartermaster Soldiers. Training focus is on technical supply, materiel management, petroleum,
and water functions of Quartermaster platoons and an introduction to the general functions of logistics. This focus
develops graduates as Quartermaster generalists, capable of filling any Quartermaster lieutenant position (except aerial
delivery positions). Some officers will receive additional entry level training in aerial delivery and materiel (AOC 92D)
and are, by regulation, the only officers who may fill parachute rigger positions. A lieutenant is normally assigned as a
platoon leader, gaining troop leading skills, and developing their functional Quartermaster skills, building a solid
leadership and technical foundation. In addition to platoon leader experience, a lieutenant will compliment their
development as an accountable officer, company executive officer (XO) or battalion level staff officer. These assignments prepare the officer for increased responsibility. In all assignments, lieutenants should concentrate on learning the
basics of how the Army works, how to lead Soldiers, and how to maintain a motivated and positive outlook.
(2) Captain. Company command is considered preferred branch experience. Officers will be eligible for functional
Quartermaster assignments either on staff (as mortuary affairs or petroleum officers) or in command (parachute rigger
or petroleum pipeline company). Officers assigned to these positions will normally have had operational or previous
experience in addition to institutional training in their chosen function. This allows the officer to be most competitive
for future commands in their career.
(3) Major. Majors continue self-development efforts to become experts in all aspects of logistics as well as honing
their chosen functional quartermaster skill. Officers desiring to command Quartermaster functional battalion-level troop

units should have previous Quartermaster Branch or functional assignments, but it is not required. Quartermaster
competencies are evident in the following positions:
(a) Quartermaster battalion XO.
(b) Quartermaster battalion S3.
(c) Quartermaster group/brigade XO.
(d) Quartermaster group S3.
(e) Quartermaster group S4.
(f) Division and corps parachute officer (92D).
(g) POL operations officer (92F).
(h) Joint area petroleum officer (92F). (Completion of a previously preferred assignment is required prior to
assignment to this position.)
(4) Lieutenant colonel. The vast majority of lieutenant colonel positions are multifunctional. However, officers
whose secondary AOC is 92 series may be assigned to functional Quartermaster command and staff positions.
Lieutenant colonels enhance their consideration for future command by having a successful assignment in a battalionlevel command.
(a) Quartermaster battalion commander.
(b) Quartermaster group eXO.
(c) Corps-level functional staff officer (mortuary affairs officer, petroleum officer, and aerial delivery officer).
(d) Service school assignment.
(5) Colonel. Colonels with a secondary 92 series AOC are eligible for Quartermaster functional command and staff
positions.
(a) Commander of the 49th POL group, Fort Lee, VA.
(b) Service school assignment.
(c) Selected positions in the Combined Arms Support Command or AMC.
h. WO development. WOs must meet certain professional developmental standards in terms of schooling and
operational assignments to evolve as a well-rounded senior WO within their specialty. Meeting these standards ensures
the WO has acquired the skills, knowledge, and attributes to remain proficient in their specialty and serve at all levels
within the Army. For a WO to be considered fully trained in the Quartermaster Branch, the WO should be tactically
and technically proficient, be physically fit, and be of the highest moral and ethical character. Recognizing that various
assignments require different strengths, techniques, and backgrounds, an officer’s most important assignment is the
current one and the officer should focus on an outstanding performance in that job assignment. The Quartermaster
Branch requires WOs who are skilled technicians in their specialty. Every WO learns and trains to be a well-rounded
logistician while gaining expertise in their specialty through progressive levels of assignments. The Quartermaster
Branch consists of five MOSs for WOs. All MOSs are open to male and females. Quartermaster WO life cycle
development and utilization is at figure 35–8, below, for MOSs 920A, 920B, 921A, and 922A and figure 35–9, below,
for MOS 923A.

i. MOS qualification.
(1) Basic-level MOS qualification.
(a) Military education. Quartermaster WO1s must continue their professional development and remain competitive
for promotion to CW2. WO1s must successfully complete the Quartermaster WOBC. WOBC provides functional
training in Quartermaster MOSs 920A, 920B, 921A, 922A, and 923A. WOBC also reinforces leadership training while
further developing officership skills. Upon successful completion of WOBC, the WO is certified in their MOS and
given an initial operational assignment commensurate with their rank. WO1s should begin work on the prerequisite
studies for the WOAC. This is an MOS immaterial course administered by the Distributive Education Section of the
Warrant Officer Career Center. Successful completion of this course is a requirement prior to attendance to the resident
Quartermaster WOAC.
(b) Professional development. WO1s can expect assignments at the company and battalion level. These assignments
give the junior Quartermaster WO a solid base of experience, depth, and breadth on systems and processes that
ultimately prepares them for assignments at the brigade and higher levels.
(c) Self-development. Self-development should include correspondence courses, institutional training, and civilian
education. WO1s should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden both their warfighting perspective
and technical comprehension. Civilian education objectives should include working towards obtaining an associates
degree. WO1s who do not possess an associate degree are strongly encouraged to pursue this educational goal.
(2) Advanced-level MOS qualification.

outstanding duty performance in their MOS may apply for a fully-funded advance degree in a discipline directly related
to their specialty. The degree completion program is highly competitive and selection is based upon demonstrated
performance and potential for promotion. Many Quartermaster WOs are also selected to attend the Logistics Executive
Development Course (LEDC) at ALMC, where advanced degrees in procurement and logistics management can be
obtained through ALMC’s Cooperative Degree Program with the Florida Institute of Technology (FIT). Quartermaster
WOs also have the opportunity to participate in the training with industry (TWI) program. The TWI program provides
a WO an opportunity to spend up to 12 months with a civilian industry that provides training in industrial procedures
and practices. The training is designed to enhance knowledge, experience, and perspectives in management and
operational techniques. The TWI program is very competitive and requires the WO to coordinate with the Quartermaster WO career manager at the AHRC.
(4) Master-level MOS qualification.
(a) Military education. Quartermaster CW4s must continue their professional development and remain competitive
for promotion to CW5. Upon selection to or promotion to CW4, the WO will be eligible to attend the Warrant Officer

logistics or business management). CW4s who have not completed a master’s degree are strongly encouraged to
complete this educational goal. CW4s who have a sound educational background and a proven record of outstanding
duty performance in their MOS may apply for a fully-funded advance degree in a discipline directly related to their
specialty. The degree completion program is highly competitive and selection is based on demonstrated performance
and potential for promotion. Many Quartermaster WOs are also selected to attend the LEDC at ALMC, where
advanced degrees in procurement and logistics management can be obtained through ALMC’s Cooperative Degree
Program with the FIT. Quartermaster WOs also have the opportunity to participate in the TWI program. The TWI
program provides a WO an opportunity to spend up to 12 months with a civilian industry that provides training in
industrial procedures and practices. The training is designed to enhance knowledge, experience, and perspectives in

35–5. Quartermaster Branch Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. The Quartermaster RC officer plays an important role in the Quartermaster combat
Service support mission. RC comprises the majority of units and personnel in the Quartermaster Branch. RC Quartermaster officer development objectives and qualifications basically parallel those planned for their Active Army
counterparts.
b. Branch preferred assignments and development opportunities. Even though RC officers are limited by geographical considerations, they should strive for Quartermaster assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as
their Active Army counterparts. Reserve officers commissioned into the Quartermaster Branch are designated AOC
92A, Quartermaster, supply and materiel management, by the Commander, AHRC–St. Louis or The Adjutant General
(TAG) of the state to which assigned for ARNG officers. RC Quartermaster officers may attend specialized courses
relating to various Quartermaster AOCs, such as the Air Delivery and Materiel Officer Course AOC 92D, advanced
petroleum/water management AOC 92F, or the Mortuary Affairs Course for S) 4V. Upon promotion to captain, some
RC Quartermaster officers may be given a 92D or 92F AOC, respectively, by the Commander, AHRC–St. Louis, or by
being assigned to a TPU position in one of these AOCs upon completing the Supply and Service Management Officers
Course (SSMO), Combined Logistics Captains Career Course (CLC3) or the RC CCC (Quartermaster). However, the
vast majority of RC Quartermaster officers are awarded AOC 92A.
c. Professional development. Professional development for RC officers is divided into phases from the grade of
lieutenant to colonel (see fig 35–10, below). These phases are described below.

330

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Figure 35–10. RC Quartermaster Developmental Model

(1) Lieutenant. The initial development of a Quartermaster officer includes the establishment of basic leadership
skills in the areas of communication, management, technical and tactical knowledge, and troop-leading experience.
Officers must complete Quartermaster BOLC within 2 years of initial appointment or completion of college if
commissioned early. Typical assignment positions may include, but are not limited to, platoon leader, supply and
Service officer, company XO, or petroleum officer. If there is a limited leadership opportunity available within the
Quartermaster competencies in an officer’s initial assignment, the officer should strive to seek to increase logistics
knowledge within the Transportation or Ordnance competencies and pursue a Quartermaster-related position when
available as a follow-on assignment. Lieutenants should strive to become technical and tactical experts by training with
the WOs and senior enlisted Soldiers in their units. Within 2 years of consideration for promotion to captain, RC
officers should enroll and begin the RC CCC (Quartermaster) and continue to hone troop leading procedures. Because
all initial assignments are important, an officer should be primarily concerned with manner of performance, development of professional attributes, enthusiasm for the job and demonstration of potential. Before promotion to captain,
officers should possess an excellent knowledge of Quartermaster competencies and have basic knowledge of other
logistics competencies.
(2) Captain. During this phase, an officer requires completion of educational requirements as well as successful
command or time in troop leadership positions. Throughout this phase, the officer continues to develop leadership,
tactical, technical, communication, and management skills. RC officers must attend CLC3 or the RC CCC (Quartermaster) prior to consideration for promotion to the grade of major. Additionally, it is recommended to complete the

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

331

SOC to prepare captains for the transition into the LG Branch. Prior to enrolling in ILE, officers must complete the
CAX. CAX prepares officers for staff duties at the battalion or higher levels.
(3) Major. At the grade of major, focus is on the development of upper-level staff skills and branch competencies.
Majors must complete at least 50 percent of ILE before they will be considered eligible for promotion to lieutenant
colonel. Quartermaster Branch training should be continued through developmental assignments, such as battalion/
brigade/group XO/S3, support operations officer, or Quartermaster staff officer at a sustainment brigade or sustainment
command. In addition to these objectives, officers should further develop their Quartermaster education. The ALEDC,
other ALMC courses, and an advanced degree all contribute to the professional development of a RC Quartermaster
officer.
(4) Lieutenant colonel and colonel. This is the utilization stage in a RC officer’s career. Emphasis is placed on an
officer successfully completing lieutenant colonel- and colonel-level commands as well as serving in key Quartermaster
or multifunctional/logistical staff positions at the division, corps, HQDA, DOD, or Joint staff levels. Officers should
complete a pre-command course when selected for lieutenant colonel or colonel command. In addition, all officers
should strive to complete their military education-level requirements. For lieutenant colonels, completion of ILE is
required for promotion to colonel. Upon promotion to lieutenant colonel, the Chief, Army Reserve, and the Chief,
National Guard Bureau, select RC officers for participation in the AWC Distance Education program. Except through
an established resident program, completion of the AWC Distance Education Course is the only other means by which
an Army officer can receive credit for SSC training.
(5) Branch transfer. Officers who wish to branch transfer at the rank of captain–colonel who have already
completed a non-logistics CCC must transfer into the LG Branch (see para 35–10). Officers who wish to hold a
Quartermaster AOC within the LG Branch must take the SSMO.
(6) RC WOs. RC WO development objectives and qualifications basically parallel those planned for their Active
Army counterparts. Junior WOs must develop a strong foundation through assignment in their branch. Even though
geographical considerations limit some RC WOs, all should strive for Quartermaster assignments that yield the same
developmental opportunities as their Active Army counterparts. The RC life cycle development model for Quartermaster WOs is at figure 35–11, below.

35–6. The Transportation Branch
a. Unique purpose of the Transportation Branch. The Transportation Branch provides the transportation capabilities
that are essential for a CONUS-based power projection Army in support of the National Military Strategy and the
physical capabilities necessary to affect agile maneuver and movement of forces and materiel at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of warfighting. The Transportation Branch consists of officers, WOs, enlisted, and civilian
personnel responsible for the worldwide movement of units, personnel, equipment, and supplies in peace and war. The
Transportation Branch moves critical supplies rapidly, under positive control, through an integrated, transportationbased global distribution system, bypassing routine warehouse/storage functions from the source to the combatant. The
Transportation Branch leverages emerging technologies and thrives on the digitized battlefield. It provides movement
control, in-transit visibility, and directs delivery to deployed forces in a dynamically fluid, nonlinear battlefield. In
terms of logistics support, the current operating environment demands focused logistics that is responsive, flexible, and
precise. Focused logistics will be the fusion of information, logistics, and transportation technologies that provide rapid
crisis response, capable of tracking and shifting assets even while en route, and delivering tailored logistics packages
and sustainment at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of operations. The Transportation Branch is the
“Spearhead of Logistics" because nothing happens until something moves.
b. Unique functions of the Transportation Branch. Functions performed by the Transportation Branch include—
(1) Planning, operating, scheduling, coordinating, supervising, and evaluating all methods of transportation for the
effective movement of units, personnel, equipment, and supplies in a transportation-based, Joint-global defense, and
commercial deployment and distribution systems.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

333

(2) Providing the operational process of synchronizing all elements of the logistics system to deliver the “right
things” to the “right place” at the “right time” to support the geographic combatant commander.
(3) Commanding all types of transportation, movement control, and logistical organizations tasked with controlling
and carrying out personnel, cargo/supply, movement control, or logistical requirements within a geographic area.
(4) Recommending priorities, coordinate tasks, document cargo and/or personnel to be transported, allocate resources, and determine the mode(s) necessary for the optimum utilization of assets and timely mission accomplishment.
(5) Planning, executing, tracking, and controling movements of units, supplies, and sustainment from the source to
the combatant.
(6) Providing theater port opening terminal services for all modes of transportation and stevedoring services at fixed
ports, unimproved beach sites, and during logistics-over-the-shore (LOTS) operations.
(7) Providing highway, rail, marine, and terminal support for Army and JIIM operations.
(8) Providing DOD worldwide, single agency management for military traffic, land transportation, and common-user
ocean terminals.
(9) Developing transportation concepts and doctrine and develop unit organizations and the requirements to support
acquisition of transportation systems for the Army.
(10) Providing training and professional development for DOD, Active Army and RC, and civilian personnel in
transportation and deployment methods.
(11) Providing direct and general maintenance support and supply support for marine and rail equipment.
(12) Providing transportation engineering services.
(13) Playing a key role in the development, procurement, and life cycle management of transportation-related
equipment, systems, and personnel.
c. Unique features of work in the Transportation Branch. The Transportation Branch features work that is not
common to many branches. Transportation Branch officers and WOs may routinely work at any of the three levels of
war; tactical, operational, and strategic. This is not limited to a specific grade; for example, a lieutenant may operate an
Arrival/Departure Airfield Control Group (A/DACG), which can be a Joint operation at both operational and strategic
levels. Transportation officers will find themselves working in Joint environments or participating in Joint operations
far more frequently than other branches. Required officer characteristics (skills, knowledge, and attributes).
d. Competencies and actions. The six core competencies of the Transportation Branch are strategic deployment,
movement control, terminal operations, water transport, highway transport and rail transport. Transportation officers
must be technically proficient with employment of transportation and mission-unique equipment, personnel, and
systems. Transportation officers must understand transportation, supply, and maintenance automated systems. In
addition to working independently, Transportation officers often work in an environment where there is little time
available for problem analysis, but sound and timely decisions are crucial. Transportation Branch mission success
requires the proper balance between technical know-how and the ability to understand and apply the appropriate
tactical expertise at the right moment. Hence, the ability to operate under stress, make decisions, and act under
primitive field conditions is critical to success.
e. Unique skills. Transportation officer skills are found in four AOCs. The Transportation Branch has three different
MOSs within the WO technical fields; marine operations, marine maintenance, and movement control operations.
(1) Transportation general (AOC 88A). Officers command, direct, control, coordinate, manage, or serve in positions
requiring general knowledge of transportation organizations, equipment, and doctrine as well as organizations engaged
in transportation-related services. They develop doctrine, organizations, and equipment for the Transportation Branch.
Officers also serve in positions requiring specialized knowledge of transportation organizations, equipment, and
doctrine as well as branch/functional experience at higher levels of operations and organizations engaged in transportation-related services with the unique capability to plan, coordinate and synchronize the rapid deployment, reception,
staging, onward movement, and integration (RSO&I), sustainment/distribution management and redeployment of forces
in any area of operations. They serve in Joint assignments, manage transportation personnel life cycle functions, and
instruct transportation skills at Service schools, Service colleges, pre-commissioning and commissioning programs, and
CTCs. Transportation officers assist USAR and ARNG transportation organizations. Examples of Transportation
general duty positions are—
(a) Headquarters staff officer.
(b) Instructor.
(c) Proponency officer.
(d) Division transportation officer.
(2) Traffic management (AOC 88B). Officers command, plan, procure, coordinate, and control the movement of
personnel, personal property, and military freight worldwide by military or commercial transport. Examples of
Transportation traffic management duty positions include—
(a) Installation transportation officer (ITO).
(b) Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) commander/staff officer.
(c) Movement control officer (MCO).

334

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(d) Division/Corps transportation officer.
(3) Marine and terminal operations (AOC 88C). Officers command, direct, control, coordinate, manage, or serve in
positions in water transport, marine maintenance, marine terminal, or inland terminal units or organizations. Their
duties encompass the command, control, or management of fixed ports, unimproved ports, and bare-beach facilities; air,
rail, motor, and inland waterway terminal operations; Joint-logistics-over-the-shore (JLOTS) operations; and marine
maintenance and salvage operations. Examples of Transportation marine and terminal operations duty positions are—
(a) Terminal unit commander/XO/staff officer.
(b) Cargo transfer company commander/platoon leader/XO.
(c) Watercraft and causeway unit commander/platoon leader/XO.
(d) Port operations crane company commander/platoon leader/XO.
(e) Floating craft/direct and general maintenance support company commander.
(4) Motor/rail transportation (AOC 88D). All rail units are in the RC. Officers command, direct, control, coordinate,
manage, or serve in positions in motor (truck), rail, truck terminal, or trailer transfer units or organizations. Duties
encompass command, control, management, and utilization of motor assets in support of terminal clearance, inter-, and
intra-zonal motor transport services and operational mobility, truck terminal/trailer transfer points, area support, driveaway, retrograde, container and intermodal operations. Examples of Transportation motor/rail transport duty positions
include—
(a) Motor (truck) transport commander/staff officer/platoon leader/XO.
(b) Rail operations commander/staff officer/platoon leader/XO.
(5) Marine operations (MOS 880A). This MOS has two distinct skill levels of technical training and professional
credentialing; MOS 880A1 and 880A2, marine deck officer. Officers within this MOS command and operate Army
watercraft and watercraft detachments; serve aboard Army watercraft as the commanding officer, master, navigator,
cargo officer or deck watch officer; serve as an Army harbormaster or port operations officer; serve on a battalion-level
staff or higher as an operations officer; or as a Service school instructor.
(6) Marine maintenance (MOS 881A). This MOS has two distinct skill levels of technical training and professional
credentials; MOS 881A1 and 881A2, marine engineering officer. Officers in this MOS command watercraft maintenance detachments and maintain Army watercraft, serve as chief engineer, assistant engineer, or engineering watch
officer; or may serve on a battalion-level staff or higher as a maintenance officer or as a Service school instructor.
(7) Movement control operations (MOS 882A). There is one WO specialty within this MOS; MOS 882A, mobility
officer. The skills and knowledge necessary to qualify for this specialty requires technical expertise to plan, organize,
and supervise the movement, deployment, and redeployment of Army personnel and equipment. They must also be
able to coordinate deployment and redeployment issues with Joint, Army, and commercial agencies as well as provide
technical expertise and guidance on the implementation and use of transportation automation systems. Mobility officers
coordinate and conduct training of unit deployment and redeployment operations. They advise and assist commanders
and staffs on deployment movement, sustainment, maneuver, and redeployment operations. Officers in this MOS may
serve on a battalion-level staff or higher, or as a Service school instructor.
(8) Other key officer skills.
(a) Junior leadership (company grade). Junior Transportation officers work in an extremely fluid and dynamic
environment with a wide variety of personnel and equipment. Since they often work independently with minimum
guidance, supervision or support, creative thinking, and problem solving are critical skills. Officers will encounter
information that varies in completeness and ambiguity. Therefore, it is imperative that Transportation officers can
communicate effectively in both written and verbal forms. Officers should also develop excellent supervisory skills to
ensure proper execution of all assigned tasks and missions. Transportation officers must be tactically proficient and
must attain a mastery of troop leading procedures, unit defense operations, and tactical convoy operations.
(b) Senior leadership (field grade). Even though envisioning may be considered a conceptual skill, it is essentially a
group process and is a talent that all senior Transportation officers need for professional development. Envisioning and
innovation contribute to the operational success of missions and assigned tasks by a process that includes establishing
purpose, vision, values, goals, and objectives. Senior Transportation officers should focus on other conceptual skills,
such as critical and moral reasoning, systems understanding, and analysis. The senior Transportation officer’s job
becomes much more difficult because they must not only have a mastery of technical skills, they must also be able to
mentor junior leaders in these skills. Their technical skills become more complex because they are involved in
resourcing, allocating, integrating, and synchronizing transportation equipment, personnel, and technologies, which
culminate in expert managerial abilities.
(9) Unique knowledge. Transportation Branch officers must possess an expert knowledge of transportation and
multifunctional logistical support systems, personnel, equipment, and operations. This knowledge includes practical
experience in transportation and multifunctional logistic operations and the employment of those systems. Specifically,
Transportation officers must strive to possess and maintain a comprehensive understanding of the following:
(a) Power projection of forces and sustainment.
(b) RSO&I.
(c) Battlefield distribution.
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

335

(d) Movement control.
(e) JLOTS operations.
(f) Inter- and intra-theater transportation operations.
(g) Deliberate and crisis action planning.
(h) Emerging transportation technologies.
(i) Transportation automated systems:
(j) Automated Air Loading Planning System (AALPS).
(k) Automated Movement Flow Tracking System (AMFT).
(l) Cargo Movement Operation System (CMOS).
(m) Computerized Movements Planning and Status System (COMPASS).
(n) Deployment Sustainment and Support Tool (DS2T).
(o) Enhanced Logistics Intra-theater Support Tool (ELIST).
(p) Global Transportation Network (GTN).
(q) Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS–A).
(r) Department of the Army Movements Management System-Redesigned (DAMMS–R).
(s) Integrated Booking System (IBS).
(t) Integrated Computerized Deployment System (ICODES).
(u) Battle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3)
(v) Joint Flow and Analysis System for Transportation (JFAST).
(w) Joint Force Requirements Generator II (JFRG II).
(x) Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES).
(y) Mobilization Movement Control System (MOBCON).
(z) Transportation Coordinators’ Automated Information for Movement System II (Transportation–AIMS II) and
Worldwide Port System (WPS).
(aa) Movement Tracking System (MTS).
(ab) Roles and functions of the SDDC.
(ac) Roles and functions of the U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM).
(ad) Roles and functions of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).
(ae) Army maintenance and supply systems and automation.
(af) Distribution management.
(10) Unique attributes. Everything begins with the Warrior Ethos. Warrior Ethos is the foundation for our total
commitment to victory in peace and war. It is the conviction that military Service is much more than just another job.
It defines who officers are and what officers do. Officers require a demonstrated mastery of branch-specific skills, and
grounding in the seven Army Values in order to successfully lead Soldiers as the Army transforms. All officers must
be physically and mentally fit, maintain and display self-control, remain calm under pressure, and adhere to published
standards and regulations. Critical officer developmental assignments Officers may use the Transportation Branch
training and development model (see fig 35–12, below) as a guideline for maintaining functional expertise throughout
their career. All Transportation Branch-coded (88) positions are open to male and female officers with the exception of
the ranger regiment movement control officer, which is specific to male officers. They can expect and should be
prepared to work in any of the four transportation AOCs. The purpose of leader development is to ensure that the
officer has acquired the necessary skills and experience, the breadth and depth of knowledge, and attributes that are
required to grow officers who are the centerpiece of a campaign quality Army with a Joint expeditionary mindset.

Figure 35–12. Active Army Transportation Developmental Model

(a) Lieutenant. After completing the Transportation BOLC III, officers are normally assigned at the company level
to gain leadership experience and to enhance technical and tactical competence. The focus of lieutenants should be on
acquiring and refining the following skills; troop leading procedures; Transportation Branch-related skills; and coordinating, planning, training, logistical, and administrative skills. Prior to promotion to captain, lieutenants should possess
an excellent knowledge of the Transportation Branch’s purpose, mission, and core competencies. This includes
practical experience in Transportation operations, activities, and missions. Special training necessary to support an
officer’s follow-on assignment may be scheduled after BOLC III. Lieutenants should expect to serve as a platoon
leader, detachment commander, or as an XO at the company level for a period of time that allows the officer to gain
breadth and depth of skills and experience. In all assignments, lieutenants should concentrate on learning the basics of
how the Army works, how to lead Soldiers, and how to maintain a motivated and positive outlook. Officers should
expect to serve in progressive positions to develop leadership, Transportation Branch skills and, when appropriate, to
complement this with staff experience at the battalion and brigade level. Typical Transportation lieutenant duty
positions include—
1. Transportation unit platoon leader.
2. Transportation unit XO.
3. Detachment commander.
4. Battalion/brigade transportation staff officer.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

337

(b) Captain. captains must be proficient in both common core and transportation competencies to gain the transportation knowledge required to be an effective leader at the company and battalion level. Captains should aggressively
prepare for and seek company-level command. captains should continue to gain an in-depth understanding of all
aspects of transportation operations as well as multifunctional logistics operations in order to serve in various staff
positions at all levels such as—
1. Transportation staff officer.
2. Mobility officer.
3. MCO.
4. Terminal operations officer.
5. Service school instructor.
6. Combat training center observer controller/trainers (OC/T).
(c) Major. Majors should aggressively seek the skills and experience that will best prepare them for the duties at the
lieutenant colonel level. Majors must exercise continuous self-development efforts to fully master all aspects of
transportation operations and multifunctional logistics to include Joint and multinational operations. This includes
honing transportation skills already gained at the company-grade level. Transportation competencies reside in the
following assignments:
1. Transportation general. Division transportation officer, battalion/group/brigade XO, battalion/group/brigade S3.
2. Movement control. Division MCO, movement control team commander, battalion/Theater Movement Control
Agency (TMCA) XO, battalion/TMCA S3.
3. Marine and terminal operations. Battalion/group/brigade XO, battalion/group S3, SDDC company commander.
4. Highway/rail transportation. Battalion/group/brigade XO, battalion/group/brigade S3.
(d) Lieutenant colonel. The objective in lieutenant colonel assignments is to give officers the opportunity to make a
greater contribution to the branch and the Army. While the majority of positions at this level are multifunctional,
officers will be called upon to fill transportation staff or command assignments, such as the following:
1. Corps transportation officer.
2. SDDC transportation staff officer.
3. Movement Control Agency (MCA) division chief.
4. HQDA/ACOM/installation transportation staff officer.
5. Army General Staff (AGS).
6. Sustainment Command transportation staff officer.
7. U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) staff officer.
(e) Colonel. Critical Transportation competencies are found in the following assignments.
1. Commander of a transportation brigade.
2. Assistant chief of staff, transportation.
3. Assistant chief of staff, movements.
4. SDDC transportation staff officer.
5. USTRANSCOM staff officer.
(11) Critical WO developmental assignments. Transportation Branch WOs manage the operation and maintenance of
U.S. Army watercraft and movement control measures in both tactical and peacetime environments. The WO developmental model is at figure 35–13, below. These operations technicians support Army missions by planning, coordinating, and directing Army units during ocean, LOTS, coastal, and harbor and inland water (CHI) missions as well as
strategic, operational, and tactical movement control missions worldwide. Mastery of the following skills relative to
each officer’s leadership stage is critical for successful performance by all Transportation officers Specific schooling
and operational assignments will best educate and prepare WOs for competitive positions of greater responsibility and
promotion. Figure 35–13, below, shows the career development models of the marine deck officer (880A) and the
marine engineering officer (881A).

35–7. Transportation Branch Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. A significant portion of Transportation assets resides in the RC. Transportation
Branch RC officers serve in the same roles and missions as their Active Army counterparts. The unique nature of the
RC Soldier’s role as a citizen-Soldier poses a challenge for their professional development. However, RC Transportation officers are expected to follow Active Army officer developmental patterns as closely as possible.
b. Branch development opportunities. Officers are professionally developed through a succession of schooling and
assignments. Generally, education and self-development requirements parallel those identified for Active Duty Transportation officers. See figure 35–14, below, for the RC Transportation life cycle model. Recommended RC Transportation officer professional development by grade is as follows:

340

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Figure 35–14. RC Transportation Developmental Model

(1) Lieutenant. The Transportation BOLC III is the starting point for newly accessed RC Transportation officers. RC
officers should complete BOLC III by their third year (USAR) or 18 months (ARNG) of Service. Officers should
obtain assignments to troop units at the company level as a platoon leader or XO for a period of time that allows the
officer to gain breadth and depth of skills and expertise. If there is a limited leadership opportunity available within the
Transportation competencies in an officer’s initial assignment, the officer should strive to seek to increase logistics
knowledge within the Quartermaster or Ordnance competencies and pursue a Transportation-related position when
available as a follow-on assignment. For self-development, lieutenants should master common core and branch tasks,
expand their professional readings, and support the Transportation Regimental Association and other military and
civilian transportation professional organizations.
(2) Captain.
(a) Complete the RC CCC (Transportation). Additionally, it is recommended to complete the SOC to prepare
captains for the transition into the LG Branch. Prior to enrolling in ILE, officers must complete the CAX. CAX
prepares officers for staff duties at the battalion or higher levels. In order to be best prepared for the duties of a major,
RC captains should successfully serve in one of the following branch-preferred positions for a period of time that
allows the officer to gain breadth and depth of skills and experience:
1. Company commander.
2. Battalion/brigade staff officer.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

341

(b) RC captains should continue to gain an in-depth understanding of transportation operations as well as multifunctional logistic operations. They also must become proficient in both common core and transportation captain tasks to
gain the knowledge required to effectively serve in the branch as a leader at the company and battalion level, in all
aspects of transportation operations and in leading Transportation Soldiers. For self-development the Transportation
captain should expand their knowledge through professional readings, support the Transportation Regimental Association and other military and civilian transportation professional and social organizations, attend seminars and conferences, and participate in community activities.
(3) Major. Officers may attend the Active Army ILE. For self-development, officers should obtain a master’s degree
and devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their warfighting and logistical perspective. Additionally,
they should conduct research and write articles for professional military publications, and support the Transportation
Regimental Association and other military and civilian transportation professional organizations. In order to be best
prepared for transportation duties at the lieutenant colonel level, it is recommended that RC majors serve in one of the
following positions:
(a) Transportation general. Including division transportation officer, battalion/group/brigade XO, battalion/group/
brigade S3.
(b) Movement control. Including division movement control officer, movement control team commander, battalion/
TMCA XO, and battalion/TMCA S3.

(c) Marine officer specialty (MOSs 880A and 881A); must maintain A2 certification as outlined in AR 56–9,
chapter 5.
35–8. The Logistics Branch
LG Branch officers are examples of Army pentathletes. They are builders of leaders and teams. They are competent,
full-spectrum professionals who support the Soldier. LG officers are effective in managing, leading, and changing large
organizations. They are skilled in governance, statesmanship, and diplomacy. A logistician understands cultural context
and works effectively across it. They are part of a Joint team, have an expeditionary outlook, and can think for
themselves in unpredictable situations. They are adaptive, trained and ready, physically fit, and are comfortable
working in JIIM environments. LG officers are self-reliant, proactive leaders who work in asymmetric and unpredictable environments where time available for problem analysis is likely constrained, but where sound, timely decisions are
urgent.
a. Unique purpose of the LG Branch. The purpose of the LG Branch is to merge all logistics basic branch officers
(Ordnance, Quartermaster, Transportation) upon completion of the combined LG CCC into one unified branch in order
to create logistics pentathletes, focused on being, primarily, multifunctional logisticians, capable of planning, integrating, and directing sustainment activities that will enable Army forces to initiate and sustain full spectrum operations.
b. Unique functions of the LG Branch. LG Branch officers serve in both operating and generating force structures
and require extensive experience in integrating 6 out of 12 sustainment functions (see FM 3–0); supply, field services,
transportation, maintenance, explosive ordnance disposal, and force health protection. LG officers should also be
familiar with the other six functions; human resources support, financial management, legal support, general engineering, religious support, and band support. LG officers may be called upon to handle more functions as further changes
are made to the Army modular force and generate additional JIIM requirements.
c. Unique features of work in the LG Branch. At the company-grade level, logistics officer assignments will be
fairly evenly split between multifunctional and functional. As officers progress from company grade to field grade,
assignments grow increasingly multifunctional. Officers must develop and use a diverse set of skills as they move
between functional and multifunctional assignments in the operating and generating force. LG Branch officers work at
all levels of command and staff and perform the following functions and tasks:
(1) Command, direct, and control multifunctional and functional logistics units.
(2) Provide for coordination of logistics activities at all levels of command.
(3) Coordinate logistics for JIIM operations.
(4) Develop logistics doctrine, organizations, and equipment.
(5) Instruct both multifunctional and functional logistics skills at Service schools and colleges.
(6) Serve in positions, such as staff officers in brigade support battalions (BSB), sustainment brigades, combat
sustainment support battalion (CSSB), expeditionary sustainment commands (ESC), theater sustainment commands
(TSC), Joint task force headquarters (JTFHQ), division/corps/ASCC headquarters, and combatant commander
(COCOM) headquarters.

(7) Active Army officers may serve as logistics advisors to ARNG and USAR organizations. Required officer
characteristics (skills, knowledge, and attributes).
d. Competencies and actions. Mission success ultimately requires the proper balance between technical skills and
the ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactical skills at the right moment. Success also requires honed
conceptual skills, enabling officers to handle changing situations and ideas. Officers must be trained how to think, not
what to think. The constantly changing nature of modern warfare requires agile logistics forces and logistics officers.
Responsiveness, flexibility, and economy are key logistics principles that enable officers to lead units to support an
agile combat force and execute operations more swiftly than their opponents.
(1) Responsiveness. Responsiveness is providing the right support in the right place, at the right time, and it includes
the ability to foresee operational requirements. Responsiveness involves identifying, accumulating, and maintaining the
minimum assets, capabilities, and information necessary to meet support requirements. Responsiveness involves the
ability to meet changing requirements on short notice. Anticipating those requirements is critical to providing responsive logistics.
(2) Flexibility. Flexibility is the ability to adapt logistics structures and procedures to changing situations, missions,
and concepts of operations. LG plans, operations, and organizations must be flexible enough to achieve both responsiveness and economy. LG organizations provide support in any environment throughout the spectrum of conflict and
adapts as operations evolve. Flexibility may require improvisation (inventing, arranging, or fabricating what is needed
from what is on hand). When established procedures do not provide the required support, logistics personnel seek
innovative solutions, rapidly devise new procedures, or take extraordinary measures to adapt to the situation.
(3) Economy. Economy means providing the most efficient support to accomplish the mission. Resources are always
limited. The commander achieves economy by prioritizing and allocating resources. Many logistics developments focus
on the ability of the logistics commander to provide required support with the minimum expenditure of resources.
e. Unique skills. The Logistics officer Corps contains ten AOCs and one skill identifier. Training for these AOCs
and skills is open to all male and female LG Branch officers. The numerical designation of some of the secondary
AOCs coincides with the other LG corps branches/regiments. LG Branch officers all have a common, primary AOC,
90A. Refer to the other branch sections of this chapter for a more detailed description of the types of functional units
and staff jobs as well as the criteria for obtaining each of the other AOCs. These skills are gained and developed
through multiple operational assignments and continuous professional study and self-development.
(1) Logistician (AOC 90A). This is the primary AOC for the LG Branch. Officers holding this AOC will command
and control multifunctional logistics units as well as serve in various multifunctional logistics staff positions. All
officers will receive this designation as their primary AOC once they graduate from CLC3. Medical Service Corps
officers who attend CLC3 will receive the 90A designation as a secondary AOC, and with that AOC will have
opportunities to serve in multifunctional logistics units on staff, as well as be eligible to compete for command of
multifunctional logistics units.
(2) Transportation general (AOC 88A). This is one of nine secondary AOCs for the LG Branch. Officers holding
this AOC will command and control transportation units as well as serve in varied levels of transportation staff
positions.
(3) Traffic management (AOC 88B). This is one of nine secondary AOCs for the LG Branch. Officers holding this
skill serve on division or higher staffs/commands at the operational or strategic level in order to provide specialized
knowledge of transportation organizations, equipment, and doctrine. Officers will plan, coordinate, and synchronize the
rapid deployment, RSO&I, sustainment/distribution management and redeployment of forces in any area of operations.
(4) Marine and terminal operations (AOC 88C). This is one of nine secondary AOCs for the LG Branch. Officers
holding this AOC will command and control marine and terminal transportation units as well as serve in varied levels
of transportation staff positions.
(5) Motor/rail transportation (AOC 88D). This is one of nine secondary AOCs for the LG Branch. Officers holding
this AOC will command and control motor and rail transportation units as well as serve in varied levels of transportation staff positions.
(6) EOD (AOC 89E). This is one of nine secondary AOCs for the LG Branch. Officers holding this AOC will
command and control EOD units as well as serve in varied levels of EOD staff positions.
(7) Materiel maintenance and munitions management (AOC 91A). This is one of nine secondary AOCs for the LG
Branch. Officers holding this AOC will command and control maintenance or ammunition units as well as serve in
varied levels of ordnance staff positions.
(8) Supply and materiel management (AOC 92A). This is one of nine secondary AOCs for the LG Branch. Officers
holding this AOC will command and control quartermaster units as well as serve in varied levels of quartermaster staff
positions.
(9) Aerial delivery and materiel (AOC 92D). This is one of nine secondary AOCs for the LG Branch. Officers
holding this AOC will command and control aerial delivery and materiel units as well as serve in varied levels of aerial
delivery staff positions.
(10) Petroleum and water (AOC 92F). This is one of nine secondary AOCs for the LG Branch. Officers holding this

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

345

AOC will command and control petroleum and water units as well as serve in varied levels of petroleum staff
positions.
(11) Mortuary affairs (SI 4V). This is the only skill identifier for the LG Branch. Officers holding this skill manage
mortuary affairs support, both on staff and as commanders.
f. Unique knowledge. LG officers must know how to exploit the following aspects of the agile logistics force when
planning and executing operations; modular unit designs, force tailoring, and split based operations. LG officers must
know sustainment unit capabilities and how units are employed in order to provide relevant sustainment information to
the commander in terms he/she can rapidly apply to the situation, enabling him to visualize, describe, and direct
operations. LG officers must be able to translate information on status and location of resources into the impact on
combat effectiveness in the present and near future using emerging information technology. LG officers should be
grounded in all sustainment Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS) and C2 Systems, such as the
Battle Command Sustainment and Support System (BCS3), Movement Tracking System (MTS), and Global Combat
Support System-Army (GCSS–A). This knowledge includes practical experience in tactics and combined arms operations at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels as well as deployment operations. Logisticians must be comfortable working in fluid, nonlinear, noncontiguous environments with highly distributed forces functioning continually, at
various tempos, and in various phases of military operations. Additionally, logisticians must understand the concepts
and employment of Joint logistics in order to provide support to the combatant commander wherever the force is
located.
g. Unique attributes. LG officers require sound judgment as well as the ability to think creatively and reason
analytically, critically, and ethically. The dynamics associated with training logistics units and supporting operational
missions across the full spectrum require a sense of ingenuity and foresight. LG officers must fully embrace the
Warrior Ethos, be confident in their abilities and training, competent in their area of expertise, ready and adaptable to
change, levelheaded under pressure, and have a Joint and expeditionary mindset. They must be innovative and
comfortable working with complex, information technologies.
35–9. Logistics Branch qualification and development
The goal of the professional development of multifunctional logistics officers is to produce and sustain highly qualified
tactically and operationally oriented individuals to provide seamless logistical support in combat and other missions.
LG officers should expect to be assigned to a wide variety of units and organizations. LG Branch positions (coded 90A
on authorization documents) provide the required experience and development in order to gain proficiency as a LG
Branch officer. They are only found at the captain and above experience level. Officers may use the LG Branch life
cycle development and utilization model (see fig 35–16, below) as a guideline for monitoring their career paths. The
LG Branch model provides progressive career development through challenging command and staff assignments in
logistics management and leader development. Assignment patterns will vary depending on the needs of the Army,
professional development requirements, manning guidance, and individual officer preferences. Logisticians can expect
to fill key positions in JIIM organizations. Officers should also expect to serve in functional logistics assignments
based on their secondary AOC qualifications or their skill identifiers as stated in paragraph 35–8b, above. See other
branch sections in this chapter for details on those types of assignments.

346

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Figure 35–16. Active Army LG Corps Developmental Model

a. Captain.
(1) Education. Officers generally attend the CLC3 at their 3rd-4th YOS. Attendance to CLC3 will be TDY and return
or PCS as fits the needs of the Army and follow-on assignments. Officers receive initial instruction in multifunctional
logistics, instruction on commanding at the company level, and advanced technical instruction in their original
accessions branch. The original accessions branch will become the officer’s secondary AOC and will dictate functional
assignments unless the officer elects to change his/her designated AOC. Logisticians may change their AOC by
attending qualification courses following completion of CLC3. For example, an officer of the Transportation or
Ordnance regiment could attend the Petroleum Officer’s Course after CLC3, and thus gain the 92F AOC, and thereafter
be affiliated with the Quartermaster regiment. LG Branch officers will only have one designated secondary AOC.
Though not mandatory for promotion, there are additional educational opportunities captains normally pursue during
their 4th-10th YOS that enhance and broaden an officer’s understanding of multifunctional logistics, which are as
follows:
(a) SOC.
(b) TWI
(c) Complete an advanced degree in a logistics discipline.
(d) The LEDC helps to prepare officers for multifunctional duties across the spectrum of operations. For a select
number of officers, attendance to LEDC may be coupled with a cooperative degree program pursuing an advanced
degree in logistics from the FIT.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

347

(e) Additional courses to obtain other LG Branch AOCs or SIs.
(2) FA process. Between their 4th-7th YOS, officers have the option of pursuing one of many different FAs required
by the Army For example, many logistics officers apply to the Acquisition Corps (FA 51). If accepted into this
program, officers attend numerous qualification courses and have specific developmental paths for future assignments.
However, once officers are accepted into another FA designation, such as FA 51, they will not return to the LG Branch
nor will they be eligible to command logistics units.
(3) Key developmental experiences. After graduation from CLC3, captains can expect functional and multifunctional
logistics assignments as company commanders and battalion and brigade staff officers as well as other staff positions in
the operating and generating force. Company command is not required for promotion to major, but is a key
developmental (KD) experience that will enhance an officer’s chance for command of a logistics unit at higher levels.
Officers who desire to be competitive for logistics battalion command should strive to serve as logistics company
commanders. The type of logistics company commanded may or may not dictate the type of battalion they could
command.
b. Major.
(1) Education. majors must complete ILE which includes the core course and the Advanced Operations and
Warfighting Course at Fort Leavenworth, as well as specified logistics electives. Completion of ILE will make officers
ILE and JPME I qualified. Attendance at ILE will be an assignment process, not by board selection, and will normally
occur between the 8th and 12th year of commissioned Service.
(2) KD experiences. Majors are primarily staff officers, serving in positions at all levels. They must demonstrate
their abilities to manage multifunctional organizations and various logistics missions. They build on their skills and
experiences from their captain years, have assignments of greater complexity, and prepare themselves to be battalion
commanders. An officer’s performance during these assignments demonstrates a mastery of skills, knowledge, and
attributes. Majors should focus on gaining experiences at the tactical level by serving as battalion support operations
officers, battalion XOs, or battalion operations officers (S2/3) of support battalions and brigade S4s of brigade combat
teams. Although no particular one of the above staff jobs are mandatory to hold for promotion to lieutenant colonel,
they are key experiences that will make majors competitive for battalion command once they have made lieutenant
colonel.
c. Lieutenant colonel. This grade requires a higher level of supervisory and managerial skills. LG Branch officers
are responsible for integrating and synchronizing logistics operations and influencing and developing policy as it relates
to logistics management. In addition, LG Branch lieutenant colonels are responsible for providing more comprehensive
supervisory control of subordinate LG Corps officers.
(1) Education. Lieutenant colonels wanting to remain competitive for subsequent promotion should be selected to a
SSC, either resident or non-resident. All officers are also encouraged to obtain a graduate-level education in an
appropriate discipline.
(2) KD experiences. Developmental experience gained as a lieutenant colonel provides the Army with officers in
senior grades who have developed the expertise needed both multi-functionally and functionally. Lieutenant colonels
serve primarily in key staff and/or Joint positions in sustainment brigade headquarters, sustainment commands (expeditionary), sustainment commands (theater), division, corps, and higher staffs. Selected lieutenant colonels will have the
opportunity to command battalions. Successful battalion command, while not mandatory for promotion to colonel, will
enhance the officer’s potential for brigade command.
d. Colonel. LG Branch colonels command at the brigade level and hold the senior logistics positions on division,
corps, sustainment commands, and many HQDA, JCS, and DOD staffs.
(1) Education. Although no specific mandatory military education requirement exists for colonels, attendance at a
SSC or completion of the AWC Distance Education Course identifies those officers with exceptional promotion
potential for Service in positions of increased responsibility at the next higher grade. All officers are also encouraged to
obtain a graduate-level education in an appropriate discipline.
(2) KD experiences. Experiences at the colonel level are primarily operational and strategic-level staff assignments.
Currently, commands make up only 21 percent of colonel-level positions. Joint assignments are viewed as key for
career enhancement, as well as important to the Army.
e. Self-development. Self-development is the responsibility of every officer and ranges from professional reading
during off-duty time to aggressively seeking out positions of increased responsibility. Each officer, with support from
mentors, should develop career goals and clearly articulate those goals to the commander and assignments officer at the
AHRC. Always remember that an officer is his or her own best career manager. By actively participating in the
management of career decisions, officers will improve the likelihood of a successful career. Officers are encouraged to
continue to broaden their logistics experience by doing the following:
(1) Establish a professional reading program.
(2) Participate in their regimental association.
(3) Participate in civilian professional logistics organizations.
(4) Become a certified professional logistician (CPL).
(5) Obtain a civilian degree in logistics-related fields.

348

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(6) Complete logistics-related correspondence courses.
(7) Complete courses in Joint logistics at ALMC.
(8) Conduct research and write articles for professional logistics publications.
35–10. Logistics Branch Reserve Component officers
a. General. RC LG Branch officer development and qualifications parallel those of their Active Duty counterparts as
described in paragraphs 35–8 and 35–9., above. Life cycle development and utilization also parallel the Active Army as
shown in figure 35–16, below. Training and development of RC LG Branch officers may be more challenging than for
their Active Army counterparts, due to several constraints, such as time to train, state and Federal missions, geographical location, decentralized officer management, and ongoing transformation of units. With the incorporation of the LG
Branch, RC officers must recognize these challenges in order to overcome them, and become equally qualified as their
Active Army counterparts.
b. LG Branch qualification and development. RC officer will be inducted into the LG Branch upon completion of a
logistics (Ordnance, Quartermaster, Transportation) RC CCC* (see interim implementation guidance at the end of this
para). Officers will hold 90A as their primary AOC and a secondary AOC out of table 35–1, above. This policy applies
to the following officers; AGR, TPU, M–Day, IMA, and IRR. As is the case with Active Army officers, there will be
no lieutenants (nor non-CCC graduates) in the LG Branch. RC Medical Service Corps (MFA70) may obtain 90A as a
secondary AOC.
(1) Captain. captains are either company commanders or staff officers. Officers will have LG Branch assignments
according to organizational structures within their geographical location/state boundaries. Officers should take full
advantage of the Battle Command Knowledge System–LOGNet and the CASCOM sustainment portal to keep skills
current in the LG Branch. Officers are encouraged to take additional multifunctional logistics courses when resources
permit.
(2) Major. majors are primarily staff officers, serving in positions at all levels. They must demonstrate their abilities
to manage assets in multifunctional organizations and organize various logistics missions. They build on their skills and
experiences from their captain years, have assignments of greater complexity, and prepare themselves to be battalion
commanders. Accordingly, it is highly encouraged that majors attend additional training courses to further their
proficiency in multifunctional logistics. Available training courses include SOC, RCMCSS, LEDC, or ALEDC.
(3) Lieutenant colonel and colonel. lieutenant colonels and colonels are the refinement stages of an RC officer’s
career. Officers will be expected to mentor junior officers on the importance of maintaining LG Branch proficiency
through multiple experiences and encourage officers to obtain additional multifunctional training when appropriate.
Focus is also placed on an officer successfully completing lieutenant colonel- or colonel-level command as well as
serving in senior logistics officer staff positions. Officers are to complete the PCC at Fort Lee, VA, when selected for
lieutenant colonel- or colonel-level command. Officers are encouraged to complete SSC, the same as their Active Army
counterparts.
c. Branch transfer. Officers may branch transfer into the LG Branch at any rank from captain through colonel. The
following rules apply:
(1) Captains who have not yet attended a RC CCC. Officers who choose to transfer into the LG Branch prior to
attending a RC CCC need only attend a logistics (Ordnance, Quartermaster, Transportation) RC CCC*. This course
provides the requisite functional and multifunctional training for LG Branch officers.
(2) Captains and above who have already completed a RC CCC other than logistics. Officers who branch transfer
after attendance at a non-logistics RC CCC must complete the following requirements in any order.
(a) Hold a functional logistics area of concentration from the Ordnance, Quartermaster, or Transportation Branches,
by completion of appropriate online or resident branch transition courses.
(b) Attend one of the following courses; SOC, RCMCSS, LEDC, ALEDC Phase I, or CLC3 (or CLOAC).
(3) It is not the intent to have branch transfer officers change branches twice; they must simply complete the
appropriate transition course that awards a logistics area of concentration as one of the prerequisites to transferring into
the LG Branch. There is no branch transfer into the Ordnance, Quartermaster or Transportation branches at captain or
above, as the only branch available to LG officers at captain or above is the LG Branch.
(4) To apply for the designation of LG Branch, USAR and ARNG officers should forward applications in accordance with published command guidance to their state Adjutant General, AHRC-St. Louis, Army Reserve Active Duty
Management Directorate (ARADMD) or the USAR Command, as appropriate.
35–11. Logistics Corps officer requirements, assignments, and life cycle initiatives
a. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for all LG
Corps officers. To do this, the field-grade inventory must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, provide
sufficient flexibility to support branch generalist positions, and provide officers with a sufficient amount of functional
experience in order to fill functional logistics positions.
b. Preferences. Assignments are based on needs of the Army, professional development requirements, and officer
preference. Officers assigned to life cycle units can expect 3-year tours. LG Corps officers can expect to serve in

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

349

branch generalist (01A coded) assignments and/or commands. Assignments are managed by the Force Sustainment
Division of AHRC Officer Personnel Management Directorate.
c. Precedence. Assignment to KD positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility on the sequence of
assignments Stabilization policies and local commanders may influence assignment precedence. Assignments will be
either to a LG Branch position or to the officers chosen secondary AOC with no precedence of one over the other.
d. Joint assignments. LG Corps officers can expect to be considered for Joint duty assignments worldwide. Joint
experience is important to the Army and is essential to individual officers for their advancement into senior leadership
positions. Joint is the way to fight and Joint assignments and education are interwoven into the fabric of Army officer
development.
e. Branch generalist assignments. LG Corps officers should expect to be assigned at least once to a branch
generalist assignment. These positions may or may not relate directly to their technical expertise, but are important to
the Army. Criteria for selection include overall manner of performance, military experience, military and civilian
education, and demonstrated potential to serve in positions of increased responsibility. These positions include, but are
not limited to, the following:
(1) Multifunctional staff positions at the grade of major and above.
(2) Advisory groups in foreign countries.
(3) Inspector general (IG) office.
(4) U.S. Army Recruiting Command (USAREC) staff.
(5) Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC).
(6) USAR and ARNG liaison.
(7) USMA faculty and staff.
(8) Other executive staff positions.
(9) Service school instructors.
f. Other assignments. LG Corps officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated above.
These other assignments may include White House Fellows, duty with the National Security Council, United Nations,
and other international staffs as well as allied Service schools. The spectrum of possible assignments is large and these
assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and important and require mature, skilled, and well-grounded
officers. Normally officers must be nominated for these types of positions.
g. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments. At each grade, the amount of time spent in KD assignments
must be monitored to ensure that officer professional development is optimized. Twelve to 24 months in each position
is preferred although not required due to the unpredictability of life cycle manning and stabilization policies. The
important factor is that each selected officer performs to a high standard and is successful in manner of performance.
The new Army force stabilization manning policies will influence LG Corps officers’ developmental experiences.
h. Structure. LG Corps officers serve at all echelons worldwide. Transformation of logistics units into modular
structures is nearly complete. Positions for the three basic branches (Ordnance, Quartermaster, Transportation) are
found at the grade of lieutenant through colonel. Currently, LG branch authorizations are only found at the grade of
captain and above.
i. Acquire. Officers will be accessed into the Ordnance, Quartermaster or Transportation branches through the
USMA, ROTC, or Officer Candidate School. Accessions are based on the needs of the Army and officer preference.
Officers will be inducted from these three branches into the LG Branch upon graduation from CLC3. Currently, LG
Corps officers are not able to participate in the Branch Detail Program. The LG Branch will accept officers transferring
from other branches or services on a case-by-case basis, based on the needs of the Army. These officers must attend
CLC3 in order to qualify them as LG Branch officers and a functional branch course in order to gain their secondary
AOC.
j. Distribute. Officers will continue to rotate between operating and generating force assignments. Sequencing and
timing of assignments will be driven by Army requirements and the force stabilization system. Officers should expect
to serve primarily in LG Branch assignments. Secondary AOC developmental assignments will be made as required
meeting the needs of the Army and maintaining the officer’s expertise in that area; however, officers should not expect
back-to-back functional assignments. Officers who select a FA in another functional category will no longer serve in
Logistics Corps assignments.
k. Deploy. LG Branch officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to deployable TOE units or generating force organizations, readiness is
imperative to success of the mission. Officers must prepare themselves and their Families for planned and no notice
deployments throughout an officers’ career.
l. Sustain. There are three major factors that affect officer career development life cycle.
(1) Promotion. LG Branch officers will compete for promotion within the force sustainment functional category.
Promotion rates will be determined by Army needs/DOPMA goals.
(2) Command. LG Branch officers will continue to be centrally selected for command positions at the lieutenant
colonel and colonel level. Command categories include; operations, strategic support, recruiting and training, and

350

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

installation. LG commands are further organized into multifunctional and functional sub-categories. Officers have the
option of selecting the category or categories in which they desire to compete for command while declining competition in other categories. The results of the command selection process are published in the CSL.
(3) OER. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and promotion potential. Starting with
captain reports, the rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the functional category which best suits
the officer’s abilities and interests.
m. Develop. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments
in troop units, staff assignments, and institutional training assignments. Self-development continues to be an essential
component of officer development. The goal is to develop and sustain logistics officers fully versed in multifunctional
logistics and experts in one secondary area of expertise (secondary AOC).
n. Separate. Army separation procedures remain in accordance with AR 600–8–24, with exceptions for stop loss/
stop move.
35–12. Life cycle initiatives for Logistics Corps warrant officers
a. Structure. LG Corps WOs serve at all echelons worldwide. Transformation of logistics units into modular
structures is nearly complete. There will be changes to the authorizations of those units based on the restructuring and
re-coding initiatives associated with new missions.
b. Acquire. Accessions are based on needs of the Army. WOs will continue to enter into the LG Corps branches
through accessions from Ordnance, Quartermaster, and Transportation enlisted feeder MOSs. Outstanding LG Corps
NCOs who have demonstrated exceptional leadership, tactical, and technical skills are ideal candidates for accession
into the WO specialties. Army policy prohibits enlisted direct appointments to WO.
c. Distribute. WOs will continue to rotate between operating force and generating force units both in CONUS and
OCONUS.
d. Deploy. LG Corps WOs are technicians and leaders who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at any time. Whether assigned to force structure units with high levels of readiness or force generation
organizations, all WOs must be fully deployable to accomplish the mission across the full spectrum of conflict. WOs
must prepare themselves and their Families for this most challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustain. There are three major factors that affect the WO career development life cycle.
(1) Promotions. WOs will compete for promotion based on needs of the Army.
(2) Assignment. WOs should adhere to their recommended career development pattern to maximize their technical
and tactical expertise and leadership development. This includes assignments at tactical, operational, and strategic level
as well as Joint, national, and in the training base. Solid performance at various levels of assignment is highly desirable
for future advancement.
(3) OER. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and personnel management. Starting with
WO1, the rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the career development which best suits the
Army’s needs and the WO’s abilities and interests.
f. Develop. WOs develop their knowledge through institutional training and improve their knowledge through
progressive levels of assignments within their specialty at all levels from tactical to national. Self-development
continues to be an essential component of WO development as well as resident training in TASS. The goal is to
professionally develop LG Corps WOs to support Army missions across the full spectrum of operations.
g. Separate. Army separation procedures remain in accordance with AR 600–8–24, with exceptions for stop loss/
stop move.

Chapter 36
Human Resources Area of Concentration
36–1. History
The Army G–1 approved merging AG Branch, personnel systems management, and FA 43A, Human Resources (HR)
management populations into a single officer area of concentration (AOC) HR officer, 42B/42H. Even though the
official consolidation does not take place until Oct 08 (fiscal year 09), the assignment process and interchangeable use
of both branch 42 and FA 43 officers is happening today. The primary goal of the merger is to provide the most
effective professional HR support to the modular Army possible, while ensuring that the majority of officers in both
specialties are not disadvantaged. Significant time, coordination, and effort led to this G–1 directed merger to
encompass successful accessions, training, reclassification, assignments, promotions, and schooling opportunities. G–1
has established a plan to ensure that the Army’s HR officer corps provides the best trained HR professional leadership
possible to serve in the expeditionary and modular Army.

36–2. Unique features of the Human Resources area of concentration
a. Unique purpose of HR AOC. The purpose of the HR AOC is to provide activities and functions to sustain human
resource functions of manning the force, providing HR services, and personnel support to Soldiers, DA civilians,
Families, contractors, retirees, veterans, and organizations providing support to operations within the commander’s
intent. HR officers manage functions from the HR life cycle that include personnel procurement, training, professional
development, distribution, sustainment, retirement or separation, and help ensure a quality force. These functions are
performed under the human resource umbrella of the Army G–1 and are described in Field Manual 1–0.
(1) Man the Force—
(a) Personnel readiness management.
(b) Reception, replacement, return to duty, rest & recuperation (R&R), redeployment (R5) operations.
(c) Personnel information management.
(d) Personnel accounting/strength reporting.
(2) Provide personnel services—
(a) Essential personnel services (EPS).
(b) Casualty operations management.
(3) Provide personnel support—
(a) Postal operations.
(b) MWR & community support activities.
(c) Band support.
(4) HR planning and operations.
b. The way ahead. The HR AOC continues to transform to meet the Army’s Campaign Plans and Army G–1
Personnel Transformation Plan. HR officers of the future will be well versed and cross-trained in multiple technical
systems supporting the Soldier throughout full spectrum operations. Officers must be computer literate and able to
quickly grasp information, analyze data, and provide immediate output of data to Commanders for use within the
operational setting. The development of Human Resource Officers will also focus on the development of agile and
adaptive officers and multi-skilled leaders who collectively embody knowledge of JIIM organizations. While Human
Resources Command will make every effort to synchronize the three priorities, the needs of the Army and the
professional development needs of the officer must continue to take precedence over individual preference. The
assignment of HR officers will continue to be made based on—
(1) The needs of the Army.
(2) The professional development needs of the officer.
(3) The officer’s preference.
c. Unique functions performed by the HR AOC. The HR AOC provides manpower, HR services, and personnel
support to commanders at all echelons in order to enhance the readiness and operational capabilities of the total force
and ensure success across the full spectrum of military operations, and formulates policy and directs the Army’s
military personnel system at strategic, operational, and tactical levels. This includes the critical operational/tactical
personnel systems/functions outlined in FMs 1–0, 3–0, and 4–0. HR AOC officers serve at all levels of the Army and
throughout the Joint community. The HR AOC is a staff-centric AOC where HR officers (BR 42B lieutenants and
captains) serve as battalion S–1s and brigade strength managers and senior HR officers (AOC 42H majors, lieutenant
colonels, colonels) serve as brigade/BCT S–1s, division, corps, ASCC/Army G–1s, serving as the primary advisors to
commanders on all matters related to human resources. Senior HR officers serve as the HR support operations officer
in sustainment structures and serve as operations officers, team leaders, and division chiefs in the Human Resource
Sustainment Center (HRSC). Senior HR officers also serve in Joint positions providing human resource expertise and
guidance for Joint commanders. Senior HR officers serve as equal opportunity officers and command HR Companies,
reception battalions, brigade special troops battalions, combat sustainment support battalions, military entrance processing stations, recruiting companies and battalions, garrisons, and Army Bands commands. They train military and
civilian personnel in personnel administration and military human resource management and develop HR doctrine to
support the full spectrum of operations. HR WOs serve at all levels of the Army. They serve in Army bands, brigade/
BCT S–1s and division, corps, ASCC/Army, ACOM G–1s, the DA staff, SRC12 HR structures, the Adjutant General’s
School, and the U.S. Army School of Music. They train military and civilian personnel in organizational management
and HR Service support. They develop policy, procedures, and doctrine to support these operations during peace and
war.
d. Unique features of work in the HR AOC. Duty positions associated in the HR AOC require thoroughly trained
and properly developed officers to provide the knowledge of military HR operations, its systems, relationships, and
interfaces. The HR officer may serve in one of the AOC or skills described below.
(1) HR officer (AOC 42B) and senior HR officer (42H). Officers who serve in this branch manage HR core
competencies and functions that support military HR management including policy formulation, interpretation, and
implementation at the brigade/BCT, division/corps, ASCC/Army, HQDA, and within JIIM operations. Example tasks
which are part of the core competencies include R5 operations management, strength management, reassignment,

352

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

sponsorship, and procurement of officer and enlisted personnel; unit manning, leaves and passes, awards and decorations, officer and enlisted transfers, and discharges, casualty operations management, postal operations, and the
planning and tracking of HR operations to support deployed forces. Senior HR and HR officers manage military HR
functions that support military personnel information management, military HR services, and military personnel
automation. Examples are personnel database management, personnel automation, personnel records management,
personnel accounting and strength reporting, casualty operations, officer and NCO evaluation systems, and officer and
enlisted promotion systems, identification documents, reassignment systems, and systems updates.
(2) Army band (AOC 42C). Officers who serve in this AOC plan, develop, and direct activities of military bands and
musical training of Army band members; coordinate all band activities of the command; and conduct technical
inspections and evaluate operational status, technical capability, and proficiency of Army bands.
(3) Postal operations (SI 4J). Officers who hold this SI formulate policies for and direct the activities of units
engaged in postal operations. Individuals must complete the Joint Service Postal Operations Course and/or the Postal
Supervisor’s Course. This SI is only awarded to HR officers.
e. Army HR focus. The Army G–1 provides HR oversight in the HR AOC performance. The Army G–1 is
responsible for all HR management policy, programs, goals, standards, structure, and resources. Included under the
Army G–1 HR umbrella is personnel readiness management. Personnel readiness management is the responsibility of
the HR AOC officer. HR AOC officers serve at all levels in MTOE and TDA organizations. HR AOC officers manage
the distribution, assignment, and personnel strength accounting systems that assure personnel readiness of the force and
they provide HR Service to Soldiers, DOD civilians, contractors, retirees, and Family members. HR AOC officers
supervise postal Service for Soldiers in deployed environments. HR AOC officers are vital members of the commander’s staff, working for the good of the organization.
f. Officer tasks. The information below provides a broad outline of an officer’s mission essential task list. HR AOC
officers must—
(1) Know the organization, structure, and doctrine of the warfighting Army.
(2) Know battlefield concepts of operation and interoperability and dependency of TOE units.
(3) Understand force structure analysis and approval process; manpower and equipment requirements, budget,
authorizations, and organization/mission change policy and programs.
(4) Understand the roles and missions of other services and Joint and multinational human resource and manpower
operations.
(5) Retain competency in the operation and management of existing and emerging military and civilian personnel/
HR systems and doctrine that are critical to success on the battlefield.
(6) Understand and use automation and other new technology that can improve timeliness and efficiency. Army
band officers (42C) must have advanced knowledge of musical performance and conducting techniques, and extensive
training in music history and theory.
g. Assignment opportunities other than MTOE.
(1) Army G–1 staff officer, Division Chief, Deputy Director.
(2) Commander MEPS, AIT company/battalion, recruiting company/battalion or Army School of Music (420C).
(3) S–1, G–1, or J–1.
(4) EO officer.
(5) Branch Chief, AHRC.
(6) Personnel management officer, AHRC.
(7) Operations officer, bandmaster, or staff band officer (420C).
(8) Instructor (USMA or AG School).
36–3. Characteristics required of officers
a. Unique attributes. All officers must be physically and mentally fit, maintain deployability preparedness, maintain
and display self-control, remain calm under pressure, and adhere to published standards and regulations. The Adjutant
General Corps must produce multi-skilled leaders who are critically reflective, comfortable with ambiguity and
uncertainty, and agents of change. HR officers must be challenged and imbued with the confidence to be innovative
and adaptive while competently performing in a JIIM environment.
b. Unique skills.
(1) Tactical and operational. Both technical and operational skills are necessary for success as an HR AOC. The
systems and processes that are used to accomplish HR functions make HR technical skills essential. The understanding
of tactical requirements and the contemporary operating environment is critical in the performance of duty in the full
spectrum operational environment within the standards described by the Warrior Ethos by each officer in the AOC.
(2) Conceptual. HR officers must have conceptual skills that are necessary for strategic vision, critical reasoning,
and problem solving. These officers must be able to move from the abstract concept to concrete solutions in everyday
problems. As principally staff officers, HR AOC officers must be able to conceptualize HR support within the
sustainment construct in support of full spectrum operations.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

353

(3) Interpersonal. Interpersonal skills are necessary because HR officers must effectively communicate with supported commanders, peers, and other personnel who provide support and Service. These officers must be able to listen,
read, learn, and coordinate actions at all levels. Communications skills, both verbal and written, are critical for HR
officers, especially those serving in S–1 and G–1 positions or on S–1 and G–1 staffs. HR officers must be able to
function effectively as a member of a large coordinating staff.
c. Unique actions.
(1) Decisionmaking. Must be able to demonstrate the ability and willingness to work with others as a team to
achieve operational success. Must be able to frame requirements, analyze data through the decisionmaking process, and
present clear definable options/courses of action to senior leaders
(2) Planning and executing. HR Officers must develop and use a diverse set of skills within the HR planning and
operations core competency to prepare the HR portion of plans and orders and the personnel estimate to ensure HR
providers understand required support to maintain the personnel element of combat power. HR officers must provide
clear and concise directives to Soldiers during the execution of HR mission requirements.
(3) Goal. The goal of the AG branch is to provide each officer with a series of opportunities in order to develop HR
professionals with well rounded backgrounds and an understanding of JIIM operations.
36–4. Critical Active Army officer developmental assignments
a. Officer qualification and development. (Career development model is at fig 36–1, below).

Figure 36–1. HR Active Army Developmental Model

354

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(1) Lieutenant.
(a) After completing the (BOLC, Phase III (proponent institutional training), officers are assigned to a duty position
that will allow maximum exposure to a wide range of HR functions.
(b) The focus of effort during the lieutenant years is to acquire, reinforce, and hone troop leading, technical, tactical,
logistics, and administrative skills. Inculcation of the Warrior Ethos and Army core values is essential in the
development of young officers. Prior to promotion to captain, officers must possess an in-depth knowledge of
combined arms operations gained through on-the-job training. By law, officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree
before promotion to captain. Officers may face initial assignments at installations where they may be a part of a life
cycle brigade combat team (BCT) 36-month assignment and other emerging assignments. Second lieutenants entering
life cycle manned (LCM) units will stay for the unit’s life cycle and fill a number of developing HR, staff-centric
positions. Lieutenants that enter LCM BCTs will most likely serve as a captain battalion S–1, but may serve in a
lieutenant position as a captain. Assignments will be based on—
1. Needs of the Army.
2. Professional development requirements.
3. Officer’s preferences.
(2) Captain.
(a) Officers generally attend the CCC at their 4th YOS that currently corresponds with promotion to captain. CCC
will be TDY and return, TCS, or PCS as determined by the needs of the Army, unit force stabilization or life cycle
stabilization and follow-on assignment. Captains must aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience that
will prepare them for duties at the rank of major. Assignments will be based on the needs of the Army, professional
development requirements, and officer’s preferences. Officers can expect operating and generating force assignments
and become fully developed HR captains after the following:
1. Possess bachelor’s degree.
2. Complete CCC.
3. Serve a minimum of 24 months in at least one HR technical/operational assignment.
4. Band officers must complete a minimum of 24 months in any 42C position.
(b) Completion of the CCC and an assignment in any of the positions below is critical in providing the skill base
and experience required of a captain before obtaining the rank of major.
1. Battalion S–1/adjutant.
2. HR plans and operations officer.
3. Assistant HR support operations officer.
4. Brigade/BCT S–1/adjutant.
5. Administrative officer.
6. Division/corps G–1 HR officer.
7. Division/corps G–1 PASR/PRM officer.
8. Postal officer.
9. 42 coded company/detachment commander.
10. 42 coded operations officer.
11. Staff bands officer, associate bandmaster, and band commander (42C) or company commander at the U.S. Army
School of Music.
(c) Experienced captains will receive developmental assignments that will provide them with exposure to the Army,
and in some cases, Joint organizations. The following are examples of branch generalist professional development
assignments for captains:
1. U.S. Army Recruiting Command/Branch Immaterial Command.
2. ROTC instructor.
3. USMA instructor/staff.
4. Active Army/RC duty.
5. MEPCOM duty.
6. AG school staff/faculty.
7. ACOM/Army/Joint staff assignments.
(d) Other nominative assignments are as follows:
1. DA, AHRC/Army Staff.
2. Observer/controller.
3. During the 7th YOS, an officer will submit to AHRC via AKO online their preference for FA designation.
(e) Certain FAs may assess a limited number of AG officers during the 4th YOS. The Army Acquisition Corps and

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

355

the Foreign Area officer program may assess a limited number of AG officers during the 4th YOS. Designation is
based upon an officer’s desires, qualifications, and needs of the Army. HR officers are encouraged to gain experience
in a variety of assignments within the functionally aligned force sustainment functional category within OPMS. During
functional designation, HR officers may request to remain within AOC 42H or may seek other opportunities within
other FAs. Recommended FAs for HR officers moving outside the force sustainment functional category are public
affairs (FA 46), operations research/systems analysis (FA 49), force management (FA 50), and information systems
management (FA 53). Non-HR officers will enter the HR AOC in the 7th year during the FDB process, and will be
rapidly transitioned into the HR AOC. Military schooling in support of the FA will be scheduled when applicable to
give HR officers every opportunity to become qualified in their FA (HR AOC for newly arriving officers and others
for departing officers).
(3) Major.
(a) All Majors in the HR AOC, BR42B officers promoted to major and other branch officers who entered the HR
AOC at the 7th year through FDB become AOC 42H and serve within the force sustainment functionally-aligned
grouping of officers. Majors will compete for promotion and schooling based on the functionally aligned categories of:
MF&E, operations support, and force sustainment. AOC 42H officers will compete in the force sustainment category.
Majors must complete ILE requirements and become JPME I certified. Majors (except 42C) should complete at least
one technical assignment as a Major to enhance their competitiveness for promotion to lieutenant colonel and to
prepare for potential Service as a CSL-selected division G–1 or battalion commander.
(b) The following are considered desired key developmental positions for majors:
1. Brigade/BCT S–1.
2. Sustainment brigade HR support operations officer.
3. Deputy division G–1.
4. HR company commander.
5. Division/corps G–1 plans and operations officer.
6. HRSC team chief.
7. ASCC/ARMY, ACOM G–1 staff officer.
8. J–1 staff officer.
9. DA G–1 staff officer.
10. EO officer.
11. Personnel officer.
12. Personnel readiness officer.
13. Battalion XO.
14. Service school instructor/staff/faculty/AHRC staff officer.
15. Army Staff or Joint staff officer
16. MEPS commander.
17. Band commander, XO, associate bandmaster, or staff bands officer majors may also serve in the following
branch immaterial developmental assignments: USAREC battalion XO, ROTC Assistant Professor of Military Science,
USMA faculty/staff, CGSC/CAC faculty/staff, Inspector General, or multinational/coalition trainer or staff officer.
Majors must exercise continuous self-development to master fully all aspects of operations to include functional HR,
branch generalist, and Joint and multinational operations. Self-development may include correspondence courses,
civilian education, and institutional training. Officers must devote time to a professional reading program to broaden
their multi-functional, full spectrum operational perspective. As stated earlier, skills and experience will drive an
officer’s career path and future assignments. The goal of the branch is to develop an inventory of field grade officers
who embody a collective knowledge of JIIM experience. While not every officer will receive an assignment in a
qualifying Joint assignment or serve a fellowship in a JIIM agency, the goal is to provide the maximum opportunity for
HR majors to receive JIIM experience. However, this will be dependent on Army demands and position/fellowship
availability.
(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Officers selected for lieutenant colonel in the force sustainment category should seek assignments of greater
responsibility in the HR AOC and branch/FA generalist positions. The HR AOC lieutenant colonel can expect
assignments in senior level staff positions and limited commands. The key education requirement for lieutenant
colonels is completion of a SSC. Officers should seek to become Joint duty qualified to enhance their competitiveness
for promotion to colonel.
(b) Lieutenant colonels should complete at least 24 months in any HR-coded position and/or complete an assignment as one of the following key and developmental positions:
(c) Division G–1.
(d) Deputy Director, HRSC.
(e) Division Chief, HRSC.
(f) MMT, Director.

months or longer (42C).
(5) Colonel phase.
(a) HR AOC colonels in the force sustainment category can expect to be assigned to senior staff positions where
they serve in a variety of AOC, branch/FA generalist and Joint positions. The vast majority of colonel level
assignments are in table of distribution and allowance (TDA) organizations.
(b) Colonels should serve 24 months in any AOC 42H coded position. Recommended KD assignments are—
1. HRSC, Director.
2. Corps G–1.
3. ASCC G–1.
4. ACOM G–1.
5. DA G–1 Division Chief, Deputy Director.
6. Executive officer, DA G–1.

11. Band officers will serve as the Commander, The U.S. Army Band or Commander, The U.S. Army Field Band
(time in position to be determined by AG Branch).
b. HR WO qualification and development. HR technicians provide expertise in human resource/military personnel
management systems and human resource/military personnel information management systems from company to
HQDA level. Adjutant General’s Corps WO bandmasters (420C) are commanders and primary trainers of direct
support bands at the installation, division, corps, and ACOM level. WO bandmasters also serve in key staff positions
and as associate bandmasters of the Special bands (see fig 36–2, below).

1. Complete the WOSSC not later than one year after promotion to CW5.
2. Serve as course director for the bandmaster WOBC and WOAC at the U.S. Army School of Music, or the CWO
of Army bands/proponency officer at the Adjutant General School.
c. Branch/FA generalist assignments. All HR officers will serve branch/FA generalist positions, such as instructors
and IGs, during various stages in their career. Moreover, officer branch/FA generalist assignments allow the Army the
flexibility to fill important positions from any one of the functionally aligned groupings of officers. Whenever possible,
HR officers should seek branch/FA generalist positions which fill an Army requirement while professionally developing the officer, while balancing the requirement to serve in an HR AOC-coded position for a specified period at each
grade.
d. Joint assignments. HR officers can expect to be considered for Joint duty assignments. There are Joint authorizations and Joint branch/FA generalist positions for HR officers to fill worldwide. JIIM experience is critical to the Army
and is essential to fully develop individual officers for their ability to train and equip Soldiers and grow leaders and to
provide relevant and ready land power to combatant commanders and the Joint team.
e. Nominative assignments. HR officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated above.
Those assignments may include; duty with special operations forces, White House Fellows, duty with the National
Security Council, the United Nations, and other international staffs, as well as HR representatives at allied Service
schools. The spectrum of possible assignments is large and these assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and important, and requiring mature, skilled, and well-grounded officers.
36–5. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. The HR AOC has diverse assignment opportunities that allow for different career development
paths. The goal of the professional development of HR officers is to produce and sustain highly qualified, tactically and
operationally oriented officers to represent the HR community in combat and other assigned missions. Assignments in
the HR AOC will be made to develop the officer’s ability to achieve that goal. Requests from officers for assignments
that do not contribute to achieving that goal will likely be disapproved.
b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility
on the sequence of assignments. Typically, HR officers (except 42C) should seek assignments in the following order:
BOLC, brigade/BCT strength manager, company XO, battalion S–1/adjutant, postal platoon leader, R5 platoon leader,
casualty platoon leader, band XO (42C), CCC, battalion S–1, HR plans and operations officer/team leader, brigade,
division, corps, or ASCC/Army Staff, company/detachment command, associate bandmaster (42C), nominative assignment, ILE, brigade/BCT S–1, Sustainment brigade HR support operations officer, HR company commander, command
of a large Army band (42C) (as a major), Division G–1, MMT or TG R5 team leader, HRSC division chief, battalion
level command, SSC, Corps G–1, ASCC/Army G–1, HRSC Director, brigade-equivalent command or commanders of a
special band (42C).
36–6. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Key HR positions. At each grade, the amount of time spent in key or critical assignments must be monitored to
ensure that officer professional development is optimized. At the rank of captain, HR officers should serve at least 24
months in any HR assignment, which may be longer in LCM BCTs. The OPMS goal for majors is to spend 3 years in
an operational assignment with 2 years spent in either a traditional or technical AOC 42H coded position. Lieutenant
colonels and colonels selected for CSL command or key billet assignment will serve 2–3 years in the selected position.
Officers selected for garrison command may have command tours up to 3 years in length.
b. HR AOC life cycle. Figure 36–1 displays the HR AOC life cycle. Additionally, it identifies branch standards and
developmental assignments that increase promotion potential.
c. HR WO life cycle. Figure 36–2 displays an HR WO life cycle model with key developmental positions that will
provide leadership opportunities and development of technical competency.
36–7. Key Active Army officer life cycle initiatives
The following section provides branch life cycle function and highlights changes associated with implementing force
stabilization initiatives and transformation.
a. Structure. HR positions are found at all echelons in TOE and TDA organizations. The Total Army Analysis
08–13 and Force Design Update 05–02 resulted in the creation of a number of new theater HR structures that include
the HRSC, the military mail terminal team (MMT), the R5 theater gateway team, HR company headquarters and R5,
Postal plans and operations teams and platoons, and casualty platoons and liaison teams. HR officers will serve in these
newly formed organizations and will be very involved in their development of supporting DOTLMPF of these
organizations. The greatest single cause of growth for HR officers is the re-coding of TOE battalion S–1 positions from
predominant MOS (of the unit) to BR42B, HR officer. This structural change is the direct result of the Army senior
leadership’s support for HR transformation and the recognition of the criticality of placing trained HR officers at the
battalion-level in support of the transformed modular Army.

360

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

b. Acquisition. Officers will continue to be accessed through USMA, ROTC, and Officer Candidate School.
Warrants will continue to be recruited form the NCO Corps. Both officer and WO accessions are based on preference,
qualifications, and needs of the Army. The branch will also remain a recipient of branch detailed officers from combat
arms branches. The near-term accession rate for BR42B lieutenants will increase to fill newly coded S–1 and brigade/
BCT strength manager positions.
c. Officer distribution. Officers will be provided assignment opportunities to develop the skills and experience base
necessary for Service at the next higher grade. The sequencing and timing of assignments are driven by Army
priorities. The GWOT, imminent contingency operations and Army transformation are currently driving forces behind
the distribution of officers. LCM of BCTs will also continue to influence officer distribution. Generally, officers
assigned to stabilized installations will be initial entry officers from BOLC. These officers will be assigned to an
installation for approximately 7 years. During this time, the officer will complete their platoon leader and lieutenant
years. Many of these officers will then proceed to the captains’ career course and return to the same installation to
complete assignments in other KD positions. The remaining officers will be reassigned to other installations for
positions in accordance with the needs of the Army. Field grade officers will be assigned to stabilized installations for
a period of time to complete a minimum of 2 years time on station with a goal of 3 years. The officers will gain
tactical and operational experience that will benefit them and the Army in their development in future positions.
(1) Life cycle units. Officers at all levels may be assigned to life cycled units (generally BCTs) and will remain in
the unit for a minimum of 3 years. The officer will complete lieutenant developmental, captain developmental, or major
developmental assignments during this time. Officers in these units have the possibility of greater than average time in
platoon leader, S–1, or major positions. Branch detail officers will remain in their detail branch until after completion
of the assignment to the BCT.
(2) Cyclic units. The majority of the installations and EAD CSS units will be managed on a cyclic manning system.
Replacements will be sent to these units and installations periodically to maintain readiness of the units. Tour lengths
and developmental positions opportunities can vary. Branch detail officers will remain on standard branch detail time
lines.
d. Deployment. Officers are expected to be well rounded, multi-skilled leaders who must remain personally and
professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to operational and deployable units or
training organizations, readiness is imperative to success of the mission. Officers must prepare themselves and their
Families for planned and no-notice deployments. In today’s fast-paced and uncertain operating environment, Families
must be ready for multiple deployments of unknown duration.
e. Sustainment.
(1) Promotion. Skills and experience, duty performance, and adherence to HR AOC requirements are all factors that
influence promotion. Promotion rates will be determined by Army needs/DOPMA goals.
(2) OER. The OER (DA Form 67–9) requires the rater and senior rater to recommend a functional category for all
Army competitive captains thru lieutenant colonels. When recommending a functional designation for rated officers,
rating officials will consider the whole person factors such asdemonstrated performance, educational background,
technical or unique expertise, military experience or training and personal preference of the officer. Functional category
recommendations by rater and senior raters on the OER will be an important factor taken into consideration during the
functional designation process.
(3) Evaluations. Lieutenant and captain evaluations will continue to be developmental in focus and will not include
a distribution evaluation by the senior rater (ACOM, COM, BCOM). The wording of senior rater comments is
significant in the identification of the best officers for future CSL boards.
(4) Development. Officer development will occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in
operational, training and staff assignments. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly perform METL
related function during Joint and combined arms operations. These tasks include, but are not limited to development
and validation of doctrine, training, and equipment.
f. Separation. The officer separation process remains unchanged. The most current separation information can be
found on the AHRC Web page at https://www.hrc.army.mil/tagd/retire/retire.htm.
36–8. Human Resources area of concentration Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. RC (ARNG and USAR) officers play an important role in the mission of HR Corps.
The wartime effectiveness of HR is highly dependent upon the quality of HR AOC officers in ARNG and USAR units,
as well as the IRR. For guidance on RC officer development see chapter 7 (see fig 36–3, below).
(1) RC HR AOC officers are assigned to HR AOC positions in TOE units or TDA organizations at ARNG or
USAR commands where they perform the same functions as Active Army HR AOC officers. Their peacetime duties
will be similar to their wartime duties. However, they will also include those separate RC personnel management,
administrative, and operational reporting requirements unique to the ARNG and the USAR.
(2) RC career progression is often constrained by the geographic dispersion of units. Often there are not sufficient
positions in a geographic area to continue in HR AOC assignments. Planned rotation into progressively challenging

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

361

HR-related positions by RC commands is essential to producing the best-qualified HR officers. This includes assignments between the TPU organizations, IRR, and IMA positions. If geographic constraints are such that assignments to
HR AOC positions are not possible, officers are encouraged to seek qualification and assignments in another AOC with
requirements in the geographic region.
(3) Officers in the IRR may find assignments in RTU, IMA positions in active Army organizations, installations or
HQDA agencies, as well as tours of ADSW or annual training. Assignment in the IRR can also be used for completing
professional military education (PME).
(4) Job opportunities and assignments are the same for both male and female officers.

Figure 36–3. HR RC Developmental Model

b. Branch development opportunities. RC HR AOC development standards for commissioned officers are as
follows:
(1) Lieutenant phase (years 1 to 6). The BOLC II and III is the starting point for newly accessed HR officers. RC
officers should complete the resident BOLC by the 2d YOS. Officers should seek to serve in more than one unit
position during this phase allowing for maximum exposure to the diversified functions within an HR organization.
Officers are encouraged to actively participate in professional reading programs and continued corresponding studies.
(2) Captain phase (years 7 to 13). HR officers must complete either the resident CCC or the Adjutant General
Officers Advanced Course (AGOAC-RC). AGOAC-RC includes nonresident instruction and an ADT phase at the U.S.
Army Adjutant General School. Officers who have completed an OAC in a different branch may complete the

362

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

AGOAC-RC to satisfy branch requirements. During this phase, all officers are highly encouraged to pursue a specialty
related undergraduate or graduate degree.
(3) Major phase (years 14 to 21). During this phase, officers should enroll in and complete ILE education (50
percent completion of the common core curriculum required for promotion to lieutenant colonel) and pursue a specialty
related graduate degree. HR officers should seek further development in HR AOC assignments during this phase.
(4) Lieutenant colonel phase (years 21 to 26). During this phase, officers must complete ILE and should seek PME
at the SSC level. Officers may seek assignment to senior command and staff positions.
(5) Colonel phase (years 26 to 30). Assignments during this phase should provide for maximum utilization skills in
the HR AOC.
(6) RC branch development. RC branch development standards for warrant officers are as follows (see fig 36–4,
below):
(a) WO1 and CW2 phase should—
1. Successfully complete the military education requirements outlined in chapter 4
2. Complete an associate degree before eligibility for selection/promotion to CW3.
3. Serve as a branch chief in a personnel detachment (420A); or should serve as commander of a small USAR/
ARNG Army band (420C).
(b) CW3 phase should—
1. Successfully complete the military education requirements outlined in chapter 4.
2. Complete a baccalaureate degree before eligibility for selection to CW4.

individual officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions. Other assignments may include but are not
limited to White House Fellows, Army Staff, United Nations, and other international staffs, as well as Finance Branch
representatives at allied and other services schools. The spectrum of possible assignments is extensive and officers
fulfilling these assignments are characterized as highly responsible, mature, skilled, and well-grounded.
37–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. The Finance Branch has diverse assignment opportunities that allow numerous career development
paths. The goal of professional development is to produce and sustain highly tactical and technical proficient officers
who can lead, think, conceptualize, and leverage existing and future information technology.
b. Precedence. Assignments to developmental leadership positions and unit stabilization stages take precedence,
although there is flexibility on the sequence of assignments. Typically, Finance officers should seek assignments and
PME in the following order FBOLC; disbursing officer; battalion staff; FCCC; FM detachment command; FM
company executive officer; brigade or division staff; nominative assignments; ILE; Finance Corps command; battalion/
brigade operations officer (as a major); branch generalist battalion level command; Finance Corps staff officer; SSC;
branch generalist brigade level command, or Finance Corps chief.
37–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Key Finance Corps positions. Finance officers serving in command and KD positions typically serve 24 to 36
months based on stabilization stages/deployments.
b. Finance Corps Branch life cycle. Figure 37–1 displays the Finance Corps life cycle with KD assignments.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

367

Figure 37–1. Finance Active Army Developmental Model

37–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a career developmental path for finance officers to meet the Army’s needs by
providing the required number of trained, competent, and experienced finance officers who are multi-skilled leaders. To
do this, the Finance Corps must maintain an inventory of officers to provide 24 to 36 months in KD positions to
captains and majors while supporting branch generalist positions to build multifunctional officers.
b. OPMS and finance transformation. As force structure decisions emerge and actions to implement them proceed,
the number of authorized Finance Corps billets, by grade, will vary. Officers who desire more information on finance
authorizations or inventory should contact the Finance proponency office or their AHRC assignment officer.
37–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Finance Corps
HR transformation will bring change to traditional processes and procedures within the officer life cycle management
functions.
a. Structure. Finance officers will serve at diverse echelons worldwide. Branch code (BC) 44A positions exist at
various levels from FM detachments to Finance Corps, branch generalist battalions, sustainment brigades, HQDA,
Joint, and DOD agencies. The implementation of modular Army construct, unit authorizations, and position grades will
adjust to the needs and capabilities required to support the future force. Other changes are possible due to the iterative
nature of the force structure and resourcing processes as well as on-going guidance defining our transforming Army.
b. Acquire. The Finance Branch will continue to access officers from the USMA, ROTC, and Officer Candidate

368

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

School. Both the Army’s needs and branch requirements determine the amount of accessions. There are few opportunities for direct commissioning.
c. Distribute. Finance officers will continue to rotate between TOE and TDA units in CONUS and OCONUS based
on stabilization guidelines and cyclic rotations. Tour lengths of 36 months CONUS are typical.
d. Deploy. Whether assigned to TOE units with high levels of readiness or TDA organizations, all finance officers
must be trained and ready to accomplish missions across the contemporary operating environment (COE). Finance
officers may deploy with their units or as individuals to support JIIM operations.
e. Sustain. OPMS changes the manner of execution of three major actions that affect officer career development.
(1) Promotion. Once officers are designated into a functional category and associated functional groups, they will
compete for promotion within the force sustainment category.
(2) Command. Centralized selection will continue to determine who will command. Officers will compete in their
functional category and associated functional groups. The result of the command selection process is announced in the
CSL.
(3) OER. Beginning with captain evaluations, the rater and senior rater will recommend the functional category and
associated functional groups for the rated officer that best suits his or her abilities.
f. Develop. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in
troop units, operational assignments, and institutional training assignments. Lifelong learning continues to be an
essential component of officer development. The goal is to broaden the professional development of officers to expertly
apply financial management skills in support of Army, combined arms, JIIM operations. All officers selected for major
must complete ILE, and all officers selected for colonel should complete senior Service college (resident or by
correspondence).
g. Separate. The officer separation process remains unchanged.
37–8. Finance Corps Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. ARNG and USAR officers play an important role in the Finance Corps. The
wartime effectiveness of the Finance Corps depends upon the quality of the finance officers in the ARNG and USAR
finance units as well as the IRR. For overall guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7.
(1) RC finance officers are assigned to Finance Branch coded positions in TOE units or TDA organizations at
ARNG or USAR commands. They perform the same functions as Active Army finance officers. Their peacetime duties
are similar to wartime duties, except they also include personnel management, administrative and operational reporting
requirements unique to the ARNG and the USAR.
(2) Geographical dispersion of units may constrain RC career progression. Some geographical areas lack sufficient
positions to provide continued career progression in finance assignments. Planned rotation into progressively challenging finance related positions by RC commands is essential to produce the best qualified finance officers. This includes
assignment between TPU organizations, IRR, and IMA positions. If geographic constraints make assignment to finance
positions impractical, officers should consider qualification and assignment in another branch or FA required within the
geographic region they are assigned.
(3) Officers in the IRR may obtain assignments in TPU organizations, RTU, and IMA positions in Active Army
organizations, installations or HQDA agencies; as well as tours of ADSW or annual training. Assignment in the IRR
also qualifies for completing PME.
b. Branch enhancing and development opportunities. RC branch developmental standards are as follows:
(1) Lieutenant (years 1–6).
(a) The FBOLC is the starting point for newly accessed finance officers. RC officers should complete the resident
FBOLC by the end of their second year (USAR) or 18 months (ARNG) of commissioned Service. Officers should seek
to serve in more than one unit position during this phase, allowing for maximum exposure to the diversified functions
within a finance unit. Typical finance lieutenant assignments include FM detachment or FM company disbursing
officer. Officers should actively participate in professional reading programs and continue corresponding studies.
(b) RC officers who have completed a basic officer leadership course other than finance and the Finance Officer
Branch Qualification Course (FOBQC) in residence or by distributed learning will satisfy the FBOLC requirement.
(2) Captain (years 7–13).
(a) Finance officers must complete the FCCC–RC in residence or through the Total Army School System (TASS).
TASS includes nonresident instruction through distributed learning, Inactive duty for training (IDT) and ADT. FCCC
provides officers’ training that enhances their performance as staff officers and commanders. It is required for
consideration for promotion to major. All officers are highly encouraged to pursue a specialty related undergraduate or
graduate degree. Typical assignments include, but are not limited to, FM detachment command, FM company eXO,
Service school instructor, or aide-de-camp.
(b) Officers who complete a CCC in a different branch should complete the FOBQ course and FCCC–RC in
residence or by distributed learning to satisfy FCCC requirements.
(3) Major (years 14–21).
(a) During this phase, officers should enroll in and complete ILE (50 percent completion required for promotion to
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

369

lieutenant colonel) and pursue a specialty related graduate degree. Finance officers should seek further development in
finance assignments during this phase. Typical developmental assignments include but are not limited to FM company
command, FM command staff officer, Joint/ARNG/USAR headquarters staff officer; ACOM staff officer, Joint Forces
HQ staff officer; and training/combat developer (Finance School).
(b) If not previously qualified, all majors must complete the FOBQC and FCCC–RC in residence or by distributed
learning prior to being awarded BC 44A.
(4) Lieutenant colonel (years 22–26).
(a) During this phase, officers should complete ILE, if not completed, and seek professional military education at
the SSC level or developmental assignments on senior command and staff positions. Branch assignments include but
are not limited to FM command staff officer, Joint/ARNG/USAR staff officer, or total force integrator.
(b) All lieutenant colonels must complete the FOBQC and FCCC–RC in residence of by distributed learning prior to
being awarded BC 44A.
(5) Colonel (years 26–30).
(a) Assignments during this phase should provide for maximum utilization skills in finance or a functionally aligned
category. Typical developmental assignments include but are not limited to Chief, FM command, USARC, AHRC,
NGB, OCAR, or HQDA staff officers.
(b) Completion of Senior Service College is desirable.
c. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for Finance Corps officers is shown at

(5) Colonel. Colonels will primarily serve as FA 45 officers on Joint, DOD, HQDA, staffs, or may be assigned to
branch/FA generalist positions. In addition to SSC, colonels should seek the opportunity to attend the National Security
Management Course held at Syracuse University. To meet the FA 45 skills, knowledge, attributes, and experience
required at the Colonel level, a FA 45 officer must successfully meet the following criteria:
(a) Complete SSC (resident or non-resident).
(b) Complete 60 months cumulative Service as a field grade officer in FA 45 assignments.
(c) Examples of FA 45 positions at the colonel level are listed below:
1. Army comptroller.
2. Deputy Chief of Staff, Resource Management.
3. Assistant, Deputy Chief of Staff Resource Management.
4. Chief, Program and Budget.
5. Chief, Management.
6. Chief, Execution.
7. DRM.
8. Corps G8.
9. Comptroller.
10. Deputy Director, Resource Management.
11. Chief, Budget Analysis.
12. Chief, Military Personnel Appropriation.
13. Chief, Comptroller Division.
14. Deputy assistant director.
15. Deputy director investment.
16. Deputy USPFO.
17. USPFO.
18. Joint/DOD/HQDA staff officer.
19. Military assistant/XO.
20. Deputy Director for Cost Analysis.
21. Budget officer
c. Functionally aligned/branch generalist assignments. Captains and above can serve in functionally aligned/branch
generalist assignments. These are important to the Army and are within the U.S. Army Recruiting Command, U.S.
Army Cadet Command (ROTC), USMA faculty and staff, Inspector General, or RCs.
d. Joint assignments. FA 45 positions are on the JDAL. In order to be considered for selection to JSO, an officer
must have completed JPME II and a full JDA, or with a waiver, must have completed two full JDAs. Officers will be
considered for the JSO (SI 3L), in accordance with the guidelines of the HQDA Selection Designation Board. FA 45
officers are not generally considered for JDAs until selected for major. Even though Joint experience is important to
the Army and to individual officers for advancement into senior leadership positions, not all FA 45 officers will receive
Joint assignments. The goal of the branch is to develop an inventory of field grade officers who embody a collective
knowledge of JIIM experience. While not every officer will receive an assignment in a qualifying Joint assignment or
serve in a fellowship in a JIIM agency, the goal is to provide the maximum opportunity for FA 45 majors to receive
JIIM experience. This will be dependent on Army demands and position/fellowship availability.
e. Other assignments. Some FA 45 officers will have opportunities to serve in assignments in the business sector
and state governments. TWI is a unique opportunity for the FA 45 officers to work in the financial management of
robust businesses to learn the best business practices for possible implementation within the Army. Additionally, some
FA 45 officers will have the opportunity to serve in assignments outside of the FA including but not limited to White
House Fellowships, Congressional Fellowships, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) developmental assignment,
and RAND Arroyo Fellowships.
38–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
The assignment sequencing in the Comptroller FA is not as rigid as that of a basic branch. However, the professional
development of FA 45 officers has certain requirements to ensure all of the Army’s Comptroller officers are well
grounded in operations. Officers will receive their initial training through designated Comptroller training programs.
a. Preferences. The Comptroller FA has diverse opportunities that allow for numerous career development paths.
The goal of the professional development of FA 45 officers is to produce and to sustain highly qualified tactically and
technically proficient officers who are able to lead, to think, and to leverage existing and future technology in
performing resource management functions.
b. Precedence. Assignment to qualifying FAs will have precedence, although there is flexibility on the sequence of
assignments. Some comptroller FA billets will be designated as requiring advanced education; military, civilian, or

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

373

both. Officers assigned to these positions must complete the required courses prior to reporting to their duty
assignments.
38–5. Duration of officer life cycle assignments
Most CONUS assignments for comptroller FA officers are typically 24 to 36 months in length. Overseas locations and
Joint assignments will continue to require specific tour lengths. Officers desiring additional information on assignments
should contact the AHRC comptroller assignments officer, the FA 45 Proponency officer in the U.S. Army Finance
School, or the Comptroller proponency officer at the Assistance Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and
Comptroller) (ASA (FM&C)).
a. Key Comptroller career enhancing positions. Successful completion of comptroller assignments as well as
applicable level courses and education as outlined in paragraph 38–3, above, enable the officer to obtain the proper
level of required skills, knowledge, and attributes. Before consideration for assignment to a Joint command or at DOD,
FA 45 officers will have successfully completed a previous comptroller FA assignment and attended requisite training.
b. Comptroller FA life cycle. Figure 38–1, below, depicts a Comptroller FA life cycle with FA positions. Additionally, it identifies developmental assignments within the FA.

Figure 38–1. FA 45 Active Army Developmental Model

374

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

38–6. Requirements, authorizations and inventory
The Comptroller FA goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for FA 45 officers and meet the Army’s needs by
providing the required number of trained, competent, and experienced FA 45 officers with the right skills, knowledge,
and attributes. In order to accomplish this, FA 45 officers must complete FA 45 ILE and successfully perform duties as
comptrollers, DCSRMs, and other key HQDA and Army level command staff positions.
38–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Comptroller
a. Structure. FA 45 officers serve at all echelons worldwide. FA 45 positions exist in Army divisional and corps
units, headquarters staffs, Joint commands, DOD, multinational, and national agencies. The majority of comptroller
related billets will be on ACOM, HQDA, and Joint staffs.
b. Acquire. Commissioned officers comprising a particular year group are functionally designated at their 7th YOS.
The criteria for selecting an officer into FA 45 include type of civilian undergraduate degree, grade point average,
personal preference, and needs of the Army.
c. Distribute. After designation into FA 45, the career manager at OPMD, AHRC will manage all FA 45 officer
assignments.
d. Deploy. FA 45 officers must remain personally and professionally prepared to serve in operational assignments
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to TOE units or TDA organizations, all FA 45 officers must be deployable to
accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. Comptrollers may deploy with their units or as individuals to
support tasking for Joint and multinational operations.
e. Sustain. Officers will compete only within their force sustainment functional category for promotion to major,
lieutenant colonel, and colonel. FA 45 majors, lieutenant colonels, and colonels will compete for qualifying and
developmental assignments as well as military and civil schooling opportunities.
f. Develop. FA 45 incorporates a professional officer development career plan offering maximum diversity for
schooling and assignment. There are many developmental opportunities for FA 45 officers as they progress through
their careers. In addition to advanced military schooling opportunities, they are eligible for ACS through the Defense
Comptrollership Program or other accredited universities that confer a MBA. They are also eligible to compete for
TWI and various fellowship programs. For ILE credentialing, FA 45 officers will complete both the 14-week common
core course in residence at a CL site and the FA 45 ILE course in residence at Fort Jackson, SC. RC officers can attend
TASS classrooms located in CONUS and OCONUS CL sites.
g. Separate. FA 45 officers will transition from the Army to civilian status in the same manner as all other officers.
38–8. Comptroller Reserve Component officers
a. General career development. The effectiveness of RC FA 45 officers is dependent upon their assignments, quality
of training, and education. For AGR FA 45 officers, their development objectives and qualifications parallel those of
the Active Army. Other RC officers’ (TPU, IRR, IMA) career progression is often constrained by the geographical
dispersion of units. Often there are insufficient comptroller FA positions in a geographic area to accommodate all FA
45 officers. If geographic constraints are such that assignment to FA 45 positions are not possible, RC officers are
encouraged to seek qualification and development opportunities in another branch or FA required in the region.
Officers in the IRR may find assignments in RTU, IMA positions in Active Army organizations, installations or DA
agencies, tours of ADSW, or AT. Assignments in the IRR can also be used for completing PME. Junior officers must
develop a strong foundation through assignments in their basic branches before specializing in their FA. For further
guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7.
b. FA qualification and development opportunities. RC FA 45 officers perform the same general functions as their
Active Duty counterparts and most provisions of paragraphs 38–1 to 38–7, above, apply to the RC FA 45 officers.
c. Award of FA 45 designation for ARNG RC officers. ARNG officers, regardless of status (mobilization day, Title
32, or Title 10), seeking award of the FA 45 designation must apply to the human resources organization of their
affiliated state, in coordination with the State Comptroller and/or USPFO. Each individual state, territory, and the
District of Columbia holds final authority for the FA designation of affiliated commissioned officers, dependent on the
needs of the state and the organization to which the officer is currently assigned. Exceptions to policy will be handled
by each state on a case-by-case basis, in coordination with the ARNG G8. Documents substantiating successful
completion of education and experience should be included with the designation request (usually DA Form 4187).
Award of the FA 45 designation to ARNG officers will be based on one of the following combinations of educational
instruction and experience in qualified positions. Courses approved to meet educational requirements are listed below
in subparagraph 38–8c(2).
(1) Successful completion of 148.5 hours of instruction and serve 12 consecutive months in a FA 45 position listed
by rank in paragraph 38–3.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

375

(2) Successful completion of 75 hours of instruction and serve 24 consecutive months in a FA 45 position listed by
rank in paragraph 38–3.
(3) Successful completion of 40 hours of instruction and serve 48 consecutive months in a FA 45 position listed by
rank in paragraph 38–3.
(4) Selected by a designation board to attend the Defense Comptrollership Program.
d. Educational opportunities. The following are resident or distributed learning courses that satisfy FA 45 education
requirements referenced in subparagraph 38–8c(1), above:
(1) PPBES, Finance School, Fort Jackson, SC (75 hours).
(2) Resource Management Budget Course, Finance School, Fort Jackson, SC (73.5 hours).
(3) Resource Management Tactical Course, Finance School, Fort Jackson, SC (34.5 hours).
(4) Army Comptrollership Course (ACC), Syracuse University (160 hours)
(5) Defense Comptrollership Program, Syracuse University (14 months).
(6) For board selected FA 45s only—
(a) Professional Resource Management Course (PRMC) at Syracuse University (160 hours).
(b) Professional Military Comptroller School at Maxwell, AFB (240 hours).
(c) Budget Management Course, Finance School, Fort Jackson, SC (USAR, 80 hours).
(d) Fiscal Law Course (40 hours, JAG School).
(e) U.S. Department of Agriculture Graduate School Courses USDA Budget Execution Course (32 hours).
(f) USDA Budget Formulation Course (32 hours).
(g) Introduction to Federal Budgeting (24 hours).
(h) Controlling a Budget (24 hours).
(i) Budget Formulation (32 hours).
(j) Budget Justification and Presentation (24 hours).
(k) Federal Budget Process (16 hours).
(l) Budget Analysis Workshop (32 hours).
(m) Performance Measurement and Budgeting (24 hours).
(n) Budget Analysis Workshop Advanced (32 hours)..
e. Life cycle development model. The RC life cycle development model for AGR FA 45 officers closely mirrors that
of the Active Army as shown at figure 38–1, above. The life cycle development model for all other categories of RC
officers is shown at figure 38–2, below. All documented FA 45 positions are considered developmental assignments
and serve as building blocks for successful performance at the next higher grade. Some examples, but not limited to,
are listed below:
(1) Captain. Program/budget officer.
(2) Major. Program/budget officer (ACOM, HQDA, or Joint staff).
(3) Lieutenant colonel. Program/budget officer (DA, ACOM, Joint staff, or OSD).
(4) Colonel. Chief, Financial Management officer; DRM Comptroller.

Chapter 39
Judge Advocate General’s Corps
39–1. Unique features of The Judge Advocate General’s Corps
a. Mission. The mission of The Judge Advocate General’s Corps (JAGC) is to provide commanders and their staffs
with accurate, proactive legal advice on all issues affecting the Army and the Joint force, while continuing to deliver
quality legal services to Soldiers, retirees, and their Families. This legal support encompasses the six core legal
disciplines: administrative law, civil law (including contract, fiscal, and environmental law), claims, international law,
legal assistance, and military justice that, collectively, are referred to as operational law.
b. Unique functions performed by JAGC. The JAGC is a special branch of the Army (10 USC 3064) whose duties
and functions are discussed in AR 27–1 and FM 27–100.
c. Unique features of work in JAGC.
(1) The JAGC consists of the following:
(a) General officers serving as The Judge Advocate General (TJAG); The Assistant Judge Advocate General
(TAJAG); Assistant Judge Advocate General for Military Law and Operations (AJAG/MLO); the Commander, U.S.
Army Legal Services Agency (USALSA); and the Commander, The Judge Advocate General’s Legal Center and
School (TJAGLCS).
(b) Commissioned officers appointed in the JAGC

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

377

(c) WOs who are assigned to the JAGC and certified as legal administrators.
(d) Other members of the Army assigned to the JAGC.
(2) TJAG is the military legal advisor to the Secretary of the Army and all officers and agencies of the DA. Under
TJAG’s authority to direct members of the JAGC in the performance of their duties (10 USC 3037 and AR 27–1) and
to assign Judge Advocates (Article 6, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), codified at 10 USC 806; AR
614–100), TJAG recruits, selects, determines qualifications, assigns and provides legal education for members of the
JAGC. In the Office of The Judge Advocate General (OTJAG), the Personnel, Plans, and Training Office (HQDA
(DAJA–PT)) manages the JAGC under the supervision of TJAG, and represents TJAG in all Judge Advocate personnel
proponent matters in coordination with TJAGLCS. The WO of the corps represents TJAG in all WO personnel
proponent matters in coordination with TJAGLCS. Personnel policies are published annually by TJAG in publication
JAG Pub 1–1.
(3) Judge Advocates are attorneys who perform their duties under commanders of their assigned or attached
commands or under other supervisory judge advocates, such as the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA); Chief, Trial Judiciary;
or the Chief, Trial Defense Service.
(a) JAGC officers include both judge advocates and WO legal administrators. All JAGC officers receive technical
legal supervision from TJAG and from the SJAs of their higher headquarters.
(b) Only judge advocates assigned to the U.S. Army Trial Defense Service authorized to perform the functions of
defense counsel, or made available as an individual defense counsel, may provide advice and assistance to Soldiers
suspected, accused or convicted of violations of the UCMJ on matters relating to those violations or suspected
violations.
(4) As much as possible, JAGC officers perform only professional legal duties for which they are trained. They
should not perform any non-legal duties, such as officer of the day, inventory officer, range officer, casualty
notification officer, casualty assistance officer, or any other duties that would interfere with or pose a conflict of
interest with their primary assigned legal duties. For RC Judge Advocates assigned to legal support organizations, there
are circumstances where they must perform non-legal duties in supporting the unit’s mission.
(5) The JAGC branch consists of two areas of concentration with four JAGC specific skill identifiers and one WO
MOS. Judge Advocates are classified as either 27A (Judge Advocate) or 27B (Military Judge). The four JAGC specific
skill identifiers are as follows: 3D (Government Contract Law Specialist), 3F (Patent Law Specialist), 3G (Claims/
Litigation Specialist), and 3N (International Law Specialist). Warrant officers in the JAGC are officers classified as
270A (legal administrators). These officers may hold skill identifiers as follows: 3R (Force Management), 6M
(Mobilization/Demobilization Operations), 6P (Master Fitness Trainer), and 7Q (Training Development).
(6) In support of the SI 3D (Government Contract Law Specialist), the JAGC has established the Acquisition Law
Specialty Program. This program formally recognizes officers who are qualified acquisition attorneys, although they
may not meet the criteria for the SI. These officers support the acquisition process but are not members of the Army
Acquisition Corps or the acquisition work force.
39–2. Officer characteristics required
a. Competencies and actions common to all. The Army must have officers who can effectively apply the four core
dimensions of leadership: values, attributes, skills, and actions. (For additional discussion of these leadership dimensions, see FM 22–100.) The four core leadership dimensions provide the basis for what a leader must be, know, and do.
The values and attributes set the basis for the character of the leader - what a leader must be. The skills developed by
leaders establish his or her competence - what a leader must know. The actions that leaders conduct and execute
constitute leadership - what a leader must do. The leadership framework describes a leader of character and competence who acts to achieve excellence across the spectrum of operations from total war, to operations other than war, to
disaster relief and in times of peace.
(1) Leadership. All JAGC officers must be focused on leadership, not only within the legal offices, but also the
impact of legal operations on the command. Leadership training is required to be integrated into courses of instruction
at TJAGLCS (AR 600–100).
(2) Values. All Army officers are expected to live by the Army core values. JAGC officers are held to an even
higher standard because of their legal duty to advise commanders on violations of legal and ethical rules. All judge
advocates are bound by the Professional Rules of Conduct for Lawyers (AR 27–26). Attorney conduct is further bound
by the state rules of conduct in the state in which the attorney is licensed to practice law.
b. Unique Skills.
(1) Judge Advocates must have the education, training, and experience equal or similar to that required of other
members of the legal profession (10 USC 3065(e)). Under the provisions of AR 27–1, Judge Advocates must be
admitted to practice and have membership in good standing (as defined by the pertinent bar) of the bar of the highest
court of a state of the U.S., the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a Federal court located in the
districts of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or the Northern Mariana Islands.
(2) Legal administrators are WOs and must have military education and experience in military legal and operational
procedures, and demonstrate expertise in legal technology. Legal administrators must be highly motivated, possessing

378

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

tact, initiative, integrity, and mature judgment. In both garrison and tactical environments, legal administrators are
leaders, mentors, trainers, and technical and war fighting experts within their organizations. Legal administrators are a
SJA’s operational law technologist. Legal administrators play a key role in assisting the SJA and the Chief of Military
Justice with managing and executing pre-trial processing, case management, production of expert witnesses, post-trial
processing and budgets of courts-martial. Legal administrators assist the SJA and chief of operational law with
planning, organizing, and executing office participation in contingency operations, including training all attorneys,
paralegal specialists and NCOs in the execution of operational law missions. At legal offices within headquarters
exercising general court-martial jurisdiction, or at an ACOM, ASCC, or DRU, a legal administrator serves as the Chief
of the Administration Division. In this capacity, they supervise office personnel and manage office budgets, facilities,
and equipment required to support legal services in both garrison and deployed environments. As strategic and tactical
planners, legal administrators anticipate changes in the military climate, instituting changes to ensure the JAGC can
support the Army’s continually evolving missions. Within information management systems, legal administrators are
responsible for the protection of attorney-client information. Legal administrators must have extensive training in
military justice and the other core legal disciplines (administrative law, claims, civil law, and legal assistance) and
apply their knowledge in any environment. Legal administrators are also responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of
the Judge Advocate Warfighter System (JAWS) and provide the primary training for judge advocates and paralegals in
hardware and software applications necessary for remote operations or deployment.
c. Unique knowledge and attributes. Officers in the JAGC develop themselves through progressively challenging
assignments and by continuing their military and professional education. Judge advocates are individually responsible
for their professional competence.
39–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
a. Judge Advocate assignments and development. See figure 39–1, below, for judge advocate Active Army developmental model.
(1) Pre-graduate course assignments. The first JAGC assignment is not normally in the state in which a judge
advocate is licensed, attended law school or performed on-the-job training (if a Funded Legal Education Program
(FLEP) officer). New judge advocates are rotated through a variety of duties in many of the legal specialties in which
judge advocates are expected to practice. These may include, but are not limited to, legal assistance officer, claims
judge advocate, administrative law attorney, labor counselor, contract/fiscal law attorney, operational law judge
advocate, environmental law attorney, appellate attorney, instructor, JTF judge advocate, SF battalion judge advocate,
operational law (OPLAW) judge advocate/trial counsel at a BCT or support brigade, and trial or defense counsel. This
broad base of experience produces a flexible judge advocate who can deploy in support of combat operations and
provides the judge advocate with a foundation for the Judge Advocate Graduate Course. In these early assignments,
some officers will have the opportunity to supervise other attorneys, Soldiers, and civilians. Many officers serve as
defense counsel before the graduate course, although first assignment judge advocates are not normally assigned to the
U.S. Army Trial Defense Service directly from the Judge Advocate Officer Basic Course.
(2) Postgraduate course assignments. Judge advocates are usually selected to attend the Judge Advocate Graduate
Course upon selection for promotion to major. Following the graduate course, officers are assigned to field grade
positions. The JAGC provides opportunities for specialization at this point. Some judge advocates partially specialize
but continue to be generalists. Some, like many acquisition law specialty officers, focus on their specialties. Judge
Advocates also get significant opportunities for leadership and management. Judge Advocate majors can expect to
serve as brigade judge advocates at a BCT or support brigade, senior defense counsel, branch and division chiefs in
large legal offices, Deputy Staff Judge Advocates, OICs of branch offices, CJAs of non-GCMCA commands, instructors at TJAGLCS, Command and General Staff College or at West Point, or as staff and trial attorneys in the litigating
divisions in Washington D.C., other defense and Government agencies, or in the OTJAG.
(3) Senior field grade assignments. Lieutenant colonels have the opportunity to serve in more specialized assignments and in senior leadership positions. Judge Advocate lieutenant colonels have their first opportunity to serve as
military judges, regional defense counsel, or SJAs at divisions or installations. They also serve as branch and division
chiefs in the largest offices; the Office of the Judge Advocate, U.S. Army Europe; or the National Capital Region.
Judge Advocate colonels are senior trial and appellate military judges; SJAs at major installations, divisions, corps,
ASCCs, ACOMs, DRUs, or combatant commands; and division chiefs in the OTJAG and the U.S. Army Legal
Services Agency.
(4) Branch/FA generalist assignments. Judge advocates do not serve in branch/FA generalist assignments.
(5) Joint assignments. After selection for promotion to major, judge advocates may be considered for JDAs in Joint
organizations worldwide, including the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Joint staff and the combatant
commands. Joint experience is important to the Army. Due to the limited number of Joint assignments available, judge
advocates are not precluded from advancing into senior leadership positions because they lack Joint experience (see 10
USC 619a(b)(3)(C)).
(6) Other assignments. Judge advocates may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated above.
These assignments may include duty with the Department of Justice, the Department of State, and the White House.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

379

The spectrum of possible assignments is large, and these assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and
important, requiring mature, skilled and well-grounded officers. Assignments contained in subparagraphs 39–3a(5),
above, and this paragraph are collectively known as JIIM assignments.

Figure 39–1. Judge Advocate Active Army Developmental Model

b. Legal administrator qualification and development (Active Army and RC).
(1) WO1 legal administrators—
(a) Will be assigned in the Mentor Training and Experience Program (MTEP) at the current unit of assignment, or
first legal administrator assignment, after successful completion of the Warrant Officer Candidate School and before
attendance at the legal administrator Warrant Officer Basic Course (WOBC) (currently only available to Active Army
WOs). This program pairs a newly appointed WO with an experienced legal administrator preparing the individual for
the WOBC and future duty as a legal administrator.
(b) Must successfully complete the legal administrator WOBC. USAR and ARNG WO1s must complete within 2
years of appointment.
(c) See figures 39–2 and 39–3, below, for legal administrator development and utilization.

Figure 39–3. Judge Advocate RC WO Developmental Model

(5) CW5 legal administrators will be assigned to the most senior supervisory, advisory and staff positions in the
TJAG, the U.S. Army Legal Services Agency, or TJAGLCS, and USAR and ARNG senior WO positions.
(6) See figures 39–2 and 39–3, above, for legal administrator development and utilization. In addition, legal
administrators may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated above. These assignments include
duties in Joint organizations, Army Staff or Secretariat positions, the Warrant Officer Career Center, and recruiting
positions. The assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and important, requiring mature, well-grounded,
and multi-skilled officers.
(7) Normally, USAR and ARNG legal administrators must complete all prerequisite levels of military education
applicable to legal administrators prior to selection to the next higher grade. For USAR WO promotions see AR
135–55. Also, for USAR WOs (CW2–CW4) with a DOR earlier than 1 January 2005, see Reference Memorandum,
HQ, DAAR–HR, dtd, 8 October 03, subject: Army Reserve Warrant Officer Professional Development Education
(PDE) Management Improvements. For ARNG WO promotions see NGR 600–101.
39–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Judge advocate preferences and precedence.
(1) Preferences. Under the statutory authority of TJAG to assign judge advocates (10 USC 806) and direct them in
their duties (10 USC 3037(c)(2)), TJAG closely monitors judge advocate professional development. TJAG’s frequent
inspection of military legal offices in accordance with Article 6, UCMJ (10 USC 806), offers a unique opportunity to
mentor JAGC leaders directly and to monitor how junior officers are developed.

382

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(a) All assignments are made in the best interests of the Army. The objective of the JAGC assignment policy is to
build an expert, flexible force by balancing the needs of the Army, professional development, personal and Family
needs, and personal preferences in every assignment. While personal preferences are considered, circumstances often
require that individual desires or needs be subordinated to the needs of the Army.
(b) Professional development of the judge advocate is accomplished by progressively more challenging assignments
to organizations in the field and at higher headquarters, along with opportunities for schooling. Proven performance and
potential as reflected in officer evaluation reports are the key factors in selecting the best qualified officer for an
assignment. The JAGC’s goal is to develop every officer professionally, ensure diversity of assignments, and provide
opportunities for management, leadership, and education. To ensure a diverse assignment pattern for Judge Advocates,
TJAG has been delegated waiver authority to the force stabilization requirements set forth in chapter one, section 9 of
this regulation (see also AR 600–35).
(2) Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions has precedence, although flexibility exists in the
sequence of assignments. While judge advocates participate in other military and legal training, in accordance with the
provisions of AR 27–1, TJAG has prescribed the following educational requirements that judge advocates should use
as a guide when seeking assignments:
(a) Judge advocate positions authorized the grade of captain require credit for IET as prescribed by TJAG for active
Army and RC Officers (See JAG PUB 1–1 for specific Officer Basic Course, BOLC II, and BOLC–DCO
requirements).
(b) Judge advocate positions authorized the grade of major or higher require credit for the Judge Advocate Officer
Graduate Course or the Judge Advocate Officer Advanced Course.
(c) Military judge positions require completion of the Military Judge Course at TJAGLCS in addition to the Judge
Advocate Officer Graduate or Advanced Course. Officers selected for military judge positions will be scheduled to
attend the next scheduled Military Judge Course, unless already certified as a military judge.
(d) Acquisition law specialty judge advocate positions normally require completion of the Contract Attorneys
Course, the Fiscal Law Course, and one additional contract law-related course within 36 months of first assignment to
a contract law position (whether contract law is a primary or part-time duty). The Contract Attorneys Course should be
completed first and within the first 12 months of assignment to a contract law position.
(e) Staff Judge Advocate positions require military education level (MEL) 4 and attendance at the Staff Judge
Advocate Course at TJAGLCS. MEL 4 is obtained by completing an Army ILE course or equivalent.
b. Legal administrator preferences and precedence.
(1) Legal administrators should serve in positions commensurate with their grade, though all legal administrators
should be prepared to serve in positions of greater responsibility at all times. See figures 39–2 and 39–3, above, for
legal administrator utilization.
(2) Key positions at the OTJAG, TJAGLCS, and the U.S. Army Legal Services Agency provide opportunity for
acquiring and developing additional skills in legal automation, force management, and training development.
39–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Judge advocate positions. Assignments in CONUS are normally a maximum of 3 years; however, the need to
staff all legal offices properly and to develop the careers of all judge advocates effectively can require shorter or longer
tours. Tour lengths for overseas assignments are outlined in AR 614–30.
(1) Trial defense counsels (TDS) will normally be assigned to TDS positions for 18 months. A senior defense
counsel will normally be assigned for a 2-year tour.
(2) A regional defense counsel will normally serve a 2-year tour.
(3) Lieutenant colonel SJAs and colonels serving as division and corps, SJAs will normally be assigned for a 2-year
tour. Colonels otherwise serving as SJAs will normally be assigned for a 2 or 3-year tour. Judge advocates serving in
nominative positions as either legal advisors or SJAs will normally be assigned for 3-year tours.
(4) Figures 39–1, above, and 39–4, below, display the Active Army and RC judge advocate life cycle models
respectively.
b. Legal administrator positions.
(1) WOs will ordinarily complete the minimum months assigned on station as prescribed in AR 614–30 before being
reassigned; however mission requirements may require earlier departure from an assignment. Reassignments are based
on the need to maintain an overseas rotational base, satisfy requirements for special qualifications, and provide for
career progression.
(2) RC legal administrator WOs will be assigned according to TOE and TDA units as proscribed by pertinent Army
regulations. Senior RC legal administrators (CW4 and CW5) will be managed by senior commands appointed in the
USAR and ARNG.
(3) Figures 39–2 and 39–3, below, display the Active Army and RC legal administrator life cycle models
respectively.

39–6. Requirements, authorization, and inventory
a. The goal is to maintain a healthy, upwardly mobile career path for JAGC officers. Fair, candid, and open
personnel management is critical to meeting the JAGC’s mission. Personnel management will be effective only when
interest in professional development is shared among the JAGC leadership, supervisors, and individual members of the
corps.
b. TJAG ensures that the numbers of authorized JAGC billets, by grade, will be sufficient to meet TJAG’s statutory
responsibility to provide quality legal services to the Army. Officers desiring more information on the JAGC
authorizations or inventory should contact the Personnel, Plans and Training Office, OTJAG, 2200 Army Pentagon,
Washington, DC 20310–2200.
39–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for The Judge Advocate General’s Corps
a. Structure. Judge Advocates serve at all echelons worldwide.
b. Acquire.
(1) Judge Advocates will continue to be accessed into the branch primarily by direct commissioning.
(a) Applications for appointment as a judge advocate come primarily from law school students, ROTC officers
attending law school on an educational delay, active members of the civilian bar, and Active Duty commissioned
officers seeking participation in the FLEP. On occasion officers transfer to the JAGC from other branches in the Army.
To be appointed, a person must have earned a law degree from a law school accredited by the American Bar
Association (ABA) and must be admitted to practice and have membership in good standing (as defined by the
pertinent bar) of the bar of the highest court of a state of the U.S., the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico, or a Federal court located in the districts of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or the Northern Mariana Islands.
(b) Judge advocates commissioned directly from civilian life enter Active Duty as Active Army officers. They are
awarded constructive credit for promotion for the time spent in law school. Officers who do not qualify for appointment as captains are appointed as first lieutenants and are usually eligible for promotion to the grade of captain within
7 months after entry on Active Duty.
(c) The FLEP, authorized by 10 USC 2004 and AR 27-1, allows a small number of Active Duty officers to attend
law school at Government expense. The program is available to officers with not less than two years nor more than six
years of total AFS at the time law school begins. Officers are detailed to the JAGC but remain in their basic branch
until later appointed in or assigned to the JAGC in the grade in which they are serving.
(2) Legal administrators are accessed from the JAGC enlisted corps (27D) through a board process. Soldiers serving
in MOS 27D with between 5 and 12 YOS that have excelled in a variety of JAGC positions are candidates for
accession. The Army’s goal is to access these Soldiers between five and eight years of Service in order to maximize
the amount of time they can serve prior to retirement. A waiver from the Army G–1 is required for Soldiers with a date
of rank over twelve years.
c. Distribute. TJAG (Personnel, Plans, and Training Office) manages assignments for judge advocates. The WO of
the Corps manages the assignments of Active Army legal administrators. The USAR manages the assignments of RC
legal administrators. The ARNG manages the assignments of ARNG legal administrators.
d. Deploy. JAGC officers must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all times.
Regardless of assignment, all JAGC officers must be deployable, with their units or as individuals, to accomplish
missions across the full spectrum of operations, from kinetic to counterinsurgency, to stability and reconstruction.
JAGC officers must prepare themselves and their Families for this challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustain. Judge advocates will compete within their CF for promotion to all grades. Active Army WO1 will be
promoted to CW2 after 2 years in grade on the recommendation of the first lieutenant colonel (lieutenant colonel/O–5)
in the chain of command. All other WOs, CW2 through CW5, will normally be considered for promotion to the next
higher grade by a DA promotion board, first below-the-zone after 3 years in grade and then in-the-zone after 4 years in
grade. DA publishes zones of consideration prior to each promotion board. WOs upon promotion to CW2 are
commissioned and appointed into the Active Army. For USAR WO promotions see AR 135–55. Also, for USAR WOs
(CW2–CW4) with a DOR earlier than 1 January 2005, see Reference Memorandum, HQ, DAAR–HR, dtd, 8 October
03, subject: Army Reserve Warrant Officer Professional Development Education (PDE) Management Improvements.
For ARNG WO promotions see NGR 600–101.
f. Develop. JAGC officer development is as follows:
(1) Development objective. The JAGC’s objective is to build an expert, flexible force through a comprehensive
professional development system that links challenging developmental assignments with institutional training and selfdevelopment (see figs 39–1 through 39–4, above). The JAGC expects each officer to seek and have diversity in
assignments and opportunities for specialization, management, leadership and education. Balanced professional development yields an officer who can deploy in support of combat forces and provide comprehensive legal service in the
field.
(2) Institutional training. Institutional training is comprised of both military training and legal education.
(a) TJAGCLS. TJAGLCS is the home of the regiment and is the cornerstone of the JAGC’s training and education.
Because the health of the JAGC is contingent on an intellectually vibrant educational institution that is in touch with

384

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

the field’s needs, the assignment of quality, experienced officers and noncommissioned officers to the TJAGLCS
faculty and staff is a high priority.
1. Judge Advocates. Initial Entry Training and the Judge Advocate Graduate Course. New judge advocates attend
the 12.5 week Judge Advocate Officer Basic Course (BOLC III), the Direct Commissioned officer Pre-Basic officer
Leader Course (BOLC–DCO), and the BOLC II en route to their first duty stations, although a few are assigned in a
delayed schooling status to installations before the basic course (see JAG PUB 1–1 and paragraph 39–8c, below, of this
pamphlet for more information on BOLC III, BOLC–DCO, and BOLC II). The centerpiece of junior officer professional development is attendance at the 10-month Judge Advocate Graduate Course. The Judge Advocate Graduate
Course fulfills the role of the CCC and the Branch Specific ILE Qualification Course required of basic branch officers.
The Judge Advocate Graduate Course educates career judge advocates in all areas of military law, legal communications, and management. The course prepares officers for middle and senior grade positions and also provides an
opportunity to develop specialized knowledge and skills. The Judge Advocate Graduate Course is accredited by the
ABA as a graduate legal education program and is statutorily empowered to award the only graduate law degree in
military law in the U.S. Officers incur a 2-year Active Duty Service obligation upon completion of the Graduate
Course and normally serve a 2-year utilization tour.
2. Legal administrators.
a. WOBC. The WOBC is a 4 week resident course conducted at TJAGCLS for all newly appointed WO1s (Active
Army, USAR, and ARNG). All newly appointed WO1s must attend and complete this 4–week course which prepares
the judge advocate WO for assignments as a legal administrator. Upon completion, WOs are certified and awarded the
MOS 270A, legal administrator.
b. WOAC. The WOAC is a 4-week resident course conducted at TJAGCLS which provides officers continued
leadership, tactical, and technical training needed to serve in company and higher-level positions. CW2s are authorized
to attend WOAC and attendance will be managed through the Active Army or RC branch managers. All legal
administrators prior to attending the resident phase of WOAC must complete the pre-requisite studies. The Action
officer Development Course (ST7000) is a pre-requisite prior to attending WOAC resident training. Graduates of the
WOAC receive the designation of MEL 6.
c. WOSC. The WOSC is a 4-week resident course conducted at the Warrant Officer Career Center which focuses on
the staff officer and leadership skills needed to serve in the grade of CW4 at battalion and higher levels. CW3s are
authorized to attend WOSC and legal administrators are encouraged to attend prior to promotion to CW4. Graduates of
the WOSC receive the designation of MEL 4.
d. WOSSC. The WOSSC is a 2-week resident course conducted at the Warrant Officer Career Center which focuses
on a broader Army level perspective required for assignment to CW5 level positions. CW4s are authorized to attend
and legal administrators are encouraged to attend prior to promotion to CW5. Graduates of the WOSSC receive the
designation of MEL 1.
e. Legal Administrators Course. All legal administrators (Active Army, USAR, and ARNG), should attend the
annual Legal Administrators Course which focuses on new developments in technical management and mid-level
management of Army Staff Judge Advocate Office administration, operations, and support services. Once every 3
years, USAR and ARNG legal administrators should attend the 2-week Warrant Officer Judge Advocate Triennial
Training (WOJATT) to better prepare them for their roles when back-filling Active Army legal administrators or
deploying with their units overseas.
(b) ACS. TJAG selects a limited number of Judge Advocates annually to attend civilian institutions for one year at
Government expense to obtain advanced legal education in specialized areas. This schooling supplements TJAGLCS
graduate course training. ADL legal administrators may be selected by TJAG for degree completion programs.
(c) Continuing professional education for judge advocates. All judge advocates participate in continuing legal
education throughout their careers. This training is required by many licensing states; it also keeps officers abreast of
current legal developments. Continuing legal education consists of training conducted by SJAs, military judges, and
regional and senior defense counsel; civilian training; and training provided at TJAGLCS. As judge advocates develop
professionally and become eligible for more senior assignments as military judges, SJAs, and Deputy SJAs, they attend
specialized training, which is part of their overall development. Senior judge advocates may also be offered the
opportunity for specialized management training.
(d) Other Army training for judge advocates. Judge Advocates are both officers and lawyers. Therefore, they
participate in officer training programs including the BOLC, ILE, the Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course
(AOWC), and Senior Service College (SSC). JAGC officers often attend other specialized military training such as
airborne and air assault training.
g. Separate. JAGC officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
39–8. Reserve Component Judge Advocates
a. General. Judge Advocates serve in both RCs,the USAR and the ARNG. The Judge Advocate General exercises
technical supervision of USAR JAGC officers not on the Active Duty list. The Personnel, Plans, and Training Office
assists TJAG by developing policy and providing technical assistance in the career management of USAR judge

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

385

advocate officers. TJAG, with the assistance of the National Guard Special Advisor to TJAG, through the Chief,
National Guard Bureau, also provides technical assistance to the respective State Adjutants General for the career
management of ARNG judge advocates. In general, qualifications and professional development are similar to Active
Army judge advocates. All judge advocate assignments are made upon the recommendation of TJAG (Article 6,
UCMJ, and 10 USC 806).
b. RC judge advocate career development.
(1) Professional development objectives are as follows:
(a) Development of officers with the professional attributes and capabilities to meet the mobilization and warfighting needs of the Army, and in the case of ARNG judge advocates, to meet the additional civil and defense needs of the
states and territories.
(b) Development of officers in the numbers and skills to meet the functional requirements of the Army in partial or
total mobilization, and in the case of ARNG judge advocates, to meet the additional requirements of the states and
territories.
(c) Development of officers with technical, managerial and administrative skills to serve in positions of increasing
responsibility in the JAGC.
(2) Company grade assignments. Company grade JAGC assignments should allow the officer an opportunity to
learn to be both a military lawyer and an officer. An officer at this stage of his or her career should be exposed to a
wide variety of experiences. The Army understands that at the same time the judge advocate is learning his or her
military craft, he or she is engaged in a full-time civilian career; however, high standards of participation and
performance are still required.
(a) Company grade judge advocates assigned to units should be assigned to junior positions, including OPLAW
judge advocate/trial counsel for a BCT/support brigade, legal support organization (LSO) team member or assistant
team chief, defense counsel, and various junior positions (legal assistance, administrative and civil law, trial counsel,
OPLAW) within staff and command judge advocate offices and sections. Assignment of judge advocates with less than
4 years of experience to positions where they are the sole or senior judge advocate is not advised.
(b) On rare occasions, company grade judge advocates are assigned to Drilling Individual Mobilization Augmentee
(DIMA) positions. DIMA assignments are with Active Duty divisions or installation legal offices. DIMA judge
advocate supervisors should not only provide training in military legal requirements of the position, but they should
also ensure that junior officers are exposed to Soldier experiences. When possible, supervisory judge advocates should
arrange to pair up new judge advocates with a platoon leader of a local line unit for a 1 or 2 day orientation on life as a
Soldier. Supervisors should counsel junior officers on both their legal abilities and their Soldier abilities. Junior judge
advocates in DIMA positions should be encouraged to drill, at least part of the year with a troop program unit in their
home area.
(c) Non-JAGC assignments are discouraged for all JAGC officers, but exceptions will be approved on rare
occasions. In some cases, non-JAGC assignments can be beneficial to both the JAGC and the Soldier. These
assignments may broaden the individual’s perspective concerning the mission of the Army and enhance an officer’s
ability to perform at a higher level position later in his or her career. TJAG approves request for assignment to nonJAGC positions. Such assignments are for a period not to exceed 3 years.
(d) Company grade officers should not be assigned to the IRR except in unusual circumstances. Appointment of
new judge advocates should be tied to an authorization in a unit or a DIMA position. It is generally unacceptable for
company grade judge advocates to spend 2 or more years in the IRR.
(3) Major assignments. judge advocates usually have at least 7 years commissioned Service when promoted to
major. This is a mid-level grade with opportunities to supervise other judge advocates. judge advocate majors should
serve as role models and mentors for junior officers, assisting them in developing their skills. This is also a time to
develop more specific skills and experiences to qualify for senior JAGC positions. RC JAGC majors should seek
assignments as division-level deputy SJAs, LSO team chiefs, brigade-level command judge advocates, senior defense
counsel, and general officer command (GOCOM) staff or command judge advocates or section chiefs. These assignments should follow developmental unit or DIMA experiences relating to the type of law practiced by the unit.
(4) Lieutenant colonel assignments. judge advocates usually have at least 14 years of commissioned Service when
promoted to lieutenant colonel. This is the beginning of senior level assignment and performance expectations. Officers
at this level should have the legal expertise, Soldier skills, and confidence to deal effectively with senior Army
commanders. Lieutenant colonels should serve as role models and mentors for junior officers, counseling and assisting
them in developing their skills and careers. JAGC officers should be competing for principal tenured JAGC positions,
such as division SJA, GOCOM SJA (lieutenant colonel), regional defense counsel, or military judge (lieutenant
colonel). The degree to which a judge advocate is competitive for these assignments is a function of prior developmental assignments. Developmental assignments for division SJA and GOCOM SJA (lieutenant colonel) may include the
following:
(a) Unit officers. Deputy or section chief within an SJA office, LSO team chief, brigade-level command judge
advocate, regional defense counsel, and military judge (lieutenant colonel).
(b) DIMA. SJA or deputy SJA and TJAGLCS professor or staff.

386

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(5) Colonel assignments. judge advocates usually have at least 18 years of commissioned Service when promoted to
colonel. For all but a handful of JAGC officers, this is their most senior level of Service to the Army. Development of
the officer is no longer a major professional objective. This is a period of full utilization of the officer’s talents,
experience, and training. At this level, officers should perform effectively with senior Army commanders. Colonels
lead, discipline, teach, and develop the field grade JAGC officers under their technical and command supervision. At
this level, JAGC officers, through training and experience, have prepared themselves for maximum use of their skills,
abilities and talents as Regional Readiness Command (RRC) and Regional Readiness Sustainment Command (RRSC)
staff judge advocates, legal service organization/mobilization support organization (LSO/MSO) commanders, state
judge advocates, and senior military judges. TJAG approves all colonel assignments. Prior assignments that offer the
experience necessary to succeed at some of these assignments are listed below.
(a) To succeed as an RRC/RRSC SJA or state judge advocate, officers should serve in the following:
1. Unit officers. Division SJA, GOCOM SJA, LSO commander, or military judge.
2. DIMA. Major command SJA (lieutenant colonel or colonel) or deputy SJA (lieutenant colonel), or TJAGLCS
professor or staff (lieutenant colonel).
(b) To succeed as an LSO/MSO commander, officers should serve in the following:
1. Unit officers. Division SJA, GOCOM SJA, RRC/RRSC SJA, LSO section chief, or military judge.
2. DIMA. SJA or deputy SJA of a major command.
(c) To succeed as a senior military judge, officers should serve in the following:
1. Unit officers. Military judge (lieutenant colonel), LSO commander, regional defense counsel, or RRC/RRSC SJA.
2. DIMA. USACCA (lieutenant colonel or colonel), TDS (lieutenant colonel or colonel), or TJAGLCS instructor in
criminal law (lieutenant colonel or colonel).
c. Professional development education for RC Judge Advocates. The following describes the various professional
courses available:
(1) The Judge Advocate Officer Basic Course (also known as the BOLC III). Part of the judge advocate officer IET,
this course provides an introduction to the military, JAGC orientation, and training in military law. BOLC III is a
twelve and one-half week course consisting of two phases. Phase 1 is two weeks long and is conducted at Fort Lee,
Virginia. It provides an introduction to the military, customs, and courtesies of the Service, a few basic military skills,
and an introduction to military leadership. Phase 2 is ten and one-half weeks long and is conducted at TJAGLCS in
Charlottesville, Virginia. This phase concentrates on providing new officers a foundation in military law. Officers must
complete BOLC III to become certified to practice as a judge advocate and to qualify for promotion to captain.
(2) BOLC Direct Commissioned Officers Course (BOLC–DCO). Part of the judge advocate officer IET, this course
provides a basic foundation in leadership and military skills necessary to succeed in today’s operational Army.
BOLC–DCO is a four week course taught by the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command at two installations, Fort
Sill, OK, and Fort Benning, GA, immediately upon completion of BOLC III.
(3) BOLC II. Currently optional for RC judge advocates, BOLC II is part of the Active Army judge advocate officer
IET. In FY 09, BOLC II becomes a part of the RC judge advocate’s IET. It is a rigorous, branch-immaterial course,
physically and mentally challenging, intended to build on the leadership and military skills acquired in the DCO,
ROTC, the USMA, or Officer Candidate School.
(4) JAGC Officer Advanced Course (JAOAC).
(a) This course is designed to provide a working knowledge of the duties and responsibilities of field grade JAGC
officers. This course is the non-resident version of the JAGC. This course serves as branch qualification for officers to
serve in field grade JAGC positions. Completion of the course is a prerequisite for promotion to major.
(b) The JAOAC consists of 2 legal subject phases. Phase I is a correspondence phase. Phase II is a 2-week resident
phase taught at TJAGLCS. This course should be taken between the 2d and 5th years of commissioned Service.
(5) ILE (formerly Command and General Staff College). ILE is the means by which the Army ensures universal
MEL 4/JPME 1 among majors in the active Army and RCs. The purpose of this qualification is to develop familiarity
with employment of multiservice and multinational forces used in Joint and combined arms operations; to develop
basic knowledge of the Joint operations planning process; and to create awareness of DOD requirements as well as
individual Service capabilities, problems and needs. While some RC judge advocates may be selected to attend ILE in
residence at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, most will complete the requirement through a combination of distance
education and two-week tours of Active Duty for training through TASS.
(6) Senior Service College (SSC).
(a) The AWC is a SSC designed to prepare officers for duty as commanders and staff officers at the highest levels
of the Army. The course is not a prerequisite for promotion, but enhances any officer’s ability to perform at the highest
level.
(b) The AWC Distance Education Course is a 2-year distance education program consisting of home study and two
2-week resident phases at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. Selection for this course is by a centralized board convened
by AHRC. This is the only distance education course that the Army recognizes as MEL 1 producing. Completion of
the course should occur between the 21st and 26th YOS.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

387

(7) Continuing legal education (CLE).
(a) Each year TJAGLCS offers specialized continuing legal education courses at Charlottesville, Virginia, and at
over 35 locations around the world. Taught by TJAGLCS faculty, these courses provide an essential update in a
particular field of law. RC judge advocates are required to attend this training to maintain their basic professional
competence as military lawyers.
(b) Individuals may apply for TJAGLCS resident CLE training that varies in length from 3 days to 3 weeks. These
courses provide practice oriented continuing legal education for military attorneys. TJAGLCS also provides weekend,
on-site CLE training at 20 CONUS Army locations and at selected OCONUS Army sites. Judge advocates should plan
for attendance at one CLE course each year.
(8) The Military Judge Course.
(a) The purpose of the Military Judge Course is to provide military attorneys with advanced schooling to qualify
them to perform duties as military judges at courts-martial.
(b) This is a 3-week course taught at TJAGLCS. The Chief Trial Judge, U.S. Army Trial Judiciary, selects Army
officers for attendance.
(9) The Action officer Development Course (ST7000) is a leader development, online course. It is a requirement for
all USAR WOs (regardless of MOS) that must be completed prior to enrollment in WOAC.
d. Life cycle development model. The RC judge advocate life cycle development model is shown at figure 39–4,
below.

Chapter 40
Chaplain Corps
40–1. Unique features of the Chaplain Corps
a. Unique purpose of the Chaplain Corps. The Chaplain Corps is a special branch of the Army whose mission is to
provide for the comprehensive religious support to the Army across the spectrum of operations.
b. Unique functions performed by the Chaplain Corps. Chaplains provide the religious, spiritual, moral, and ethical
support to the Army in any contingency. As religious leaders, they provide the Army community the opportunity to
participate in worship and religious educational opportunities and to receive the pastoral care and spiritual enrichment it
seeks. Chaplains preserve and perpetuate the faith-based values that often serve as the bedrock of our units and
communities. As special staff officers, they coordinate religious support activities to support the commander’s operational plans and objectives in war and peace. Similarly, they provide commanders with professional advice on the
impact of religion on military operations.
c. Unique features of work in the Chaplain Corps. Chaplains serve on the personal and special staff of the
commander and assist in ensuring that the policies and leadership practices of the command are in keeping with strict
moral, ethical, and humanitarian standards. The Chaplain advises the commander and staff on matters pertaining to
religion, morals, and morale. The senior Chaplain assigned to a unit or headquarters is normally designated the staff
Chaplain. The Chaplain is responsible to the commander for all chaplain related activities within the command. The
Chaplain exercises staff and technical supervision of the activities of the other Chaplains assigned to the headquarters.
He or she provides staff supervision for the activities of Chaplains in subordinate commands and provides commanders
and staff with advice, information, recommendations, programming, funding data, and plans concerning religious
activities, morale, chaplain, and chaplain assistant personnel matters.
(1) The Chaplain branch encompasses two AOCs; command and unit chaplain (56A) and clinical ministries
supervisor (56D).
(a) The command and unit chaplain (56A) serves as a religious leader with staff functions for unit of assignment
and to units requiring area religious coverage. The duties of Chaplains are those, which normally pertain to the clergy
profession and those, which are prescribed by law, regulations, and distinctive conditions and circumstances of the DA.
(b) The clinical ministries supervisor (56D) applies to two types of supervisors who offer specialized supervision in
the areas of clinical pastoral education (CPE) and approved supervisors for family life chaplaincy.
(2) The Chaplain Branch incorporates 7 SIs and they are as follows:
(a) Chaplaincy resources manager (corps and installation) (7F).
(b) Marriage and family specialist (7K).
(c) Chaplaincy resource manager (HQDA, HQ IMA, region, ACOM, DRU, ASCC, USACHCS) (7M).
(d) Chaplain service school instructor (7N).
(e) Hospital ministries chaplain (7R).
(f) Combat medical ministry (7S)
(g) Force management (3R).
40–2. Officer characteristics required
Chaplain officers are fully qualified members of the clergy of a religious faith group. Entry-level requirements are
established by public law, DODDs and Army regulations. Chaplains are required to possess a baccalaureate degree of
not less than 120 semester hours; have completed a master’s degree consisting of 72 semester hours (minimum) of
graduate professional study from an accredited institution in theology or approved subjects (normally validated by the
possession of a master of divinity degree, an equivalent degree or 72 semester hours); and be certified by a qualified
religious organization which has met all the administrative requirements established by the Armed Forces Chaplains
Board.
a. Competencies and actions common to all. The Army must have officers who can effectively apply the four core
dimensions of leadership: values, attributes, skills, and actions. (For additional discussion of these leadership dimensions, see FM 6–22) The four core leadership dimensions provide the basis for what a leader must be, know, and do.
The values and attributes set the basis for the character of the leader - what a leader must be. The skills developed by
leaders establish his or her competence - what a leader must know. The actions that leaders conduct and execute
constitute leadership - what a leader must do. The leadership framework describes a leader of character and competence who acts to achieve excellence across the spectrum of operations from total war, to operations other than war, to
disaster relief, and in times of peace.
(1) Values are at the core of everything the Army is and does. The Army is an institution of people with unique and
enduring values. These values must be a part of the men and women (officers, enlisted personnel, and civilians) who
are the Army. These values provide the sense of purpose necessary to sustain our Soldiers in combat and help resolve

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

389

ambiguities in operations other than war. Officers must establish and maintain an environment in the Army where
Soldiers and civilians do what is right; where individuals treat each other as they should be treated; and, where
everyone can be all they can be. There are seven Army Values (LDRSHIP).
(a) Loyalty. Bear true faith and allegiance to the U.S. Constitution, the Army, their unit and other Soldiers.
(b) Duty . Fulfill their obligations.
(c) Respect. Treat people as they should be treated.
(d) Selfless-service. Put the welfare of the nation, the Army, and their subordinates before their own.
(e) Honor. Live up to all the Army Values.
(f) Integrity. Do what’s right, legally, and morally.
(g) Personal courage. Face fear, danger, or adversity (physical or moral).
(2) There are six chaplaincy values; spirituality, accountability, compassion, religious leadership, excellence, and
diversity (SACRED).
(a) Spirituality. Seek to know God and yourself at the deepest level.
(b) Accountability. Hold one’s self and others to the moral and spiritual high ground in every area of life.
(c) Compassion. Love in word and deed.
(d) Religious leadership. Model spiritual truths wisely and courageously.
(e) Excellence. Do the best for God’s glory.
(f) Diversity. Respect the differences of others.
(3) Leader attributes are fundamental qualities and characteristics. Attributes assist in defining what an officer
should be and contribute to leader actions. Army leader attributes are described in three categories; mental, physical,
and emotional.
(a) Mental attributes describe aptitudes and capacities for learning that leaders should possess and develop. Included
in this category are will, self-discipline, initiative, judgment, confidence, intelligence, and cultural awareness.
(b) Physical attributes specify physical dispositions or aptitudes that can be nurtured and developed. Included in this
category are health fitness, physical fitness, stamina, military bearing, and professional bearing.
(c) Emotional attributes are those affective aptitudes or capacities that contribute to how one feels and substantially
contribute to leadership. Included in this category are self-control, balance, and stability.
(4) Leader skills are synonymous with competencies. They are abilities or competencies that one develops and uses
with people, with ideas, and with things. Competence is of primary importance for all Army officers. The Army
recognizes that officers must develop four types of skills.
(a) Interpersonal skills reflect competence in communicating with people.
(b) Conceptual skills refer to competence in handling ideas.
(c) Technical skills reflect competence with things.
(d) Tactical skills refer to the ability to put together technical, interpersonal, and conceptual skills and apply them to
warfighting tasks.
(5) Officers provide purpose, direction, and motivation as they influence their subordinates, operate to accomplish
their mission, and strive to improve their unit or organization. Leader actions are how Army officers act to achieve
excellence and get the job done. These actions are applicable across all levels of leadership.
(a) Influencing refers to the use of appropriate people skills to guide subordinates or teams toward mission
accomplishment. Influencing subdivides into communicating, decisionmaking, and motivating.
(b) Operating or accomplishing the mission refers to the relative short-term actions of getting the job done.
Operating divides into planning, executing, and assessing.
(c) Improving refers to the long-term investment-type actions essential to improving everything the leader influences. Improving subdivides into developing (people), building (teams), and learning.
b. Unique skills. Chaplains must fully comprehend the organization, structure and doctrine of the warfighting Army
as it evolves in the 21st Century. In addition, they—
(1) Plan and execute the commander’s master religious plan/commander’s religious program in support of the unit’s
mission.
(2) Assess the impact of indigenous religious beliefs and practices on the unit’s mission.

c. Unique knowledge. Chaplains must remain up-to-date on Army organization, structure and doctrine. They also—
(1) Possess expert knowledge of distinctive faith groups in order to perform and provide for the religious needs of
the Army’s Soldiers and Families.
(2) Remain current on developments in the civilian religious community for possible application to their area of
expertise.
(3) Understand the elements of suicide awareness and prevention.
(4) Know the characteristics of healthily marriage and Family relationships.
(5) Possess the knowledge of the dynamics of ethical decisionmaking.
(6) Assess the religious needs, prepare the commander’s master religious plan and implement and evaluate the
commander’s religious program
d. Unique attributes. Chaplains must possess the highest standards of discretion, integrity, and professional ethics. In
addition, they will—
(1) Provide religious support in a religiously pluralistic setting.
(2) Ensure the free exercise of religion.
40–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
Chaplain professional development provides skills, knowledge and experience enabling them to provide religious,
spiritual, and moral leadership and to perform staff officer functions in the Army. This is a comprehensive system that
assigns Chaplains according to the needs of the Army, and identifies and provides the training required to prepare and
sustain Chaplains for serving in these assignments.
a. Branch qualification. Upon completion of Chaplain Basic officer Leader Course (CHBOLC), Chaplain officers
are eligible for worldwide deployment in their specialty. There are no by-grade standards for Active Army Chaplains.
b. Chaplain officer Education System (OES) and branch development.
(1) Newly commissioned Chaplain. The CHBOLC provides initial entry military training for newly commissioned
Chaplains. CHBOLC consists of twelve weeks of military training divided into four modules: Chaplain’s Initial
Military Training (CIMT), Phase I (Staff officer Introduction), Phase II (Pastoral Care Training), and Phase III
(Ministry in a Combat Environment). Designed for first lieutenants, CHBOLC builds on the professional ministerial
knowledge and skills acquired in civilian institutions prior to commissioning as a Chaplain. CHBOLC equips Chaplains
with the knowledge and skills about the military necessary to perform their duties as staff officers and to provide
religious support at the battalion level. A non-combatant course, CHBOLC trains Chaplains how to conduct or provide
religious support in today’s multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, and pluralistic Army, across the full spectrum of military
operations.
(2) Captain. Chaplain captains are normally assigned to battalions. They may also serve as hospital Chaplains,
confinement facility Chaplains and installation Chaplain resource managers. Chaplains attend their branch CCC to
acquire professional development in the OES. Captains selected for promotion are eligible to enroll in the ILE course,
which further prepares them to serve as staff officers at the brigade and division level of competency. A select number
of chaplain officers will be selected annually to attend CPE in order to prepare for ministry in the hospital setting.
Chaplains become eligible once they are selected for Conditional Voluntary Indefinite (CVI) status. A select number of
Chaplain captains may be offered to participate in the DCP to prepare for specialized assignments.
(3) Major.
(a) Chaplain majors generally serve as brigade or group Chaplains, assistant division Chaplains, depot Chaplains,
Service school instructors (or staff), Family life directors, hospital Chaplains, installation and region Chaplain resource
managers, installation Chaplain training managers, and corps staff action officers.
(b) All Chaplain majors attend ILE and complete the course within their first two years in grade. Completion of ILE
qualifies Chaplain officers to serve in ILE coded positions.
(c) Some Chaplain majors will attend fully-funded civilian schooling and CPE to prepare them for Chaplain
assignments requiring additional skills.
(4) Lieutenant colonel.
(a) Chaplain lieutenant colonels serve as division staff Chaplains, HQDA, ACOM, DRU, ASCC, and region staff
action officers, installation staff Chaplains, CPE and Family life supervisors, and hospital Chaplains.
(b) A select number of Chaplain lieutenant colonels and colonels will either attend SSC in residence, or complete it
through the AWC Distance Education Program.
(5) Colonel. Chaplain colonels serve primarily as corps, ACOM, DRU, and ASCC staff Chaplains, CONUS Army
Staff Chaplains, Joint or unified command staff Chaplains, installation staff Chaplains, HQDA directors, region, and
medical center staff Chaplains. USAR chaplain colonels serve at the division and RRC levels. ARNG Chaplain
colonels serve as Joint Force HQ (formerly known as STARC) chaplains. RC Chaplains of all ranks (first lieutenant
through colonel) may serve in positions similar to Active Army.
c. Branch/FA generalist assignments. Chaplain officers do not normally serve in branch/FA generalist (formerly
branch immaterial) assignments. These assignments will be made only as an exception to policy.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

391

d. Joint assignments. Joint experience is important to the Army and valuable to the officers who serve in those
billets. Few Chaplains will have the opportunity to serve in Joint billets, and it is not a requirement for advancement to
senior leadership.
40–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. The Chaplain Branch has diverse assignment opportunities, which allow for varied career development paths. The goal of the professional development of Chaplain Branch officers is to produce and sustain highly
qualified clergy and staff officers. Assignments in the Chaplain Branch, which meet the needs of the Army, will be
made to develop the Chaplain’s ability to achieve that goal. Requests from officers for assignments that do not
contribute to achieving that goal will likely be rejected.
b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility on the
sequence of assignments. Some Chaplain officer billets will be designated as requiring advanced education, either
military or civilian. Officers assigned to those jobs must complete the required courses prior to reporting to their duty
assignments.
c. RC. RC assignments are managed on a volunteer and position vacancy basis under the guidance of senior
supervisory Chaplains at all echelons.
40–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
Most assignments for Chaplain officers will be 24 to 36 months in length. OCONUS locations will continue to require
specific tour lengths.
40–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for Chaplain officers.
b. OPMS III implementation. The number of authorized Chaplain billets, by grade, will vary as force structure
decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more information on Chaplain Branch
authorizations or inventory are encouraged to contact the branch office.
40–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Chaplain Corps
a. Structure. Chaplain officers serve at all echelons worldwide.
b. Acquire. Direct commissioning is the primary means of accessioning Chaplain officers.
c. Distribute. The Chief of Chaplains manages all Chaplain officer personnel assignments.
d. Deploy. Chaplain branch officers must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all
times. Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA organizations, all
Chaplain Corps officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. Chaplains may
deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests; or as individuals to
support Joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping missions. Chaplain
Corps officers must prepare themselves and their Families for this most challenging life cycle function.
e. Sustain. Chaplain officers will compete within the Chaplain Corps for promotion to all grades.
f. Develop. Chaplain Branch incorporates a professional officer development career plan offering diversity for
schooling and assignment. As Chaplain officers progress through their careers, in addition to advanced military
schooling opportunities, they become eligible for additional civilian training, which prepares them for specialty
positions.
g. Separate. Chaplain officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
40–8. Chaplain Corps Reserve Component officers
The Chaplain RC officer is an integral part of the Army chaplaincy. The RC, the ARNG, and the USAR, provide one
half of the uniformed force structure in the Total Army Chaplaincy. Branch qualifications and standards are the same
for the ARNG and USAR Chaplains as they are for the Active Army Chaplains.
a. General career development. Developmental patterns and objectives are the same for the RCs with the following
exceptions:
(1) Chaplain candidates are RC officers of the Staff Specialist Branch with the 00A56 (Chaplain Candidate
Program) designation. Chaplain candidates are seminary students who are working to establish their academic and
ecclesiastical credentials, in order to seek an appointment as an Army Chaplain. Their training parallels much of the
CHBOLC, while providing ministry practicum experiences and unit training. These ministry practicum include ministry
at various installations, in Army medical centers, and in the disciplinary barracks. Candidates can enter RC or Active
Army Chaplain assignments upon completing their academic and ecclesiastical credentials and receiving an endorsement from their church bodies.
(2) The CHBOLC for Reserve Chaplains is the same as the course provided Active Army Chaplains, except
CHBOLC Phase II instruction may be taken through a correspondence method for RC officers. RC promotion to
captain requires completion of all phases of CHBOLC.

392

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

(3) The Chaplain OES for RC Chaplains following CHBOLC is discussed in 40–3b, above.
b. Branch qualification and development opportunities. Even though RC officers are limited by geographical
considerations, they should strive for Chaplain assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as their
Active Army counterparts.

Chapter 41
Army Medical Department
41–1. The Army Medical Department description
The Army Medical Department (AMEDD) is a special branch of the Army whose mission is to provide health services
for the Army and, as directed, for other agencies, organizations, and military Services. Six separate officer Corps or
branches provide the leadership and professional expertise necessary to accomplish the broad Soldier support functions
implicit to the mission. Specific information on AMEDD officer professional and career development may be found in
detail in DA Pam 600–4.
41–2. Personnel management
The key to the distinctive personnel management system of the AMEDD is the six individual corps, each with a
defined mission; some with missions provided for by statute. The separate nature of the many disciplines that combine
to make the total health care delivery system dictates some diversity in approach to the management of the personnel
within that system. The AMEDD capitalizes upon the diversity of its Corps and is committed to developing and
selecting the very best qualified officers from its entire corps for key leadership positions. The Surgeon General is
responsible for AMEDD officer career management within the general policies established by the Deputy Chief of
Staff, G–1. The Director of Personnel, Office of The Surgeon General, and the Commander, AHRC manage AMEDD
officers with the advice and assistance of the six AMEDD corps chiefs and professional consultants.

Chapter 42
Army Acquisition Corps
42–1. Unique features of Army Acquisition Corps
a. Unique purpose of Army Acquisition Corps, FA 51. Effectively and efficiently develop, acquire, field, and sustain
materiel by leveraging domestic, organic, commercial and foreign technologies, and capabilities to meet the Army’s
current and future mission requirements. Army Acquisition Corps officers, in conjunction with the civilian acquisition
workforce, are primarily responsible for “materiel development”, the “M” domain in doctrine, organizations, training,
leadership, materiel, and education, personnel and facilities (DOTLM–PF). The primary purpose of the Army Acquisition Corps based on a 1989 briefing to the CSA is to “ensure excellence in product and project management.” The
Army Acquisition Corps ensures that the U.S. Army remains the best equipped Army in the world, with technological
overmatch against any opponent. FA 51, the military component of the Army Acquisition Corps, provides the
following capabilities to the Army acquisition process:
(1) Military operational experience, training, and education in one of the Army’s basic branches at the ranks of
lieutenant and captain help to ensure that military considerations are represented throughout the acquisition process.
(2) Ability to communicate and integrate effectively with warfighters.
(3) Deploys worldwide providing acquisition support in operational environments.
(4) Military leadership and planning skills.
b. Unique functions performed by the Army Acquisition Corps FA. The Army Acquisition Corps partners with
warfighters to provide materiel solutions, life cycle logistics support, and contracting support throughout the materiel
life cycle from basic research through development, fielding, and sustainment to divestment. The Army Acquisition
Corps provides acquisition support to warfighters throughout the spectrum of operations to include counterterrorism
and Homeland Security. Unique functions performed by the Army Acquisition Corps are based in statute and cannot be
performed by non-Acquisition Corps members. Applicable statute is contained in the Defense Acquisition Workforce
Improvement Act (DAWIA), consisting of 10 USC Sections 1701-1764. Unique functions performed by Acquisition
Corps officers include—
(1) Program, project and product management, and program oversight of acquisition programs of record. Title 10
USC Section 1735 contains specific requirements for program management positions.
(2) Contracting, contract management, and program integration. Title 10 USC Section 1724 contains specific
requirements for contracting positions.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

393

(3) Assignment to critical acquisition positions (CAPs) in accordance with 10 USC Section 1733, only an Acquisition Corps Member may fill a CAP. Section 1732 contains Acquisition Corps Membership criteria. Note that any
acquisition position required to be filled by a lieutenant colonel or above is automatically a CAP.
c. Unique features of work in the Army Acquisition FA. Some of the work performed by FA 51 officers can not be
duplicated by other branch or FAs. Acquisition officers oversee and manage contracts worth billions of dollars, manage
programs worth billions of dollars, and oversee technical development efforts that build the future Army. Acquisition
officers manage limited resources to satisfy warfighter requirements. Acquisition officers of all grades operate at the
tactical, operational, and strategic levels. For example, an acquisition captain or major may serve as an assistant
product manager or a systems contracting officer working with the defense industrial base on a Joint program of
strategic importance such as space and missile defense, while an acquisition major or lieutenant colonel might be
leading a deployed contracting organization providing contracting support to tactical forces engaged in combat
operations. Furthermore, acquisition officers must comply with 10 USC acquisition-specific laws, regulations, and
instructions as well as Army regulations and instructions regarding both discharge of acquisition duties and acquisition
career management that apply to no other branch or FA. It is also important to understand the difference between being
a member of the Army Acquisition Corps and being a member of the Federal Acquisition workforce, as well as some
of the terminology associated with this FA.
d. Acquisition workforce. The personnel component of the acquisition system. The acquisition workforce includes
permanent civilian employees and military members who occupy acquisition positions, who are members of an
Acquisition Corps, or who are in acquisition development programs.
e. Acquisition Corps. A subset of the acquisition workforce, composed of selected military and civilian personnel
(meeting qualification requirements) in grades of major or general schedule 13, or broadband (BB) equivalent and
above, who are acquisition professionals. There is one Acquisition Corps for each military department and one for all
the other DOD components. Just because an officer is accessed into FA 51 and the officer’s control branch is “Active
Army” does not mean the officer is a member of the Acquisition Corps. The officer must also meet the requirements
established by law to become an Acquisition Corps member. Membership in the acquisition workforce is determined
by the position an incumbent holds. Acquisition Corps membership is determined by meeting statutory requirements
for grade, experience, education, and training; not by the position an individual encumbers.
f. Acquisition CFs. There are 12 CFs within the acquisition technology and logistics (AT&L) workforce: business,
cost estimating, and financial management; contracting; facilities engineering; industrial/contract property management;
information technology; life cycle logistics; production, quality and manufacturing; program management; purchasing;
systems planning, research, development and engineering-science and technology manager; systems planning, research,
development and engineering-systems engineering; and test and evaluation.
g. AOC. An Army officer’s Acquisition career will be focused in several groupings of the CFs mentioned above.
These groupings are commonly referred to as AOC and are designated as 51A; 51C; 51L; 51S, and 51 Z. A description
of these AOCs is described in paragraph 42–3, below.
h. Certification. A required certification level is assigned to each AT&L position, and there are up to three
certification levels for each acquisition CF: Level I (basic or entry level); Level II (intermediate level); or Level III
(advanced level). In order to become certified in one of the 12 CFs, individuals will complete a process through which
it will be determined if they meet all education, training and experience standards established for a given acquisition
CF or position or for membership in the Army Acquisition Corps. (Note: Non-acquisition officers can be certified in an
acquisition CF if they meet the certification requirements, and this certification can be annotated in section X of the
officer’s ORB.) Information on certification levels may be found at the Defense Acquisition University’s Web site
http://www.dau.mil/catalog.
i. Critical acquisition positions (CAPs). CAPs are a subset of AT&L positions which are based on the criticality of
that position to the acquisition program, effort or function it supports. The FY 04 and FY 05 National Defense
Authorization Acts (NDAA) eliminated the grade requirement for civilian personnel for CAPs; however, currently the
DA only permits GS–14 or BB equivalents to occupy designated CAPs. No similar change was made for military billet
designations; all military billets at the grade of O–5 and above are required to be designated as CAPs. CAPs may only
be filled by Acquisition Corps members.
42–2. Officer characteristics required
FA 51 requires officers who are diversified, well-rounded leaders; who are experienced in the operational Army and its
doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures; who are grounded in the Army Values and display the Warrior Ethos;
who understand the challenges that face warfighters; who possess superb conceptual abilities, critical thinking, written,
and verbal communication abilities, management skills, an understanding of industrial capabilities, and financial
acumen; who possess the ability to anticipate requirements and react quickly to a rapidly changing operational and
political environment; who are cognizant of the constraints and capabilities of diverse stakeholders; who can maximize
return for the warfighter for each dollar spent; and who are committed to providing our warfighters with the best
materiel and services of any military force in the world. Additionally, there are FA unique skills, knowledge, and
attributes that require professional development and they are as follows:
a. Unique skills. FA 51 officers must strive to seek education, training, and experience to support Acquisition
394

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

Certification in two or more Acquisition CFs. Goals and requirements for officers to achieve certifications will be
discussed in detail in paragraph 42–3, below. Certification standards are set in Department of Defense Instruction
(DODI) 5000.66 and the current standards are kept in appendix B of the Defense Acquisition University catalog,
available at the following URL http://www.dau.mil/catalog/default.aspx.
b. Unique knowledge. FA 51 officers must maintain knowledge of applicable statutes, and DOD and Army
regulations and policy guidance pertaining to acquisition. Additionally, Acquisition officers need to understand current
technological developments in industry, academia, and government; implications of funding cycles and trends on
acquisition programs; earned value management, lean manufacturing, and six sigma statistical process control; systems
engineering principles; configuration management; requirements generation process; materiel fielding process; management and testing of system of systems; integration of life cycle acquisition; lead systems integration (LSI); and the
system sustainment processes.
42–3. Officer developmental assignments
a. Accession. Officers are normally accessed into the Army Acquisition Corps at the 7th YOS immediately prior to
their cohort year-group’s respective FDB. A prerequisite for accession is having held the appropriate KD positions as
outlined in the corresponding chapter of this DA Pam for their basic branch. Officers in the zone of consideration for
accession are notified by AHRC via all military personnel offices (MILPER) message, which contains the requirements, procedures, and time lines for accession. Additionally, officers may apply for an FD transfer to the Army
Acquisition Corps after being selected by the FDB, on a case-by-case basis, if they possess unique skills required by
the Army Acquisition Corps. The current strength of the gaining and losing branch/FA will also be a consideration.
Due to statutory requirements to fill CAPs, officers accessed at the ranks of major (P) and higher are required to meet
all training, education, and experience requirements to become Acquisition Corps members prior to a FD transfer being
approved.
b. Following accession. Newly accessed officers’ files transition to Acquisition Management Branch (AMB) at
AHRC; AMB handles all future assignments for FA 51 officers regardless of basic branch. Newly accessed officers
will normally complete their current tour in their basic branch prior to being trained and assigned to their first
acquisition assignment. Officers are generally expected to attend the FA 51 Basic Qualification Course (BQC) en route
to their first acquisition assignment. All Army Acquisition Corps officers in YG 94 and subsequent year groups should
complete the common core ILE and FA-specific follow on course within a 4-year window that spans their 9th, 10th,
11th, and 12th year of commissioned Service.
c. First assignment. The goal for an officer’s first assignment is to an acquisition region, in which the officer will
rotate through several jobs usually in different AOCs in order to gain diversity of experience and support certification
in multiple AOCs. Army requirements may dictate that some officers are not assigned to a region on their first
assignment.
d. Acquisition AOC. FA 51 currently manages officers in the following acquisition AOCs which are groupings of the
Acquisition CFs:
(1) 51A - Program management.
(2) 51C - Contracting, quality, and production management.
(3) 51S - Systems, planning, research, development, and engineering (SPRD&E).
(4) 51L - Life cycle logistics.
(5) 51Z - Multifunctional acquisition leader in the grades of lieutenant colonel and colonel certified in two or more
of the above AOCs (51Z is an Army Acquisition leaders’ personnel distribution tool. It is not a formal Army AOC.)
Note. ** Officers are not single-tracked into one of the above AOCs, but are expected and encouraged to seek experience in several.
Beginning with YG 99, most Acquisition officers can expect to have ample opportunities to serve in diverse assignments and most
will be expected to attain certification in both contracting and program management. Officers in YGs 99 and younger are expected
to become level II certified in at least two Acquisition CFs prior to their lieutenant colonel CSL - key billet (CSL–KB) Board in
order to be optimally prepared for lieutenant colonel CSL–KBs. Officers in year group 1999 and beyond who wish to be selected for
CSL–KB position at the lieutenant colonel and colonel level are encouraged to pursue level III certification in either program
management or contracting and level II in the other; this does not supersede the position certification requirements.

e. The AOCs are described as follows:
(1) Program management (51A). This area encompasses program management, some information technology duties,
and test and evaluation. 51A positions involve the following acquisition leadership opportunities and duties:
(a) Within specific program management assignments, officers will focus on reviewing requirements and development of system solutions; life cycle cost analysis, force structure implications, battlefield systems integration; and
associated doctrine, training, logistics, organizational and materiel implications of materiel requirements; partnering
with the warfighter during the entire acquisition process and during actual implementation of materiel solutions.
Assignments include; Army field support brigade (AFSB) staff officer, combat developer (requirements), and assistant
product manager and other program management positions.
(b) Assignments with an information technology focus will center on the research, engineering, and systems
integration of information technology; participation in mission analysis and concept development; evaluation of
competing technological approaches to battlefield systems integration; and post-deployment software support. Officers
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

395

provide leadership and management in the acquisition of software engineering solutions, simulations and modeling,
information network projects, computer systems, technical and systems architectures, and systems integration projects.
Officers are expected to maintain awareness of advances in emerging information technologies, evaluate and assess
competing technological approaches, and manage cost, schedule, and performance.
(c) Assignments with a test and evaluation focus will center on leading test teams, the design, documentation, and
execution of experiments and tests under conditions ranging from highly controlled to realistic free-play exercises in an
operational environment. Officers will coordinate with the warfighter and program offices, schedule all resources for
the test, design automated data processing support plans and instrumentation, and conduct or control the test to achieve
the objectives. They produce the test report, evaluate test data and assess the performance, utility, military suitability
and effectiveness of systems under test. Officers can expect to perform these duties CONUS and OCONUS, at
installations, test centers, program offices, and during deployments while providing acquisition support across the entire
spectrum of military operations.
(d) Typical Assignments within the 51A area include, but are not limited to the following:
1. Assistant TRADOC systems manager (ATSM).
2. Assistant project/product manager (APM).
3. AFSB plans officer.
4. AFSB systems plans/operations officer.
5. Software systems staff officer.
6. Acquisition staff/project officer.
7. Product/project manager (CSL–KB).
8. Test and evaluation director.
9. Engineering or experimental test pilot.
10. HQDA, OSD, and Joint staff.
(2) Contracting and production management (51C). Assignments with a contracting and production management
focus will center on officers leading teams that provide contracting support worldwide to contingency and noncontingency operations throughout the entire spectrum of military operations. These officers will lead contingency
contracting teams, contracting efforts for installations, and weapon systems procurement offices. They execute contract
management and production management oversight at contractor facilities worldwide. Officers coordinate with warfighters and program managers for requirements determination. These officers are responsible making determinations
on contracts awards. Contracting officers are responsible for developing contracting support plans.
(a) Assignments with a contracting focus may include contracting support to the warfighter; contract support
planning at all levels of Army operations or AFSB staff; systems and Service contracting in major buying commands,
PEOs, and Life Cycle Management Commands (LCMCs). Assignments with a production management focus may
include; full spectrum contract surveillance CONUS and OCONUS and executive plant manager liaison to contractor
LSIs. Duties may include working these specific developmental duties or leading teams that execute them (Acquisition
strategic planning; advising warfighters, program managers, and industry; determining best agreement or contract type;
performing risk analysis; forming contractual instruments; negotiating terms and conditions; obligating funds; awarding
contracts; leading contractual action post award; monitoring performance and production; and program management
front-line support in plant).
(b) Officers can expect to perform these duties, CONUS and OCONUS, at installations, system directorates,
contracting organizations; at Defense Contract Management Agency regional offices, plants and Headquarters; and
during deployments while providing full spectrum acquisition support across the entire spectrum of military operations.
Typical assignments include—
1. Contracting staff officer.
2. Contingency contracting team chief.
3. Branch Chief for Contracting.
4. Production and industrial manager.
5. AFSB Contingency Contracting Battalion Commander.
6. DCMA Plant Director.
7. DCMA Regional Director.
8. Contract Organization Director.
9. Division Chief for Contracting.
(3) Systems, planning, research, development, and engineering (51S). 51S equates to any of the Acquisition CFs of
SPRDE, to include SPRDE–STM (science and technology manager), SPRDE–SE (systems engineering), and a new CF
being considered for institution designated as SPRDE–GE (general engineering). The Army Acquisition Corps manages
51S in order to generate members of the Uniformed Army Scientist and Engineer (UAS&E) Program. UAS&E officers
possess the operational experience necessary to understand the unique environment, operational characteristics, and
technological needs of the Army. The UAS&E officer’s operational experience and quick deployability to combat
zones gives the officer different skills and duties from the civilians who make up approximately 99 percent of the

396

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

acquisition science and engineering workforce. UAS&E officers have the goal of attaining an advanced degree (masters
or Ph.D.) in a technical science or engineering field. Due to the length of schooling some UAS&E officers attend, their
career paths, and opportunities for acquisition diversity may vary from the career paths of other AOCs. UAS&E
officers should strive to rotate through program management (51A) jobs and attain program management certification
in addition to SPRDE certification.
(a) Assignments in the UAS&E program focus on linking the laboratories, the field Army, and Soldiers together to
find technological or technology based solutions for the challenges faced by warfighters. UAS&E officers spiral
technologies into existing platforms to provide real-time solutions to current operational challenges, and work on longterm technology development programs to develop the future force to ensure technological overmatch in the future.
UAS&E officers maintain awareness of advances in emerging technologies from Army and Joint labs, academia, and
the worldwide industrial base; evaluate such technologies for applicability to solving warfighting problems; and inform
combatant commanders of technological issues in operational terms. UAS&E officers translate the operational requirements of warfighters into the technical language of the scientists and engineers working in the labs and vice-versa.
UAS&E officers prepare technology support plans and integrate into all aspects of the warfighting planning process as
necessary. UAS&E officers may, on occasion, directly participate in tactical combat operations down to the squad/fireteam level in order to gain first-hand knowledge of warfighter technology requirements. UAS&E officers may field
new and/or experimental technologies directly from laboratories to units in combat to meet short-term needs, or may
conduct technology transfer/hand-off from laboratories to traditional acquisition programs.
(b) Officers can expect to perform these duties CONUS and OCONUS, at installations, CTCs; Army laboratories,
combatant command and numbered Army headquarters; international technology centers around the globe; and during
deployments while providing technical acquisition support across the entire spectrum of military operations. The
majority of UAS&E positions are currently in the AMC Research Development and Engineering Command
(RDECOM). Other UAS&E positions may be in the AFSBs, The USMA, Space and Missile Defense Command, or the
Missile Defense Agency. AS&E officers working in any AMC/RDECOM UAS&E position may be periodically tasked
to deploy as supplemental field assistance in science and technology (FAST) team members. Selected UAS&E officers
may be afforded the opportunity to attend a fully-funded Ph.D. program in two phases (refer to AR 621–1); Phase 1 is
the full-time academic phase and Phase 2 is the dissertation phase. During Phase 2, officers may be assigned to an
RDECOM laboratory to complete their dissertation while working on a topic of Army interest. Refer to paragraph
42–7, below, for more information on FA 51 science and engineering degrees. Typical assignments include—
1. Research, Development, and Engineering Center (RDEC) systems manager.
2. FAST) team member.
3. Science advisor or technology staff officer to combatant commander.
4. Technology staff officer in AFSB.
5. Advanced technology demonstration (ATD)/advanced concept technology demonstration (ACTD) assistant product manager.
6. Science or technology instructor at USMA.
7. DA/ASA(ALT) staff.
8. RDEC branch or division chief.
9. ATD/ACTD program manager or director.
10. International technology center sub-regional director.
11. RDEC systems center military deputy.
12. International technology center regional director.
13. RDEC system center director.
(4) Acquisition life cycle logistics (FA 51L). This is a new AOC for Army Acquisition Corps military members,
although it has long been a civilian Acquisition CF. The 51L AOC is being initiated to meet Army requirements for
life cycle logistics. The 51L AOC is designed primarily as a means to prepare FA 51 acquisition officers to compete
for Critical Acquisition Positions in the new LCMCs. Non-FA 51 Corps officers in the ranks of lieutenant colonel and
above who meet the requirements for life cycle logistics and wish to compete for LCMC leadership positions that are
designated as acquisition positions must seek certification in Acquisition life cycle logistics and membership with the
Acquisition Corps per DAWIA and DODI 5000.66 requirements. Leadership duties and opportunities in the 51L AOC
may include—
(a) Assistant program manager for logistics.
(b) Acquisition staff officer in an LCMC.
(c) AFSB systems plans/operations officer.
(d) Logistics division chief within a product/program management office.
42–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
a. Preferences. FA 51 has many diverse opportunities. The goal of professional development of FA 51 is to prepare
Army Acquisition Corps officers to fill CAPs; DODI 5000.66 contains specific requirements by type of CAP position.
Additionally, an officer is best prepared to fill a CAP if the officer has diverse experience and is certified in more than
DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

397

one Acquisition CF; these officers are more flexible and are more capable, by skill set and statute, to fill a wider range
of critical acquisition positions. Therefore, officers should strive to achieve a variety of experiences within each
assignment, consistent with certification requirements, experience requirements, and the pursuit of multidisciplinary
development. To facilitate diversification, the Army Acquisition Corps offers regional assignments for captains and
junior majors in order to more efficiently manage developmental assignments below the AHRC central management
level, but within oversight of AHRC. These regional assignments allow officers the opportunity to rotate to two or
more regionally managed positions within one tour of duty. Officers should ensure that their experiences are properly
recorded on their Officer Record Brief (ORB).
b. Precedence. The assignment experience required to attain the goal of certification in multiple Acquisition CFs
prior to promotion to lieutenant colonel requires careful planning and attention to an officer’s qualifications and
expertise. FA 51 officers’ career and assignment planning should include the use of the Army Acquisition Corps life
cycle model (see fig 42–1, below); direct coordination with their rater and senior rater, and coordination with their
AMB assignments officer at AHRC. Officers will be assigned to critical acquisition positions in which they have
achieved the prerequisite certifications and qualifications. Some FA 51 billets are designated as requiring advanced
education, either military or civilian. Officers assigned to those positions must possess the requisite skills or education.
c. Assignment to UAS&E positions. Available officers that are members of the UAS&E program will be the first
considered for assignment to UAS&E positions. If no UAS&E member is available, then AMB will seek the best
qualified available officer.
42–5. Duration of critical officer life cycle assignments
a. Regionalization of Army Acquisition Corps assignments. Regionalization applies to captains and majors. (Majors
within 1 year of their primary zone of consideration for lieutenant colonel will not be considered for regionalization).
Under this concept the military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology)
appoints a senior regional acquisition official (SRAO) to each established region. The SRAO will have the opportunity
to standardize professional development and increase the diversification of the officers within that region by allowing
the officer the ability and time to grow into positions of increased responsibility and positively support the GWOT,
America’s Homeland Security, and the Army’s Campaign Plan. Most assignments for Active Army, USAR, and
ARNG Army Acquisition Corps officers will be between 24-48 months in length. OCONUS locations will continue to
require specific tour lengths. Although many acquisition officers will find themselves assigned to regional assignments,
many acquisition experiences may result from non-regional tours, which are typically 24 months. It is important to
ensure that the OER and the ORB are properly annotated with all education, certification, and assignment information.
b. Army Acquisition Corps life cycle model. Figures 42–1 and 42–2, below, display an FA 51 life cycle with
standard education experiences and number and type of developmental and CAPs.

42–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
The Army Acquisition Corps goal is to prepare a sufficient inventory of officers certified and developed to fill CAPs;
therefore, we must maintain a healthy, viable career path for FA 51 officers.
42–7. Key officer life cycle initiatives for Army Acquisition Corps
a. Structure. Army Acquisition Corps officers serve within all acquisition, combat development, and research
facilities worldwide.FA 51 positions exist in TRADOC, AMC, the PEO structure, DOD, HQDA, Joint commands, and
national agencies projecting a JIIM footprint.
b. Acquire. FA 51 officers are accessed based on requirements for YG and grade, with specific targets by branch.
Accession processes are covered in paragraph 42–3, above.
c. Distribute. Following accession into FA 51, all FA 51 officer assignments will be managed by AMB and AHRC.
d. Deploy. Army Acquisition Corps officers are warfighters who may deploy worldwide at any time. Whether
assigned to Army Acquisition Corps positions in CONUS or OCONUS in Army or Joint services organizations, all
Army Acquisition Corps officers must be able to deploy to accomplish missions across the full range of military
operations. Army Acquisition Corps officers may deploy tomorrow as a member of an Army Acquisition Corps team;
or more likely they may deploy as individuals to support Joint and multinational operations other than war such as
humanitarian and peace keeping missions. FA 51 officers must prepare themselves and their Families for this most
challenging life cycle function.

DA PAM 600–3 • 11 December 2007

e. Sustain. Officers accessed into the Army Acquisition Corps will compete for promotion to lieutenant colonel and
colonel per the OPMS.
f. Develop. Diversification is the key feature of an Army Acquisition Corps officer’s development. The goal is to
expose officers to all support functions and phases of acquisition to grow well-rounded and aware leaders prepared to
lead highly complex, multifunctional organizations, and provide acquisition support throughout the full range of
military operations to the current and future force. An additional goal for Army Acquisition Corps officers is a master’s
degree in an appropriate scientific, technical, engineering, business or management field. All Army Acquisition Corps
officers may apply for the opportunity to attend fully-funded ACS. Selection to ACS is contingent upon the needs of
the Army, the officer’s promotion potential, their potential for academic success, and their career time line Approximately 10 percent of all Army Acquisition Corps officer positions are in scientific, technical, or engineering fields.
Therefore, opportunities for scientific, technical or engineering master’s degrees are offered to those with appropriate
undergraduate backgrounds.
(1) Masters level science and engineering degrees may require 18 to 24 months to complete. All non-technical
advanced degree programs attended by Army Acquisition Corps officers will normally be 12 to 18 months in length.
(2) Officers selected to pursue master’s degrees must attend regionally accredited universities. The Army Acquisition Corps has facilitated a relationship between the Defense Acquisition University (DAU) and several universities to
grant DAU equivalency credit for selected coursework at the school as well as the university accepting DAU courses
toward degree requirements. The Army Acquisition Corps has also established a partnership with the University of
Texas, Arlington, which combines an MBA academic portion with a nine-month TWI phase; known as the Industry
Graduate (IGRAD) Program. Upon completion of this 24-month program, the candidate is awarded an MBA by the
university.
(3) Officers selected to pursue science and engineering degrees are directed to attend only accredited institutions that
offer full-time programs. Masters level science and engineering courses of study normally require up to 24 months to
complete, depending upon undergraduate background. AR 621–1, paragraph 2–11f states that Ph.D. candidates may
complete PhDs in two phases; Phase 1 is up to 36 months in a fully-funded schooling earning Academic Evaluation
Reports (AERs) to complete all requirements but dissertation (“ABD”) and Phase 2 is up to an additional 24 months to
complete the dissertation phase in addition to normal duties such as instructing or other Academic Education Requirement System validated position; the officer may earn both an AER and an OER during Phase 2. The officer should be
aware that spending 36 months in a full-time school environment may put the officer at a disadvantage for promotion
boards. Officers seeking a Ph.D. must work with their academic advisor to earn their Ph.D. in as little time as possible;
the recommended time to complete Phase I is 18–24 months if possible. For more information on the Army
Acquisition Corps ACS application process and a sample listing of previously attend institutions and degrees pursued,
refer to the AMB homepage.

(5) FA 51 Leader Development Plan for captains and majors. Newly accessed acquisition officers in YGs 94 and
younger will generally attend the FA 51 BQC en route to their first assignment. Exceptions may be made for officers
who have attended equivalent training provided as part of a tailored acquisition master’s degree program, such as the
Systems Acquisition Management or Acquisition and Contract Management MBA curriculums at the Naval Post
Graduate School. The FA 51 BQC provides acquisition doctrine, lessons learned, leadership, and DAU-equivalent
training in support of level II certification in multiple Acquisition CFs. Officers in YGs 94 and younger are also
expected to adhere to the DA G–3 ILE implementation plan, which states that officers should attend ILE and an FAspecific follow-on course between their 8th and 12th year of commissioned Service. The FA 51 Intermediate Qualification Course on Acquisition Leadership (FA 51 IQC) is the Army Acquisition Corps’s FA-specific follow-on course to
ILE. FA 51 IQC is required for Army Acquisition Corps Active Duty officers who have not completed ILE by January
2006 or made sufficient progress in the legacy non-resident Command General Staff Officer’s Course (CGSOC) by
January 2006 to continue the course. As of January 2006, ILE for Army Acquisition Corps officers will consist of the
core ILE plus the FA 51 IQC. Details on the FA 51 Leader Development Plan, to include FA 51 BQC and FA 51 IQC
can be found at http://asc.army.mil/programs/LDP/default.cfm.
(6) Army Acquisition Corps officers are strongly encouraged to establish and maintain dialogue with the Acquisition
Support Center (ACS) for professional development advice and information as well as for opportunities that impact the
Army Acquisition Corps through the ASC’s proponent mission. Officers are also encouraged to maintain a dialogue
with their assignment officers at AMB, AHRC or their RC career manager. Each officer is his or her own best career
manager. Maintaining an open dialogue optimizes the opportunities for enhanced professional development training,
education, and experience.
g. Separate. FA 51 officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
42–8. Army Acquisition Corps Reserve Component officers
a. The ARNG and the USAR provide a variety of assignment opportunities for FA 51 officers. Upon mobilization
and during peacetime training assignments, officers assigned to acquisition positions must be qualified to perform as
Army Acquisition officers. Accordingly, they must meet at least the minimum education, training and experience
requirements of the Army technology and logistics workforce (AT&L WF) at their respective grade levels. The AT&L
WF represents the total Army of both the Active and RC. The ARNG and USAR contribute much to our AT&L WF in
day-to-day peacetime operations, during contingencies, and in times of mobilization. These personnel must be certified
acquisition professionals. The RC will receive education, training and acquisition work experience opportunities
comparable to that provided Active Army personnel. Differences in Active Army officers and RC officers will exist.
Acquisition RC officers are authorized to dual track rather than single track. This allows RC Acquisition officers to
acquire and maintain professional certification and provide a valuable pool of deployable assets for contingency
operations. Much of the extensive and detailed career management guidance, such as progressive and exclusive
acquisition assignments, minimum tour length, advanced schooling and command opportunities, cannot reasonably be
applied to RC officer careers. Except for Army Acquisition Corps officers who leave the Active Army and join the RC,
it is normally not possible for RC officers to acquire four full years of acquisition experience in uniform. Reserve
officers ordinarily acquire their acquisition expertise in their civilian careers, either in Government or industry.
Granting equivalent credit based on civilian experience, coupled with recurring education under the DOD financed
DAU consortium of schools/courses, will allow the RC to maintain the professional acquisition workforce needed to
support the total Army and meet the legal requirements of DAWIA (see fig 42–2, below).
b. Eligible RC officers may compete for CSL–KB positions at the lieutenant colonel and colonel level along with
Active Army officers and Army Acquisition Corps civilians. These RC officers will be slated to programs that support
the RC.
c. The ultimate goal is to create an integrated Army Acquisition Corps, ensuring the standardization of education,
training, and experiences to better integrate all components across the full spectrum of military operations.

Branch
A branch is a grouping of officers that comprises an arm or Service of the Army in which, as a minimum, officers are
commissioned, assigned, developed and promoted through their company grade years. Officers are accessed into a
single basic branch and will hold that branch designation, which is later augmented between the 5th and 6th YOS with a
functional area. An accession branch admits officers upon commissioning; a non-accession branch admits experienced
officers from the accession branches. With the exception of Special Forces, all other branches are accession branches.
Special Forces recruits officers with a minimum of 3 years experience. (See chap 15 for further discussion.) Officers
will serve their first 8 to 12 years developing the leadership and tactical skills associated with their branch. They will
continue to wear their branch insignia throughout their military Service. All career branches are in the operations CF.
Branch/functional area generalist position
An 01A or 02A-coded position that may be filled by any officer, regardless of branch or functional area designation.
This is an umbrella term used to collectively describe two subset categories defined as officer generalist and combat
arms generalist positions. (Note: Previously termed immaterial positions.)
Captains Career Course
This course is the second major branch school officers attend before company-level command. It combines the
instruction formerly taught in the branch Officer Advanced Course and the Combined Arms and Services Staff School
(CAS3). The branch phase consists of 18-weeks of branch specific technical and tactical training with integrated
common core instruction. The 6-week TDY staff process phase at Fort Leavenworth prepares officers to function as
staff officers at battalion, brigade and division level.
Career field
A specific grouping of functionally related officer, WO, enlisted and civilian positions into management categories
having a common mission area. CFs consist of officer branches and FAs, WO and enlisted military occupational
specialties and civilian occupational series. There are four CFs: operations, information operations, institutional support
and operational support. (The term CF in lower case is also a generic term commonly used by military and civilian
personnel when referring to their branch, FA, military occupational specialty or civilian occupational series.)
Career field coordinators
The senior Army leaders responsible for the oversight of the branch and FA proponents who collectively comprise their
CFs. CF coordinators are responsible to integrate, consolidate, and report professional development, force structure, and
personnel policy issues to HQDA.
Career field designation
The process whereby officers are assigned a CF. Immediately after selection for promotion to major, an officer’s file is
reviewed by a formal Career Field Designation Board. Designation is based on factors including officer preference,
rater and senior rater recommendations, education, training, and unique skills or attributes.
Combat arms generalist position
A duty position requiring a broad understanding of combined arms doctrine, training and force structure. A combat
arms generalist position is not identified with one specific branch or FA, but is limited to officers whose branches are
Infantry, Armor, Field Artillery, Air Defense Artillery, Aviation, Special Forces, and Corps of Engineers; and who are
currently managed in the operations CF. These positions are documented in TAADS with code 02A. (Note: Previously
termed combat arms immaterial positions.)
Functional area
A FA is a grouping of officers by technical specialty or skill, which usually requires significant education, training and
experience. An officer receives his or her FA between the 5th and 6th YOS. Individual preference, academic background, manner of performance, training and experience, and needs of the Army are all considered during the
designation process.
Officer generalist position
A duty position requiring a broad understanding of Army leadership, doctrine, policy, force structure and management.
An officer generalist position is not identified with or limited to one specific branch or FA, but indicates that any
officer may be assigned to the position. For example, both Armor Branch officers in the operations CF and FA 45
Comptrollers in the institutional support CF are eligible to serve in officer generalist positions. These positions are
documented in The Army Authorization Document System with code 01A. (Note: Previously termed branch immaterial
positions.)

Skill
Identifies a requirement and an officer possessing specialized skills to perform duties of a specific position that may
require significant education, training, and experience. A skill can be related to more than one branch or FA. An officer
may have more than one skill.
Special branches
A grouping of branches and officers primarily concerned with providing combat Service support and/or administration
to the Army as a whole but managed separately from combat Service support branches. Special branches include Army
Medical Department, Chaplain Corps, and Judge Advocate General’s Corps.
Strategic human resource management
A broader, more holistic perspective on personnel management that extends beyond the fundamental life cycle
functions. Strategic human resource management (SHRM) focuses on the long term vision of OPMS and links
fundamental personnel management decisions to the desired end state. SHRM links character and leader development,
the new officer Evaluation Reporting System (DA Form 67–9) and the personnel life cycle management functions
addressed in OPMS XXI. While the initial focus of SHRM is on officer personnel, SHRM will encompass the total
force of officers, warrant officers, enlisted and civilian personnel.
