Philosophy and Management
Chapter 1
Introduction
1–1. Purpose
This pamphlet serves primarily as a professional development guide for all officers. It does not prescribe the path of
assignments or educational requirements that will guarantee success, but rather describes the full spectrum of develop-
mental opportunities an officer can expect for a successful career. This document also serves as a mentoring tool for
leaders at all levels and is an important personnel management guide for assignment officers, proponents, and
Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) selection board members. Its focus is the development and career
management of all officers of the U.S. Army.
1–2. References
See appendix A.
1–3. Explanation of abbreviations and terms
See the glossary.
1–4. Current perspective
   a. Officer development for the Army should effectively balance breadth and depth of experience. Army operations
are inherently Joint. Officers must understand the terms of DODI 1300.19 and the Joint Qualification System. Officers
should focus on developmental positions that enhance career progression and lead to Joint qualified officer status. All
assignments are important to sustain a trained and ready Army. An officer’s focus should be on bringing the Warrior
Ethos to every job and every facet of their development. Officers use challenging assignments at all levels to help them
hone, through experience, what they have learned through their formal education about leading and training Soldiers.
Operational factors - the constraints of time, Army requirements, positions available, and readiness—all influence the
amount of time an officer will need to acquire appropriate leadership skills. Success will depend not on the number or
type of positions held, but rather on the quality of duty performance in every assignment. It is tied to individual
contribution, and related to the individual officer’s definition of success in the Army profession. Not all officers will be
afforded opportunities to perform all types of duty. The types and extent of duties and assignments are articulated in
the following chapters. For this publication, the term "officers" encompasses warrant officers, (warrant officers are
appointed by commission at the grade of chief warrant officer two (CW2), company grade officers, and field-grade
officers. All officers are direct representatives of the President of the United States. Chapters relating to officer
education, general promotion policies, and officer evaluation apply to all special branches as well. Specific policies
applicable to the Judge Advocate General’s Corps (JAGC), the Chaplain Corps, and the Army Medical Department
(AMEDD) are found in chapters 38, 39, and 40, respectively. The governing regulations for this pamphlet are AR
600–3 and AR 350–1.
   b. Officers are encouraged to read all branch and functional area (FA) chapters, regardless of branch, FA, military
occupational specialty (MOS), or career field held, because unique and valuable lessons in Army culture and officer
professional development are found in every chapter.
   c. This pamphlet documents officer personnel management, and incorporates the evolving philosophies of the Army
leadership. The Officer Personnel Management System (OPMS) enhances the warfighting capability of the Army;
provides all officers with the information they need to ensure a reasonable opportunity for career success; and describes
a framework that fulfills Army requirements with an officer corps balanced with the right grades and skills. Successive
personnel management studies have shown the need for a development and career management system that provides
for the career development of the warrant officer segment of our officer corps. Better integration of warrant officers
into the officer corps enhances the effectiveness and professionalism of warrant officers through improvements in
training, development, assignment, promotion, and retention practices.
1–5. Warrior Ethos and Army Values
Everything begins with the Warrior Ethos. The Warrior Ethos compels Soldiers to fight through all conditions to
victory no matter how much effort is required. It is the Soldiers’ selfless commitment to the nation, mission, unit, and
fellow Soldiers. It is the professional attitude that inspires every American Soldier. Warrior Ethos is grounded in
refusal to accept failure. It is developed and sustained through discipline, commitment to Army Values, and pride in
the Army’s heritage. Warrior Ethos is the foundation for our total commitment to victory in peace and war. It is the
conviction that military service is much more than just another job. It defines who officers are and what officers do. It
is linked to this country’s longstanding Army Values, and the determination to do what is right and do it with pride.
Soldiers enter the Army with their own values, developed in childhood and nurtured through experience. We are all
                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                                   1

shaped by what we have seen, what we have learned, and whom we have met. However, once Soldiers put on the
uniform and take the oath, they have opted to accept a Warrior Ethos and have promised to live by Army Values.
Army Values form the very identity of the Army. They are nonnegotiable and apply to everyone at all times, in all
situations. The trust that Soldiers have for one another and the trust the American people put in us demands that we
live up to these values. These values are interdependent; that is, they support one another. You cannot follow one value
and ignore another. The seven values that guide all leaders and the rest of the Army are loyalty, duty, respect, selfless-
service, honor, integrity, and personal courage. Leaders must believe in them, model them in personal actions, and
teach others to accept them. Officers require a demonstrated mastery of branch, FA, or MOS-specific skills, and
grounding in these seven values to successfully lead Soldiers in the 21st century. Officer leaders who adopt a Warrior
Ethos and a joint, expeditionary mindset will be confident that they are organized, trained, and equipped to operate
anywhere in the world, at any time, in any environment, against any adversary to accomplish the assigned mission.
1–6. The Army Profession
   a. In 2010, senior Army leadership directed the Commander, Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) to
conduct a comprehensive review of the Army profession. This Armywide assessment began in January 2011. The
purpose was to assess how the Army has changed after more than 10 years of continuous deployments and how it must
adapt to remain successful in an era of persistent conflict.”
   b. The Army Profession defined: “The Army is an American Profession of Arms, a vocation comprised of experts
certified in the ethical application of land combat power, serving under civilian authority, entrusted to defend the
Constitution and the rights and interests of the American people. “
   c. The Army Professional defined: “An American Professional Soldier is an expert, a volunteer certified in the
Profession of Arms, bonded with comrades in a shared identity and culture of sacrifice and service to the national and
the Constitution, who adheres to the highest ethical standards and is a steward of the future of the Army Profession.”
1–7. Mentoring, counseling, and coaching
   a. Today’s leaders have the critical responsibility to develop future leaders who are prepared to meet tomorrow’s
challenges. An essential component of this development is mentoring. The term mentorship refers to the voluntary,
developmental relationship between a person of greater experience and a person of lesser experience that is character-
ized by mutual trust and respect. Army Doctrine Publication (ADP) 6–22 provides additional information on
mentorship.
   b. Mentorship impacts both personal development (maturity, interpersonal and communication skills) as well as
professional development (technical and tactical knowledge, and career-path knowledge).
   c. The goal of mentorship is to assist the lesser-experienced person in reaching his or her personal and professional
potential. It is critical to understand that mentorship is not any one behavior or set of behaviors, but rather includes all
of the leader development behaviors (for example, counseling, teaching, coaching, and role modeling) that are
displayed by a trusted advisor.
   d. The strength of the mentorship relationship is based on mutual trust and respect. Assessment, feedback, and
guidance accelerate the developmental process and enhance performance. When this occurs within a mentoring
relationship, even higher performance results.
   e. Mentoring requires taking advantage of any opportunity to teach, counsel, or coach to build skills and confidence
in the mentored. Mentoring is not limited to formal, structured sessions, but can include every event from quarterly
training briefs, to after action reviews, to unstructured, casual, recreational activities. To aid in the mentorship (and
career management) process, the Army has developed and implemented the Army Career Tracker, an Army leadership
development tool that uses the professional development model (PDM) and provides a common picture of training and
experience. Used properly, this tool facilitates structured mentorship and can be utilized and revised by successive
mentors as an officer progresses in experience. Additionally, the Army Mentorship Program is an official effort to
provide additional resources for leaders and junior officers. Tools for the mentorship process may be found at http://
www.armyg1.army.mil/hr/mentorship/.
   f. One of the most important legacies that today’s senior leaders can leave with the Army is to mentor junior leaders
to fight and win future conflicts. Mentoring develops great leaders to lead great Soldiers
1–8. Officer Personnel Management System overview
   a. Historical perspective. Officer personnel management reviews and analysis have been on a continuum of
constructive change for many years. The OPMS was instituted in 1972, as a result of the U.S. Army War College
Study on Military Professionalism and a follow-on analysis directed by the Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS) for Personnel.
Numerous changes in personnel management policy were incorporated into OPMS between its implementation in 1975
and 1981. After passage of the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) by Congress in 1981, the Chief
of Staff, Army (CSA), ordered a major review to examine the impact of the legislation on OPMS policies. As a result,
OPMS II was developed in 1984 to accommodate the changes brought about by DOPMA, including the creation of
2                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

FAs, dual tracking and Regular Army (RA) integration. These and other mostly evolutionary proposals were imple-
mented beginning in 1985. Two years later, the CSA, directed a review of officer leader development to account for
the changes in law, policy, and procedures that had occurred since the creation of OPMS II. As a result of the study,
the Leader Development Action Plan was approved for implementation in 1989. Over 50 recommendations represent-
ing the latest revisions to the officer personnel system were incorporated into OPMS. The Army has undergone
significant changes with widespread affect on the officer personnel system, brought about by the drawdown at the end
of the Cold War and by major legislative initiatives. Public Law (PL) 99–433, commonly referred to as The Goldwater-
Nichols Act, required the Services to improve interoperability and provided the statutory requirements for Joint duty
assignments, Joint tour credit, and Joint military education. This law also specified the acquisition experiences and
education necessary for an officer to be the project manager of a major weapons system. This law later led to the
creation in 1990 of the Army Acquisition Corps. In 1990, PL 101–510 placed additional requirements on Acquisition
Corps officers and directed them to single track in their FA. Congressional Title XI (1993) legislation placed additional
officer requirements on the Active Army (AA) in their support of the Army National Guard (ARNG) and U.S. Army
Reserve (USAR). The Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act in 1996 brought the Reserve Component (RC)
officer promotion systems in synchronization with the Active Component (AC). This legislation established a best-
qualified promotion system for RC officers, thereby replacing the fully qualified system previously used and allowing
full integration into OPMS. With an 8-year span since the last formal OPMS review, the DCS, G–1 assembled a team
of senior field-grade officers to examine a series of OPMS-specific issues and determine whether a general review of
the entire officer system was warranted. This OPMS XXI Precursor Study Group, under the direction of Commanding
General (CG), Personnel Command (PERSCOM), now the U.S. Army Human Resources Command (HRC), ultimately
reviewed more than 60 individual issues. Based on the collective body of these issues, the DCS, G–1 recommended to
the CSA that a comprehensive review of the OPMS was necessary. As a result, the OPMS XXI Task Force convened
in July 1996, to review and recommend changes to the OPMS. Consistent with the task of developing capabilities to
meet the challenges of the next century, the CSA, instructed the task force to link their work with other ongoing Army
planning efforts. In designing the personnel system for the future, the CSA, directed that the task force also create a
conceptual framework integrating OPMS with the Leader Development System, ongoing character development
initiatives, and a new officer evaluation report. The focus was to take the Army in a direction to meet its vision of the
future instead of simply solving individual problems. The task force concluded that OPMS should incorporate a
holistic, strategic human resource management approach to officer development and personnel management. In
addition, the task force called for the creation of an officer career field-based management system composed of four
career fields: operations, operational support, institutional support, and information operations. Under OPMS XXI,
officers were designated into a single career field after their selection for major, and serving and competing for
promotion in their designated career field, from that point on in their career. The results of these strategic recommenda-
tions, approved by the Army Chief of Staff in December 1997, formed the basis for the changes to the OPMS.
   b. Current perspective. The Army continues to transform; this transformation process is ongoing and continuous in
nature. As part of the Secretary of the Army’s Human Capital Reform Initiatives, key Army stakeholders continue to
modernize the Army’s assignment and professional management systems to meet the Army’s needs, now and as the
Army adjusts to changing end strength and mission demands.
   c. Purpose. The purpose of OPMS is to enhance the effectiveness and professionalism of the officer corps. The
OPMS encompasses all policies and procedures by which Army field grade, company grade, and warrant officers are
trained, educated, developed, assigned, evaluated, promoted, and separated from active duty. The OPMS consists of
personnel management policies and procedures that assure a deployable, professional officer corps capable of meeting
the challenges of the future as embodied in Joint Operations Concepts.
   d. Coordination. The personnel proponents provide guidelines concerning career patterns and leader development, as
listed in AR 600–3. The coordinating agency for officers on the active duty list (ADL) is the Officer Personnel
Management Directorate (AHRC–OPB), 1600 Spearhead Division Avenue, Fort Knox, KY 40122–5200; for ARNG
officers, the agency is the Chief, National Guard Bureau, (NGB–ARP–PO), 111 South George Mason Drive, Arlington,
VA 22204–1382; and for USAR officers not on the ADL, the agency is the Commander, U.S. Army Human Resources
Command (ARPC–OP), 1600 Spearhead Division Avenue, Fort Knox, KY 40122–5200.
1–9. Warrant officer personnel management overview
   a. Historical perspective. Personnel management of warrant officers is the product of a number of dynamic yet
disparate systems and events. The present Warrant Officer Program was announced in DA Circular 611–7 on 12 April
1960. This publication outlined utilization policies, criteria for selection of warrant officer positions, and instructions
for conversion to the current warrant officer MOS system. However, the conception of a warrant OPMS can only be
traced back to 1966, when a study group was formed at the Department of the Army level. The group’s mission was to
develop a formal Warrant Officer Career Program, which would be responsive to future Army requirements while
concurrently offering sufficient career opportunities to attract high-quality personnel. The study group examined all
aspects of the Warrant Officer Corps and made a number of recommendations in areas such as pay, promotion,
utilization, and education. As a result of these recommendations, actions were initiated to provide more attractive
career opportunities for warrant officers. A tri-level education system was established by the end of 1972, which
                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                                  3

provided formal training at the basic or entry level for warrant officers in 59 occupational specialties, at the
intermediate or mid-career level for 53 specialties, and at the advanced level for 27 specialties. By the close of 1975,
the Army’s capability for professionally developing the Warrant Officer Corps had been significantly expanded and
warrant officers were being offered developmental opportunities not available to their predecessors. In 1974, the
Warrant Officer Division was created at PERSCOM (now HRC) to provide centralized career management for all but
The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) and AMEDD warrant officers. In the 1981 Defense Officer Personnel Manage-
ment Act, officer career management was codified, but DOPMA specifically excluded warrant officers. To fill that
void, the CSA chartered a Total Warrant Officer Study (TWOS) in 1984. The TWOS introduced a number of
substantial changes including a new definition of the warrant officer. The TWOS also resulted in requirements-based
position coding in authorization documents and a training philosophy of "select, train and utilize." The Warrant Officer
Management Act (WOMA) was introduced in Congress shortly after the publication of TWOS, signed into law in
December 1991 and is the current basis for the management of warrant officers on the ADL. The WOMA is the
warrant officer counterpart of DOPMA. It provided for management of warrant officers by years of warrant officer
service (WOS) rather than total service, automatic RA integration at the chief warrant officer three (CW3) level,
created the rank of chief warrant officer five (CW5), permitted selective retention and retirement, and eliminated the
dual promotion system. In February 1992, the Chief of Staff of the Army approved the Warrant Officer Leader
Development Action Plan (WOLDAP). The WOLDAP expanded upon the foundation of TWOS and WOMA and
provided a blueprint for the leader development of warrant officers in the Army of the future. The plan contained
specific recommendations on issues dealing with training, assignments, civil education, and other subjects for both
active and reserve warrant officers. In 2000, the Chief of Staff chartered the Army Training and Leader Development
Panel to conduct a series of studies to recommend changes to leader development education for all segments of the
Army. The Warrant Officer Study by this panel developed a further revision of the TWOS definition of warrant
officers for the future as: “The warrant officer of the Future Force is a self-aware and adaptive technical expert, combat
leader, trainer, and advisor. Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the warrant
officer administers, manages, maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment across the full range of
Army operations. Warrant officers are innovative integrators of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident
war-fighters, and developers of specialized teams of Soldiers. They support a wide range of Army missions throughout
their careers." The warrant officer specific component of OPMS features:
   (1) A structure that optimizes warrant officer utilization and provides sustainable inventories.
   (2) An acquisition program to access quality candidates in sufficient numbers, with appropriate requisite background
and skills, and at the appropriate time in the candidates’ careers.
   (3) Clearly defined warrant officer personnel policies and professional development requirements.
   (4) A means to maintain warrant officers’ technical expertise on current and new systems in their units.
   (5) Distribution of the right warrant officer to the right place at the right time. Building on the long history of WOS
to the country, the warrant officer component of OPMS provides the mechanisms for professional development and
appropriate personnel management for warrant officers throughout their careers.
   b. Current perspective. HRC discontinued consolidated management of warrant officer careers and assignments and
adopted the Army Training and Leader Development Panel recommendation to incorporate warrant officer management
into applicable individual branches. The change was contemporaneous with the base realignment and closures reloca-
tion to Fort Knox.
   c. Purpose. The purpose of the warrant officer component of OPMS is to enhance the effectiveness and profes-
sionalism of the warrant officer cohort while thoroughly integrating management practices and leader development
education within the larger field and company grade officer corps. The OPMS encompasses all policies and procedures
by which Army warrant officers are procured, trained, educated, developed, assigned, evaluated, promoted, and
separated from active duty. The OPMS assures a deployable, professional warrant officer corps capable of meeting the
challenges of the Future Force.
   d. Coordination. The personnel proponents provide guidelines concerning career patterns and leader development.
The coordinating agency for AC warrant officers is HRC, Officer Personnel Management Directorate; for ARNG
warrant officers, the Chief, National Guard Bureau (NGB–ARH), 111 South George Mason Drive, AHS2, Arlington,
VA 22204–1373; and for Reserve warrant officers, the Commanding General, U.S. Army Human Resource Command
(ARPC–OPS), 1600 Spearhead Division Avenue, Fort Knox, KY 40122–5200.
1–10. Officer Evaluation System overview
The Officer Evaluation Reporting System (OERS) is a subsystem of officer evaluations. The primary function of OERS
is to provide information from the organizational chain of command to be used by HQDA for officer personnel
decisions. This critical information is documented on the DA Forms 67–10 series (DA Form 67–10–1 (Company Grade
Plate (O1 - O3; WO1 - CW2) Officer Evaluation Report), DA Form 67–10–2 (Field Grade Plate (O4 - O5; CW3 -
CW5) Officer Evaluation Report), DA Form 67–10–3 (Strategic Grade Plate (O6) Officer Evaluation Report), DA
Form 67–10–4 (Strategic Grade Plate (O7) Officer Evaluation Report), hereafter referred to as OER) for officer
evaluations, and the DA Form 1059 (Service School Academic Evaluation Report) and DA Form 1059–1 (Civilian

Institution Academic Evaluation Report) for service school and civilian institution academic evaluations. The informa-
tion contained on these evaluation reports is correlated with the Army’s needs and individual officer qualifications to
provide the basis for officer personnel actions such as promotion, functional description, retention in grade, elimination,
retention on active duty, reduction in force, command and project manager designation, school selection, and assign-
ment. An equally important function of OERS is to encourage the professional development of the officer corps
through structured performance and developmental assessment and counseling. The OERS is an important tool for
leaders and mentors to counsel officers on the values and any specific elements of the Army Leadership Doctrine
necessary to improve performance and enhance potential.
Chapter 2
Officer Leader Development
2–1. Leader development overview
   a. The Army Leader Development Strategy defines leader development as the deliberate, continuous, and progres-
sive process—founded in Army Values—that grows Soldiers and Army civilians into competent, committed profes-
sional leaders of character. Leader development is achieved through the career-long synthesis of the training, education,
and experiences acquired through opportunities in the institutional, operational, and self-development domains, sup-
ported by peer and developmental relationships. Army leaders must be able to understand the conditions of the modern
global environment, analyze them in terms of the problems they face and re-frame them in mission command terms.
Our leaders must be able to apply problem solving and decision-making skills to defeat an enemy who presents
asymmetric threats, who is a fleeting target and embedded in the populace, who is adaptive and unpredictable, who has
the capability to shift between irregular and conventional warfare, and who is a near peer enemy capable of
conventional offense and defense operations as well. Our officers must have the leadership capabilities to fight among
the populace, and deny support to our adversaries while encouraging support to the local government. Leaders must
recognize changing operational environments and remain fully prepared to reconfigure resources to undertake a range
of altered missions.
   b. The leader and functional competencies we develop through training and experience must provide us with the
capability to successfully interact at the human level with not only our own Soldiers, but with joint, interagency,
intergovernmental, and multinational (JIIM) partners; the indigenous populace and government; and with local,
national, and international media. To develop this complex and comprehensive set of leader capabilities requires a
strategy that employs military and civilian education, leverages experience gained during assignments in operational or
generating force units, as well as during broadening assignments, and self-development activities that are broad
ranging. This strategy must produce a steady flow of talented, agile leaders who are proficient in core leader and
functional competencies across the operational themes and comfortable with risk. Leader competencies for decisive
action will expand to encompass cross-cultural communications, language, and the ability to enable economic develop-
ment, governance, and conflict resolution through negotiation.
2–2. Leader development strategy
Pursuit of the Army Leader Development Strategy employs the three domains of leader development—institutional,
operational, and self-development. These domains define and engage a continuous cycle of education, training,
selection, experience, assessment, feedback, reinforcement, and evaluation. Learning, experience, and feedback provide
the basis for professional growth. Overall, leader development enhances leader capabilities for positions of increasing
responsibility. The goal of Army leader development is to create the training, education, and experience conditions that
produce agile, innovative, and adaptive leaders of unimpeachable integrity, character, and competence who act to
achieve decisive results and who understand and are able to exploit the full potential of current and future Army
doctrine.
2–3. Domains of leader development
   a. Institutional. The institutional Army (schools and training centers) is the foundation for lifelong learning. Training
is an organized, structured, continuous, and progressive process based on sound principles of learning designed to
increase the capability of individuals, units, and organizations to perform specified tasks or skills. The objective of
training is to increase the ability of leaders to competently perform in training and operational situations. Individual
task training builds individual competence and confidence to perform these tasks in support of collective training and
operations. Education is the process of imparting knowledge and developing the competencies and attributes Army
professionals need to accomplish any mission the future may present. Education contributes to the development of
Soldier and Army Civilian leader competencies, focusing on fundamentals which are later practiced, expanded, and
improved in training and experience. Education occurs in the institutional, operational, and self-development domains.
As a component of leader development, education contributes to the growth of the three leader attributes of character,
presence, and intellect. Education focuses on intellect and moral character of leaders to improve judgment and
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                                  5

reasoning and hone the habits of the mind: agility, adaptability, empathy, intellectual curiosity, and creativity.
Education in the Army is primarily professional military education (PME) or Civilian Education System, but may
include studies within civilian academia. PME and Civilian Education System are progressive and sequential across a
career continuum to ensure that Soldiers and Army Civilians are successful at each stage of their professional service,
while continually growing in the competencies and attributes needed for higher levels of service."
   b. Operational. Operational and broadening assignments constitute the second domain of leader development. Upon
completion of institutional training, leaders are ideally assigned to operational positions. This operational experience
provides them the opportunity to use, hone, and build on what they learned through the formal education process.
Experience gained through on-the-job training in a variety of challenging assignments and additional duties prepares
officers to lead and train Soldiers, both in garrison and ultimately in combat. The commander or leader in the unit
plays a significant and instrumental role in this area. Commanders and other senior leaders are particularly responsible
for mentoring that is vital to the development of junior officers. They introduce the officer to their unit and establish
leader development programs. They explain both unit and individual performance standards, and provide periodic
assessments and continual feedback to develop the officer. Beyond accomplishing the mission on a daily basis,
developing subordinate leaders is a professional responsibility, which must be carried out to guarantee the quality of
our future leaders. Similarly, periodic assignment to broadening positions throughout the career timeline provides
officers with exposure to a different environment, presents them with opportunities to work complex problems, and
ultimately helps the Army grow strategic, adaptive, and innovative executive-level leaders capable of performing above
and beyond the tactical and operational levels. In order to maximize an officer’s ability to pursue broadening
assignments and be competitive for promotion to senior commissioned ranks, it is imperative for officers and
commanders to understand and adhere to existing guidance that limits key developmental (KD) assignments to 24
months maximum time.
   c. Self-development. Learning is a lifelong process. Institutional training and operational assignments alone do not
ensure that Army officers attain and sustain the degree of competency needed to perform their varied missions. The
profession of arms requires comprehensive self-study and training. Leaders must commit to a lifetime of professional
and personal growth to stay at the cutting edge of their profession. They must keep pace with changing operational
requirements, new technologies, common weapons platforms, and evolving doctrines. Every officer is responsible for
his or her own self-development. Self-assessment and taking appropriate remedial or reinforcing action is critical to a
leader’s success. Self-development programs include activities that stretch the individual beyond the demands of on-
the-job or institutional training. Self-development, consisting of individual study, research, professional reading,
practice and self-assessment, is accomplished via numerous means (studying, observing, and experiencing), and is
consistent with an officer’s personal self-development action plan and professional goals. Self-development is the key
aspect of individual officer qualification that solidifies the Army leader development process. A critical component of
the self-development domain is Multi Source Assessment and Feedback (MSAF). Although officers may take ample
steps to facilitate self-development, the MSAF program—also referred to as “360 degree Assessment”—helps officers
raise self-awareness and better shape their self-development efforts. The MSAF provides input from peers, superiors,
and subordinates which help the rated officer develop as a self-aware and adaptable leader. Officers can access the
“360 degree Assessment” at: http://msaf.army.mil. Results of the feedback remain confidential, are only available to the
rated officer, and are used for self-development rather than evaluative purposes.
2–4. Leader principles
Six principles are inherent in officer development and career management. These principles serve as a frame of
reference for the individual officer, commander, mentor and branch and FA proponents. These six principles are:
   a. Leader development is doctrinally based ADP 1 providing the foundation for our warfighting doctrine. It
articulates the constitutional and legal basis for our being, the national security objectives, the spectrum of warfare and
our beliefs concerning the profession of arms to include the professional Army ethic and values. ADP 3–0 is our
keystone warfighting doctrine for subordinate and tactical-level doctrine, professional education and individual and unit
training. ADP 7–0 tells us how we should train, including the senior leader’s role. ADP 6–22 outlines the core
dimensions of leadership and the basis for leadership excellence. Together, these references provide the foundation
needed to develop competent, confident leaders capable of assuming positions of greater responsibility and create the
conditions for sustained organizational success.
   b. Leader development programs should be responsive to the environment, including such factors as law, policy,
resources, force structure, world situation, technology, and professional development.
   c. An officer’s success should be measured in terms of contribution. An officer’s professional goals are directly
related to his or her own definition of success in the Profession of Arms.
   d. High-quality Soldiers deserve high-quality leaders. This principle is the heart of leader development and breathes
life into all aspects of the seven Army fundamental imperatives—training, force mix, doctrine, modern equipment,
quality people, leader development, and facilities.
   e. We recognize as a philosophy that leaders can be developed. While a principle in itself, it is inextricably linked to
the philosophy of shared responsibilities among the individual leaders; the schoolhouses, branches and FA proponents
throughout the Army; and the commanders in the field.
6                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   f. Leader development is cooperative and holistic. The individual officer, unit commanders, mentors and Army
educational institutions all share in the responsibility for developing leaders at every level.
2–5. Leader development and the Officer Education System
   a. Company and field grade officers. The Officer Education System provides the formal military educational
foundation to company and field grade officers necessary to prepare them for increased responsibilities and successful
performance at the next higher level. Its goal is to produce a broad-based corps of leaders who possess the necessary
values, attributes, and skills to perform their duties in service to the nation. These leaders must know how the Army
runs and demonstrate confidence, integrity, critical judgment, and responsibility while operating in an environment of
complexity, ambiguity, and rapid change. To build effective teams capable of supporting joint and multinational
operations in this environment, they must be adaptable, creative, and bold amid continuous organizational and
technological change. The Officer Education System is discussed in more detail here in chapter 4. The following
paragraphs highlight key aspects of officer development—
   (1) Common core. Common core is the consolidation of common skills training and training subjects prescribed by
law, Army regulations, or other higher authority. These subjects comprise the tasks all officers are expected to perform
successfully, regardless of branch. Common core instruction begins at pre-commissioning and continues at each
educational level. The instruction is progressive and sequential, building upon the skills and knowledge acquired
through previous training and operational assignments.
   (2) Entry-level officer training. To address shortcomings identified by the Army Training and Leader Development
Panel (officer) study, the Army implemented the Basic Officer Leaders Course (BOLC). The objective of the BOLC is
to develop technically competent and confident platoon leaders, regardless of branch, who are grounded in leadership,
basic technical and tactical skill proficiency, are physically and mentally strong, and embody the Warrior Ethos. To
achieve this objective, BOLC capitalizes on experience-based training, logically structured to build upon and reinforce
previous lessons. The BOLC occurs in two phases. BOLC A is pre-commissioning training conducted by the traditional
pre-commissioning sources. It provides the foundation of common core skills, knowledge, and attributes desired of all
newly commissioned lieutenants. BOLC B is a combination of common block instruction targeting small-unit leaders
skills focusing on warfighting and the Warrior Ethos, and branch-specific technical and tactical training conducted at
branch school locations. The BOLC–Direct Commissioned Officer Course is a course designed to give direct commis-
sion officers, who do not have the benefit of BOLC A pre-commissioning training, the necessary skills to achieve
success at BOLC B. See paragraph 4–7a for further discussion on BOLC.
   (3) Captains’ Officer Education System. The branch Captain Career Course (CCC) prepares company grade officers
to command Soldiers at the company, troop, or battery level, and to serve as staff officers at battalion and brigade
levels. AA and RC officers incur a 1-year active duty service obligation (ADSO) for attendance at a branch CCC upon
completion or termination of the course. Officers attend CCC following selection for promotion to the grade of captain,
normally before company-level command. Select captains who have demonstrated superior performance in their basic
branches may be selected to receive this training at other than their branch schools. (For example, a Field Artillery
officer might attend the CCC for armor officers.) This cross training benefits officers of both branches. Officers
seeking accession into Special Forces (SF) will normally attend the Maneuver CCC. The captains’ PME centers on the
technical, tactical and leadership competencies needed for success in follow-on assignments. CCC is a prerequisite for
promotion to major for RC officers. See paragraph 4–7d for further discussion on CCC.
   (4) Intermediate level education. The intermediate level education (ILE) is the Army’s formal education program for
majors. It is a tailored resident education program designed to prepare new field grade officers for their next 10 years
of service. It produces field grade officers with a Warrior Ethos and joint, expeditionary mindset, who are grounded in
warfighting doctrine, and who have the technical, tactical, and leadership competencies to be successful at more senior
levels in their respective branch or FA. ILE consists of a Common Core Course phase of operational instruction offered
to all officers, and a tailored education phase (qualification course) tied to the technical requirements of the officer’s
branch or FA. The RC also has a tailored distributed learning ILE program. ILE Common Core Course is a prerequisite
for promotion to lieutenant colonel in the RC. See paragraph 4–7e for further discussion of ILE.
   (5) Senior Service College. The Senior Service College (SSC) provides senior-level PME and leader development
training. The Army’s SSC, the U.S. Army War College, prepares military, civilian and international leaders to assume
strategic leadership responsibilities in military or national security organizations. It educates students about employ-
ment of the U.S. Army as part of a unified, joint, or multinational force in support of the national military strategy;
requires research into operational and strategic issues; and conducts outreach programs that benefit the nation. See
paragraph 4–7g for further discussion of SSC.
   b. Warrant officers.
   (1) Background. The Army Training and Leader Development Panel Warrant Officer Study recommended that the
Army make a fuller integration of warrant officers into the larger officer corps. In recognition of expanding leadership
roles for warrant officers in the future force, the study called for a single, world-class, leader development education
system that would have distinct components for warrant officer, company grade, and field grade officers. The study
also called for combining warrant officer, company grade, and field grade officer training, as appropriate, wherever
required common officer skills are taught.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                                7

   (2) Training and education goals. The goal of warrant officer training and education within the Officer Education
System is to produce highly specialized expert officers, leaders, and trainers who are fully competent in technical,
tactical, and leadership skills; creative problem solvers able to function in highly complex and dynamic environments;
and proficient operators, maintainers, administrators, and managers of the Army’s equipment, support activities, and
technical systems. Warrant officer leader development is a continuous lifelong learning process beginning with pre-
appointment training and education. The Officer Education System prepares warrant officers to successfully perform in
increasing levels of responsibility throughout an entire career. The Officer Education System provides the pre-
appointment, branch MOS-specific, and leader development training needed to produce technically and tactically
competent warrant officer leaders for assignment to platoon, detachment, company, battalion, and higher-level
organizations.
   (3) Common core. Common core is the consolidation of common skills training and training prescribed by law,
Army regulations, or other higher authority. It comprises the tasks all officers are expected to perform successfully
regardless of branch. Common core instruction begins at pre-appointment and continues at each educational level. The
instruction is progressive and sequential and builds upon the skills and knowledge acquired through previous training
and operational assignments.
   (4) Pre-appointement training. Pre-appointment training qualifies individuals to serve as officers. The purposes of
pre-appointment training are to educate and train candidates, assess their readiness and potential for appointment to
warrant officer, and prepare them for progressive and continuing development. All AA warrant officer candidates must
attend the resident Warrant Officer Candidate School (WOCS) at Fort Rucker, AL. The ARNG and USAR warrant
officer candidates may attend WOCS at either Fort Rucker or one of the RC-regional training institutes WOCS. The
WOCS graduates are appointed to warrant officer one (WO1). The appointment is contingent upon certification by the
MOS proponent that the warrant officer is technically and tactically qualified to serve in the authorized warrant officer
MOS.
   (5) Warrant Officer Basic Course. The Warrant Officer Basic Courses (WOBCs) are branch-specific qualification
courses that ensure newly appointed warrant officers receive the MOS-specific training and technical certification
needed to perform in the MOS at the platoon through brigade levels. Training is performance oriented and focuses on
technical skills, leadership, effective communication, unit training, maintenance operations, security, property accounta-
bility, tactics, and development of subordinates. Newly appointed warrant officers who attend WOBC will incur a 6-
year ADSO upon graduation. This ADSO does not apply to warrant officers who already hold a warrant officer MOS
or reclassified to another MOS. Warrant officers who attend Army directed professional development courses, includ-
ing Warrant Officer Advanced Course (WOAC), Warrant Officer Staff Course (WOSC), and Warrant Officer Senior
Staff Course (WOSSC) do not incur a service obligation.
   (6) Warrant Officer Advanced Course. The WOAC is a combination of common core and MOS proponent training
that prepares the officer to serve in senior positions at the CW3 level. The WOAC includes two phases: a nonresident
common core module and a resident phase, which includes a common core module and MOS-specific module. See
paragraph 4–7i(3) for further discussion of WOAC.
   (7) Warrant officer intermediate level education. The warrant officer ILE is a branch immaterial resident course
which focuses on staff officer and leadership skills needed to prepare them for duty in CW4 grade technician and staff
officer positions at battalion and higher levels. Instruction includes decision-making, staff roles and functions, organiza-
tional theory, structure of the Army, budget formation and execution, communication, training management, personnel
management, the contemporary operational environment, and special leadership issues. It is designed to produce
officers with a Warrior Ethos who are grounded in warfighting doctrine and possess the technical, tactical and
leadership competencies to be successful at more senior levels. See paragraph 4–7i(4) for further discussion of WOSC.
   (8) Warrant Officer Senior Service Education. The Warrant Officer Senior Service Education is currently the
capstone course for warrant officer PME. It is a branch immaterial resident course which provides master-level
professional warrant officers with a broader Army level perspective required for assignment to CW5 grade level
positions as technical, functional, and branch systems integrators, trainers, and leaders at the highest organizational
levels. See paragraph 4–7i(5) for further discussion of Warrant Officer Senior Service Education.
Chapter 3
Officer Personnel Management System and Career Management
3–1. Purpose
The OPMS is executed by HRC, Officer Personnel Management Directorate. The purpose of OPMS is to:
   a. Acquire. Identify, recruit, select, and prepare individuals for service as officers in our Army.
   b. Develop. Maximize officer performance and potential through training and education in accordance with AR
350–1, assignment, self-development and certification of officers to build agile and adaptive leaders.
   c. Utilize. Assign officers with the appropriate skills, experience, and competencies to meet Army requirements and
promote continued professional development.
8                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   d. Sustain. Retaining officers with the appropriate skills, experience, competencies, and manner of performance to
meet Army requirements and promote continued professional development.
   e. Promote. Identify and advance officers with the appropriate skills, experience, competencies, manner of perform-
ance and demonstrated potential to meet Army requirements.
   f. Transition. Separate officers from the Army in a manner that promotes a lifetime of support to the Service.
3–2. Factors affecting the Officer Personnel Management System
Various factors continuously influence the environment in which OPMS operates. In turn, changes in that environment
necessitate continuous adjustments and alterations of policy by the DCS, G–1. Factors that influence OPMS policy are:
   a. Law. Congress passes legislation that impacts on officer professional development through required changes in
related Army policy.
   (1) The DOPMA of 1981 created active duty strength limits for officers in grades above chief warrant officer,
promotion flow and timing points and the integration of RA and other than RA into common patterns.
   (2) The Department of Defense (DOD) Reorganization Act of 1986 (Goldwater-Nichols Act) instituted Joint officer
management provisions requiring a number of officers in the Army to serve in Joint duty assignments as field grade
officers.
   (3) PL 99–145 specified the acquisition experiences and education necessary for an officer to be the project manager
of major weapon systems. This law later led to the creation of the Army Acquisition Corps.
   (4) Warrant officer professional development is influenced directly by laws limiting the size of the Army and
budgetary concerns. The 1986 law also aligned Army warrant officers to those of the other Services in that all
appointments to chief warrant officer (CW2 through CW5) would be by commissioning. In 1991, the Warrant Officer
Management Act created a uniform system for warrant officer grade management and control similar to the one used to
manage company and field grade officers (DOPMA).
   (5) The 1995 Defense Authorization Act included the Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act to align Reserve
forces with DOPMA. It was intended to standardize personnel management for Reserve officers of all Services by
providing flexibility in personnel management for Reserve officers.
   b. Policy. New laws often create changes in policy. The provisions of this document are in accordance with current
law and policy. Changes to those laws and policies will affect future versions of this document.
   c. Budget. The size and composition of the officer corps, accessions, strength management, promotion rates and pin-
on-points, schooling, education programs and permanent change of station (PCS) timing are but a few areas affected by
budget decisions and subsequent policies.
   d. Officer Personnel Management System vision. The OPMS vision includes the overarching concept of growing and
developing adaptive leaders capable of employing mission command to successfully accomplish the spectrum of
established and emerging missions. Adaptability is a key tenet of ADP 3–0. Adaptive leaders are—
   (1) Competent in their core skills.
   (2) Sufficiently broad in education and experience to operate across the spectrum of conflict.
   (3) Able to operate in JIIM environments and leverage other capabilities to achieve mission objectives.
   (4) Culturally astute and able to use this awareness and understanding of foreign environments to innovate in
mission execution.
   (5) Courageous enough to take prudent risk to exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the
operational environment.
   (6) Grounded in Army Values, Warrior Ethos, and the Army Profession.
   e. Proponent strategy. Each branch/FA has a proponent responsible for coordinating the development of its officer
population. Proponent responsibilities are in part executed through the publication of this pamphlet. To fulfill these
responsibilities the proponent must:
   (1) Project future requirements for officer skills and sustain or modify elements of force structure and inventory to
meet future needs.
   (2) Define the three domains of leader development: institutional, operational and self-development balanced be-
tween the specific requirements for their particular skill and specialty and the broader developmental requirements
defined by the respective functional category proponents and the Army.
   (3) Articulate competencies required for specific branches, FAs or area of concentration (AOC)/MOS by grade, and
provide general guidance on table of organization and equipment (TOE) or table of distribution and allowances (TDA)
positions, educational and training opportunities that enable development of those competencies.
   (4) Develop generic patterns of officer development embodied in branch and FA officer development models. These
models are used by Officer Personnel Management Directorate assignment branches to execute the proponent profes-
sional development programs, but are not intended as prescriptions for a path to success in the Army.
   (5) As proponents modify officer skill requirements or development models to meet changing conditions, OPMS and
this pamphlet will be modified.
                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                                9

   f. Officer needs. The OPMS responds to the mission and requirements of the Army and attempts to balance force
structure requirements, officer professional development, and individual needs and preferences of the officer.
3–3. Officer Personnel Management System
   a. The Officer Personnel Management System. The OPMS is an evolutionary system that balances the needs of the
Army with the aspirations and developmental requirements of the entire officer corps; warrant, company and field
grade. Inherently flexible, the system is designed to respond to a variety of doctrinal, proponent, commander, and
individual initiatives to meet emerging needs. Flexibility is embedded in OPMS subsystems, which are interrelated and
affected by each other’s changes. These subsystems are:
   (1) Strength management. The number of officers, by grade and specialty, are defined by Army requirements, law,
budget, and policy. The combination of these factors results in the determination of the numbers of officers to access,
promote, develop, assign, and separate. Since each of these factors is dynamic, the number, grade, and branch of
officers within the inventory are also dynamic. As Army requirements for force structure change, the officer inventory
will also change and be realigned to meet the needs of the resulting force structure.
   (2) Assignments. Officers are assigned to fulfill current and future Army requirements while meeting the profes-
sional development needs of the various branches, FAs, and functional categories. This is balanced with the best
interests of the officers against the Army requirements.
   (3) Professional development. Each branch, FA, or officer skill proponent defines the appropriate mix of education,
training, and experience needed by the officer corps at each grade level within the context of the overarching
requirement to develop adaptive leaders. The demands of each specialty balanced with broadening opportunities are
reflected in subsequent branch or proponent chapters as life-cycle development models. HRC must develop each
officer, both active and RCs, by using these models while balancing Army requirements. To ensure the professional
development of all officers, HRC operates in concert with various responsible agents to include: the individual officer;
the Army and branch proponents; the DCS, G–3/5/7; commanders in the field and the senior Army leadership. Officer
professional development is a responsibility shared by all. Life-cycle development models portray the full range of
training, education, and experiences for the development of our future leaders.
   (4) Evaluation. The Army officer structure is pyramidal. The apex contains very few senior grades in relation to the
wider base. Advancement to increasingly responsible positions is based on relative measures of performance and
potential. The mechanism to judge the value of an individual’s performance and potential are the OER described in
detail in chapter 6. All OPMS subsystems are affected by the evaluation report. Promotion, school selection, functional
designation and command and key billet selection, retention in service, and development opportunities are all based on
the information contained in the OER.
   (5) Centralized selection. The hub around which all the subsystems revolve is centralized selection. Strength
management, professional development, and evaluation of individual contribution occur in the series of centralized
Department of the Army and HRC selection boards for retention, career status, schooling, promotion, field grade
command designation, and selective early retirement. These boards employ evaluation reports, competency guidance,
and strength requirements to advance individuals to the next stage of professional development. Officers generally flow
through the centralized selection subsystem by groupings based on date of rank. Company and field grade officer
groupings are termed cohort year groups. Warrant officer groupings are called the inclusive zone of eligibility. Each
board is preceded by a zone announcement that specifies the makeup of the cohort or inclusive zone. Centralized
selection perpetuates the ideals, cultural values, ethics, and professional standards of the Army by advancing and
retaining only those individuals best qualified to assume positions of greater responsibility. Centralized selection has
evolved over time to account for the impact of law, policy, budget, Army and officer needs, and proponent vision.
   (6) Review process. The OPMS was designed to be reviewed periodically. At the discretion of the Chief of Staff of
the Army; the DCS, G–1; and the CG, HRC will conduct a review of OPMS to determine the health of the system and
to recommend changes.
   b. A comprehensive system. The OPMS model is a developmental system focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a Warrior Ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights windows of opportunity to gain broadening experience or
exposure. The concept of broadening will be addressed in greater detail in paragraph 3–4 on officer development.
   (3) Voluntary transfer opportunities (via the Voluntary Transfer Incentive Program (VTIP)) between branches and
FAs and branch transfer between branches, announced and adjudicated several times a year beyond the 4th year of
commissioned service, develop both specific and broad functional competencies.
   (4) Officers selected for FA transfer through VTIP, and those who elect to remain in basic branches should seek
training and assignments that balance branch or FA-specific skill development with broadening opportunities. Broaden-
ing assignments, education or experiences expand a leader’s capabilities by exposing them to different organizational
cultures and environments. Such assignments are often JIIM in nature, and expose officers to problem sets not
10                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

routinely addressed at the tactical level. A balanced mix of assignments offers the best path to development of strategic
level thinkers and leaders.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, bolsters the development of joint and
expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expeditionary force—
regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so on.
   (6) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments; ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also to support unit readiness and cohesion. However, time in developmental
assignments must be balanced with the necessity to meet Army manning requirements. The functionally aligned design
is the heart of OPMS and is intended to align branches and FAs, consistent with Joint doctrine, focusing on
development of agile and adaptive leaders with broader, functionally relevant competencies.
   (7) Officers will be managed by categories and groups with similar functions to facilitate the development of officer
functional competencies required on the future battlefield. The design is not intended to reflect where officers serve on
the battlefield, but to align the functions and skills required. The three functional categories and associated functional
groups are:
   (a) Operations. This functional category gathers maneuver branches and FAs that have similar battlefield application
or complementary roles. The functional category includes the following branches and FAs: Infantry (11), Armor (19),
Aviation (15), Field Artillery (13), Air Defense Artillery (ADA) (14), Engineer (12), Chemical (74), Information
Operations (30), Military Police (MP) (31), and Special Operations Forces (SOF) encompassing SF (18), Psychological
Operations (37) and Civil Affairs (CA) (38). NOTE: Per AR 5–22, the CG, U.S. Army Special Operations Command
(USASOC), is the proponent for Army Special Operations Forces (ARSOF). This includes SF, Psychological Opera-
tions, and CA branches, and 75th Ranger Regiment, Special Operations Aviation and special mission units (SMUs).
The CG, U.S Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS) is the branch proponent for
SF, Psychological Operations, and CA.
   (b) Operations support. This functional category gathers two currently existing branches, Military Intelligence and
Signal, with FAs that have similar battlefield applications or complementary roles. Also included in this functional
category are the functions associated with force training, development, and education that design, build, and train the
force. This category will in the future incorporate the emerging Cyber capability. The functional category includes the
following branches and FAs: Signal Corps (25), Information Systems Management (53), Telecommunication Systems
Engineer (24), Space Operations (40), Electronic Warfare (EW) (29), Military Intelligence (35), Strategic Intelligence
(34), Foreign Area Officer (FAO) (48), Strategic Plans and Policy (59) Nuclear and Counterproliferation (52), Force
Management (50), Operations Research/Systems Analysis (49), Simulation Operations (57), Permanent Academy
Professor (47), and Public Affairs (46).
   (c) Force Sustainment. This functional category includes an integrated Logistics Corps as well as the branches and
FAs associated with resource and Soldier support functions: Integrated Logistics Corps: Transportation Corps (88),
Ordnance (91) and Quartermaster (92), Logistics Branch (90); Human Resources (42H), Financial Management (36),
Acquisition Corps (51). A part of force sustainment but separately managed are the Health Services: AMEDD
(medical, dental, veterinary, nurse, medical specialist and medical services), Chaplain Corps, and TJAG.
3–4. Officer development
   a. Officer Personnel Management System. Under OPMS, company grade officers are accessed into the Army’s basic
branches, and through a series of educational and developmental assignments are given the opportunity to hold branch
developmental assignments outlined by their proponent. During their company grade years, captains are designated into
one of three officer functional categories (Operations, Operations Support, Force Sustainment) in which they continue
their development either in their basic branch or in a FA. Officers in the RCs will also undergo functional designation
with their AA counterparts; but modification to the process is necessary to accommodate personnel management
considerations unique to the ARNG/USAR. Accessioning policies for the Army Acquisition Corps and SOF are unique
and are addressed in their respective chapters.
   b. Development objectives. One of the major objectives of OPMS is to professionally develop officers through a
deliberate, continuous, sequential, and progressive process including training, education and experiences nested with
counseling and mentoring from commanders, branch proponent, and Officer Personnel Management Directorate, HRC.
These interactions are embodied in the process of officer development:
   (1) Development in a designated specialty. For the Army competitive category (ACC), there are 34 branch and FA
specialties in OPMS. The differences between a branch and FA are:
   (a) Branch. A branch is a grouping of officers that comprises an arm or Service of the Army and is the specialty in
which all officers are commissioned or transferred, trained and developed. Company grade officers hold a single branch
designation and may serve in repetitive and progressive assignments associated with the branch. They may not be
assigned to more than one branch. See paragraph 8–2 for further discussion of officer branches.
   (b) Functional area. A FA is a grouping of officers by technical specialty or skills other than an arm, Service, or
branch that usually requires unique education, training, and experience. After functional designation, officers may serve
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              11

repetitive and progressive assignments within their FA. An officer may not be assigned to more than one FA at a time.
See chapter 8 for further discussion of FAs.
   (2) Key terms in operational assignments. A number of terms are used when describing operational assignments:
   (a) Command. The command is the authority that a commander in the military service lawfully exercises over
subordinates by virtue of rank or assignment. The command comprises the leadership, authority, responsibility, and
accountability for effectively using available resources and planning the employment of, organizing, directing, coordi-
nating, and controlling military forces to accomplish assigned missions. It includes responsibility for unit readiness,
health, welfare, morale, and discipline of assigned personnel.
   (b) Key billet. A duty assignment at the lieutenant colonel or colonel rank requiring specific, highly developed skills
and experience that is deemed so critical to a unit’s mission that an officer is selected for assignment by HQDA. Key
billet officers exercise judgment and recommend actions to the commander. They principally manage resources and
oversee processes that operate in a leadership environment.
   (c) Centralized selection list. A listing of command/key billet positions by type category approved by CG, HRC to
be filled by officers selected under the Centralized Command/Key Billet Selection System. Centralized selection list
(CSL) command positions fall into four categories listed below.
   1. Installation command category. Support tenant units or activities in a designated geographic area by organizing,
directing, coordinating, and controlling installation support and service activities. They are TDA organizations, both the
continental United States (CONUS) and outside the continental United States (OCONUS), dedicated to supporting and
protecting Army Soldiers, Civilians, and their Families. They are accountable for critical mission areas such as
mobilization, public works, real property management, and local civil authorities/host nation rapport.
   2. Operations command category. Battalion and brigade size units, expeditionary in nature and deployable world-
wide with approved TOE, Joint organization and SMUs providing the fighting power available to combatant or Joint
Task Force commanders with a primary mission to deploy to a theater of combat operations.
   3. Recruiting and training command category. Focused on generating Soldiers into conventional and SMUs of the
U.S. Army and sister Services, typically TDA organizations that support the training of units from the Army and sister
Services. They are typically fixed-site and non-deployable. The cadre and non-training Soldiers are typically not
required to qualify with individual weapons.
   4. Strategic support command category. Focused on generating Soldiers into conventional and SMUs of the U.S.
Army and sister Services, typically TDA organizations that support the training of units from the Army and sister
Services. They are typically fixed-site and non-deployable. The cadre and non-training Soldiers are typically not
required to qualify with individual weapons.
   (d) Key developmental positions. These positions are specified, by branch or FA in this pamphlet, and revised
periodically. A KD position is one that is deemed fundamental to the development of an officer in his or her core
branch or FA competencies or deemed critical by the senior Army leadership to provide experience across the Army’s
strategic mission. The majority of these positions fall within the scope of the officer’s branch or FA mission.
   (e) Developmental positions. All officer positions are developmental. They enhance some aspect of warfighting
skills, increase their level of responsibility, develop their understanding of interoperability among Army branches, or
expose them to branch-related generating force/JIIM opportunities that directly contribute to success as an innovative
and adaptive leader.
   (f) Broadening opportunities. Officers should view the concept of broadening as a purposeful expansion of a
leader’s capabilities and understanding provided through opportunities internal and external to the Army. Broadening is
accomplished across an officer’s full career through experiences and/or education in different organizational cultures
and environments. The intent for broadening is to develop an officer’s capability to see, work, learn and contribute
outside each one’s own perspective or individual level of understanding for the betterment of both the individual
officer and the institution. The result of broadening is a continuum of leadership capability at direct, operational, and
strategic levels, which bridges diverse environments and organizational cultures. The broadening process will be
dynamic and variable across cohorts, grades, and branches or FAs. Opportunities will change in response to the Army’s
emerging missions, evolving structure and professional culture. Deliberate career management that carefully limits KD
time to prescribed intervals, allowing exceptions only under limited extenuating circumstances is fundamental to the
concept of broadening. Broadening opportunities may vary in scope, responsibility, and developmental outcomes and
typically fall in four major categories listed below.
   1. Functional or institutional. An assignment that provides a developmental opportunity directly related to an
officers branch or FA, but which provides the officer the opportunity to develop a wider range of knowledge and skills
useful in an Army specific environment or a broader joint context. Assignments that provide a developmental
opportunity usually not directly related to an officer’s branch or FA but which may develop a greater understanding of
how the Army operates as an institution.
   2. Academia and civilian enterprise. An experience with civilian industry or within a community of students,
scholars, and instructors at institutes of higher learning where the officer can gain new perspectives and knowledge,
skills, and abilities not generally obtained from organic experiences, training, or education.
   3. Joint or multinational. An experience in a Joint duty assignment list billet, or a Joint opportunity unrelated to an
12                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

officer’s branch or FA. Such experiences immerse the officer in an environment requiring routine interaction with JIIM
organizations and personnel resulting in an understanding of their interaction with our Army. Assignments with a
significant role of interaction with partner nation military organizations at operational and strategic level.
   4. Interagency or intergovernmental. Assignments or experiences at U.S. Government agencies outside DOD, or
with partner nation governmental agencies. The focus of these opportunities will be more politically and policy
oriented. These categories are convenient delineations but may not cover all possible opportunities. Broadening should
enhance the adaptability and intellectual scope of our officers. It is not possible to foresee all the types of experience
that will develop the diverse talents required of future leaders.
   (3) Institutional education (Officer Education System). Training and education of an officer is driven by operational
demands of an officer. AR 350–1 is the primary regulation governing officer training and education. This includes
resident and nonresident instruction, on-the-job training, individual study and when appropriate, civilian education.
   (4) Professional development counseling and mentoring. This is conducted by commanders at all levels as well as
by HRC career managers.
   (5) Designation and election of branches, functional areas, and functional categories.
   (a) Branch designation. Upon commissioning, lieutenants are designated in a basic branch for entry on active duty,
training and initial assignment. When required, some lieutenants are branch detailed to a combat arms branch for 3 or 4
years, or until their assigned units are in a reset period. Under the branch detail program, officers attend the company
grade level education at the school of the branch to which they are detailed. Company grade officers in the 4-year
detail program receive transition branch training in conjunction with their enrollment in the captain’s level education.
During the early years of service, professional development within the branch follows the proponent’s life-cycle model.
Generally, the first 8 years of service are devoted to branch developmental assignments and training that prepares the
company grade officer for further advancement. Company grade officers may request, in writing, a voluntary branch
transfer in accordance with AR 614–100. Detailed officers must be approved for branch transfer by their detail branch,
basic branch, and HRC (AHRC–OPD–C), in addition to meeting the requirements of AR 614–100. Prior to selection
for promotion to captain, officers may volunteer for SOF (SF, Psychological Operations, or CA) training and, upon
successful completion of training, will receive a branch transfer into their respective branch. Selection for SOF training
is made by cohort year group and upon selection for promotion to captain. The SOF officers are expected to have
served a successful initial tour as a lieutenant in a small-unit leadership position in one of the Army’s other basic
branches. As a result, they are expected to have knowledge of conventional Army operations and be experienced in
Army leadership. Lieutenants who volunteer in the targeted year group are selected by a DA-centralized SOF accession
board at approximately 3 years of commissioned service and then go to a designated CCC to qualify for continued
Special Operations officer training.
   (b) Functional designation process. ACC groups interrelated branches and FAs into officer management categories
called functional categories and functional groups. The functional designation process determines in which specialty
officers will continue their development; either in their accession branch or in a different FA. Management of officer
development in functional categories recognizes the need to balance specialization of the officer corps with the inherent
requirement for officers to gain more breadth in an increasingly complex environment. Officers have periodic
opportunities after the 4th year of officer service to transfer to a different branch or FA. The process is known as the
VTIP and is managed by HRC to balance inventories with Army requirements and to leverage individual officer
preferences and demonstrated abilities. VTIP panels are conducted two to three times a year and are announced via
MILPER message describing procedures and specialties to be considered for cross leveling. VTIP allows HRC to
identify and target officers with critical skills early in their development, allowing them to get additional training and
experience to bring those skills to bear as quickly as possible. The VTIP balances the force across the three functional
categories. The intent of the VTIP panel is to fill requirements and provide the FAs enough time to send their officers
to school and training prior to utilization. The VTIP process ensures that the needs of the Army are met for future field
grade officer requirements in each functional category. Each functional category has its own unique characteristics and
development model for officers, which reflects the readiness requirements of the Army today and into the 21st century.
Officers in all functional categories are assigned across the Army in TOE and TDA organizations.
   (c) Joint duty assignment. The Joint duty assignment list, and its subset, the Joint critical billets, confer Joint credit
to our officers. Assignments are usually preceded by Joint JPME I, completed at ILE Command and Staff College. The
Joint Critical billets are typically filled by Joint Qualified Officers, those with a previously completed Joint tour, plus
JPME II, completed at Joint Forces Staff College or in a SSC. All of these positions, plus numerous others involve
assignments/experiences in the Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, or multinational environment, but are not subject
to the control measures of the Joint duty assignment list (tour length, JPME, promotion monitoring). Paragraph 3–13
goes into greater detail on this subject.
   c. Generalist positions. Some positions in the Army are independent of branch or FA coding and are designated as
branch/FA generalist, combat arms generalist positions, or JIIM positions. Some company and field grade officers
should expect to serve in these assignments at various times during their careers, regardless of their functional
designation. Officers are selected for these and other similar positions based on overall manner of performance,
previous experience, military and civilian education and estimated potential for further service.
   d. Focused development. Both branches and FAs may require more specific job skills and qualifications to prepare
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                               13

their officers further to meet highly specialized position requirements. These specific skills are called areas of
concentration (AOCs). AOCs are described in the branch/FA chapters of this pamphlet.
   (1) Branch/FA development fosters a mastery of skills, knowledge and attributes for an officer’s grade in a specific
branch or FA. Branch development enables captains to achieve mastery of common core and branch skills, knowledge,
and attributes that assures the strong professional development foundation essential for success in the field grades.
Generally speaking branch development for captains equates to completion of an appropriate company grade level
education followed by successful performance as a company grade officer. Branch development for majors results from
completion of an approved field grade ILE and successful performance in a KD branch or FA assignment. During an
officer’s field grade years, OPMS allows for the broadening of an officer’s development from mastery of branch skills
to more multifunctional skills. Branch officers have the opportunity, and are encouraged to, expand their knowledge
and skills beyond their specific branch through multiple avenues. These opportunities, advanced civilian schooling,
assignments in cross-branch/FA, and the use of JIIM assignments will enhance the development of officers for the
increasingly demanding requirements necessary to lead Soldiers today and in the future, as well as, to function
effectively at the senior executive level in the Army organization. FA officers will also be provided the opportunity to
broaden their development through the use of cross-branch/FA and JIIM assignments.
   (2) The full spectrum of military operations require an Army officer to be proficient in a myriad of tasks between
the spectrums of wide area security and combined arms maneuver. Officers must be tolerant of ambiguity and be able
to make rapid adjustments by thinking critically and creatively. This will require an officer to be “operationally
adaptable” and comfortable with collaborative planning and decentralized execution in an ever changing environment.
Personnel requirements for transitional functions will continue to evolve as teams with labels such as military transition
team, special police transition team, border team, provincial reconstruction team, modular brigade security force
assistance teams, or other names, grow from our experience with current and future operations. The invaluable
experience that officers gain serving in assignments to these challenging team positions will enhance their ability to
serve in future leadership roles in the current operational environment. Assignments to such teams are considered KD
opportunities for officer career development. The broad exposure to local leaders, government functionaries, non-
governmental agencies, and international aid organizations will enhance an officer’s interoperability in joint environ-
ments. Officers should seek to serve in these positions as part of their normal career progression. Service in transition
team positions will not preclude officers from further assignments to key developmental positions specific to their
branch or FA.
   (3) PME instructor positions are critically important as developmental experiences that shape individual career
success, and effectively disseminate shared operational experience. The Army historically cycles between periods of
active conflict and intense deployed operational focus, and periods of consolidation, training, and preparation for the
future. It is critical that the Army consolidate the hard won experience of our officers who have served in operational
theaters, and disseminate that through its PME system. Positions as platform instructors, small group leaders, doctrine
writers or other positions in the institutional Army are critical broadening opportunities for our officers that will
enhance an officer’s standing in competition for command, key billet or senior executive-level positions.
   e. Promotion. Under OPMS, majors and lieutenant colonels compete for promotion from within their respective
functional categories. Selection for promotion is based on the fundamentals of performance and potential for further
service. These are measured by the officer’s relative standing with peers as indicated in the evaluation reports,
assignment history, and branch, FA and JIIM development opportunities afforded. The selection boards are instructed
as to the number of field grade officers to select based on Army needs, law, policy, and budget. Additionally, the
boards receive guidance on the officer qualities expected for promotion. All of this information is contained in the
Secretary of the Army’s Memorandum of Instruction issued to the board. Members of the board use DA Pam 600–3 to
determine branch and FA qualifications. Congress and the Secretary of the Army approve promotion selection lists
prior to publication.

                                        Figure 3–1. Officer competency evolution
3–5. Company grade development
   a. Branch-specific development. This phase commences upon entry on active duty and generally lasts through the
10th year of service (see fig 3–1). Officers begin their professional development at pre-commissioning/appointment,
referred to as BOLC A, followed by attending BOLC B. For additional information on BOLC B, refer to paragraphs
4–7a through 4–7c.
   (1) Basic education. The BOLC B marks the beginning of a company grade officer’s formal military professional
development training following commissioning. BOLC B prepares officers for their first duty assignment and provides
instruction on methods for training and leading individuals, teams, squads, and platoons. Additionally, the course
provides officers with a detailed understanding of equipment, tactics, organization and administration at the company,
battery or troop level.
   (2) Initial assignments. After officers graduate from BOLC B, branch assignment officers in Officer Personnel
Management Directorate will assign the majority of officers to a branch duty position. Included in these assignments
are CONUS or overseas troop units where officers begin to develop their leadership skills. All junior officers should
seek leadership positions in troop units whenever possible. Troop leadership is the best means to become educated in
Army operations and builds a solid foundation for future service.
   (3) Bachelor’s degree. Prior to promotion to captain, officers must complete their baccalaureate degree.
   (4) Captains Officer Education System. Officers should attend their branch CCC following selection for promotion
to the grade of captain. This is the second major branch school officers attend before company-level command.
Selected captains deemed to have demonstrated superior performance in their basic branch might be selected to receive
this training at schools other than their basic branch. A Field Artillery officer, for example, may attend the Armor
CCC. This cross training benefits officers of both branches. Officers seeking accession into SF will attend the Infantry
CCC. Officers seeking accession into the Psychological Operations or CA branches will attend a designated CCC. For
additional information about the Captains Officer Education System, see paragraph 4–7d.
   (5) Branch opportunities. All company grade officers must focus their efforts during the company grade years on
mastering the basic skills of their specific branch, regardless of the FA and functional category they will later enter.
Much of the value an officer brings to a specialized FA is dependent on experience gained by leading Soldiers and
mastering basic branch skills. Leading Soldiers is the essence of leadership development at this stage of an officer’s
career. Officers who have demonstrated the potential and desire to command Soldiers fill command positions. The
number of company commands within a specific branch may not afford all officers the opportunity to command at the
captain level. Command opportunities for captains are found in traditional TOE line units or TDA units in training,
garrison, and headquarters organizations.
                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             15

Note. This paragraph discusses branch opportunities in general. For information unique to a particular branch, refer to that branch’s
chapter in Part Two of this pamphlet.
   b. Post-initial branch development. Between the 4th and 7th years of service, and after company grade officers have
been afforded branch development opportunities, a number of options become available for continued professional
development and broadening. At this time, career managers at Officer Personnel Management Directorate assess the
officer’s developmental objectives for the post-branch development phase based on assignment patterns completed,
relative manner of performance achieved, individual preferences and Army requirements available for the next
developmental stage (see fig 3–1). The types of assignments and developmental patterns for this phase are as follows:
   (1) Branch assignments. The range of further assignments to branch-coded positions is a function of the Army’s
requirements and officer availability. These assignments may include staff and faculty positions at Service schools,
Combat Training Center (CTC) duty or staff positions in tactical or training units. Branch assignments further develop
the basic branch skills and employ the officer’s accumulated skills, knowledge, and attributes.
   (2) Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Some company grade officers may serve in positions coded 01A
(Officer Generalist) or 02A (Combat Arms Generalist). These branch/FA generalist positions do not require an officer
from a specific branch or FA but may be performed by an officer with certain experiences, manner of performance and
demonstrated potential. Such assignments include USAREC staff and command positions, Reserve Officers’ Training
Corps (ROTC) or U.S. Military Academy (USMA) faculty and staff, and major command staff positions.
   (3) Functional area specific. Officers designated into FAs should expect training and education opportunities to
focus on their areas of specialization and include progressive and repetitive assignments of increasing responsibility.
Each of the FA chapters in this pamphlet outlines developmental positions.
   (4) Advanced Civilian Schooling or Expanded Graduate School Program. Each year some officers will be provided
the opportunity to attend civilian academic institutions to obtain graduate-level degrees in designated disciplines. The
final number varies based on budget, policy, and Army requirements. These positions are annually assessed to
determine how many officers should be entered into each academic discipline. The criteria for selection are based on
the branch or FA skill required, academic proficiency measured by undergraduate performance and scores from the
graduate record examination or graduate management admission test, ability to be accepted by an accredited college
and manner of performance to indicate strong potential for future service. Proponents must forecast the education and
utilization of advanced civilian schooling graduates to meet projected needs since the degrees typically take 12 to 22
months to complete. The specific follow-on assignment or utilization is often determined about 6 to 9 months prior to
graduation. See branch and FA chapters for discussion of advanced civilian schooling/Expanded Graduate School
Program requirements. AR 621–1 is the governing regulation and specifies the method by which officers may apply for
advanced civilian schooling.
   (5) Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational training opportunities. This program provides short-
term (90 to 180 days) training for officers providing them the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future.
   (6) Training With Industry. Some branches and FAs participate in Training With Industry, where officers are
assigned to a civilian industry to observe and learn the technical and managerial aspects of that field. The total number
of training quotas varies annually from 50 to 70 based on budget, policy, and requirements. Officers selected for this
program must be proficient in their branch or FA, have a manner of performance that reflects a strong potential for
future service and be able to serve a utilization tour upon completion of training. The Training With Industry program
is outlined in AR 621–1 and in the specific branch and FA chapters later in this pamphlet.
   (7) Army Acquisition Corps. Between their 7th and 8th year of service, between 80 and 120 captains are accessed
into the Army Acquisition Corps (FA 51) to be professionally developed in this FA. HRC hosts an Acquisition
Accession Board annually to select branch-qualified captains for FA 51. The Army Acquisition Corps officers may
receive a fully funded master’s degree (if not already at civilian education level 2), attend the Materiel Acquisition
Management Course and other FA related training, and serve repetitive assignments in their acquisition specialties to
prepare them for critical acquisition positions at field grade level. The Army Acquisition Corps, created in early 1990,
is described in detail in chapter 42 of this pamphlet.
   c. Promotion. Selection for promotion to major. Normally an officer within a cohort year group enters the primary
zone of consideration for major around the 9th year of service. Below the zone consideration occurs a year earlier.

                                             Figure 3–2. Officer career timeline
3–6. Major development
This phase, which generally encompasses the 10th to 17th years of service, begins with selection for promotion to
major. This is a critical period in an officer’s career life-cycle that demands an acute awareness of important HQDA
centralized boards and the preparations they require. The junior field grade years serve to develop the officer cohort in
a variety of branch or FA assignments within their functional category.
   a. Development. The general development goals are to complete ILE/JPME I, and successfully complete other
branch, FA or broadening assignments prior to consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel. All branch and FA
officers selected for ILE attendance are required to complete ILE prior to the 15th year of commissioned service. ILE
provides a quality education for all field grade officers and prepares them for their next 10 years of service. Officers
must be ILE/JPME I complete to be eligible for SSC attendance. See paragraph 4–7e for further discussion of ILE.
Most branches and some FAs have identified positions as KD for majors. It should be noted that in all branches/FAs
majors positions that support transitional functions, such as training teams and provincial reconstruction teams, are
designated as KD positions. Positions created to address specific emerging missions or capability are most often
considered KD for the purposes of career development/advancement.
   b. Promotion. Cohort year group officers are generally considered for promotion to lieutenant colonel in their 16th
year of service as they enter the primary zone of consideration. Below the zone selection is possible, and normally
officers will be considered 1 year prior to their primary zone consideration.
3–7. Lieutenant colonel development
This phase generally occurs between the 17th and 22nd years of service. Those selected for promotion to lieutenant
colonel now begin the senior field grade years, where they make the maximum contribution to the Army as
commanders and senior staff officers. Attaining the grade of lieutenant colonel is most often considered to be the
hallmark of a successful career, although each officer defines success differently. Officers in the grade of lieutenant
colonel serve as senior leaders and managers throughout the Army providing wisdom, experience, vision and mentor-
ship mastered over many years in uniform.
   a. Development. The professional development goals for a lieutenant colonel are to broaden their branch, FA and
skill proficiency at the senior levels through assignments and schooling. Most of these officers will serve in high
visibility billets in their branch, FA or JIIM positions, and a possible assignment to a cross-branch/FA developmental
position.
   (1) Branch assignments. Lieutenant colonels can expect branch-coded assignments to both TDA and TOE positions.
These billets can range from positions within a battalion through echelons above corps. However, the TDA structure
requires the greater portion (almost 70 percent) of the senior field grade expertise and experience. Here, the officer’s
development over the years is used to fulfill the doctrinal, instructional, policymaking, and planning needs of the
Army. Branch proponents have outlined developmental standards in their respective chapters of this pamphlet.
   (2) Functional area assignments. OPMS recognizes the need for balanced specialization to meet the Army’s
challenges in the 21st Century. The system design allows officers to serve in repetitive assignments within a FA to gain
a high degree of expertise. FA proponents have outlined developmental standards in their respective chapters of this
pamphlet.
   (3) Joint duty assignments. The Joint duty assignment list contains approximately 1350 lieutenant colonel authoriza-
tions and officers will continue to have the opportunity for assignment to Joint duty positions as an integral part of
their development. See paragraph 3–8 for additional details on the Joint officer program.
   (4) Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Some officers will serve outside their branch or FA in billets
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             17

coded as branch/FA generalist. Such assignments are found throughout the Army in troop and staff organizations from
the installation to Department of the Army level.
   (5) Centralized selection. A centralized board at HQDA selects a limited number of officers for command and key
billets. The lieutenant colonel CSL command and key billet contains both TOE and TDA positions. The command
board meets annually to select commanders from the eligible cohort year groups. Command opportunity varies based
on force structure and the command categories for which an officer competes. On average, lieutenant colonels serve in
their command tours during their 18th through 20th years of service. Once the board makes its selections and conducts
a preliminary slating for category, Officer Personnel Management Directorate conducts a slating process. HRC
coordinates this slating process with major Army commands (ACOMs); and the CSA reviews and approves the slate.
The Army Acquisition Corps conducts a similar HQDA-level board to select lieutenant colonel commanders and
product managers. Only certified Army Acquisition Corps officers can compete for these positions.
   (6) Senior Service College. The annual SSC (military education level (MEL) SSC) selection board reviews the files
of lieutenant colonels after their 16th year of service. The SSC is the final major military educational program available
to prepare officers for the positions of greatest responsibility in the DOD. Officers must be ILE/JPME I qualified to be
eligible for SSC attendance consideration. There are about 350 resident seats available each academic year within the
SSC network. These include attendance at the U. S. Army War College, the Advanced Strategic Leadership Studies
Program within the School of Advanced Studies at Fort Leavenworth, the Eisenhower School for National Security,
(formerly the Industrial College of the Armed Forces), the National War College, the College of International Security
Affairs, the Joint Advanced Warfighting School, Inter-American Defense College other sister Service war colleges,
resident fellowships at Governmental agencies and academic institutions and approved foreign SSCs. Approximately 30
to 35 percent of a cohort year group is selected to attend during their years of eligibility that run between the 16th and
23d years of service. The SSC selection board examines the eligible population and produces an order of merit list
containing 1,300 names. The top 350 officers are activated for resident attendance while the remainder are contacted by
their branch or FA managers and encouraged to apply for the 85 annual active duty seats in the U.S. Army War
College Distance Education Course. U.S. Army War College resident and distance education programs award Master of
Strategic Studies degrees. Only the resident SSC courses and U.S. Army War College distance education program
award SSC completion MEL 1. The Army does not recognize other Service War College distant education programs as
SSC nor MEL 1 equivalent. Resident course graduates are also awarded JPME II. Officers completing Fellowship
programs receive a certificate of graduation from the U.S Army War College designating MEL SSC complete but are
not awarded a master’s degree nor JPME II. SSC graduates are assigned to organizations based on guidance from the
CSA. Tours following graduation are to the Army Staff, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary of Defense, ACOMs, Army
service component commands (ASCCs), and direct reporting units (DRUs), and combatant command staffs in branch,
FA, branch/FA generalist or Joint coded positions.
   (7) Former battalion commander assignments. Lieutenant colonels completing battalion command are assigned to
positions designated as requiring the skills of former battalion commanders. These post-command assignments may be
to branch, branch/FA generalist assignments, or Joint coded positions. Emphasis is placed on Joint duty assignments
for those officers without a Joint qualifying tour.
   b. Promotion. Cohort year group officers are normally considered for promotion to colonel in the primary zone in
their 21st year of service. Below the zone selection is possible, and normally officers will be considered 1 year prior to
their primary zone consideration.
3–8. Colonel development
Those officers selected for promotion to colonel continue their senior field grade phase that concludes with their
separation or retirement from active duty or selection for promotion to brigadier general. Attaining the grade of colonel
is realized by a select few and truly constitutes the elite of the officer corps. As colonels, their maximum contribution
to the Army is made as commanders and senior staff officers.
   a. Development. The general professional development goals for colonels are to further enhance branch or FA skill
proficiency through additional senior-level assignments and schooling.
   (1) Branch assignments. Many colonels can expect to receive assignments to branch-coded positions at the brigade,
division, corps, and echelons above corps in the TOE environment. TDA organizations throughout the Army also need
the expertise of senior field grade officers. Almost 70 percent of the colonel authorizations are in the TDA structure.
   (2) Funtional area assignments. Under OPMS, FA officers work predominantly in their specialties after selection
for promotion to major. Having risen above their peers at the grade of major and lieutenant colonel, those promoted to
colonel are truly the world-class specialists in their respective fields. These officers will serve primarily in senior
managerial billets across the Army coded for their specialty.
   (3) Joint duty assignment. The Joint duty assignment list contains a number of colonel billets in branch and FA
positions. Officers who did not serve as majors or lieutenant colonels in a Joint duty assignment list billet should
continue to seek Joint development. Colonels who completed the requirements for Joint Qualified Officer designation,
may serve second and third tours in positions coded “Joint Critical”. (For more information, read para 3–13, which
details the Joint duty program.)
   (4) Senior Service College. The annual SSC selection board reviews the files of colonels until their 23d year of
18                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

service. Officers must be JPME I qualified to be eligible for SSC attendance consideration. The majority of colonels
will either attend the resident training or be awarded MEL SSC certification from the U.S. Army War College Distance
Education Course during the latter 3 years of their eligibility window. See paragraph 3–7a(6) for more information on
the available SSC-level courses.
   (5) Centralized command selection. Some officers are selected for command at the colonel level. Most positions are
branch coded and branch officers compete within designated categories for these positions. An HQDA-level board also
selects Army Acquisition Corps program managers. Officers are eligible for colonel command selection until their 26th
year of service. The HQDA command boards meet annually to select promotable lieutenant colonels and serving
colonels for assignment to command positions during the following fiscal year (FY). The opportunity varies by branch
and ranges from 16 percent to 50 percent. The command board prepares a slate to category and an initial slate to units.
The final slate to unit is prepared by Officer Personnel Management Directorate. Slates are approved by the CSA, and
are coordinated with the ACOMs, ASCCs, and DRUs. The majority of officers in a cohort year group do not
command; they make their maximum contribution to the Army in other important branch or FA senior staff
assignments.
   (6) Former brigade commander assignments. Colonels completing brigade command are assigned to positions
designated by the CSA, as requiring the skills of former commanders. These post-command assignments may be to
branch, branch/FA generalist assignments or Joint coded positions. Emphasis is placed on Joint duty assignments for
those officers without a Joint qualifying tour.
   b. Promotion. Promotion to general officer is managed separately and is beyond the scope of this pamphlet.
3–9. Warrant officer definitions
The Army warrant officer is a self-aware and adaptive technical expert, combat leader, trainer, and advisor. Through
progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the warrant officer administers, manages,
maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment across the full spectrum of Army operations. Warrant
officers are innovative integrators of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident warfighters, and developers of
specialized teams of Soldiers. They support a wide range of Army missions throughout their career. Warrant officers in
the Army are accessed with specific levels of technical ability. They refine their technical expertise and develop their
leadership and management skills through tiered progressive assignment and education. The following are specific
characteristics and responsibilities of the separate, successive warrant officer grades:
   a. Warrant officer one/chief warrant officer two. A WO1 is an officer appointed by warrant with the requisite
authority pursuant to assignment level and position given by the Secretary of the Army. CW2s and above are
commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the President
of the United States. WO1’s and CW2’s primary focus is becoming proficient and working on those systems linked
directly to their AOC/MOS. As they become experts on the systems they operate and maintain, their focus migrates to
integrating their systems with other branch systems.
   b. Chief warrant officer three. The CW3s are advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary
duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform
any other branch-related duties assigned to them. As they become more senior, their focus becomes integrating branch
systems into larger Army systems.
   c. Chief warrant officer four. The CW4s are senior-level technical and tactical experts who perform the duties of
technical leader, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor and serve in a wide variety of branch level
positions. As they become more senior they focus on integrating branch and Army systems into Joint and national-level
systems.
   d. Chief warrant officer five. The CW5s are master-level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary
duties of technical leader, manager, integrator, and advisor. They are the senior technical expert in their branch and
serve at brigade and higher levels.
3–10. Warrant officer career patterns
The development of the professional attributes and technical capabilities of Army warrant officers to meet the needs of
the Army is accomplished through proponent-designed PDMs for each AOC/MOS. These PDMs describe schooling,
operational assignments, and self-development goals for warrant officers in each grade. PDMs are based on Army
requirements, indicating the numbers and types of warrant officers to be accessed, retained, promoted, schooled and
assigned by AOC/MOS. Proponents monitor the Army documents pertinent to their AOCs/MOSs since any change to
the force structure may require a change to the warrant officer inventory. The size of the warrant officer inventory is
limited by various factors. As requirements change, strength and professional development goals of each career field
AOC/MOS are aligned accordingly. Warrant officers are accessed into a specific AOC/MOS and can normally expect
to spend their entire career in that field. Branch, FA, and AOC/MOS are defined in the glossary, but these terms as
they pertain to warrant officers have different connotations. Branches are the officially designated categories within the
Service that separate personnel and functions. Examples of branches are Field Artillery, Infantry, Quartermaster,
Aviation, and so forth. Warrant officers are appointed in the U.S. Army at large but contribute directly to the success
and missions of the specific branches. Like commissioned officers, warrant officers wear the insignia of the branches
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              19

they support on the Army Service uniform. Branch proponents play a significant role in the management of warrant
officers within the functional categories, development of life-cycle development models, and provision of proponent
based training for warrant officers. FAs for warrant officers are groupings of AOC/MOSs within branches. Examples
are Electronic Maintenance and Ammunition AOC/MOSs that are a part of the Ordnance Branch but are grouped in a
separate FA within the Ordnance Branch. An AOC/MOS is an assigned specialty that most warrant officers hold, with
variations, for their entire career. Most warrant officers hold and work their AOC/MOS for their entire career. Some
AOCs/MOSs, notably in Aviation, Ordnance, and Signal branches merge at the grades of CW3 through CW5. The list
of specialties, with general description of duties, by grade, is contained in DA Pam 611–21. Not all assignments within
a career will directly relate to the warrant officer’s FA, branch, or AOC/MOS. Some warrant officer positions are
AOC/MOS immaterial but FA/branch specific; that is, any qualified warrant officer within a specific branch FA
(Aviation, Artillery, Ordnance, and so forth) may be assigned to the position. Others are designated AOC/MOS as well
as FA/branch immaterial; that is, any qualified warrant officer, regardless of AOC/MOS and FA/branch, may be
assigned to the position. Some positions in leader development, professional development, personnel management,
training, and training development require the assignment of the best-qualified warrant officer, regardless of AOC/
MOS or FA/branch.
3–11. Warrant officer development
Junior warrant officers (WO1s and CW2s) main developmental focus in on their primary MOS (PMOS)/AOC. As they
gain more experience and training, their focus and expertise shifts from their PMOS/AOC to integrating other systems
within their branch/FAs to Army, Joint, and national-level systems. A generic PDM, depicted in figure 3–2, consists of
the four primary levels of warrant officer utilization. Subsequent chapters detail PDMs by FA branch and AOC/MOS.
   a. Entry level. Warrant officers are accessed according to the needs of the Army. Once accepted, the applicant must
attend WOCS, conducted by the Warrant Officer Career College at Fort Rucker, AL or a two-phased regional training
institute run by State ARNG. SF warrant officers, 180A, will attend their candidate school at Fort Bragg, NC. The
WOCS and regional training institutes test the mental, emotional, and physical stamina of candidates to determine their
acceptability into the warrant officer corps. The course is focused on common, foundational material and provides the
skills, knowledge and behaviors required of all warrant officers, regardless of specialty. Upon course completion, the
candidates are appointed to the grade of WO1 but are not yet AOC/MOS-qualified.
   b. Warrant officer one/chief warrant officer two. After graduating from WOCS, the new WO1 must attend a WOBC
conducted by his or her proponent school. WOBC provides functional training in the applicable AOC/MOS and
reinforces the leadership training provided in WOCS. Upon successful completion of WOBC, the warrant officer is
awarded a AOC/MOS and given an initial operational assignment. Operational assignments continue for the next
several years. Throughout this period, warrant officers should continue their self-development, to include the pursuit of
civilian education goals. The civilian education goal at this career point is an associate degree or equivalent in a
discipline related to their AOC/MOS prior to eligibility for selection to CW3. After promotion to CW2, at approxi-
mately the third year of warrant officer service, warrant officers can enroll in Prerequisite Studies for the WOAC, an
AOC/MOS immaterial course administered by the Distributive Education Section of the Warrant Officer Career
College. Completion of this course renders the officer eligible to attend his or her resident WOAC. Officers are eligible
to attend the resident portion of their proponent-controlled WOAC after serving for 1 year as a CW2 and should attend
no later than 1 year after their promotion to CW3. Officers must attend WOAC prior to promotion to CW4.
   c. Chief warrant officer three/chief warrant officer four. At this point, warrant officers should actively pursue the
next civilian education goal, a baccalaureate degree in a discipline related to their AOC/MOS, prior to eligibility for
selection to CW4. Warrant officers will attend the WOSC conducted at the Warrant Officer Career College after
serving 1 year as a CW3 but no later than 1 year after their promotion to CW4. Officers must attend WOSC prior to
promotion to CW5. Some proponents may provide follow-on functional training at this point.
   d. Chief warrant officer five. Upon completion of 1 year time in grade as a CW4 but no later than 1 year after
promotion to CW5, warrant officers should attend the WOSSC at the Warrant Officer Career College. Again,
proponent schools may provide a follow-on portion of this course. Upon completion of the WOSSC and promotion to
CW5, the warrant officer will serve the remainder of his or her career in positions designated for that grade.
3–12. Introduction to officer skills
A skill identifier (SI) identifies specific skills that are required to perform the duties of a particular position and are not
related to any one branch, FA or career field. There are over 250 skills in the current Army regulation, many of which
require special schooling, training, and experiences in which qualification is maintained.
3–13. Joint officer professional development
   a. Joint Qualification System. Statutory changes in the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for FY
2007 resulted in the establishment of different levels of joint qualification as well as criteria for qualification at each
level. The Joint Qualification System acknowledges both designated Joint billets as well as experience-based Joint duty
assignments in contributing to the development of Joint Qualified Officers. These assignments with the necessary
JPME culminate with an officer being identified as a fully Joint Qualified Officer and the receipt of the 3L identifier.
20                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   b. Standard-Joint duty assignments.
   (1) The standard-Joint duty assignment list is a consolidated list of standard-Joint duty assignment lists approved for
Joint credit by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy. The standard-Joint duty assignment
list has approximately 3,916 billets for Army majors through colonels. A standard-Joint duty assignment list is a
designated position where an officer gains significant experience in joint matters. The preponderance of an officer’s
duties involves producing or promulgating National Military Strategy, Joint doctrine and policy, strategic and contin-
gency planning, and command and control of combat operations under a unified command. Serving in a standard-Joint
duty assignment list affords an officer the opportunity to fulfill the necessary Joint experience criteria on the path to
becoming a Joint Qualified Officer.
   (2) The provisions of Title 10 United States Code (10 USC), specify that officers on the ADL may not be appointed
to the grade of brigadier general unless they have completed a full tour of duty in a Joint duty assignment and have
been selected for the additional skill identifier (ASI) of 3L (Joint Qualified Officer). The Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Force Management Policy may waive the Joint duty assignment requirement, the Joint Qualified Officer
requirement, or both on a case-by-case basis for the following reasons: for scientific and/or technical qualifications for
which Joint duty assignment positions do not exist; for officers serving in professional specialties; for officers serving
in a Joint duty assignment for at least 12 months that began before 1 January 1987; for officers serving in a Joint duty
assignment at least 180 days on the date the board convenes; and lastly, for the “good of the Service.”
   c. Joint duty credit. The statutory tour length for most standard-Joint duty assignment lists is 36 months to the day
for field grade officers and 2 years for general officers. After completing a full tour of duty in a standard-Joint duty
assignment list, officers will be awarded the 3A (Joint Duty Qualified) SI. An officer begins to accrue Joint duty credit
upon assignment to a standard-Joint duty assignment list billet and stops accruing Joint duty credit on departure.
Critical occupational specialty officers (major to colonel) who meet the early release criteria may receive full tour
credit for serving at least 2 years in their initial Joint duty assignment. Officers possessing a critical occupational
specialty may be released early from a Joint duty assignment with the approval of the Joint activity if they meet all of
the criteria below.
   (1) Must be serving in their initial Joint duty assignment.
   (2) Reassignment must be to the critical occupational specialty specific skill held by the officer being released from
the Joint duty assignment.
   (3) Officers must serve at least 2 years in that standard-Joint duty assignment list.
   d. Experience-based Joint duty assignment. An experience-based Joint duty assignments may include non-Joint duty
assignment list assignments and experiences that demonstrate an officer’s mastery of knowledge, skills, and abilities in
Joint matters. Officers may gain experience points towards achieving Joint Qualified Officer status by having their non-
Joint duty assignment list assignments validated by a Joint Qualification System experience panel. These experiences
may be shorter in duration; therefore, they may be aggregated to achieve the equivalent of a full Joint tour of duty in a
standard-Joint duty assignment list. Officers may submit their request for experience points through a self-nomination
process in coordination with their HRC assignment officer and the HRC Joint Policy Section.
   e. Joint Qualified Officers. Joint Qualified Officers are educated and experienced in the employment, deployment,
and support of unified and multinational forces to achieve national security objectives. Joint Qualified Officers provide
continuity for Joint matters that are critical to strategic and operational planning and serve within the Joint arena and
their service. Field grade officers eligible for the Joint Qualified Officer designation must meet the highest standards of
performance, complete both Phase I and II of a JPME program and successfully complete a full tour of duty in a
standard-Joint duty assignment list or have the necessary points from experience-based Joint duty assignment lists.
Officers approved by the Secretary of Defense will be awarded the 3L (Joint Specialty Officer) SI.
   f. Joint professional military education. The Army Officer Education System is in compliance with CJCSI 1800.
01D. The requirement for Joint education stems from the Goldwater-Nichols DOD Reorganization Act of 1986. The
Goldwater-Nichols DOD Reorganization Act of 1986 makes the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff the principal official to
assist the Secretary of Defense in JPME matters, including the Joint curricula at Service schools. Further, as prescribed
in 10 USC 663, the Secretary of Defense, with advice and assistance from Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, periodically
reviews and revises the curricula of Joint education programs. Intermediate and senior staff college Army institutions
are accredited by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff JPME programs. Graduates meet the requirements for JPME.
   (1) The CJCSI 1800.01D defines Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff objectives and policies regarding the Army
educational institutions that comprise the officer PME and JPME systems. The CJCSI 1800.01D also identifies the
fundamental responsibilities of the major military educational participants in achieving those objectives. The Army
provides officer PME and JPME to eligible Armed Forces officers, international officers, eligible Federal Government
Civilians and other approved students. The Army operates its officer PME system primarily to develop officers with
expertise and knowledge appropriate to their grade, branch, and occupational specialty. Incorporated throughout PME,
officers receive JPME from pre-commissioning through general/flag officer rank.
   (2) JPME is a Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff-approved body of objectives, outcomes, policies, procedures, and
standards supporting the educational requirements for Joint officer management. The JPME is imbedded in Army
programs of instructions and in concert with PME produces desired outcomes in support of the Joint Officer
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              21

Management System. The JPME is a three-phase Joint education program taught in the Command and General Staff
School (Fort Leavenworth), the U.S. Army War College, at other Service intermediate- or senior-level colleges, the
Joint Forces Staff College, and at the National Defense University for the CAPSTONE course.
   (3) The Army operates the officer PME system primarily to develop officers with expertise and knowledge
appropriate to their grade, branch, and occupational specialty. Embedded within the PME system, however, is a
program of JPME overseen by the Joint Staff and designed to fulfill the educational requirements for Joint officer
management as mandated by the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986. Incorporated throughout Army PME, officers receive
JPME from pre-commissioning through general/flag officer. Army PME is structured in five military educational levels
to support five significant phases in an officer’s career.
   (a) Pre-commissioning. Military education received at institutions and through programs producing commissioned
officers upon graduation.
   (b) Primary. Education typically received at grades O1 through O3.
   (c) Intermediate. Education typically received at grade O4.
   (d) Senior. Education typically received at grades O5 or O6.
   (e) General/flag officer. Education received as a general/flag officer.
   (4) All Army branch and FA officers will complete pre-commissioning, primary and intermediate (J Phase I). Award
of J credit is dependent on completion of appropriate to the grade, branch, and FA.
   (a) J Phase I. The J Phase I is incorporated into the curricula of intermediate and senior-level military service J
schools and other appropriate educational programs that meet J criteria and are accredited by the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. J Phase I is integrated into the ILE curricula at the Command and General Staff College and all other
Service Intermediate Level Colleges. Other programs, as approved by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, may
satisfy the J Phase I requirement.
   (b) J Phase II. The J Phase II is that portion of the Program for Joint Education that complements J Phase I. The J
Phase II is taught at the Joint Forces Staff College to both intermediate and senior-level students. Field grade officers
must complete J Phase I to be eligible to attend J Phase II. Under exceptional conditions, the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff may approve a direct-entry waiver to permit an officer to complete J Phase II without having completed
J Phase I. The J Phase II is integrated, along with J Phase I, into the curricula at all senior-level colleges to include the
U.S. Army War College.
   (5) J Phase II graduates. The Army must ensure that the following requirements are met by officers who graduate
from each of the National Defense University schools (for example, the National War College, the Eisenhower School
for National Security, or the Joint Forces Staff College) for each FY:
   (a) All Joint Qualified Officers must be assigned to a Joint duty assignment as their next duty assignment following
graduation, unless waived on a case-by-case basis by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy.
   (b) More than 50 percent (defined as 50 percent plus one) of all non-Joint Qualified Officer graduates from each of
those schools must be assigned to a Joint duty assignment as their next duty assignment following graduation.
   (c) One half of the officers subject to that requirement (for each school) may be assigned to a Joint duty assignment
as their second.
   (d) The Army shall coordinate with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to document compliance.
3–14. Assignment process and considerations
The life-cycle of a cohort year group spans 30 years of service. Some officers from a cohort may attain general officer
status and be retained in service beyond that point. Some warrant officers may attain the rank of CW5 and also serve
up to 30 years of warrant officer service. The assignment process throughout an officer’s career is based on several
factors and considerations. The environmental factors in which operates can affect the assignments an officer may
receive. The assignment process has these elements:
   a. Army requirements. The central engine that drives and the assignment process is Army requirements. Army
requirements are those positions that must be filled by officers to accomplish our wartime and peacetime missions.
When an officer leaves a position, the losing agency generates a requisition for a replacement. Army requirements for
officers are specified on the various TOE and TDA structures. Grade, branch, FA, skill, and special remarks are
documented for each position within The Army Authorization Documents System, which is maintained by the DCS,
G–3/5/7. Annually, the Army projects positions to be filled and places officers on PCS orders to occupy the vacancies.
Within the Officer Personnel Management Directorate, the requisition cycles span 6 months, and the assignment
branches determine which officers meet the position requirements and are available for the assignment.
   b. Availability for assignment. Officers are considered available for assignment when they complete the required
tour length as specified in AR 614–100 for CONUS and OCONUS locations. DOD and Army policies for tour length
are changed based on a variety of external factors, to include budget limitations. Force stabilization is an important
factor in future assignment decisions.
   c. Professional development needs. Professional development in the officer’s designated branch, FA or AOC/MOS
is important to the assignment manager; however, force stabilization will be an equally important consideration. Each
22                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

branch and FA has a life-cycle development model. The officer’s career needs are examined in light of these models to
ensure the next assignment is progressive, sequential and achieves the professional development goal for that grade.
   d. Other assignment considerations. Besides Army requirements, availability and professional development, the
assignment managers scrutinize other considerations in arriving at an appropriate assignment.
   (1) Preference. Officers should frequently update their preference statement for location, type of assignments,
personal data, professional development goals and education and training needs. Assignment managers may not be able
to satisfy all preferences because of dynamic requirements, but they do attempt to satisfy as many as possible.
   (2) Training and education. Whenever possible, assignment managers provide schooling en route to the officer’s
next assignment to meet the special requirements of the position. Civilian educational goals that are specific require-
ments of positions or professional development will also be considered during the assignment process.
   (3) Personal and compassionate factors. Personal crises occur in every officer’s career. The Officer Personnel
Management Directorate assignment managers attempt to assist in such circumstances by adjusting the assignment.
However, officers should apprise their assignment manager of such personal or compassionate considerations at the
time they occur and not wait until an assignment action is pending. In some cases, formal requests for compassionate
deferment from assignment or request for reassignment are needed in accordance with AR 614–100. Officers should
coordinate with local Soldier support activity for processing such documents. Officers with dependents having special
needs should enroll in the Exceptional Family Member Program.
   (4) Overseas equity. Overseas equity must be a consideration when selecting officers for assignments. With the
Army serving in a variety of overseas locations, the equitable distribution of OCONUS and unaccompanied tours
among all officers is a morale concern as well as a developmental experience in many branches and FAs. Overseas
tours broaden the professionalism of the officer corps, and assignment managers consider this element of tour equity in
each assignment action.
3–15. Individual career management
The OPMS provides leader and technical training for company grade, field grade, and warrant officers. Negotiating
through this multitude of possibilities to meet the needs of the Army and the important needs of the individual is the
result of interaction among the individual officer, the commander, the proponent, and the Officer Personnel Manage-
ment Directorate assignment manager. Each has an important part to play in the professional development of not only
individual officers, but of the officer corps as a whole.
   a. The individual. In many respects, officers are ultimately their own career managers. While Army requirements
dictate the final outcome of all development actions, in every case the officer must participate in such decisions.
Participation in the officer development process is possible at the basic branching/career management field (CMF)
designation point, volunteering for training and education programs, selection of FA, preferences for functional
category, application for entry into special programs and long-range planning of career goals. The key is to be involved
in professional development by making informed and logical decisions and acting on them. One important element of
an officer’s involvement is the accurate reflection of capabilities in the official personnel management files maintained
by HQDA.
   (1) The Army Military Human Resource Record, the DA Form 4037 (Officer Record Brief), and the career
management individual file contain the data from which important professional development decisions are made for
selection, advancement, assignment and retention. Officers should review, update, and maintain these records through-
out their careers. Officers should also request periodic advice and counseling from commanders, supervisors, senior
officers and HRC career managers to remain informed of career opportunities and to assess progress achieving career
goals.
   (2) To facilitate individual career management, each officer should maintain a current 5-year plan that at a
minimum, depicts operational and broadening assignment goals, desired PME courses and timelines, and key personal/
family milestones so that when the time comes to discuss assignments with branch managers or raters/senior raters,
offices are prepared, informed, and can contribute to the career management process. In addition, officers can employ
the Army Career Tracker to view career development opportunities and career maps, in an effort to simplify the career
management process and better empower the individual officer.
   b. The commander. Commanders play a critical part in development by understanding the roles of all their officers,
their education and development needs and incorporating them into a unit officer professional development process. All
officers look to their rater, senior rater, and mentors for advice and career counseling. Some counseling is official, such
as the preparation and submission of the OER and DA Form 67–10–1A (Officer Evaluation Report Support Form).
Other forms of counseling are often unofficial and relate to career patterns, advice about assignments and duty
positions. Regardless of the type of counseling, commanders should be factually informed before rendering advice.
This is especially important given the changes in manning guidance, career progression, attitude, and culture over the
course of a rater’s or senior rater’s career. Experiences that raters and senior raters had as junior and mid-grade officers
will not always replicate circumstances and experiences their subordinates face at similar points in their career timeline.
In some cases, providing uninformed guidance based on “how things used to be” is as detrimental to a subordinate’s
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              23

career as providing no guidance at all. To that end, this pamphlet contains many of the professional development facts
that commanders need to give wise counsel.
   c. The proponents. Proponents design life-cycle development models for their branches, FAs and AOC/MOS and
monitor the overall professional development of officer populations. Logical and realistic career patterns, qualifying
objectives and an accurate understanding of attrition and promotion flows are vital ingredients in each branch or FA.
Leader development action plans and life-cycle development models should be constructed to meet overall Army
requirements as well as branch, FA and functional category objectives. Constant contact with the officer population and
the Officer Personnel Management Directorate assignment branches should be sustained to communicate goals and
objectives of the branch and FA.
   d. Officer Personnel Management Directorate assignment managers. Assignment and career managers at HRC,
Officer Personnel Management Directorate are responsible for fulfilling current and future Army requirements while
meeting the professional development needs of the various branches, FAs, and functional categories. Additionally, they
balance the best interests of the individual officers against the Army requirements. Career managers can provide
candid, realistic advice to officers about their developmental needs. As the executors of Army and proponent programs,
they operate within the existing policy and manning guidance, budget, and legal framework to make decisions
concerning assignments, schooling, manner of performance and subjective evaluations of competitiveness for selection
and retention. All officers should communicate frequently with their assignment managers to receive guidance and
advice on professional development.
Chapter 4
Officer Education
4–1. Scope
   a. Training and education requirements. Common training requirements apply to all officers, WO1 through O6, and
specify the skills, knowledge, and attributes required of every officer. Other training and education requirements for
branch, FA, or skill codes apply to officers in a particular specialty.
   b. Training and education methods. Officer education occurs in institutional settings, in operational assignments and
through self-development. Institutional training represents the resident training an officer receives in military and/or
civilian institutions. Self-development encompasses nonresident schooling including individual study, distributive learn-
ing, research, professional reading, practice, and self-assessment.
4–2. The Officer Education System
   a. Strategic objective. The strategic objective of the Officer Education System is to provide an education and
training system operationally relevant to the current environment, but structured to support the future environment by
producing more capable, adaptable and confident leaders through continuous investment in personal growth and
professional development throughout their careers. To achieve this objective, the Army has embraced an experiential
and competency-based education and training model in its education system. This model integrates current technologi-
cal capabilities to rapidly advance learning in both individual and collective training requirements while providing
Army leaders the right training and education in the right medium, at the right time and place for success in their next
assignment. This model supports the Army’s service culture and Warrior Ethos, and produces leaders who can resolve
dilemmas under stress, make decisions, and lead formations. The institutional side of the Army is a series of leadership
laboratories focused on learning, growing, achieving competency, and getting better training into units.
   b. Officer Education System goal. The goal of the Officer Education System is to produce a corps of leaders who
are fully competent in technical, tactical, and leadership skills, knowledge, and experience; understand how the Army
runs; are prepared to operate in JIIM environments; and can demonstrate confidence, integrity, critical judgment, and
responsibility; operate in an environment of complexity, ambiguity, and rapid change; build effective teams amid
organizational and technological change; and adapt to and solve problems creatively. The products of this system are
officers who are highly specialized experts, trainers, and leaders; fully competent in technical, tactical, and leadership
skills; creative problem solvers able to function in highly complex and dynamic environments; proficient operators,
maintainers, administrators, and managers of Army equipment, support activities, and technical systems. Officer leader
development is a continuous process that begins with pre-commissioning/pre-appointment training and education.
   c. The Officer Education System is a sequence of the PME for professionals in subjects that enhance knowledge of
the science and art of war. The PME is a progressive education system that prepares leaders for increased responsibili-
ties and successful performance at the next higher level by developing the key knowledge, skills, and attributes they
require to operate successfully at that level in any environment. PME is linked to promotions, future assignments, and
career management models for all officers.
4–3. Current paths to officer education
Current Force educational models will be followed in parallel with Future Force models. Currently, officers enter active
24                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

duty with diverse educational backgrounds and civilian experience. This diversity is amplified by the great variety of
service experiences among officers with different branches and FAs. The current Officer Education System permits
officers to build upon achievements and experience and progress to a higher level of learning. Opportunities exist for
resident and nonresident instruction. There are multiple paths to obtaining a professional education. Officers may
follow different paths to achieve success, even where they share the same branch, FA or MOS.
4–4. Guides for branch, military occupational specialty, or functional are development courses
   a. Education requirements are satisfied by both the Army’s military schools and by civilian institutions. The BOLC
and the branch CCC includes training specific to junior officers (WO1, O1 through O3). The ILE, Command and
General Staff College, and SSC provide opportunities for advanced military and leader development training. The
warrant officer specific PME courses are described fully in paragraph 4–7h. Specialized courses offered by military and
civilian institutions provide additional opportunities for assignment oriented FA and functional category education.
Other Services and elements of the Federal Government offer courses that support officer professional development.
Advanced education may consist of resident and/or nonresident courses.
   b. Numerous courses support both Army requirements and the professional needs of individual officers. It is difficult
to anticipate and specify the many combinations of courses that apply to both Army and individual needs. However,
representative courses particularly suitable for various branches, MOS and FAs are discussed in detail in paragraphs
4–7, 4–16, and 4–17. (Also see branch and FA-specific chapters in this pamphlet.)
   c. Officers designated to serve in FAs will receive specialized training and education so that they develop the
necessary skills and technical qualifications to perform the duties required of their FA. Courses of study leading to
graduate degrees at civilian colleges and universities may meet these needs. Specific educational requirements are
outlined in the FA proponent chapters of this publication.
   d. The primary reference for Army courses is the online Army Training Requirements and Resources System
(ATRRS) course catalog at https://www.atrrs.army.mil. Most of the courses listed in the FA pages of this resource
include course identification numbers that are assigned an established code. (These codes are explained in ATRRS.)
The additional references listed below can assist officers in planning their developmental training and education:
   (1) AR 350–1.
   (2) AR 611–1.
   (3) AR 621–1.
   (4) AR 621–7.
   e. Detailed information, including enrollment procedures for correspondence courses, is included in ATRRS at:
https://www.atrrs.army.mil. In many cases, correspondence courses paralleling the numbered resident courses listed in
ATRRS are available. The correspondence courses represent an important alternative means of career field develop-
ment to many of the resident courses because of their flexibility and convenience.
   f. ATRRS lists some of the applicable DOD courses. Joint distributed learning (DL) provides an interservice DL
catalog that can be accessed at: http://catalog.jointadlcolab.org/index.asp.
   g. Occasionally, a course may be found under an Army number and the number of another Service and listed in
more than one catalog. A few of the courses listed have no numbers. In such cases, officers may want to contact the
responsible school for pertinent descriptive material.
   h. Officers will not enroll in other than Army schools without written approval of the CG, HRC and the DCS, G–3/
5/7, Director of Training. Officers successfully completing other Services’ Intermediate Staff Colleges and SSCs
accredited in accordance with CJCSI 1800.01D will be awarded MEL and JPME credit accordingly upon fulfilling
Army JPME requirements.
   i. ATRRS is the Army system of record for training. This system allows officers to research information regarding
different schools and courses. The system is also used to track enrollment and interfaces with personnel systems to
record the completion of courses.
   j. AA Soldiers will generally attend resident training at the proponent site. However, in some cases AA Soldiers
may attend the Army training study courses taught at Total Army School System (TASS) battalions. These courses are
resident courses. These are different from RC configured courses, which are not treated as resident courses.
4–5. Nonresident schools and instruction
   a. All officers are encouraged to further their branch, or FA education through appropriate courses of nonresident
instruction. The successful completion of a given level of nonresident instruction is considered on an equivalent level
of attainment to, but does not rule out, future attendance at a resident course of instruction. An exception is enrollment
in the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course, which awards JPME I, not JPME II as with the resident
program, and rules out attendance at a resident SSC.
   b. Equivalent level of attainment means that an officer who has reached a specific MEL through nonresident
instruction receives the same consideration in assignment, promotion and future schooling as an officer whose MEL
was reached through resident instruction. Officers will not enroll in other than Army schools without written approval
of the CG, HRC and the DCS, G–3/5/7, Director of Training. Officers who do not have the opportunity to attend a
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              25

resident course should complete the level of PME appropriate to their grade through nonresident instruction. However,
to attend ILE/JPME I and SSC/JPME II, officers must be HQDA board selected. There is no equivalent level of
attainment for the BOLC B, where resident participation is required.
   c. Nonresident instruction allows officers to advance their professional education and their careers, thereby enhanc-
ing their overall performance and potential. Military school courses available through correspondence, with and without
a resident phase, are listed in, ATRRS, TASS, and the TRADOC Online Library.
4–6. Educational counseling
The numerous educational opportunities and frequent moves in the Army often make it difficult to plan educational
programs. Officers frequently need professional educational counseling and support. Commanders and supervisors play
a significant role in the development of subordinate officers. Officers should turn to their commander, mentor, rater,
assignment officer local Army Education Center, or an education counselor at the appropriate Service school. The
Warrant Officer Career College at Fort Rucker, AL is another excellent source for warrant officer education counsel-
ing. In addition, many civilian institutions provide counseling services.
4–7. Military schools
   a. Basic Officer Leaders Course Phase B. Upon commissioning an officer is assigned to a branch. The first training
the officer attends is BOLC B. The BOLC B is a rigorous, branch immaterial course, physically and mentally
challenging, with the majority of the training conducted via hands-on in a tactical or field environment. Focusing on
training at the platoon level, a cadre of officers and noncommissioned officers (NCOs) will continuously evaluate each
student’s performance in a series of leadership positions, under various conditions/situations. The student officers also
participate in several peer reviews and self-assessments. The curriculum includes advanced land navigation training,
rifle marksmanship, weapons familiarization, practical exercises in leadership, urban operations, convoy operations, and
use of night vision equipment. It culminates in squad and platoon situational-training exercises using contemporary
operational environment scenarios. Additionally, students must negotiate confidence courses that challenge them to
overcome personal fears. Junior officers depart BOLC B with a confidence in their ability to lead small units, an
appreciation for the branches of the combined arms team, and a clear understanding of their personal strengths and
weaknesses. There is no ADSO for BOLC B attendance. Direct commission officers may attend the BOLC - Direct
Commissioned Officer Course, a BOLC A prep course for officers who did not have the benefit of participating in
BOLC A pre-commissioning training.
   b. Branch detail program. Upon commissioning, selected lieutenants appointed to the Signal, Quartermaster, Ord-
nance, Transportation or Finance branches may be detailed to a combat arms branch for a minimum of 2 years or
longer if affected by life-cycle manning. Selected Military Intelligence and Adjutant General (AG) officers are detailed
for 4 years. Lieutenants under the branch detail program attend the BOLC and participate in branch-specific training
for the branch to which they are detailed. On completing the detail, officers attend a 4-week branch transition course,
as prescribed by their chief of branch, before they return to their designated branch. Officers in the 4-year program
receive transition branch training in conjunction with their enrollment in the CCC. All officers continue to participate
in branch-specific training once they are reassigned back to their designated branches.
   c. Captain Career Course. The CCC is intended for captains with at least 3 years in service, and provides them with
the tactical, technical, and leader knowledge and skills needed to lead company-size units and serve on battalion and
brigade staffs. The course emphasizes the development of leader competencies while integrating recent operational
experiences of the students with quality institutional training. It facilitates lifelong learning through an emphasis on
self-development. The curriculum includes common core subjects, branch-specific tactical and technical instruction,
and branch immaterial staff officer training.
   (1) The RC CCC provides the same educational outcomes as the CCC (AA) in roughly the same amount of time as
the former RC Officer Advanced Course and RC Combined Arms and Services Staff School. The RC CCC now
follows a 13-month model which includes two 15-day resident periods, and 11 months for completing branch-specific
DL phases. Branches may include a technical prerequisite DL phase prior to the first resident phase. Officers have the
flexibility to complete the DL at home station. CCC is a requirement for RC officers’ promotion to major.
   (2) Coordinating staff modules (S1, S2, assistant S3, S4, S5, and battalion maintenance officer) exist to provide
assignment oriented training for AA and RC officers preparing to serve in these staff positions. Each module consists
of approximately 35 hours of DL.
   (3) The AA and Active Guard Reserve (AGR) officers normally will attend their branch-specific CCC in residence:
   (a) As soon as practical after promotion to captain.
   (b) As soon as possible after completing 4 years of active Federal commissioned service.
   (c) Prior to the 7th year of Federal commissioned service.
   (4) The RC officers may enroll in the RC CCC upon completion of BOLC B and promotion to first lieutenant.
Those who desire to enroll prior to this time require a waiver by the unit commander, or by the CG, HRC for members
of the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR). The RC officers must enroll in the CCC prior to completing 8 years of
commissioned service.
26                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (a) The RC officers must satisfy the following prerequisites for enrollment into the CCC:
   (b) Be a commissioned officer in the grade of first lieutenant or captain.
   (c) Meet the standards of AR 140–1, AR 600–9, and AR 350–1.
   (5) The process by which RC officers enroll in CCC depends on their component. Troop program unit (TPU) offices
are enrolled through their ATRRS manager, then approved at Level 1 (unit, battalion, brigade level), after which HRC
approves the quota and reserves the seat. IRR, individual mobilization augmentee (IMA) and AGR officers enroll
through their respective branch assignment officer at HRC.
   d. Intermediate Staff College. The Army Intermediate Staff College program of PME instruction is ILE. Effective in
August 2005 and for officers in Year Group (YG) 1994 and subsequent year groups, ILE replaced the existing
Command and General Staff Officers Course. The ILE consists of a common core curriculum that includes JPME
Phase 1 requirements and the required branch and/or FA specialized education or qualification course. Successful
completion of both ILE Common Core and the respective qualification course is required for award of JPME Phase I
credit and MEL 4. JPME Phase I is that portion of the ILE Common Core concentrating on instruction of joint matters.
Officers must complete JPME Phase I to be eligible to attend JPME Phase II or a SSC. Completion of ILE is
recognized by award of MEL ILE and the code of Command and Staff College graduate.
   (1) All ACC officers will attend ILE following selection to major but no later than the start of their 15th year of
commissioned service.
   (2) Starting with YG2004 and subsequent, merit-based selection boards will be conducted in conjunction with
promotion selection to major to consider ACC Army officers for attendance to ILE, regardless of component or branch
for 10-month resident, 14-week satellite campus, and ILE distance education opportunities on a best-qualified basis.
AC ACC officers will also be considered for select credentialing programs approved in lieu of the ILE Advanced
Operations Course.
   (3) Special branch officers will continue to be board selected for resident ILE attendance. Special branch proponents
will determine completion requirements and timelines for special branch officers.
   (4) RC officers will continue to be board selected for resident ILE attendance. RC officers will complete ILE prior
to their 15th year of commissioned service.
   (5) Most branch officers and some FA officers will receive the ILE Common Core Course at Fort Leavenworth, KS
during the first 16 weeks of ILE, after which they will receive the Advanced Operations Course for 24 weeks. Most FA
officers and some branch will receive the Common Core Course from Command and General Staff College instructors
at one of the satellite campuses and as prescribed through advanced distributed learning and TASS. Following the
common core instruction, FA officers attend individual qualification course ranging from 4 to 178 weeks in length.
Qualification courses provide officers the technical preparation for assignments in their respective FAs. Branch officers
who attend ILE Common Core Course at a satellite campus must complete the Advanced Operations Course via
distance learning. Completion of the ILE Common Core and the respective branch or FA qualification course qualifies
the officers for award of MEL 4 (ILE) and the code Command and Staff College graduate and JPME I.
   (6) Branch officers will receive qualification course credit and award of JPME Phase I credit upon completion of the
other than Army Intermediate Staff Colleges that are accredited in accordance with CJCSI 1800.01D. Branch and FA
officers selected for attendance at other Services or Joint resident intermediate staff colleges and/or selected for
attendance at other nation’s intermediate staff colleges must first complete the 2 week ILE preparatory course. Officers
attending the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base, AL, and the College of Naval Command
and Staff at Newport, RI, are afforded the opportunity to participate in the ILE preparatory course upon arrival at those
locations. The remaining officers attending other than the Army Intermediate Staff College are afforded an opportunity
to participate in ILE preparatory course at Fort Leavenworth, KS. Unless otherwise authorized through an DCS, G–3/5/
7 exception to policy, branch and FA officers selected or approved for attendance at other Service DL, blended
learning or nonresident intermediate staff colleges programs must first complete the qualification/credentialing course
for their respective branch or FA. FA and special branch officers may attend international and sister Service schools,
but must still attend their respective qualification courses to be credentialed ILE.
   (7) Officers may compete for selection to attend a DOD, Congressional, or Interagency fellowship in lieu of the the
Advanced Operations Course portion of ILE but area still required to complete the common core instruction at one of
the satellite campuses.
   e. Advanced Military Studies Program. The Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP) is a yearlong resident
course taught by the School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) at the Command and General Staff College. The
purpose of the AMSP is to provide the Army and the other services with specially educated officers for command and
general staff positions at tactical and operational echelons. The program provides its graduates an advanced education
in the military arts and sciences focused at the operational level. Additionally, the program provides training in the
practical skills needed to plan and conduct battles, major operations and campaigns and in adapting doctrine and
techniques to the changing realities of war. Applicants must be ILE qualified or resident students in ILE or sister
Service resident programs. There are a mix of students from AA, RC, other Services, and international officer students
selected for attendance each year. The Director, SAMS accepts applications from August through October of each year.
   f. Senior Service College. The SSCs are at the apex of the military schools system and award JPME II credit and the
                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                               27

SSC graduate code (MEL 1). SSCs prepare officers for senior command and staff positions within the Army and DOD.
These colleges include the U.S. Army War College, the Advanced Strategic Leadership Studies Program within the
School of Advanced Studies at Fort Leavenworth, the National War College, the Eisenhower School for National
Security (formerly Industrial College of the Armed Forces), the College of International Security Affairs, the Naval
War College, the Air War College, the Inter-American Defense College, the Joint Advanced Warfighting School, other
accredited international senior military service colleges. Additionally, approximately 40 civilian and military fellowship
programs provide SSC graduate code (MEL 1) but do not provide JPME II nor a master’s degree.
   (1) The SSC eligibility requirements for officers are:
   (a) DA Board selected.
   (b) Must be JPME Phase 1 complete.
   (c) Must be lieutenant colonel or above.
   (d) Will have no more than 22 years of active Federal commissioned service. Promotion list service determines
years of service for AA officers (except Medical Command). The Federal commissioned service is the governing factor
for Medical Command officers and for other-than-AA officers.
   (2) Military and Army Civilian positions that require SSC education are defined as follows: A military member,
lieutenant colonel/CW5 and above, or Army Civilian, GS–14 and above or NSPS pay band 3 and above, who occupies
a leadership position (both command and staff) that requires a thorough knowledge of strategy and the art and science
of developing and using instruments of National power (diplomatic, economic, military, and informational) during
peace and war. This knowledge is necessary in order to perform Army, Joint, or Defense Agency operations at the
strategic level (ACOM, ASCC, DRU, field operating agency, Joint Task Force, or higher).
   (3) Officers who have completed 16 years Federal commissioned service, have credit for ILE schooling, do not have
more than 23 years Federal commissioned service as of 1 October of the year of entry into the college, and are serving
as lieutenant colonels or colonels as of the board’s convening date are eligible to attend an SSC. The annual Army SSC
Selection Board selects officers on a best-qualified basis. Branch and FA floors, based on Army requirements, are
considered during the SSC selection process. There is a 2-year ADSO for attendance at SSC schooling.
   (4) The Army’s Senior Leaders Course is the U.S. Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, PA. The mission of the
U.S. Army War College is to prepare selected military, Army Civilian, and international leaders for the responsibilities
of strategic leadership; educate current and future leaders on the development and employment of land power in a JIIM
environment; to research and publish on National security and military strategy; and to engage in activities that support
the Army’s strategic communication efforts. The U.S. Army War College conducts both a resident education program
and a distance education program. Successful completion of either program results in the awarding of a U.S. Army
War College Diploma and a Master of Strategic Studies Degree. (The U.S. Army War College is accredited by the
Middle States Commission on Higher Education). Resident education program graduates also receive JPME Phase II
(JPME II) credit. Distance education program graduates receive JPME I credit.
   g. Senior Service Fellowship.
   (1) The primary goal of all fellowships is professional development. Officers who participate in the SSC Fellowship
Program forego any other opportunity for SSC education. SSC credit will be granted to senior Army officers who
successfully complete at least a 9-month program. The program must be academically structured to provide an
educational experience requiring fellows to study and evaluate critically broad National security policy, strategy,
interagency, and operational issues to substantially enhance their ability, as senior Army leaders, to participate
effectively in the formulation and implementation of national security policy.
   (2) The Advanced Strategic Leadership Studies Program (previously named the Advanced Operational Art Studies
Fellowship) is a 24-month senior-level course held at the SAMS, Fort Leavenworth, KS.
   (a) The focus of the first academic year is on planning and operations at the theater-strategic level at unified,
component and Joint Task Force level headquarters. Students follow a rigorous set curriculum, with emphasis on
national security strategy, military theory, strategic studies, military history, and campaign planning.
   (b) The senior-level course seminar at the SAMS has eight U.S. Army, two U.S. Air Force, one U.S. Marine Corps,
one U.S. Coast Guard, one or two U.S. agency representatives (typically Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S.
Agency for International Development) and three international officers (usually from the United Kingdom, Canada, and
Germany). U.S. Army officers attend for 2 years; most other students 10 months—international officers and U.S.
Marine Corps officers typically stay for a 2nd year to serve as seminar leaders for the AMSP conducted at SAMS.
   (c) This senior-level course is designed to develop theater-level senior leaders and general staff officers for positions
of significant responsibility including strategic thinkers and planners at Combatant Commands, Joint Task Forces, and
other four-star headquarters. During the first year, students are in a curriculum shaped by the required learning areas
for JPME II accreditation. The curriculum provides a comprehensive, multifaceted focus at the theater/strategic level
across the spectrum of Joint and land force operations—during peace, crisis, and war. In their second year, designated
students become members of the SAMS faculty responsible to provide the coaching, mentoring, counseling, and
military subject instruction for the education of the officers in the AMSP program.
   (d) Students in the senior-level course spend approximately 9 weeks temporary duty (TDY), with fieldwork
conducted at defense organizations and military headquarters in various foreign nations as well as visiting all
28                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

Combatant Command headquarters throughout the globe. They must also complete a 40 page research paper. Advanced
Strategic Leadership Studies Program graduates are awarded MEL 1 credit and skill identifier 6S (AMSP graduate).
Graduates also receive a masters in Theater Strategy through the Command and General Staff College. This degree
granting program is accredited by North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.
   (3) Other Senior Service Fellowships are governed in accordance with AR 621–7. The proponent for Army
fellowships is DCS, G–3/5/7, Strategic Leadership Division.
   (4) Fellowship opportunities are designed to provide unique personal and professional educational experiences to
Army officers that are not available through traditional PME. Fellowships enhance the officer’s capabilities to meet
specific requirements for Army leaders that serve at the highest levels of the national security establishment.
   h. Warrant officer schools.
   (1) Warrant Officer Candidate School. All AA warrant officer candidates must attend the resident WOCS at Fort
Rucker, AL. The ARNG and USAR warrant officer candidates may attend WOCS at either Fort Rucker, AL or at one
of the RC-regional training institute. WOCS graduates are conditionally appointed to WO1 (grade WO1). Appointment
is contingent upon certification by the MOS proponent that the warrant officer is technically and tactically qualified to
serve in the authorized warrant officer MOS.
   (2) Warrant Officer Basic Course. Upon graduation from WOCS and appointment to WO1, each officer will attend
functional specialty training at WOBC, which is a functional specialty development course taught at various proponent
schools that prepares newly appointed officers for their assignments as WO1. Training is performance oriented and
focuses on technical skills, leadership, effective communication, unit training, maintenance operations, security, prop-
erty accountability, tactics, and development of subordinates. The WOBC graduates are recognized as WOBC
“GRAD”. Branch proponents are responsible for developing and updating WOBC training and technical certification
standards.
   (3) Warrant Officer Advanced Course. The WOAC is MOS-specific and builds upon the skills, knowledge, and
attributes developed through previous training and experience. The course provides officers the leader, tactical, and
technical training needed to serve in company and higher-level positions. WOAC training consists of two components:
   (a) Prerequisite studies. This is a mandatory nonresident course that must be completed prior to attending the
proponent/branch resident WOAC training. The Action Officer Development Course (131 P00) was adopted as the
resource for this DL course. It is completed online and provides warrant officers serving in CW2 or higher duty
positions relevant training in organization and management techniques, communication skills, preparing and staffing
documents, conducting meetings and interviews, problem solving, time management, writing, coordinating activities,
and ethics. Enrollment must occur after promotion to CW2 in order to qualify for WOAC Prerequisite Studies credit.
CW2s have the flexibility to enroll at any convenient time after promotion to CW2. Once enrolled, the course must be
completed within 1 year.
   (b) Resident course. CW2s are eligible to attend their MOS WOAC. ADL warrant officers will attend the advanced
course at their respective proponent school no later than 1 year after promotion to CW3. ARNG warrant officers
complete this training prior to promotion to CW3. USAR warrant officers must complete this training prior to selection
for CW3. The branch phase varies in length depending on the branch. Primary focus is directed toward leadership skill
reinforcement, staff skills, and advanced MOS-specific training. The course consists of in-depth training in MOS-
specific and branch immaterial tasks. Graduates of the WOAC receive the designation of MEL code “WOAC”.
   (4) Warrant Officer Staff Course. The WOSC is a resident course conducted at the Warrant Officer Career College.
This course focuses on the staff officer and leadership skills needed to serve in the grade of CW4 at battalion and
higher levels. The course which includes instruction in communication skills, staff skills and relationships, problem
solving and decision-making, educates and trains officers in the values and attitudes of the profession of arms and in
the conduct of military operations in peace and in war. The CW3s are eligible to attend the WOSC. The ADL warrant
officers will complete this course not later than 1 year after promotion to CW4. National Guard warrant officers will
complete this course prior to promotion to CW4. USAR warrant officers will complete this course prior to selection to
CW4. WOSC graduates are recognized by MEL code “WOSC”.
   (5) Warrant Officer Senior Staff Course. The WOSSC is the capstone for warrant officer PME. It is a branch
immaterial 2-week resident course conducted at the Warrant Officer Career College. The WOSSC provides a master-
level professional warrant officer with a broader Army level perspective required for assignment to CW5 level
positions as technical, functional and branch systems integrators and trainers at the highest organizational levels.
Instruction focuses on "How the Army Runs" and provides up-to-date information on Army level policy, programs, and
special items of interest. CW4s are eligible to attend the WOSSC. ADL warrant officers will complete this course no
later than 1 year after promotion to CW5. National Guard warrant officers must complete this course prior to
promotion to CW5. USAR warrant officers will complete this course prior to promotion to CW5. Graduates are
recognized by MEL code “WOSSC”.
4–8. Department of Defense and Department of State schools
Based on Army requirements, the Officer Personnel Management Directorate may designate officers to attend courses
at schools operated by the DOD, Department of State, and Foreign Service Institute.
                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              29

4–9. Foreign schools
Each year, based on quotas received by the U.S. Government, approximately 30 qualified officers are selected to attend
26 foreign schools in 15 different countries as students. AR 350–1 contains a list of the foreign schools that U.S.
officers attend. FAOs receive preference for most of these schools.
4–10. Language training
More than 50 language courses are offered to meet Army requirements for officer linguists. The majority of these
courses are longer than 20 weeks, requiring the officer to PCS to a Defense Language Institute in Monterey, CA, or
Washington, DC. Officers receive language training only if being assigned to a language-coded position. Officers
trained at Government expense test in that language every year and are expected to maintain their proficiency at a 2/2
level as measured by the Defense Language Proficiency Test.
4–11. Aviation training
All Aviation officers attend initial entry flight training in conjunction with their officer basic course (WOBC/BOLC).
Company grade officers may volunteer for initial entry flight training in rotary-wing aircraft under the provisions of
AR 611–110. Aviation qualification and transition training is based on worldwide Aviation requirements. Aviators
requiring additional skills normally receive training during a PCS move. All officers may volunteer for aircraft specific
or MOS-specific training. Course descriptions and prerequisites are in the ATRRS online catalog.
4–12. Command team training and education
The Pre-Command Course (PCC) is the CSA’s program. It prepares selectees for command by providing a common
understanding of current doctrine and by providing both new and refresher training in selected functions and duties.
Brigade and battalion command preparation is a multi phase program that provides focused leader development
opportunities for all of the Army’s future senior leaders. AA and AGR brigade and battalion-level command selectees
will attend a three or four-phase pre-command continuing education and training program, depending on type and level
of command prior to assuming command. Phase I is the branch-immaterial PCC at Fort Leavenworth, KS, followed by
two or more of the following PCC phases prior to assuming command. Phase II is training for specific command
categories (modified table of organization and equipment (MTOE) operational, initial military training, garrison,
recruiting, Acquisition Corps and Corps of Engineers division/district commands). Phase III is branch/functional
training. Phase IV is the senior officer’s legal orientation course, Charlottesville, VA. TPU commanders attend Phases I
and II on a space available basis. TPU commanders must attend Phase III if Phase I is not attended. Prerequisites for
the branch immaterial PCC and the Tactical Commanders Development Program are outlined in ATRRS at https://
www.atrrs.army.mil. Attendance at PCC is scheduled by HRC, the senior leader development office, or the ARNG, as
appropriate, unless otherwise stated. The PCC requirements are detailed in AR 350–1.
4–13. Other military schooling
Many military school courses provide the knowledge or skills necessary for a specific assignment. Officers may apply
for these courses or are scheduled by Officer Personnel Management Directorate, HRC for such courses to qualify for a
specific assignment. Complete information on such courses is contained in the ATRRS online catalog.
4–14. Application for military schools
Officers do not apply as students to centrally selected military schools. They receive automatic consideration for
centrally selected schools when they enter the appropriate zone of eligibility (except those officers who have completed
the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course). Officers may apply for training through their assignment
officers if they desire training en route to the next assignment or through their command channels if TDY-and-return to
the installation is appropriate. The Officer Personnel Management Directorate, HRC may automatically schedule such
training if necessary for the position.
4–15. Service obligation
   a. Attendance at military courses of instruction or civilian education programs at Government expense will incur a
service obligation. AR 350–100 governs all service obligations to include which courses of instruction result in an
ADSO, what the policies and procedures are for computing service obligations and how service obligations are
fulfilled. Policies in AR 350–100 take precedence over other Army publications if there is a conflict.
   b. An ADSO differs from a requirement to be assigned to an Army Educational Requirements System position. An
ADSO is a specific period of active duty that an officer serves before eligible for voluntary separation. Assignment to
an Army Educational Requirements System position may be required in addition to the ADSO for the Army to derive
the greatest benefit from Government sponsored civilian education. AR 621–108 specifies the types of education that
require assignment to an Army Educational Requirements System position.

4–16. Civilian education
   a. The Army Advanced Civilian Schooling program has two objectives: to meet Army requirements for advanced
education and to provide selected officers the opportunity to satisfy their educational aspirations.
   b. Company grade officers are required to obtain a baccalaureate degree from a qualifying educational institution
prior to attending the CCC.
   c. Officers should take advantage of opportunities for advanced education and should consider their civilian
education background when determining their qualifications for study in a given discipline. Officers who want to
pursue advanced degrees should do so in an academic discipline that supports their designated branch, FA or MOS. On
completion of schooling, officers are assigned by grade, branch, FA, MOS, civilian education level, and when possible,
academic discipline (or related discipline set) for initial utilization in an Army Educational Requirements System
validated position. In this manner, specific Army requirements are satisfied while simultaneously contributing to the
professional development of the officer corps and the satisfaction of an officer’s educational aspirations.
   d. The appropriate proponent determines academic disciplines that support each branch, FA or MOS. See branch and
FA-specific sections below.
4–17. Education programs
Officers may pursue full-time studies toward a master’s or doctoral degree through either fully funded or partially
funded programs or a bachelor’s degree through the Degree Completion Program. Officers are encouraged to pursue
advanced degrees particularly when there is an opportunity to do so in coordination with resident training such as ILE
and SSC. Officers with liberal arts undergraduate degrees should not be dissuaded from their pursuit of graduate
education in the sciences. Available education programs are discussed in general below. (AR 621–1 governs specific
civil school programs.)
   a. Fully-funded programs. Under these programs, the Army pays all tuition costs, provides officers with full pay and
allowances, and moves officers and their Families to the college or university of study. Normally, the period of
schooling does not exceed 18 months (24 months for participants in officer Career Satisfaction Program). Officers may
not draw veterans’ education benefits while participating in the Army fully funded program.
   (1) Advanced degree program. Selected officers attend graduate school to meet specific Army requirements estab-
lished by the Army Educational Requirements System. While completing graduate studies, officers are assigned to
Army Educational Requirements System positions according to branch or FA, grade and appropriate academic skills.
Following graduation, utilization assignments will be served in accordance with AR 621–108 for a minimum of 24
months, and will normally occur immediately following such education, but no later than the second assignment
following education completion. Primary zone of consideration to attend graduate school normally occurs on comple-
tion of the CCC, with sufficient basic branch or MOS experience, and 6 to 8 years of Federal commissioned service;
but no later than the 17th year of service.
   (2) Short course training. Tuition funds allocated to organizations are available for unprogrammed training that is
needed for current job performance when the training is less than 20 weeks and is in subjects for which the Army has
no in-house training capability.
   (3) Fully Funded Legal Education Program. TJAG’s Funded Legal Education Program provides instruction leading
to a law degree at an approved civilian school at Government expense (normally 3 academic years) for up to 25
selected company grade officers each FY. Upon completion, the officer accepts an appointment in the JAGC for the
period of the active duty obligation incurred under the provisions of AR 27–1 and AR 350–100. The Funded Legal
Education Program is the only approved program currently available for Army officers to study the legal profession.
Program participants perform on-the-job-training duties under the supervision of a staff judge advocate or legal officer
designated by TJAG when school is not in session for 5 days or longer. Program participants who do not finish school,
or fail to pass the bar exam after two attempts, return to service in their basic branch.
   (4) Training With Industry. This program provides training in industrial procedures and practices not available
through military service schools or civilian education. The Training With Industry provides officers with vital
knowledge, experience, and perspective in management and operational techniques to fill responsible positions in
ACOMs and activities that normally interface with civilian industry. It provides the trainee an opportunity to grapple
with real problems inherent to the business environment. Currently, these programs are concentrated in the areas of
transportation, procurement, logistics management, research, and development, Public Affairs, banking, communica-
tion-electronics, advertising and marketing, physical security, artificial intelligence, and automation systems. The
programs are normally 10 months with a predetermined follow-on assignment focusing on the experience gained. AR
621–1 provides information on application procedures.
   b. Partially funded programs. Under these programs, the officer bears the cost of all tuition, fees, and textbooks.
Many officers elect to use their in-service veterans benefits (if applicable) to help defray educational costs. The Army
provides officers with full pay and allowances and moves officers and their Families to the school location if the
schooling is 20 weeks or more. Participants attending schools for less than 20 weeks attend in a permissive TDY
status. After their branch notifies officers that they are accepted into the program, it is their responsibility to select and
be accepted by an accredited college or university.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                                  31

   (1) Degree Completion Program. Now that all officers are required to have a bachelor’s degree prior to commis-
sioning, the Degree Completion Program serves as a vehicle for officers pursuing a master’s degree or warrant officer
pursuing a bachelor’s degree to complete their education requirements. This program authorizes officers up to 18
months of full-time civilian education to complete undergraduate or graduate degree requirements. Company and field
grade officers pursuing an advanced degree must agree to study in an academic discipline that supports their branch or
FA (or, in some cases, a designated skill). The primary zone of consideration for the graduate level is the 5th through
the 17th year of service.
   (2) Cooperative degree programs. Selected students attending schools such as the Command and General Staff
College, the Logistics Executive Development Course at the Army Logistic Management College, and certain SSCs are
offered the opportunity to participate in various courses conducted by cooperating civilian institutions. Attendance at
these courses is concurrent with the military schooling. After graduation, officers are authorized up to 12 months to
complete graduate degree requirements as full-time resident students at the civilian institution. Those attending SSC
normally pursue studies during the summer school sessions immediately before and after the military course. In all
cooperative degree programs, officers pay for educational costs.
   c. Fellowships or scholarships. According to AR 621–7 eligible officers may apply for permission to accept
fellowships or scholarships offered by corporations, foundations, funds, or educational institutions. Participation in such
programs normally does not exceed 1 year in advanced civilian schooling and officers will incur an ADSO in
accordance with AR 350–100 of 3 days to every 1 day served in school. Officers are also required to serve for a
minimum of 24 months in a utilization tour. The following information is provided regarding fellowships. Program and
eligibility criteria are subject to change; refer to annual MILPER messages for the most current information.
   (1) Arroyo Center Fellowship (Research Fellowship). Participants work on critical Army policy issues (captain and
major) (RAND Arroyo Center, Santa Monica, CA).
   (2) Congressional Fellowship (Legislative Fellowship). Participants pursue a master’s degree in Legislative Affairs
then serve within a Congressperson’s office. Fellows are educated and trained in Congressional activities, emphasizing
those matters regarding DOD. Fellows are typically given responsibility for drafting legislation, arranging Congres-
sional hearings, writing speeches and floor statements, and briefing Members of Congress for committee deliberations
and floor debate (captain/major).
   (3) Regional Fellowships (lieutenant colonel level) (Research Fellowship). Applicants must have no more than 17
years Federal commissioned service. AR 621–7 governs these programs.
   (a) Asia-Pacific Center Fellowship. Participants conduct research with primary focus on exploring ways to cope
with the increasingly complex interrelationships of the military, economic, political, and diplomatic policies releveant
to security issues (Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, Honolulu, HI).
   (b) George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies. Participants conduct research or participate in other
activities related to supporting newly democratic nations transitioning into free market economies (G.C. Marshall
European Center for Security Studies, Garmisch, GE).
   (c) Department of State Strategic Policy Planning Fellowship. Participants conduct research, information gathering
and other liaison activities in order to ensure the Army’s position is understood and appropriately factored within DOD
policy development and decision-making. This program is designed to expand the officer’s executive-level skills
(Office of Plans, Policy, and Analysis, Bureau of Political and Military Affairs, Department of State, Washington, DC).
   (4) George and Carol Olmstead Scholarship. Participants and their Family members immerse themselves in a
foreign culture, while the officer attends the host country’s university pursuing a graduate degree in Liberal Arts. The
general purpose of the program is to broadly educate young, career military line officers who exhibit extraordinary
potential for becoming this country’s future military leaders (captain or junior major).
   (5) The General Wayne A. Downing Scholarship. Participants pursue a graduate degree focused on terrorism,
counterinsurgency, comparative politics, or a closely related discipline at a foreign or U.S. University. The purpose and
target population for this scholarship mirrors that of the George and Carol Olmstead Scholarship Program.
   (6) Strategic Education and Development Program. Participants pursue a master’s degree in Public Administration
at Harvard University. After successful completion of the program, officers are designated into the Army Strategic
Plans and Policy career field (FA 59) (captain or major).
   (7) Department of Defense Information Assurance Scholarship Program. Participants pursue a graduate degree in an
Information Assurance discipline. This program is designed to assist in recruiting and retaining highly qualified
personnel in the field of Information Assurance (captain/major/warrant officer/NCO) (Air Force Information Technol-
ogy (IT), National Defense University, Washington, DC and Partner University; Naval Postgraduate School).
   (8) The Joint Chief of Staff/Office of the Secretary of Defense/Army Staff Intern Program. This program provides
participants with a broader perspective of operations within the military and our government. Interns begin by pursuing
a master’s degree in Policy Management, followed by integration into the policy and operational activities of the
nation’s senior military staff (Joint Staff or Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)). Interns are ultimately placed
into positions within the Army Staff (captain/major).
   (9) Training With Industry. The Training With Industry Program was established to provide training and develop-
ment of skills in U.S. private sector procedures and practices not available through existing military or Advanced
32                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

Civilian Schooling Programs. Participants develop experience in higher-level managerial techniques and an understand-
ing of the relationship of their industry as it relates to specific functions of the Army.
   (10) White House Fellowship. Fellows are assigned to work with senior White House officials, cabinet secretaries,
or other deputies. Their duties include writing speeches, reviewing and drafting proposed legislation, answering
congressional inquiries, chairing meetings, conducting briefings, and otherwise assisting high-level Government offi-
cials (major, lieutenant colonel, NCO).
   (11) Cyber Command Scholarship. This is a 2 year, degree producing program open to RA captains and majors in
the Operations, Operations Support, and Force Sustainment Assignment Divisions. Selected officers will pursue a
master’s degree in Cyber Security at the University of Maryland (other universities will be added in the coming years),
and then will complete a mandatory 3-year utilization assignment. (By year group, majors cannot have more than 18
months time in grade).
4–18. Tuition assistance
Eligible officers pursuing off-duty undergraduate or graduate civilian education courses may apply for tuition assist-
ance under the provisions of AR 621–5. If approved, the Army pays up to 100 percent of tuition costs. Individual
officers pay all other amounts, such as fees for registration and matriculation and the cost of books and supplies.
Participants agree in writing to remain on active duty for a minimum of 2 years after completing the course or courses.
(See AR 621–5.)
4–19. Eligibility criteria and application procedures
   a. Since many elements of the programs discussed in this chapter differ, officers should consult the governing Army
regulations for the specific eligibility criteria and application procedures.
   b. Selection for full-time civil schooling is governed by the needs of the Army, the officer’s demonstrated
performance, and his or her academic background. Officers pursuing a graduate degree should choose a discipline that
fulfills the professional development requirements of the officer’s designated branch, FA or MOS. In addition,
applicants must have completed the CCC. Since selection for full-time schooling programs is based in part on the
availability of the officer, Officer Personnel Management Directorate retains schooling applications until the applicant
withdraws from further consideration or becomes ineligible by virtue of military performance or years of service.
Officers selected for Advanced Civilian Schooling should expect a utilization assignment immediately after graduation.
Officers who attend fully funded educational programs are normally subject to recoupment if, prior to completing their
required service obligation, they separate from the Army voluntarily or involuntarily.
Chapter 5
Officer Promotions
5–1. General
This chapter covers the active duty promotion system for officers through the grade of colonel. This system constitutes
a vital aspect of military personnel management affecting each officer and, therefore, must be legally correct and
logically sound. Further, it must be administered fairly and equitably; to do otherwise would jeopardize the effective-
ness of the officer corps.
5–2. Promotion process objectives
   a. Though the specific procedures for selecting officers for grade advancement have varied over time, the objectives
of this process have remained constant—
   b. Ensure advancement to the higher grades of the best-qualified officers.
   c. Meet Army branch, MOS, FA, and grade requirements.
   d. Provide career incentive.
   e. To promote officers based on the whole person concept and potential to serve in the next higher grade.
   f. Although not an objective, identifying and eliminating ineffective officers is another result of the promotion
process.
5–3. Statutory requisites
The objectives of the promotion system are consistent with statutory requisites and the realities of the Army structure
and authorizations.
   a. The legal basis for the officer promotion system is contained in 10 USC. This law prescribes strength and grade
authorizations, promotion list components, promotion procedures, and separation procedures resulting from non-
selection. The statutory requirements of 10 USC have been promulgated through regulatory, directive, and policy
means in the establishment and administration of the promotion system.
   b. DOPMA became effective 15 September 1981. The DOPMA was a major revision to 10 USC and is still the
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            33

basis for year group management of the company and field grade officer corps. In 1984, the DOPMA provisions of 10
USC were amended to overcome certain unintended consequences of the original act and to give the Service secretaries
more flexibility in limiting eligibility for promotion consideration. The current law:
   (1) Establishes statutory limitations on the number of officers who may serve in senior grades.
   (2) Provides common law for the appointment of AC officers and for the ADL service of RC officers.
   (3) Provides uniform promotion procedures for officers in the separate Services.
   (4) Provides common provisions governing career expectation in the various grades.
   (5) Establishes common mandatory separation and retirement points for regular commissioned officers.
   (6) Increases the amount of separation pay for officers separated involuntarily short of retirement.
   (7) Provides related authorities to manage the officer force under the revised personnel system.
   (8) Increases the flexibility of Presidential authority under mobilization in times of declared crisis.
   c. The WOMA was passed into law as part of FY 1992/1993 legislation and went into effect on 5 December 1991.
The WOMA revisions to 10 USC have become the basis for the management of the active duty warrant officer corps.
The current law established—
   (1) Single promotion system for warrant officers.
   (2) Tenure requirements based upon years of warrant officer service.
   (3) The grade of CW5.
   (4) Authorization for the Secretary of the Army, to convene boards to recommend retirement-eligible warrant
officers for selective mandatory retirement.
   d. Defense authorization legislation for FY 2007 highlighted the 10 USC requirement to accommodate a standard for
exemplary conduct as part of the officer promotions process. The DODI 1320.4 sets policy for how promotion
selection boards, special selection boards, and special review boards evaluate officers against the standard of exemplary
conduct and deal with adverse information on officer conduct.
5–4. Active duty list
   a. Background. The DOPMA and WOMA revised the laws providing for the establishment of separate RA
(permanent) and Army of the United States (temporary) lists and established a single, consolidated ADL. The DOPMA
and WOMA, as revised, provide for the following:
   (1) Establishment of an initial active duty list. No later than 6 months after 15 September 1981, all officers of the
Army serving under 10 USC 36 as amended by DOPMA (except for those identified in 10 USC 641) will be placed on
the ADL in the same relative seniority that they held on 14 September 1981. Pre-WOMA relative seniority was
determined according to seniority criteria outlined in AR 600–8–29, and was primarily based on the Army of the
United States date of rank a warrant officer held on 4 December 1991.
   (2) Adjustment to the active duty list. Adjustments to the ADL are made to maintain the relative seniority among
officers of the Army as it existed on the day before the effective date of the law. Under provisions of Title 10 USC
741, the Secretary of the Army did establish and/or adjust the ADL date of rank of any company/field grade officer
who was serving on active duty on 14 September 1981. Any RA or USAR officer, who on the effective date of
DOPMA (15 September 1981) was serving on active duty in a temporary (Army of the United States) grade that was
equal to their permanent (RA or USAR) grade, was awarded an ADL date of rank equal to that held in their Army of
the United States grade. WOMA provided for the establishment of an initial ADL that placed all warrant officers of the
Army serving under 10 USC, in the same relative seniority, which they held on 4 December 1991.
   b. Current law. As required by Title 10 USC, the Army maintains a single ADL on which officers are to be carried
in order of seniority. They are considered for promotion, each time a selection board is convened to consider officers in
an established date of rank zone of consideration for their competitive category. The provisions of 10 USC 741 and
742 relate to rank among officers of the same grade as follows:
   (1) Establishes relative rank of the various officer grades.
   (2) Provides that rank among officers of the same grade or equivalent grade is initially determined by date of rank.
An officer with an earlier date of rank is senior to an officer with a later date of rank.
   (3) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army have prescribed rules for breaking date of rank ties and
general rules for establishing dates of rank when breaks in service, service credit, and placement on the ADL
determinations must be made. The date of rank and rank/precedence criteria are published in AR 600–8–29.
   (4) To maintain the relative seniority among warrant officers of the Army as it existed on the day before the
effective date of the law, the Secretary of the Army established/adjusted the ADL on 4 December 1991. Any RA or
USAR warrant officer who, on the effective date of WOMA, was serving on active duty was awarded an ADL date of
rank equal to the highest grade, temporary (Army of the United States) or permanent (USAR or RA), he or she had
achieved.

5–5. Promotion process
   a. Title 10 USC provides for a single promotion process of all officers on active duty and on the ADL, regardless of
their component. Active duty reserve officers serving on the ADL are no longer considered by Reserve boards.
   b. The effect of the 10 USC/DOPMA/WOMA on the tenure and retirement opportunity for officers is shown in table
5–1.
   c. The WOMA mandated a single promotion process for all warrant officers on active duty and the ADL, regardless
of their component. The requirement for warrant officers to be recommended by two different selection boards
(temporary and permanent) for promotion to the next higher grade was eliminated. On 5 December 1991, warrant
officers serving on active duty assumed as their permanent grade the highest grade, temporary (Army of the United
States) or permanent (USAR or RA), they had held. Active duty Reserve officers serving on the ADL are no longer
considered by a Reserve board.

5–6. Army grade structure
   a. The distribution of grades at major and above is controlled by 10 USC and may be further constrained by
Congress, the Office of the Secretary of the Army or the CSA. Although 10 USC is subject to revision and
modification, the basic concept remains unchanged. In effect, the by grade number of field grade officers allowed
depends on total officer authorized strength levels, which are based on the total size of the Army and prescribed by the
Secretary of the Army.
   b. The distribution of grade CW5 is established and controlled by 10 USC and WOMA and may be further
constrained by Congress, the Office of the Secretary of the Army, or the Chief of Staff of the Army. Although 10 USC
and WOMA are subject to revision and modification, the basic concept remains unchanged. In effect, the number of
CW5 positions depends on the total warrant officer authorized strength level. Total warrant officer authorizations are
based on the size of the Army and the number prescribed by the Secretary of the Army.
5–7. Promotion flow
   a. Changes in authorizations, losses, and promotions to the next higher grade create fluctuations in both the time in
service and time in grade at which promotions occur. Under ideal circumstances, each qualified officer would advance
through the grade structure with some degree of predictability. However, a relatively standardized promotion flow does
not occur consistently due to expansion and contraction of the Army, changes in promotion policies and variations in
officer losses each year.
   b. Title 10 USC establishes minimum time in grade requirements for promotion to the next higher grade as shown in
table 5–2.
   c. The promotion timings, as stated in DODI 1320.13 are expressed in terms of the years of active Federal
commissioned service at which promotion occurs. The promotion opportunity (DOPMA rate), as stated in DODI 1320.
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                                      35

13, is the percentage of total selects over the eligible in the zone population. Promotion timing and opportunity
objectives are shown in table 5–2.
   d. Changes in authorizations, losses, and promotions to the next higher grade create fluctuations in the point within a
warrant officer’s career at which promotions occur. Under ideal circumstances, each qualified warrant officer should
advance through the grade structure with some degree of predictability. This relatively standardized promotion flow is
not consistently obtainable due to expansion and contraction of the Army, changes in promotion policies, and variations
in warrant officer losses each year.
   e. The WOMA establishes minimum time in grade requirements for promotion to the next higher grade. The warrant
officer promotion flow objective may be expressed in terms of years at which, WOS promotions occur. History has
consistently revealed that rapid promotions, in terms of reduced time in grade, have occurred during periods of force
expansion. Conversely, promotions have always slowed down when force reductions occur. The current warrant officer
promotion flow objectives are shown in table 5–2.

Notes:
Time in service is separated into years of WOS for Technician and Aviation warrants.
5–8. Below the zone promotions
The below the zone or secondary zone promotion capability is designed to allow the accelerated promotion of
outstanding officers who have demonstrated performance and indicated potential clearly superior to those who other
wise would be promoted. Below the zone promotions apply only to promotion to the ranks of CW3, CW4, CW5,
major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel. Officers will normally receive only one below the zone consideration per grade.
By law, the number of officers recommended for promotion from below the zone may not exceed 10 percent of the
total number recommended; except that the Secretary of Defense may authorize that percentage to be increased to no
more than 15 percent. Army policy sets the ACC below the zone promotion capability at 5.0 to 7.5 percent.
Note. AMEDD, Chaplain Corps, and JAGC are not part of the ACC.
5–9. Competitive categories
Each officer on the ADL is grouped in a competitive category for promotion as authorized in Title 10 USC and
prescribed in DODI 1320.12. Competitive categories are established to manage the career development and promotion
of certain groups of officers whose specialized education, training, or experience, and often relatively narrow utiliza-
tion, make separate career management desirable. Officers in the same competitive category (see para 8–1b) will
compete among themselves for promotion. There are six competitive categories for officers: the ACC includes all
branches and FAs other than the special branches; chaplains and judge advocates are in separate categories; and the
AMEDD has a category for the Medical Corps, a category for the Dental Corps, and a category for all other medical
department branches. There are two competitive categories for the warrant officer corps, Technical and Aviation
warrants.
5–10. Impact of the Officer Personnel Management System evolution
With the implementation of OPMS revisions, changes have occurred in company grade, field grade, and warrant officer
personnel management. These changes affect only ACC officers and warrant officers.
   a. Promotion plan. As part of OPMS, the Army defines primary and secondary zones of consideration for field
36                                                   DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

grade promotions by basic year groups. The in the zone population, or primary zone, is usually established by the dates
the first and last due course officer was promoted from a specific year group. A due course officer is one who has been
on continuous active duty since commissioning as a second lieutenant and who has neither failed selection for
promotion nor been selected for promotion from below the zone. This primary zone is accessed into the Army, and at
times shaped, to achieve a promotion opportunity (table 5–2) that is relatively similar over a period of the next 5 years.
This procedure has become known as the 5-year Field Grade Promotion Plan. OPMS revisions have not changed this
policy.
   b. Decentralized selections. The officer’s local commander approves promotion to first lieutenant and CW2. Nor-
mally, the battalion commander promotes with the recommendation of the company commander. Although the
promotion is thought of as being automatic upon completion of a specific period of active duty, the promotion is based
on an officer’s demonstrated performance. Officers who fail promotion to first lieutenant and CW2 are generally
released from active duty or discharged.
   c. Centralized selections. Officers promoted from captain through colonel and CW3 to CW5 are selected by HQDA
centralized boards. Selection boards are asked to recommend fully or best qualified (as appropriate) officers from an
inclusive zone of consideration. The zone of consideration includes officers from above, in and below the promotion
zone. When the number of officers being considered exceeds the maximum number to promote, the boards operate
under best-qualified criteria. Centralized boards, except captain, are provided minimum promotion requirements (floors)
by branch, FA, or AOC to ensure the Army’s skill and grade mix balances with its needs. Recommendations are based
upon branch, MOS, and FA competency, the potential to serve in the higher grade and the whole person concept.
Factors considered include:
   (1) Performance.
   (2) Embodiment of Army Values.
   (3) Professional attributes and ethics.
   (4) Integrity and character.
   (5) Assignment history and professional development.
   (6) Military bearing and physical fitness.
   (7) Attitude, dedication, and service.
   (8) Military and civilian education and training.
   (9) Concern for Soldiers and Families.
   d. Special branches. Promotion within special branches (AMEDD, Chaplain Corps, and JAGC). The officer promo-
tion system reinforces all other personnel management programs to acquire and retain the right number of officers, with
the proper skills, to meet the Army’s needs. The objective of promotion within the special branches is to maintain an
orderly promotion flow that replaces losses, meets changing requirements, and recognizes uneven attrition rates within
these competitive categories. Provisions of the system include mandated floors by branch, FA, or AOC and the optional
employment of selection ceilings. Selection opportunity may vary among competitive categories based upon projected
requirements in the higher grades.
   e. Instructions to promotion boards. Each board receives a memorandum of instruction from the Secretary of the
Army providing guidance for the selection process. Copies of these memorandums are released to the officer corps
following approval and public release of the board results. That portion pertaining to specialization has been expanded
significantly to indicate that, in today’s Army, the specialist has a significant role and responsibility. The instructions
highlight the need for the different officer professional development patterns required for accomplishing the Army’s
total mission. Instead of a single traditionally accepted career pattern through various grades, multiple paths for
advancement exist as the Army recognizes divergent Service needs and individual capabilities. Further, instructions to
promotion boards prescribe that promotion potential will be determined, for the most part, based on an officer’s record
of performance in their designated branch or FA and the officer’s overall performance.
   f. Promotion board membership. Personal qualifications, experience, and performance determine promotion board
membership. The ACOM, ASCC, and DRU commanders recommend board members (colonel and below) from lists
provided by the HQDA Secretariat for Selection Boards of eligible candidates who meet qualifications in a broad
spectrum of military fields. Following policy guidance from the Secretary of the Army, membership is designed to
adequately reflect the skills, commands, and diversity of the competitive category under consideration. The Director of
Military Personnel Management, DCS, G–1, approves the final slate of members on behalf of the Secretary of the
Army. The CSA, approves general officer membership.
   g. Special selection boards. Special selection boards (SSBs) are convened, as required, to consider officers with
dates of rank above or in the promotion zone that were erroneously omitted from consideration or whose official
records contained material errors seen by the original board. Erroneous entries or omissions on DA Form 4037
generally do not justify reconsideration by a SSB. The officer’s responsibility to review his or her DA Form 4037 at
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                               37

least annually and the provision of AR 600–8–29 entitling officers in the zone of consideration to submit a letter to the
president of the board are considered sufficient opportunity to overcome minor administrative deficiencies.
Chapter 6
Officer Evaluation System
6–1. Overview
   a. The Officer Evaluation System identifies those officers most qualified for advancement and assignment to
positions of increased responsibility. Under this system officers are evaluated on their performance and potential
through duty evaluations, school evaluations, and HQDA evaluations (both central selection boards and HRC officer
management assessments).
   b. The assessment of an officer’s potential is a subjective judgment of the officer’s capability to perform at a
specified level of responsibility, authority, or sensitivity. Potential is normally associated with the capability to perform
at a higher grade. However, the Army also assesses the officer’s potential for retention and increased responsibility
within a specified grade.
   c. Officer qualifications provide the real link between the needs of the Army and individual officer performance.
They focus on an officer’s background in terms of experience and expertise and include such items as specialty
qualification, successful performance in demanding positions, civil and military schooling, and physical profile.
Performance is the execution of tasks in support of the organization or Army missions. While results or accomplish-
ment of a series of tasks is the primary focus, the manner in which tasks are approached and a general adherence to
officer corps professional values are also important. The performance assessment by HQDA differs significantly from
that accomplished in the organizational duty environment. The organizational duty assessment involves personal
knowledge of the situations surrounding a specific performance for a specified period of time. The HQDA assessment
is accomplished by an after-the-fact assessment of a series of reports on performance over a variety of duty positions
and covering the officer’s entire career.
6–2. Officer evaluation reporting
   a. The officer evaluation reporting is a subsystem of the Officer Evaluation System. It includes the methods and
procedures for organizational evaluation and assessment of an officer’s performance and an estimation of potential for
future service based on the manner of that performance.
   b. The official documents of these assessments are the DA Forms 67–10 series and DA Form 1059.
   (1) The performance evaluation contained on the OER is for a specific rating period only. It focuses on comparing
the officer’s performance with the duty position requirements and the standards of the rating officials. Performance
includes the methods or means of effort used by an officer in accomplishing tasks assigned by superiors or implied by
the duty position. Performance assessments are then determined as a result of the rated officers efforts, degree of task
accomplishment, and the degree of compliance with competencies and attributes encompassed within the leadership
requirements model that apply to all officers, regardless of duty position, grade, or specialty.
   (2) The potential evaluation contained on the OER is a projection of the performance accomplished during the rating
period into future circumstances that encompass greater responsibilities. The primary focus of this assessment is the
capability of the officer to meet increasing levels of responsibility in relation to his or her peers.
   (3) DA Forms 1059 are prepared for officers who take part in resident and nonresident training at service schools
and civilian educational institutions. It explains the accomplishments, potential, and limitations of students while
attending courses. Furthermore, performance assessments are linked to the leadership requirements model in accord-
ance with ADP/ADRP 6–22.
   c. The OER system is directly linked to the OPMS. Raters and senior raters are required to recommend a potential
functional category Branch and/or FA for future service on all ACC captains in Parts Vc and VIId on each OER. These
rating chain recommendations, given by rating officials over a series of OERs, will provide pertinent information for
Functional Designation Boards and for the VTIP that provides for lateral movement between specialties.
6–3. Relationship with the Officer Personnel Management System, leader development, and character
development process
   a. The primary function of the OERS is to provide information from the organizational chain of command to be
used by HQDA for officer personnel decisions. The information contained in the OER is correlated with the Army’s
needs and individual officer qualifications. It provides the basis for OPMS personnel actions such as promotion, branch
and FA designation, elimination, retention in grade, retention on active duty, reduction in force, command and project
manager designation, school selection, assignment, and specialty designation.
   b. An equally important function of the OERS is to encourage the professional development of the officer corps. To
accomplish this, the system uses the Army’s leadership doctrine to relate teaching, coaching, counseling, and assessing
core leader competencies and attributes to improve performance and enhance professional development. Particularly
38                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

valuable is the developmental counseling fostered through senior officers linking the Army’s evaluation system to its
leader development and personnel management systems. Developmental counseling is the responsibility of senior
officers to provide feedback concerning professional growth, potential and career pathways to success. While these
aspects of developmental counseling through mentorship have always been a major element of the evaluation process,
they must be continually emphasized.
   c. For further information on the Officer Evaluation System, see AR 623–3 and DA Pam 623–3.
Chapter 7
Reserve Component Officer Development and Career Management
7–1. Purpose
   a. The RCs of the Army include the ARNG and the USAR. The OPMS for the RC is executed by HRC for
lieutenant colonels and below for (AGR, IMA, IRR) for the USAR. The Office of the Chief, Army Reserve (OCAR)
manages the Ready Reserve colonels for the USAR. The State AGs manage the officer population for the ARNG.
Some elements of OPMS are executed at local unit level due to the unique aspects of RC duty. The purpose of OPMS
as it is applied to the RC is the same as outlined in paragraph 3–1. This chapter discusses the unique aspects of OPMS
for the RC.
   b. The RCs of the Army include the ARNG and the USAR. When not in a federalized status (under Federal
control), the ARNG comes under control of the states, the territories of Guam and the Virgin Islands, the Common-
wealth of Puerto Rico or the District of Columbia. The USAR is a Federal force within the Department of the Army.
7–2. Factors affecting Officer Personnel Management in the National Guard
   a. OPMS within the ARNG is also influenced by factors described in paragraph 3–2. In addition OPMS for RC
officers is influenced by the different categories that National Guard officers serve in.
   b. The RC consists of three categories: the Ready Reserve, the Standby Reserve, and the Retired Reserve. All
Reserve and Guard officers are assigned to one of these three categories.
   c. The Ready Reserve is the largest category in the RC and contains the overwhelming majority of RC officers. The
Ready Reserve consists of the Selected Reserve, the IRR, and the inactive National Guard (ING).
   d. It is common for RC officer pool to consist of a mix of officers who have served in various capacities throughout
the force to include other Army components as well as varied lengths of service in a variety of duty status’ and
capacities. Efforts are ongoing to apply consistent standards, ease of transition, and recognition of the assignment
broadening capabilities associated with the officers who balance a civilian career with their military service.
   (1) The Selected Reserve consists of the following:
   (a) Units manned and equipped to serve and/or train either as operational or as augmentation units. These units
consist of:
   1. Troop program unit reservists. These are officers who are required to perform (drill) 48 unit training assemblies
(UTAs) per year and 14 days (15 days for ARNG) per year in annual training status. These members are in a paid
status while performing these duties.
   2. Active Guard Reserve. In accordance with 10 USC 101(16), the term “Active Guard and Reserve” means a
member of a RC who is on active duty pursuant to 10 USC 12310 or 32 USC 502(f) and 709(a). These officers are
Guard or Reserve members who are ordered to active duty or full-time National Guard duty for the purpose of
organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the RC units. The AGR status is defined as officers
serving in an active duty status for at least 180 days, performing administrative and training duties in direct support of
the ARNG and USAR. The primary objective of the AGR Program is to improve the readiness of the RC.
   3. Army Reserve individual mobilization augmentee. These officers are trained individuals assigned to an AC,
Selective Service System, or Federal Emergency Management Agency organization in billets that must be filled on, or
shortly after mobilization. Officers assigned to this control group perform at least 12 days of annual training each year
and are assigned to a specific duty position in an AA unit or organization.
   (b) Training Pipeline (Non-deployable Account). These are officers who have not yet completed initial active duty
for training, and include all officers who are in training for professional categories including: undergraduate flying
training, chaplain candidates, health profession students, early commissioning program participants, and cadets enrolled
in the Simultaneous Membership Program.
   (2) The Individual Ready Reserve. These officers are Reserve officers not serving in the Selected Reserve. The IRR
is a manpower pool comprised of trained individuals who typically have some period of their military service
obligation or contractual commitment remaining. A remaining service obligation or contractual commitment is not
however a requirement to be member of the IRR. The IRR is vital to the expansibility and reversibility of the active
officer force pool and is critical to augmenting the RC manpower requirements. It provides officers the opportunity to
continue serving in a more limited capacity to facilitate their pursuit of a civilian career track or other personal life
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              39

obligations then transition to a TPU without losing accrued rank. Members may voluntarily participate in training for
retirement points and promotions with or without pay. The IRR members may be required to meet the same training
requirements as Selected Reservists. Required training (involuntary) may not exceed 30 days a year. Members of the
IRR will be geographically affiliated with a RC unit in order to provide IRR Soldiers and their Families with a local
network of support, improve IRR Soldier readiness, promote Continuum of Service and retain Soldiers with valuable
skills, knowledge, abilities and experiences. The intent for the IRR Affiliation Program is communication versus
participation to ensure members of the IRR and their Families are aware of dedicated support and available resources.
IRR officers serve in one of three control groups—
   (a) Control Group–Annual Training. Ready Reserve officers with a training obligation, but who do not belong to an
Army Reserve unit. They must perform annual training when so directed.
   (b) Control Group–Reinforcement. All other non-unit Ready Reserve officers not assigned to another control group.
   (c) Control Group–Officer Active Duty Obligor. Active duty officers who are appointed in the USAR but do not
enter onto active duty at the time of their appointment. These officers maintain their obligated status and may be
ordered to active duty or duty with an ARNG or USAR unit.
   (3) Army Reserve National Guard Inactive National Guard personnel. The ING consists of National Guard person-
nel in an inactive status in the Ready Reserve, not in the Selected Reserve, attached to a specific National Guard unit.
To remain ING members, they muster once a year with their assigned unit, but do not participate in training activities.
ING Soldiers are considered mobilization assets of the unit. Similar to other IRR, some ING members have legal and
contractual obligations. ING members may not participate in training activities for points or pay and are not eligible for
promotion.
   (4) Retired Reserve. The Retired Reserve is comprised of all Reserve officers who receive retired pay on the basis
of active duty and/or Reserve service; all Reserve officers who are otherwise eligible for retired pay but have not
reached age 60 and who have not elected discharge and are not voluntary members of the Ready or Standby Reserve;
and other retired reservists. All retired members who have completed at least 20 years active duty (Regular or
Reserve), regardless of the retired list to which assigned, may be ordered to active duty involuntarily whenever
required as determined by the Secretary of the Army.
7–3. Factors affecting Officer Personnel Management in the Army Reserve
   a. OPMS within the USAR is also influenced by factors described in paragraph 3–2. In addition OPMS for RC
officers is influenced by the different categories in which USAR officers serve.
   b. The USAR consists of three categories: the Ready Reserve, the Standby Reserve, and the Retired Reserve. All
Reserve officers are assigned to one of these three categories.
   c. It is common for RC officer pool to consist of a mix of officers who have served in various capacities throughout
the force to include other Army components as well as varied lengths of service in a variety of duty status’ and
capacities. Efforts are ongoing to apply consistent standards, ease of transition, and recognition of the assignment
broadening capabilities associated with the officers who balance a civilian career with their military service
   d. The Ready Reserve is the largest category in the RC and contains the overwhelming majority of USAR officers.
The Ready Reserve consists of the Selected Reserve and the IRR.
   (1) The Selected Reserve consists of the following:
   (a) Units manned and equipped to serve and/or train either as operational or as augmentation units. These units
consist of:
   1. Troop program unit reservists. These officers are required to perform 48 battle assemblies (UTAs) and 14 days of
annual training per year. These members are in a paid status while performing these duties.
   2. Active Guard Reserve. In accordance with 10 USC 101(16), the term “Active Guard and Reserve” means a
member of a RC who is on active duty pursuant to 10 USC 12310. These Army Reserve officers are ordered to active
duty for the purpose of organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the RC units. The AGR status is
defined as officers serving in an active duty status and have been accessed into the AGR program performing
administrative and training duties in direct support of the USAR. The primary objective of the AGR program is to
improve the readiness of the Army Reserve.
   3. Individual mobilization augmentee. These officers are trained individuals assigned to an AC, Selective Service
System, or Federal Emergency Management Agency organization in billets that must be filled on, or shortly after
mobilization. Officers assigned to this control group perform at least 12 days of annual training each year and are
assigned to a specific duty position in an AC unit or agency.
   (b) Training pipeline (non-deployable account). These are officers who have not yet completed initial active duty for
training, and include all officers who are in training for professional categories including: undergraduate flying training,
chaplain candidates, health profession students, early commissioning program participants, and cadets enrolled in the
Simultaneous Membership Program.
   (2) The IRR are Reserve officers not serving in the Selected Reserve. The IRR is a manpower pool comprised of
trained individuals who may have some period of their military service obligation or contractual commitment remain-
ing or the officer desires to continue to serve in the Ready Reserve without being a member of a unit. Members may
40                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

voluntarily participate in training for retirement points and promotions with or without pay. IRR members may be
required to meet the same training requirements as Selected Reservists. Required training (involuntary) may not exceed
30 days a year. The IRR is vital to the expansibility and reversibility of the active officer force pool. It provides
officers the opportunity to continue serving in a more limited capacity to facilitate pursuit of a civilian career track or
other personal life obligations. Members of the IRR will be affiliated with an Army Reserve unit for the purpose of
maintaining communication and a channel of support resources for Soldiers who transitioned off of active duty The
IRR officers serve in one of three control groups—
   (a) Control Group–Annual Training. Ready Reserve officers with a training obligation, but who do not belong to an
Army Reserve unit. They must perform annual training when so directed.
   (b) Control Group–Reinforcement. All other non-unit Ready Reserve officers not assigned to another control group.
   (c) Control Group–Officer Active Duty Obligor. Active duty officers who are appointed in the Army Reserve but do
not enter onto active duty at the time of their appointment. These officers maintain their obligated status and may be
ordered to active duty or to serve with an USAR unit.
   (3) The Standby Reserve is a pool of trained individuals manpower needs in specific skills. The Standby Reserve is
managed in accordance to DODI 1235.09. These officers maintain their military affiliation without being in the Ready
Reserve. They may be designated as key civilian employees, or have a temporary hardship or disability. These
individuals are not eligible for mobilization.
   (a) Active status list. Standby Reservists temporarily assigned for hardship or other cogent reasons. Officers in this
status may attend battle assemblies and perform annual training. Officers in this status are considered during mandatory
promotion boards.
   (b) Inactive status list. Standby Reservist are not required by law or regulation to remain in an active status to retain
their Reserve affiliation in a nonparticipating status, and those who have skills which may be of possible future use to
the Armed Forces. Standby Reservist include members transferred to an inactive status in lieu of separation. Officers in
this status are prohibited from attending battle assemblies and performing annual training. Time served in this status is
considered a break in service.
   (4) The Retired Reserve is comprised of all Reserve officers who receive retired pay on the basis of active duty and/
or Reserve service; all Army Reserve officers who are otherwise eligible for retired pay but have not reached age 60
and who have not elected discharge and are not voluntary members of the Ready or Standby Reserve; and other retired
reservists. All retired members who have completed at least 20 years active duty (RA or USAR), regardless of the
retired list to which assigned, may be ordered to active duty involuntarily whenever required as determined by the
Secretary of the Army.

7–4. Officer Personnel Management System
   a. The flexibility of the OPMS enables USAR and ARNG unique policies, where necessary, to facilitate officer
management and development for RC officers. The OPMS subsystems of: Strength Management, Assignments,
Professional Development, Evaluation, Centralized Selection, and Review Process, described in paragraph 3–3 apply to
both the AA and RC. Examples of RC-unique policies within these subsystems are:
   (1) Assignments. Assignments for USAR TPU, IMA, and ARNG M–Day officers may be constrained by geography
and structure. Assignment policies for the RC take into account these constraints and enable officers not serving full
time to continue to develop while allowing those officers to establish and maintain civilian occupations. Assignment
policies for AGR personnel have constraints, however USAR AGR assignments are not limited by geography, and
ARNG AGR assignments are limited only by State boundaries.
   (2) Centralized selection. The implementation of the Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act in 1996 brought
the RC company and field grade officer promotion systems in synchronization with the AC. It established a best-
qualified promotion system for RC officers, replacing the fully qualified system previously used. There is a centralized
selection process for officers in the USAR and ARNG. However, there are also policies and procedures to conduct
decentralized unit vacancy promotions to fill critical positions, and both the USAR and the ARNG have policies and
processes within OPMS for a decentralized selection process where required to account for geographic constraints.
Within the ARNG, States conduct selection for brigade and battalion-level commands. Within the USAR, regions
conduct selection for battalion-level commands under the new consolidated command selection boards AGR officers
and TPU officers are considered under the best-qualified principle.
   (3) Professional development. While RC officers share the same mission as their AA counterparts, the unique nature
of the RC officer’s role as a “citizen Soldier” poses a challenge for professional development. RC officers are expected
to follow AA officer development patterns as closely as possible, except that RC officers, in some instances, have
increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. To meet professional development objectives, RC
officers may need to rotate among TPU, the IRR, and the IMA programs. These transfers are necessitated by
geographical considerations, as well as the need to provide as many officers as possible the opportunity to serve with
troops in leadership and staff positions. Additionally, there may be occasions when officers need to transfer to the IRR
while they complete mandatory educational requirements. Such transfers will be temporary and should not be seen as
impacting negatively on the officer’s career. The success of an officer is not measured by length of service in any one
component or control group, but by the officers breadth of experience, duty performance and adherence to branch and
functional requirements.
   b. The OPMS model described in paragraph 3–3b applies to the AA and RC. The OPMS model provides the
flexibility to allow officers to grow in their basic branch or FA, and gain and breadth of experience. Managing officers
within the functional aligned design will provide opportunities for officers to be well-grounded in their branch and FA,
provide opportunities to gain additional competencies to create multiple-skilled leaders, and still provide the flexibility
necessary to compensate for the challenges of civilian employment, geography, and structure.
7–5. Officer development
   a. RC officers are accessed into the RC at company grade and field grade level. Initial accession is into the Army’s
basic branches; and officers should seek educational and developmental assignment opportunities outlined by their
proponent to gain depth in their chosen branch. Officers previously commissioned by another component are accessed
in either their current branch/FA or will undergo a branch/FA transfer.
   b. RC officers do not have a centralized functional category designation, but choose to transition to a FA and
functional categories at critical points of their career. Officers who choose to designate in a FA will complete PME or
other qualification training necessary. Once a RC officer commits to a FA designation, normally at the senior company
grade/junior field grade level, officers should seek assignment to positions requiring expertise in the particular specialty
associated with the officer’s functional category branch or FA skills. Senior RC officers well-grounded in their branch/
FA should increase their breadth by seeking assignments outside their basic branch/FAs, in broadening and develop-
mental positions that require leadership and managerial skills common to all officers. Add assignments to the
Operational and Generating Force.
   c. The objectives of OPMS in the RC are achieved through interaction between the individual, proponent, career
managers, and the field commander. The level of control and the nature of that interaction differ based on the
component and status of the officer. Each plays a vital role in the officer’s development. As a general rule human
resources (HR) organizations at the Army and State level play a greater role in AGR officer’s assignment development.
Individuals and commanders are more influential in the development of TPU and M–Day officers.
   (1) Development in a designated specialty. Although RC officers serve in the same branches and FAs as the AA,
RC officers may be limited to certain branches and FAs based on their geographic location and the military structure.
   (2) Progressive operational assignments. Progressive operational assignments serve to give officers depth in their
chosen branch or FA. RC officers should aggressively seek operational assignments of increasing responsibility and
complexity. The assignment and transfer of officers is a collective effort between the assignment officer, the officer
and his or her unit. The applicable TOE or TDA prescribes the grade, branch, and MOS requirements for positions to
which officers may be assigned. In the RC environment, assignment options are constrained by the force structure and
42                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

demographic and geographic limitations. For these reasons, RC officers may need to accept assignments throughout the
Selected Reserve. RC officers must also realize the possibility of occasional temporary transfers to the IRR, especially
in conjunction with the completion of PME requirements. These transfers provide the officer an opportunity to
complete required studies without the distraction of a troop assignment and allow other officers the opportunity to gain
troop leadership experience. The concepts of equivalent assignment and constructive credit should be considered when
determining RC operational assignments. There are numerous leadership positions within the RC structure that do not
fall into the traditional definition of TOE/TDA command. TOE leadership and command positions should be recog-
nized, and desired as potential assignments, however there are also TDA staff positions in Regional and State
commands that require quality leaders and provide similar operational experience as battalion and brigade staff
positions. Careful planning and programming by agencies, commanders and the individual officer are essential to
maximize the career potential and efficient use of officer skills, knowledge, and attributes. Experience gained through
challenging and varied assignments enhances officer development and provides trained officers able to meet the
dynamic needs of the RCs.
   (3) Professional development counseling and mentoring. Counseling and mentoring is a critical component of RC
officer development and is conducted by commanders at all levels as well as by assignment officers at HRC or the
State. However, the development of each officer will vary due to the assignment opportunities available to the officer
given his geographic location and civilian occupation. These realities of RC service make mentors especially critical
for RC officer professional development.
   (4) Designation and election of branches, functional areas, and functional categories.
   (a) Branch designation. Upon commissioning, lieutenants are designated in a basic branch for training and initial
assignment. Officers attend the company grade level education at the school of the branch to which they are detailed.
During the early years of service, professional development within the branch follows the proponent’s life-cycle model.
Generally, the first 8 to 12 years of service are devoted to branch developmental assignments and training that prepares
the company grade officer for further advancement. Company grade officers may request, in writing, a voluntary
branch transfer in accordance with AR 140–10.
   (b) Functional designation. The Army promotion list groups interrelated branches and FAs into officer management
categories called functional categories and functional groups. The RC officers may choose, based on operational or
civilian experience, structure limitations, or personal preference to specialize in a FA. AR 140–10 outlines how RC
officers are designated in a FA. Officers who choose to designate in a FA are encouraged to continue to choose
assignments that continue to build depth in their chosen specialty. Education, training and experience; and evaluation
reports are taken into account in determining an officer’s suitability to serve in a FA and additional training required to
be qualified in the chosen FA.
   1. Many RC officers are leaders in industry, the community and in the corporate world. Many positions in
corporations provide training and experience not only useful to the military but closely related to military specialty
skills. Officers at all levels should be sensitive to the relationship between civilian occupations and training and
military skills. Being the financial officer for a corporation certainly provides evidence of qualification as a military
finance officer. Leadership in a civilian occupation provides evidence of potential for military leadership positions.
These are examples of constructive credit possibilities that should be considered in determining an officer’s qualifica-
tion for branch and FA designation, and award of AOCs and skills. AR 611–1 provides guidance for evaluating civilian
education and occupation experience in the classification of RC officers. Officers may also apply for constructive or
equivalent credit for military education courses in accordance with AR 135–155.
   2. The ARNG Officer Personnel Classification Boards can determine an officer to be qualified in his or her duty
position, however, the officer may not be considered fully qualified until meeting other related criteria in this pamphlet
(for example 12 months service in a FA assignment or 36 months as a commander). The officer does not have to be
considered fully qualified in his or her branch (BR) AOC or FA AOC to be considered for favorable personnel actions.
Additional requirements beyond the mandatory military education for award of the AOC will not preclude the officer
from being promoted or reassigned.
   (c) Joint duty assignment Reserve. Officers in the RC serve in Joint Headquarters, Joint State Task Force Headquar-
ters, and in other assignments that interact with other services and agencies. The definitions and management processes
for Joint accreditation for RC officers were established 1 October 2007 as part of the John Wagner National Defense
Authorization Act 2007. Experience-based Joint duty assignments are assignments and experiences that demonstrate an
officer’s mastery of knowledge, skills, and abilities in joint matters. Experience-Joint duty assignments include non-
Joint duty assignment list RC in OSD, the Joint Staff, Combatant Command headquarters, and Defense Agencies
headquarters. This includes joint credit for Desert Shield/Desert Storm and for service in designated Joint Task Forces.
All officers are eligible to have their non-Joint duty assignment list billet experiences reviewed for possible award of
joint experience points. These points, along with completion of the requisite JPME would make them eligible for joint
qualifications. RC officers have opportunities to gain JPME I and II credit, and will gain JPME credit along with their
AA counterparts at ILE (JPME I) and at the Joint Forces Staff College, or in a SSC (JPME II). RC officers also serve
in numerous positions that involve assignments/experiences in the JIIM arena.
   d. The RC has positions that are independent of branch or FA coding and are designated as branch/FA generalist,
immaterial positions. RC company and field grade officers can expect to serve in these assignments at various times
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              43

during their careers, regardless of their functional designation. Officers are selected for these positions based on overall
manner of performance, previous experience, military and civilian education and estimated potential for further service.
   e. Both branches and FAs may require more specific job skills and qualifications to further prepare their officers to
meet highly specialized AOC position requirements. AOCs are described in the branch/FA chapters of this pamphlet.
   f. Branch/FA development fosters a mastery of skills for an officer’s grade in a specific branch or FA. Branch
development enables captains to achieve mastery of common core and branch skills that assure a strong professional
development foundation essential for success as a field grade officer. Generally speaking, branch development for RC
captains equates to completion of the appropriate CCC and successful performance in a KD assignment. Branch
development for majors results from completion of ILE and successful performance in a branch or FA assignment.
During an RC officer’s field grade years, OPMS allows for the broadening of an officer’s development from mastery
of branch skills to more multifunctional skills. RC officers have the opportunity and are encouraged to expand their
knowledge and skills beyond their specific branch through multiple avenues. These opportunities for Army Reserve
officers include, but are not limited to, assignments in the OCAR/U.S. Army Reserve Command (USARC) staff, DA
staff, and JIIM assignments for AGR officers and use of the IMA program for TPU officers.
   g. Under the current OPMS, RC Army promotion list majors and lieutenant colonels compete for promotion without
regard to their branch or FA. Selection for promotion is based on the fundamentals of performance and potential for
further service. These are measured by the officer’s relative standing with his peers as indicated by their evaluation
reports, educational qualification, and assignment history. The selection boards are instructed as to the number of field
grade officers to select based on Army needs, law, policy, and budget. As with the AA promotion boards, the boards
receive guidance on the officer qualities expected for in the Secretary of the Army’s Memorandum of Instruction.
Congress and the Secretary of the Army approve promotion selection lists prior to publication. In addition to selection
for promotion via a DA-centralized selection board or a unit vacancy promotion process, RC officers have differing
rules for promotion dependent on their status. TPU officers must be assigned in a position of higher grade in order to
be promoted. IRR officers, if on a standing promotion list, will be promoted at maximum time in grade or when they
report into a TPU position of the next higher grade, whichever is earlier. AGR officers compete for promotion
separately from the rest of the RC and are promoted by sequence number.

Notes:
Officers attain JPME I qualification by completing the full ILE curriculum. Completing only the ILE Common Core will preclude serving in Joint assignments
and attending JPME II/AJPME institutions, including SSCs.
7–6. Company grade development
The goals of OPMS for the RC are the same as those for the active duty. Laws and regulations specific to the ARNG
and USAR affect OPMS implementation. OPMS in the ARNG is executed by the state, within the guidance and
policies established by HQDA and NGB. OPMS for USAR is executed by the HRC (AGR, IMA, IRR) (HRC), and the
USARC (TPU). Specific guidance for USAR officers is addressed in AR 135–175. DA Memo 600–4 offers a wealth of
information on reserve officer selections.
   a. Branch-specific development. BOLC I is the commissioning source (Officer Candidate School (OCS), ROTC,
Direct Appointment). Upon commissioning, all RC officers begin their professional development by attending BOLC
II, followed by BOLC III.
   (1) Basic education. BOLC marks the beginning of a company grade officer’s formal military professional develop-
ment training following commissioning. BOLC II and III prepare officers for their first duty assignment and provide
44                                                      DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

instruction on methods for training and leading individuals, teams, squads, and platoons. Additionally, the course
provides officers with a detailed understanding of equipment, tactics, organization, and administration at the company,
battery or troop level. All phases of BOLC must be completed within 2 years of commissioning for an officer to be
eligible for promotion, a mobilization asset, and remain in the USAR and ARNG. For additional information on BOLC
II and III refer to paragraphs 4–7a through c.
   (2) Initial assignments. USAR TPU and ARNG officers are normally assigned to a predetermined unit of assign-
ment upon accession into the USAR. Included in these assignments are CONUS or overseas troop units where officers
begin to develop their leadership skills. All junior officers should seek leadership positions in troop units whenever
possible. Troop leadership is the best means to build a solid foundation for future service.
   (3) Eligible for promotion. To be eligible for promotion to captain, RC officers must complete both their baccalaure-
ate degree and phases II and III of BOLC.
   (4) Captains Officer Education System. The Army’s current formal education process for captains is the CCC which
officers attend either in resident or nonresident status. The RC officers should attempt to attend and complete their
branch CCC before or immediately following their promotion to the grade of captain. The course combines the
instruction formerly taught in the branch Officer Advanced Course and the Combined Arms and Services Staff School.
If an officer’s CCC does not include the Combined Arms Exercise (formerly CAS3), then the officer must also attend
Combined Arms Exercise to be eligible for further education opportunities. Selected captains deemed to have demon-
strated superior performance in their basic branch may be selected to receive this training at schools other than their
basic branch. Officers seeking accession into SF will normally attend the Maneuver CCC. For additional information
about the Captains Officer Education System, refer to paragraph 4–7d.
   (5) Branch opportunities. All company grade officers should focus their efforts during the company grade years on
mastering the basic skills of their specific branch. Much of the value an RC officer brings to future assignments is
dependent on experience gained by leading Soldiers and mastering basic branch skills. Officers who have demonstrated
the potential and desire to command Soldiers should seek command positions. The number of company commands
within a specific branch, or a specific area may not afford all officers the opportunity to command at the captain level.
Command opportunities for captains are found in traditional TOE line units or TDA units in training, garrison, and
headquarters organizations.
   b. Post-initial branch development. After a company grade officer has been afforded a branch development opportu-
nity, a number of options for continued professional development are available. At this time, the officer, commanders,
and assignment officers assess the individual’s developmental objectives for the post-branch development phase. The
types of assignments and developmental patterns for this phase are as follows:
   (1) Branch assignments. The range of further assignments to branch-coded positions is a function of the Army’s
structure, unit fill, and officer’s flexibility. These assignments may include staff and faculty positions at training
schools, duty with Regional or State Headquarters, or staff positions in tactical or training units. Branch assignments
further develop the basic branch skills and employ the officer’s accumulated skills, knowledge, and attributes.
   (2) Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Some company grade officers may serve in positions coded 01A
(Officer Generalist) or 02A (Combat Arms Generalist). For career progression, officers seeking combat arms generalist
positions should refer to the National Guard. These branch/FA generalist positions do not require an officer from a
specific branch or FA but may be performed by an officer with certain experiences, manner of performance and
demonstrated potential.
   (3) Functional area designation. Officers who choose to designate into FAs should expect training and education
opportunities to focus on their areas of specialization and include progressive and repetitive assignments of increasing
responsibility. Each of the FA chapters in this pamphlet outlines developmental positions.
   (4) Advanced degrees. Officers should seek opportunities to obtain graduate-level degrees in designated disciplines.
Advanced degree programs for RC officers are currently limited; however officers should try to further their education
through tuition assistance, and State and local programs.
   (5) Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational training opportunities. This emerging program intends
to provide short-term (90 to 180 days) training for officers providing them the skills necessary to lead the Army of the
future.
   (6) Training With Industry. Some branches and FAs participate in Training With Industry, where officers are
assigned to a civilian industry to observe and learn the technical and managerial aspects of that field. The total number
of training quotas varies annually from 50 to 70 based on budget, policy, and requirements. Officers selected for this
program must be proficient in their branch, have a manner of performance that reflects a strong potential for future
service and be able to serve a utilization tour upon completion of training. The Training With Industry program is
outlined in AR 621–1 and in the specific branch and FA chapters later in this pamphlet.
   (7) Army Acquisition Corps. HRC hosts an Acquisition Accession Board annually to select branch-qualified captains
for FA 51. The Army Acquisition Corps officers may receive a fully funded master’s degree (if not already at civilian
education level 2), attend the Materiel Acquisition Management Course and other FA related training, and serve
repetitive assignments in their acquisition specialties to prepare them for critical acquisition positions at field grade
level. The Army Acquisition Corps, created in early 1990, is described in detail in chapter 48 of this pamphlet.

   (8) Selection for promotion to major. Below the zone opportunities are currently being considered for USAR
officers. Below the zone opportunities occur approximately a year earlier than officers are currently considered for the
DA Board.
7–7. Major development mandatory intermediate level education enrollment
   a. This phase begins with selection for promotion to major. The junior field grade years serve to develop the officer
cohort in a variety of branch or FA assignments within their functional category.
   b. The general development goals are to complete MEL ILE, and successfully complete other branch, FA or
broadening assignments prior to consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel. The ILE will provide a quality
education for all field grade officers and prepare them for their next 10 years of service. See paragraph 4–7e for further
discussion of ILE.
   c. The minimum time in grade for majors is 4 years and the maximum time in grade is 7 years.
   d. Resident ILE selections are made via DA-centralized selection board and USAR TPU graduates are assigned to
organizations based on guidance from the Chief, Army Reserve (CAR). Assignments for USAR AGR resident ILE
graduates will be made by HRC to fill operational assignments.
   e. School of AMSP. TPU officers who are selected to the SAMS Course will agree to a 2 year utilization tour upon
completion of the course. Their assignment will be based upon guidance from the CAR. AGR graduates will be
assigned by the officer’s assignment officer with input from the HRC SAMS manager.
7–8. Lieutenant colonel development—mandatory Advanced Operations Course attendance and
completion
   a. This phase generally occurs when an officer has at least 3 years time in grade. Officers in the grade of lieutenant
colonel serve as senior leaders and managers throughout the Army providing wisdom, experience, vision, and
mentorship mastered over many years.
   b. The professional development goals for a lieutenant colonel are to broaden their branch, FA and skill proficiency
at the senior levels through assignments and schooling. Most of these officers will serve in high visibility billets in
their branch, FA or JIIM positions, and a possible assignment to a cross-branch/FA developmental position.
   (1) Branch assignments. RC lieutenant colonels can expect branch-coded assignments to both TDA and TOE
positions. These billets can range from positions within a battalion through echelons above corps. Branch proponents
have outlined developmental standards in their respective chapters of this pamphlet.
   (2) Functional area assignments. The OPMS design allows officers to serve in repetitive assignments within a FA to
gain a high degree of expertise. FA proponents have outlined developmental standards in their respective chapters of
this pamphlet.
   (3) Joint duty assignments. The RC does not have a formal Joint Credentialing program, and there are limited
assignments available in the RC to gain exposure and experience in joint operations. RC officers may apply for joint
duty credit for qualifying assignments as specified for AC officers.
   (4) Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Some officers will serve outside their branch or FA in billets
coded as branch/FA generalist. Such assignments are found throughout the Army in troop and staff organizations from
the installation to Department of the Army level.
   (5) Semi-centralized selection. A semi-centralized board is held by each Regional Readiness Command (RRC)/
Regional Support Command (RSC) which selects a limited number of officers for command and key billets. The
Lieutenant Colonel Command Assignment Selection Board contains both TOE and TDA positions. The command
board meets at least annually (usually semi-annually) to select commanders from the eligible officers. Command
opportunity varies based on force structure and the command categories for which an officer competes. On average,
lieutenant colonels serve in their command tours during their 18th through 20th years of service
   (6) Senior Service College. The Army War College does not accept individual applications into its SSC programs
except through special exceptions. A DA-centralized board is held on behalf of the CAR to identify officers to attend
SSC. USAR officers are selected according to AR 350–1. Commissioned officers from all components should
remember that according to the provisions of AR 350–100, attendance at the Army War College incurs a 2-year service
obligation. U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course allows you to participate in a 2-year, rigorous program
of instruction that results in the award of the same graduation certificate and the same fully accredited master of
science degree awarded to graduates of the resident program. You will need to devote 15 hours each week to a
program that is delivered to you via the Internet, one that leverages technology to enhance the educational experience.
Only the resident SSC courses and nonresident Army War College course award MEL SSC and JPME II upon
completion. SSC graduates are assigned to organizations based on guidance from the CAR, and Director of ARNG.
Tours following graduation are to the Army Staff, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary of Defense, ACOM, and
combatant command staffs in branch, FA, branch/FA generalist or joint positions.
   c. Below the zone selection is possible, and officers will only be considered once prior to their primary zone
consideration.

7–9. Colonel development
   a. Those officers selected for promotion to colonel continue their senior field grade phase that concludes with their
separation or retirement from an active status or selection for promotion to brigadier general. Attaining the grade of
colonel is realized by a select few and truly constitutes the elite of the officer corps. As colonels, their maximum
contribution to the Army is made as commanders and senior staff officers.
   b. The general professional development goals for colonels are to further enhance branch or FA skill proficiency
through additional senior-level assignments and schooling.
   (1) Branch assignments. Many colonels can expect to receive assignments to branch coded or immaterial positions
at the brigade, division, corps and echelons above corps in the TOE environment. TDA organizations throughout the
Army also need the expertise of senior field grade officers.
   (2) Functional area assignments. Under OPMS, FA officers should strive to work predominantly in their specialties
after selection for promotion to major. Having risen above their peers at the grade of major and lieutenant colonel,
those promoted to colonel are truly the world-class specialists in their respective fields. These officers should seek
senior managerial billets in the RC coded for their specialty.
   (3) Joint duty assignment. Although there is currently no RC Joint duty assignment reserve list, officers should seek
joint development in positions that provide Joint experience. Credit for the joint duty can be applied for in the same
manner used by AC for non-Joint duty assignment list duties that qualify as joint service.
   (4) Command selection. Some officers are selected for command at the colonel level. Most positions are branch-
coded and branch officers compete within designated categories for these positions. The command billets are board-
selected positions in the USAR. Command selections are approved by the CAR or the State AG. The majority of
officers in a cohort year group do not command; they make their maximum contribution to the Army in other
important branch or FA senior staff assignments.
7–10. Warrant officer development
Career management is of critical importance to the modern RC warrant officer. The modern RC warrant officer is a
complex person with numerous skills and disciplines, both civilian and military. The need for a thorough, profession-
ally designed leader development plan is both obvious and imperative. The career RC warrant officer must be well
trained to fill his or her mobilization role.
   a. Army National Guard.
   (1) ARNG warrant officer career management is the responsibility of the State AG.
   (2) The National Guard Bureau (NGB) communicates DA policy to the State AG in all matters concerning warrant
officer career management.
   (3) Leader development is a primary command responsibility. Commanders at all levels assist in the administration
of WOLDAP–ARNG by coordinating with the officer personnel manager to develop and properly guide the career of
each officer in their command, recommending assignments according to qualifications, aptitudes, potential and desires
of their officers, serving as mentors, conducting periodic evaluations and counseling, and recommending leader
development schools and training.
   (4) Organization personnel officers, especially at battalion level, play a vital role in career management for ARNG
warrant officers. The responsibilities of the personnel officer include maintaining liaison with the officer personnel
manager, assisting warrant officers in maintaining their records, counseling warrant officers concerning requirements
for designation of MOS and FA, and making recommendations to the commander and the Military Personnel
Management Office (ARNG) for changes to the personnel status of warrant officers.
   (5) Warrant officers have the final responsibility for ensuring they are progressing satisfactorily in their professional
development. They establish goals and evaluate progress, making necessary adjustments to achieve personal goals and
professional proficiency.
   (6) The Army Military Human Resource Records for all ARNG warrant officers are maintained at NGB. The
appropriate State AG office maintains a field military personnel record jacket for each warrant officer.
   (7) The AG of the State establishes unit location and stationing.
   b. U.S. Army Reserve.
   (1) Commanders and assignment officers are charged with the duty of developing the most professionally competent
USAR warrant officers possible by consistently providing meaningful training opportunities for the warrant officers
within their area of management responsibility. The assignment officer has training programs available which are
designed to provide a balance of military experience during each USAR warrant officer’s career.
   (2) The TPU is one important training vehicle. In the TPU, warrant officers gain the operational assignment
experience necessary for leader development. In this area, commanders must be closely involved with the developmen-
tal process of their subordinate warrant officers by offering progressive and sequential assignments and ensuring that
appropriate skills, knowledge, and attitudes are developed.
   (3) A balance must be maintained between assignments to TPUs and assignments within the IMA and IRR.
Diversity of assignment reduces the probability of narrow, limited training and assignment experience. Stagnation in
any category of assignment can be counterproductive to the development of the individual officer, as well as
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                                47

improperly utilizing the availability of assignments to enhance the professional capability of the entire warrant officer
cohort.
   (4) In the IRR, the warrant officer is able to "update" his background by training with the AA in progressive career
field assignments. This type of assignment is called “counterpart training.” IMA assignments may also be available.
   c. Warrant officer management considerations.
   (1) Army National Guard. To properly plan for the development and assignment of warrant officers into positions of
increasing responsibility, it is necessary to have an overview of the State force structure and an inventory of warrant
officer positions. States develop a State Master Development Plan (SMDP) as a tool for this purpose. The SMDP
allows for analysis of all MOSs authorized by State force structure documents, to determine career progression patterns
for warrant officers within the State. The SMDP is used to determine how many warrant officers in each MOS the AG
needs to develop. The proper selection, training, and utilization of warrant officers is dependent on each State’s MOS
requirements. Institutional training must be completed at the appropriate warrant officer career point, the best-qualified
warrant officers must receive progressive operational assignments in recognition of their demonstrated skills, and all
warrant officers must be aware of their responsibility to achieve the highest possible goals of self-development.
   (a) All warrant officers are assigned according to individual qualifications that are properly documented.
   (b) The professional capabilities of all warrant officers are developed through planned and progressively responsible
assignments. This ensures a sufficient number of qualified warrant officers at all times to accomplish assigned
missions.
   (c) All warrant officers have equal opportunity for promotion selection and for higher assignments on the basis of
their demonstrated abilities.
   (d) All warrant officers are aware of the guidelines and expectations in their career planning.
   (2) U.S. Army Reserve. Decisions on assignments will be made on the basis of the "whole person" concept and unit
requirements. Military training priorities must be integrated with the officer’s civilian job as well as personal and
community responsibilities.
   (a) The assignment officer/career manager will ensure that the background information on each warrant officer is
complete. Each record will be reviewed to determine the extent and quality of activity during service. Those IRR
officers without recent active participation may be programmed for counterpart training, if available, with an ACunit
prior to consideration for assignment to a troop unit.
   (b) Warrant officers serving in the IRR will be considered for reassignment to a TPU or an IMA assignment based
on the following factors. The assignment officer/career manager and when applicable the senior leader development
office senior warrant officer must ensure that officers have the prerequisite and, when appropriate, civilian schooling
required to prepare them for the reassignment.
   1. Availability and type of TPUs within a reasonable commuting distance (AR 140–1), normally within a 50-mile
radius or a 90-minute travel time. Distance is based on travel by car, one way, under normal traffic, weather, and road
conditions over the most direct route to the warrant officer’s home or current residence.
   2. Prior experience, both active and RC, and the level of this experience compared to a typical warrant officer of the
same grade, MOS/FA, and age.
   3. Career field and level of military schooling or potential to acquire the required skills within 3 years of
assignment.
   4. Amount of time the warrant officer can make available for military activities and officer’s preferences for types
of assignments.
7–11. Warrant officer one development
A WO1 is appointed by warrant with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position given by the
Secretary of the Army. WO1s are basic level, technically and tactically focused officers who perform the primary
duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, and advisor. They also perform any other
branch-related duties assigned to them. They also provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision
necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. WO1s have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions
and tasks assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility for how well
their command performs its mission. The WO1s primarily support levels of operations from team through battalion,
requiring interaction with all Soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide leader development, mentorship, and
counsel to enlisted Soldiers and NCOs. The appropriate WOBC must be completed within 2 years of appointment to be
a mobilization asset and remain in the ARNG and USAR.
7–12. Chief warrant officer two development
A CW2 is a commissioned officer with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the
Secretary of the Army. CW2s are intermediate level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of
technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, and advisor. They also perform any other branch-
related duties assigned to them. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for
subordinates to perform their duties. They have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions and tasks
48                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility for how well their
command performs its mission. CW2s primarily support levels of operations from team through battalion, requiring
interaction with all Soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and
counsel to NCOs, other warrant officers and company grade branch officers.
7–13. Chief warrant officer three development
A CW3 is a commissioned officer with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the
Secretary of the Army. CW3s are advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of
technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other
branch-related duties assigned to them. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision
necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. CW3s have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions
and tasks assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility for how well
their command performs its mission. CW3s primarily support levels of operations from team through brigade, requiring
interaction with all Soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and
counsel to NCOs, other warrant officers and branch officers. CW3s advise commanders on warrant officer issues.
7–14. Chief warrant officer four development
A CW4 is a commissioned officer with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the
Secretary of the Army. CW4s are senior-level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of
technical leader, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other branch-related
duties assigned to them. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for
subordinates to perform their duties. CW4s have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions and tasks
assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility for how well their
command performs its mission. They primarily support battalion, brigade, division, corps, and echelons above corps
operations. They must interact with NCOs, other officers, primary staff, and special staff. CW4s primarily provide
leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs, other warrant officers and branch officers. They have
special mentorship responsibilities for other warrant officers and provide essential advice to commanders on warrant
officer issues.
7–15. Chief warrant officer five development
A CW5 is a commissioned officer with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the
Secretary of the Army. CW5s are master-level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of
technical leader, manager, integrator, advisor, or any other particular duty prescribed by branch. They provide
direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. CW5s
have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions and tasks assigned to them. CW5s primarily support
brigade, division, corps, echelons above corps, and major command operations. They must interact with NCOs, other
officers, primary staff, and special staff. They provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to warrant
officers and branch officers. CW5s have special warrant officer leadership and representation responsibilities within
their respective commands. They provide essential advice to commanders on warrant officer issues.
7–16. Management considerations
   a. Army National Guard. Orderly career planning provides for progressive duty assignments and military schooling
to meet current needs and develop officer skills for future assignments. The success of the officer career planning and
management program is dependent upon policies and plans that ensure:
   (1) All officers are assigned according to individual qualifications that are properly documented.
   (2) The professional capabilities of all officers are developed through planned and progressively responsible assign-
ments. This ensures a sufficient number of qualified officers are available at all times to accomplish assigned missions.
   (3) All officers have equal opportunity for promotion selection and for higher assignments based on their demon-
strated abilities.
   (4) All officers are aware of the guidelines and expectations concerning career planning.
   b. U.S. Army Reserve-management consideration.
   (1) Previous active duty assignments. When evaluating an officer’s active duty assignments, consideration should be
given to the duty positions held by the officer, as well as his or her experience level. Active duty experience should be
capitalized upon by assigning these officers to positions in which they can share their experiences and expertise.
   (2) Experience. The officer’s record should be reviewed for previous assignments, the level of assignment, com-
mand and staff experience, active duty for training assignments, and other RC oriented training.
   (3) Military education. The officer’s record should be reviewed for military schools that have been completed.
Enrollment into resident and nonresident schools should be accomplished in a timely manner to ensure successful
completion of military education requirements. Education that incurs a service obligation must be fulfilled in either the
unit that sent the officer or in a like-type unit. Although assignment officers are not responsible for ensuring that
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            49

managed officers complete the requirements, they play an important role in monitoring the officer’s progress until the
course is successfully completed.
   (4) Civilian background. Assignment officers should evaluate the officer’s civilian education and occupational
background for potential skills, knowledge, and attributes that have military applications. Consideration may be given
for designation of a SI for a civilian-acquired skill.
   (5) Level of participation. The most critical factor in an officer’s development is his or her willingness to participate
in leader development over an extended period of time. The successful Army Reserve officer keeps his or her
assignment officer informed of the type of duty, training, and education that best conforms to the officer’s attributes,
interests, and professional development needs. Although statutory and regulatory requirements for participation in
education and training exist, the Army Reserve remains a volunteer organization. Ideally, every officer participates in
educational opportunities to the maximum extent possible within the funding constraints that exist within the Army
Reserve environment. It is also realized that Army Reserve officers are constrained by civilian employment, Family
considerations, and community responsibilities. However, Army Reserve officers must make every attempt to partici-
pate consistently in training and education opportunities. Failure to do so may result in the officer’s administrative
elimination from the service through either voluntary or involuntary means (board action).
   (6) Branch officers serving in command positions. Army Reserve officers must meet branch criteria for the type of
unit they will command. This requirement is fundamental to our America’s Army concept; therefore, requesting a
waiver from this requirement is strongly discouraged. Officers can request a waiver through their chain of command
and assignment officer to the CAR. In the absence of compelling reasons, approval of the request is not likely.
   (7) Reassignment-Individual Ready Reserve. Officers serving in the IRR are considered for placement in a TPU
position or an IMA assignment, based upon current position availability and the officer’s career progression needs. The
assignment officer ensures that officers have the military and civilian schooling necessary for TPU or IMA assign-
ments, while taking the following factors into consideration:
   (a) Availability and type of TPUs within a reasonable commuting distance. Officers are assigned according to
established procedures using the request vacancy system. (See AR 140–1 and applicable directives.)
   (b) Availability and type of IMA assignments currently available.
   (c) Prior experience (both AA and RC) and the level of this experience compared to a typical officer of the same
grade, branch, FA and time in service/time in grade.
   (d) Career field and level of military and civilian schooling or potential to acquire the necessary skills within 3 years
of assignment.
   (e) Officer’s annual training control group affiliation. (Obligated members of the annual training control group or
Officer Active Duty Obligor control group may be involuntarily assigned to a TPU or IMA position vacancy.)
   (8) Reassignments. AGR and IMA warrant officers are managed by HRC and will be reassigned based off of the
CAR Manning Guidance. Assignments will support (in this order) the needs of the USAR, professional development
needs of the officer, and the personal needs of the officer. TPU warrant officers are managed at the USARC and
subordinate commands. A thorough review of an officer’s file will be completed upon transfer to the IRR, and the
officer should be prepared to discuss future career development needs and type of assignments desired. An officer in
the IRR should continue to seek training opportunities to remain current in branch and/or FA skills.
7–17. Individual mobilization augmentee/drilling individual mobilization augmentee assignments (U.S.
Army Reserve)
   a. General. USAR officers fill a number of key positions throughout the DOD and other Governmental agencies.
These positions are used to rapidly expand the agencies during the early phases of mobilization. Pre-selected, specially
qualified officers are assigned to these positions and are trained during peacetime to augment the commands and
agencies to enhance mission accomplishment upon mobilization. These officers are called IMAs/drilling individual
mobilization augmentees (DIMAs) and are assigned to Army Reserve Control Group-IMA in a Selected Reserve status.
IMAs are given pre-mobilization orientation and qualification training for the positions to which they are attached. This
is accomplished during 12-day annual training tours. Officers assigned as DIMA receive an additional 12 days of
training per year in an inactive duty training status, which are performed with their unit or organization of attachment.
These tours are coordinated between the unit or organization, the career management officer (CMO) and the officer.
(For further guidance on the IMA program, see AR 140–145.)
   b. Training. IMA officers training requirements are coordinated through the gaining agency. All requests for training
in lieu of, or in addition to, annual training tours are submitted on DA Form 1058–R (Application for Active Duty for
Training, Active Duty for Special Work, Temporary Tour of Active Duty, and Annual Training for Soldiers of the
ARNG and USAR) through the proponent agency to Commander, U.S. Army Human Resources Command
(ARPC–PLM–I–IMA), 1600 Spearhead Division Road, Fort Knox, KY 40122–5200. HRC publishes orders if the unit
or organization concurs and funds are available. Units or organizations should provide IMA/DIMA officers the
opportunity to participate by completing projects for retirement credit throughout the year.
   c. Federal employees. Federal employees are declared available for mobilization by their employing command or
agency. As IMA officers, DA civilian employees may not hold IMA positions with the same HQDA general or special
50                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

staff element in which they are employed. USAR members should report employment conflicts to their proponent
agencies and HRC assignment officers when they occur.
7–18. Company and field grade officer education
   a. Resident courses. The RC officers are authorized to attend resident Army service schools to become qualified in
their present or projected assignments as funds and allocations allow. Attendance at resident service schools is the
preferred option for all RC officers since it allows for peer-to-peer interaction and an ongoing exchange of ideas and
experiences. It also allows RC officers to interact with their AA counterparts and provide them with information about
the RC. It is understood, however, that not all RC officers will be able to attend all service schools in residence due to
budgetary, time or training seat constraints. For this reason, type of school attendance (resident or nonresident) is not a
discriminator for promotion or duty assignment in the RC. Officers may also attend courses that contribute to the
military proficiency of the unit or enhance their specific abilities.
   b. Nonresident courses. With the exception of the BOLC, military schools may be taken through nonresident
courses, TASS and through Distributed Learning courses. The CCC and ILE are available in both TASS and
nonresident versions. The CMOs at HRC (for Army Reserve) and the State officer personnel manager (for ARNG)
should ensure that officers are enrolled in military education courses in a timely manner to ensure that all RC officers
remain fully competitive for promotion and assignment considerations. Table 7–2 discusses the options available for
RC officers to complete their military education and the amount of time that each officer has to complete the
nonresident instruction after enrollment before being dropped from the school.
   c. Branch and functional area educational requirements. All RC officers are designated a branch upon appointment.
Branching decisions are made based upon the needs of the Army, although officer preference is considered. Branching
is usually determined prior to commissioning, although RC officers can be re-branched at any time based upon the
needs of the service until they attend BOLC; at which point their branch is fixed. Once an officer has attended BOLC,
he or she cannot be re-branched until they have either attended another BOLC or completed other branch development
courses, such as CCC.
   (1) Basic Officer Leaders Course. All officers attend BOLC in their branch to meet branch development and
mobilization requirements; no alternative training method is available. Although attendance at BOLC immediately after
commissioning is preferable, RC officers must complete BOLC within 2 years of commissioning.
   (2) Captain Career Course. The RC officers will enroll in the RC CCC upon completion of BOLC III and
promotion to first lieutenant. Those who desire to enroll prior to this time require a waiver by the unit commander, or
by the Commander, HRC–Fort Knox for members of the IRR. The RC officers must enroll in the CCC prior to
completing 8 years of commissioned service. RC officers must satisfy the following prerequisites for enrollment into
the CCC:
   (a) Be a commissioned officer in the grade of first lieutenant or captain.
   (b) Meet the standards of AR 140–1, AR 600–9, and AR 350–1.
   (3) Functional area training. RC officers may apply for FA designation once promoted to captain. Although a FA is
not a branch, it is an area of specialization requiring additional training or experience. Many courses provided through
the DOD and in the civilian community support FA training and qualification, as does civilian work experience. For
example, some officers are qualified as Operations Research/Systems Analysts in their civilian profession; yet do not
possess the Operations Research/Systems Analysis (FA 49) FA. Since this FA is chronically short throughout the
Army, these officers will be strongly encouraged to apply for it based on their civilian experience. FA selection is
therefore based on such factors as the officer’s experience and abilities, geographical requirements and the needs of the
Army. FAs allow RC officers to broaden the scope of their experience and enhance both their assignment and
promotion potential.
   d. Intermediate level education. This mid-level school prepares majors for assignments at the division and corps
level, as well as joint assignments. The school is branch non-specific and provides training in the military arts and
sciences, as well as introductory courses in geopolitical issues and on how the Army runs. RC officers also receive
credit for ILE by attending the resident Marine Corps, Navy or Air Force Command and General Staff College and the
Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation.
   e. Associate Theater Logistics Studies Program. The Associate Theater Logistics Studies Program (ATLog) replaces
the Associate Logistics Executive Development Course and is offered to officers in Ordnance, Transportation, Quarter-
master, and some Medical Service. Attendance at the Combined Logistics Officer Advanced Course or the Combined
Logistics Captains Career Course (CLC3) at Fort Lee satisfies the prerequisites for ATLog. The course targets
logisticians at the Operational level who will be positioned in the Army as multifunctional, joint, and multinational
logistics problem solvers. ATLog consists of five phases. Phase I and Phase V are mandatory resident phases. Phases
II, III, and IV are nonresident phases. All nonresident phases are offered via blackboard. All phases are required to be
taken in sequence (1, 2, 3 and so forth). This ensures that all students have the same educational background. ATLog
requires students to take the 2 week resident Joint Course on Logistics as a prerequisite prior to enrollment into Phase
IV. Students have 3 years to complete the entire ATLog course. ATLog also provides Defense Acquisition University
(DAU) course equivalency for five DAU courses: ACQ 101, ACQ 201, CON 100, LOG 101, and LOG 201. HRC has
approved award of a SI to ATLog graduates. This SI is for logistics officers focused upon becoming the Army’s
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              51

logistics planners and problem solvers in theater and expeditionary sustainment commands (ESCs), as well as joint and
multinational staffs. The phases of ATLog are:
   (1) Phase 1—Theater Logistics (TLog) (resident).
   (2) Phase 2—Data Analysis and Application (nonresident).
   (3) Phase 3—Capabilities and Requirements/Contracting (nonresident).
   (4) Phase 4—Material and Distribution Management/Battle Logistics Analysis Paper (nonresident).
   (5) Phase 5—TLog (Capstone)/Regional Economic Implications (resident).
   f. Senior Service School requirements. The SSCs provide field grade officers with advanced professional education
in both military and sociopolitical topics. The SSCs, which include the Army War College and university fellowships,
prepare officers for senior leadership positions throughout the DOD.
   g. Field grade refresher courses. Branch refresher courses are conducted by branch proponent schools to provide
current doctrine in branch matters and special subjects for field grade officers. While no credit for promotion is given
for attendance at these courses, the opportunity to update professional knowledge is of great value to RC officers.
   h. Language training. Where a TOE or TDA position requires language proficiency, officers may apply for language
acquisition or sustainment training at either the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, CA, or the ARNG Language
Center. These resident courses are very lengthy, lasting from 25 to 60 weeks.
   i. Civilian education. The standard for civilian education for officers in the U.S. Army is a baccalaureate degree.
Most officers commissioned into the RC already have a baccalaureate degree; however, some officers commissioned
through the State OCS do not. Table 7–3 lists the educational requirements applicable to the appointment and
commissioning of officers without baccalaureate degrees. Effective 1 October 1995, in accordance with the National
Defense Authorization Act for FY 1995, a baccalaureate degree from an accredited educational institution is required
for promotion to any grade above first lieutenant. Army Nurse Corps officers appointed on or after 1 October 1986
must possess a baccalaureate degree in nursing (accredited by an agency acceptable to HQDA) prior to promotion to
major.
   j. Other military education.
   (1) Total Army School System. The TASS offers ILE to RC officers. Since 1 October 1993, CCCs have been
offered through the branch proponent schools in RC configured courses. The TASS option offers an excellent
opportunity for completing educational requirements because of the presence of qualified instructors and the interaction
with fellow officers.
   (2) The Army Institute for Professional Development. The Army Institute for Professional Development at Fort
Eustis, VA, administers the Army Correspondence Course Program (ACCP). The ACCP provides progressive educa-
tional opportunities through correspondence for a wide variety of subjects. This type of military education is particu-
larly well suited for RC officers who cannot take advantage of resident courses. Many courses are targeted at specific
assignments, such as motor officer, personnel officer, or dining facility officer.
7–19. Warrant Officer Education System
   a. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to outline the methods available to warrant officers in completing military
education requirements and civilian education goals as they progress through their military careers.
   b. Military education.
   (1) The Department of the Army MOS proponents conduct courses in both AA and RC configured versions
combining correspondence and active duty for training phases for most occupational specialties.
   (2) Warrant officer training under Warrant Officer Education System has five levels that provide warrant officers
with performance-based certification and qualification training. Warrant Officer Education System trains and develops
warrant officers for progressively more difficult and complex assignments. The new course titles align more closely
with comparable commissioned officer courses for consistency and ease of understanding by the Army at large. All
warrant officers, supervisors, and commanders must familiarize themselves with the new Warrant Officer Education
System and understand the affect on warrant officer leader and professional development. The five levels of Warrant
Officer Education System are:
   (a) Warrant Officer Candidate School. This course provides candidates with initial warrant officer training. Gradu-
ates are appointed to warrant officer (WO1). Completion of WOBC within 2 years (a 1-year extension may be granted
on a case-by-case basis) of warrant officer appointment is required.
   (b) Warrant Officer Basic Course. This is proponent training that provides MOS-specific instruction and certifica-
tion following WOCS and is characterized by an increased emphasis on leadership. This course is an ARNG
requirement for promotion to CW2, and an Army Reserve requirement for promotion to CW2 for a warrant officer
with a date of rank of 1 January 05 or later. (Warrant officers with date of rank prior to 1 January 05 are grandfathered
for promotion to CW3.)
   (c) Warrant Officer Advanced Course. This training provides additional training for warrant officers serving at the
company and battalion level and is a two phase course consisting of:
   1. Warrant Officer Advanced Course Prerequisite Studies Phase. This is a mandatory nonresident course that must
be completed prior to attending resident WOAC training. Effective 1 October 1998, the Action Officer Development
52                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

Course (ST7000) was adopted as the resource for this DL course. It can be completed online via the Internet, and
provides warrant officers serving in CW2 or higher duty positions relevant training in topics such as management
techniques, communication skills, preparing and staffing documents, meetings and interviews, problem solving, writing,
coordinating, briefings, and ethics. In keeping with the Warrant Officer Education System model, enrollment must
occur after promotion to CW2 in order to qualify for WOAC Prerequisite Studies credit. The course must be completed
within 1 year of enrollment; however, CW2s now have the flexibility to enroll at any convenient time between 24 and
48 months of total warrant officer service. Completion of the Action Officer Development Course is mandatory
requirement for promotion of all ARNG warrant officers to CW3 including those awarded an MOS that does not have
an advanced course. To enroll online, go to http://www.adtdl.army.mil/cgi-bin/atdl.dll/accp/st7000/top.htm and follow
the enrollment instructions.
   2. The resident phase of the Warrant Officer Advanced Course. This course is administered and conducted by
individual proponents and is an ARNG requirement for promotion to the grade of CW3. For USAR warrant officers,
successful completion is a requirement for promotion to CW4 and CW5 until 2010 when it will be a requirement for
promotion to CW3 for a warrant officer with a date of rank of 1 January 05 or later. (Warrant officers with date of
rank prior to 1 January 05 are grandfathered for promotion to CW4.)
   (d) Warrant Officer Staff Course. This common core 5-week resident course prepares warrant officers to serve in
staff positions at the brigade and higher levels. WOSC is an ARNG requirement for promotion to CW4. (At this time,
WOSC is not a prerequisite for the WOSSC). For Army Reserve warrant officers, successful completion will be a
requirement for promotion to CW4 and CW5 beginning in 2010.
   (e) Warrant Officer Senior Staff Course. This 2-week resident course is conducted at the Warrant Officer Career
Center (WOCC), Fort Rucker, AL and prepares warrant officers selected for promotion to chief warrant officer (CW5)
to serve at the highest level staff positions. (This course is an RC requirement for promotion to CW5).
   (3) Correspondence courses. The Army Institute for Professional Development at Fort Eustis, VA is responsible for
the administration of the ACCP. The ACCP provides progressive education opportunities through correspondence for a
wide variety of subjects. This type of military education is particularly suited for RC personnel who cannot take
advantage of resident courses. Many courses are targeted at specific assignments.
   (4) Language training. Where the MTOE or TDA position requires language proficiency, warrant officers may
apply for language training at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, CA or the ARNG Language Center in
Puerto Rico.
   c. Civilian education. There is a demand for warrant officers with an education beyond high school level to
accommodate the changing technological environment within the Army. The RC warrant officer corps must keep pace
with these changes if it is to meet the challenges of the future. Applicants for initial appointment must meet all MOS-
specific additional civilian education requirements as specified for the particular warrant officer specialty. Applicants
whose native language is not English must be tested and achieve a minimum raw score of 80 on the English
Comprehension Level Test. Civilian education goals are as follows:
   (1) The ARNG goal for warrant officers is the attainment of a specialty-related associate degree or 60 college
semester hours by the eighth year of warrant officer service.
   (2) The Army Reserve goal for warrant officers is the attainment of a specialty-related associate degree or 60
college semester hours by the 5th year of warrant officer service, and a bachelors degree by the 10th year of warrant
officer service.

7–20. Promotion
See AR 135–155 and NGR 600–101 for all promotion details. Law for promotion automatically considers commis-
sioned officers of the RCs who are on the Reserve active status list for 1 year or more and when they have served the
required years in grade, per the 1-year rule outlined in 10 USC 14301(a). The AR 135–155 requires that each USAR
warrant officer who is in an active status be considered for promotion at such time as he or she has served the required
number of years in grade. Promotion consideration occurs whether officers are assigned to an ARNG unit, TPU or a
control group, except for the Standby Reserve (Inactive) and the Inactive ARNG. The RC officers assigned to an
ARNG unit or USAR TPU have an additional opportunity for promotion to fill unit position vacancies at such time as
they have completed the education and time in grade requirements. Warrant officers in the Standby Reserve (Inactive)
and ING are not considered for promotion. Army Reserve warrant officers assigned to TPUs have the additional
opportunity to be considered for promotion to fill unit vacancies at such time as they have completed the required years
in grade, without regard to total years of service. The ARNG warrant officers are promoted by the State AG to fill
vacancies in ARNG units. Time in grade requirements for vacancy promotions are contained in AR 135–155. Army
Reserve warrant officer promotion time lines are shown in AR 135–155. ARNG promotion time lines are outlined in
NGR 600–101.
7–21. Consideration (C), Selection (S), and Promotion (P) requirements for company and field grade
officers
   a. General. To be eligible for selection for promotion, an RC officer, other than a warrant officer, not on extended
active duty must—
   (1) (C) Be on the Reserve active status list.
   (2) (P)/(S) Be an active member and participating satisfactorily in RC training.
   (3) (S) Meet the prescribed military educational requirements shown in table 7–1.
   (4) (S) Meet the prescribed civilian educational requirements of 10 USC 12205. The USC states that no person may
be appointed to a grade above the grade of lieutenant in the Army Reserve or be federally recognized in a grade above
the grade of first lieutenant as a member of the ARNG unless that person has been awarded a baccalaureate degree by
a qualifying institution. This does not apply to the following:
   (a) (S) The appointment to or recognition in a higher grade of a person who is appointed in or assigned for service
in a health profession for which a baccalaureate degree is not a condition of original appointment or assignment.
   (b) (C) The appointment to or recognition in a higher grade of any person who was appointed to, or federally
recognized in, the grade of captain before 1 October 1995.
   (c) (C) Recognition in the grade of captain or major in the Alaska ARNG of a person who resides permanently at a
location in Alaska that is more than 50 miles from each of the cities of Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau by paved
road, and who is serving in a scout unit or a scout supporting unit.
   (5) (S) Meet the prescribed civilian educational requirements of AR 135–155.
   (a) (S) Army Nurse Corps officers appointed on or after 1 October 1986 must possess a baccalaureate degree in
nursing from an accredited educational institution prior to promotion to major.
   (b) (S) Officers other than Army nurses appointed on or after 1 October 1987 must possess a baccalaureate from an
accredited educational institution prior to promotion to major.
   (6) (C) Have served the required time in grade in accordance with AR 135–155.
   b. (C) Reserve appointments. Upon release from active duty, officers with Reserve appointments are transferred in
the grade satisfactorily held while on the ADL and, if accepted, may transfer to an ARNG unit or Army Reserve TPU;
otherwise, they are transferred to the IRR. The officer also retains his or her time in grade. Officers on the ADL
selected for promotion, removed from the ADL before being promoted, and transferred to the Reserve active status list
in the same competitive category, shall be placed on an appropriate promotion list for Reserve of the Army promotion
without the need for further consideration. RA officers who leave active service must apply and be accepted for a first-
time Reserve appointment to enter Reserve duty.

7–22. Promotion selection board
   a. The minimum military education requirements shown in table 7–1, paragraph 7–4, are a prerequisite for promo-
tion. Since annual selection boards consider officers for promotion far enough in advance of the date on which the
required time in grade will be completed as prescribed in AR 135–155, educational requirements, both military and
civilian, must be completed no later than the day prior to the date the board considering the officer convenes. The
promotion board schedule is established annually by HQDA and is adjusted as required.
   b. Selection boards consider the promotion of officers for all grades first lieutenant to colonel. Officers considered
qualified and selected for promotion to first lieutenant will be promoted when they have completed 18 months service
in grade. Second lieutenants are not promoted unless they have completed an Army BOLC. Second lieutenants who are
not obligated and not promoted upon completion of 36 months commissioned service are separated.
   c. Warrant officers of the ARNG are appointed and promoted by the States under section 8 of the U.S. Constitution.
In order for an ARNG warrant officer to be concurrently promoted and receive Reserve Warrant Officer of the Army
designation, the State promotion action must be federally recognized. To accomplish this process, the promotion action
requires the conduct and examination by a Federal Recognition Board. The senior RA advisor of the State for the
numbered Army Area (continental United States Army (CONUSA)) commanders appoints Federal Recognition Boards.
Appointments to the Federal Recognition Board are made by authority of the Secretary of the Army. The Secretary of
the Army provides administrative instructions and guidance to be used by the Federal Recognition Board in a
memorandum of instruction to the board. Federal Recognition Boards consist of a total of three commissioned officers
of the AA and the ARNG who are senior to the officer being considered. The senior member of the board will serve as
president of the board. A minimum of one member (preferably two) should be in the same branch as the officer to be
considered. The board will consist of at least one minority member as a voting member, if possible, when minorities
are being considered. Normally, at least one female officer will be appointed as a voting member whenever there are
females being considered. When feasible, a commissioned aviator will be included as a member of the board when
considering promotion of Aviation warrant officers. Applicants for ARNG promotion are examined in accordance with
NGR 600–101.
   d. The Army Reserve CW3 and CW4 selection board selects officers for promotion without regard to vacancies in
the next higher grade using a "fully qualified" methodology. The Army Reserve CW5 selection board selects officers
for promotion utilizing a "best-qualified" methodology and considers both MOS and promotion ceilings when deter-
mining who will be promoted to fill the projected vacancies in authorized CW5 positions. Army Reserve selection
boards will be composed of at least seven members: a brigadier general as board president, two colonels, and four
CW5s. At least one-half of all selection board members will be RC officers not on active duty. Each selection board
will consist of at least one minority member as a voting member. Normally, at least one female officer will be
appointed as a voting member whenever there are females being considered. Army Reserve unit vacancy boards, when
needed, convene on a date announced by HQDA. Selection boards convene each year as announced by HQDA.

Chapter 8
Infantry Branch
8–1. Unique features of the Infantry Branch
   a. Unique purpose of the Infantry Branch. The Infantry Branch is the maneuver branch with the mission to close
with and destroy the enemy by means of fire and movement to defeat or capture him, or repel his assault by fire, close
combat and counterattack. The Infantry is the only branch specifically designed to engage the enemy in direct ground
combat. Infantry officers are valued for their physical and mental toughness, and their innate ability to focus on
mission accomplishment in the most austere environments.
   b. The way ahead. The continued evolution of the Army after 10 plus years of protracted conflict, changes in
strategic focus, and unprecedented resourcing challenges will alter but not significantly change how the Infantry Branch
trains, assigns, and develops officers. Although the means, methods, and time available to develop Infantry officers
may change in the upcoming years, the fundamental goal and requirements remain unchanged. The end state remains
the development of agile, adaptable, physically and mentally tough Infantry officers with a solid foundation in the core
warfighting skills required to close with and destroy the enemy in close ground combat. While the focus of the Infantry
Branch has always been the development of combined arms warriors, the Army’s development and fielding of
combined arms formations has amplified this requirement. These formations require a deliberate focus on the develop-
ment of Infantry company grade officers who are experts in branch-specific individual, leader, and collective tasks,
who can employ their units as part of a combined arms element. Field grade officers in these organizations require a
broader understanding in the application of combined arms maneuver, joint and coalition capabilities to plan and
execute brigade combat team (BCT) level tactical operations in support of unified land operations. As the Infantry
officer progresses through the ranks their development must also prepare them to successfully serve across the entire
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              55

JIIM environment. The assignment of Infantry officers will continue to be made based on (1) the needs of the Army,
(2) the professional development needs of the officer and (3) the officer’s preference. While HRC will make every
effort to synchronize the three priorities, the needs of the Army and the professional development needs of the officer
must continue to take precedence over individual preference.
   c. Unique functions performed by the Infantry Branch. Infantry leaders are expected to synchronize all elements of
combat power on the battlefield to defeat the enemy. Infantry officers are prepared to train, lead, and employ all types
of Infantry and other maneuver and fire assets on the battlefield in unified land operations (offense, defense, and
stability operations). The Infantry arrives on the battlefield by parachute assault, air assault, mechanized vehicle,
wheeled vehicle or on foot. Insertion means are dependent upon the mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and
support available, time available and civilian considerations.
   d. Unique features of work in the Infantry Branch. Infantry officers work at all levels of command and staff and can
perform the following functions and tasks:
   (1) Execute mission command of infantry and combined arms forces in combat.
   (2) Provide coordination for employment of combined arms forces at all levels of joint, Army, and coalition
commands.
   (3) Develop doctrine, organizations, and equipment for Infantry unique missions and formations.
   (4) Instruct Infantry skills at service schools and CTCs.
   (5) Serve in positions requiring general combat skills such as staff officers in all levels of headquarters and activities
requiring Infantry or maneuver expertise.
   (6) Serve as Infantry instructors at pre-commissioning programs, service schools, and colleges.
   (7) Serve as Infantry advisors to DOD, ARNG, USAR, and JIIM organizations.
   e. Branch detail. Infantry Branch participates in the branch detailing of officers into Infantry for development and
growth at the grade of lieutenant. Officers detailed Infantry (branch code 11) will lose their Infantry designation once
they reach their branch detail expiration date and they have been reassigned into their new branch. Although branch
detail times vary they generally occur prior to selection for captain and attendance at the CCC.
   f. Branch eligibility. Specific eligibility requirements can be found in DA Pam 611–21. Officers of other branches
who desire a branch transfer to Infantry should submit a request in accordance with AR 614–100.
8–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. General. Infantry Branch requires officers who are, first and foremost, leaders of Soldiers. They should be
mentally and physically disciplined and well-versed in Infantry and combined arms tactics, techniques and procedures.
Infantry leaders will embody the Warrior Ethos. They will place the welfare of their Soldiers ahead of their own, and
they will live the Army Values without exception. Their example will inspire others to achieve the same level of
commitment and professionalism. The Infantry must produce agile and adaptive leaders who are flexible, critically
reflective, and comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty, and agents of change. Infantry officers must be challenged
and imbued with the confidence to be innovative and adaptive while competently performing in a JIIM environment.
Infantry officers must be:
   (1) Proficient in the art and science of the profession of arms.
   (2) Comfortable employing both lethal and nonlethal means.
   (3) Able to confront the uncertain situations of the contemporary operational environment.
   (4) Adept at using ethical decision-making to solve complex, dynamic problems.
   (5) Team builders, able to confidently lead Soldiers while engendering loyalty and trust. Additionally, there are
several branch-unique skills that require professional development. Infantry Branch is the proponent for the following
SIs (detailed descriptions contained in DA Pam 611–21):
   (a) 2B–Air Assault.
   (b) 3X–Bradley Leader.
   (c) 3Z–Mortar Unit Officer.
   (d) 5P–Parachutist.
   (e) 5R–Ranger.
   (f) 5S–Ranger/Parachutist.
   (g) 5Q–Pathfinder.
   (h) 5W–Jumpmaster.
   b. Competencies and actions common to all. Infantry officers are valued for their skills as leaders, trainers, and
planners: these skills are acquired and perfected through realistic training, PME and service in the most demanding
positions Infantry Branch offers. Infantry officers must be proficient at maneuvering both vehicular and non-vehicular
Infantry formations as well as serving in equally critical assignments within the generating force. The goal of the
branch is to provide each officer with a series of leadership, staff, and developmental assignments; institutional
training; and self-development opportunities in order to develop combined arms warriors with broad experience who
can successfully operate in infantry specific, branch immaterial and JIIM assignments.
56                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   c. Unique skills. Infantry officers should consistently display outstanding performance across a wide variety of
operating and generating force positions. Infantry officers should demonstrate excellence in their warfighting skills;
technical proficiency; a well developed understanding of combined arms, joint, and coalition warfare; and the ability to
lead, train, motivate, and care for Soldiers.
8–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
   a. Lieutenant. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop the requisite
Infantry Branch skills, knowledge, and abilities. Lieutenants will focus on development of Infantry tactical and
technical warfighting skills and the utilization of these skills in an operating force assignment.
   (1) Education. Infantry officers will attend the Infantry BOLC. The Infantry BOLC course takes the graduate of
OCS/BOLC I and continues development with the mission to “Educate and train Infantry lieutenants who are
competent, confident, and professional leaders; able to lead platoons to fight and win in any operational environment.”
The Infantry BOLC endstate is: A physically rugged, competent, and confident Infantry officer proficient in Infantry
skills who is adaptable, flexible, and prepared to train and lead Infantry platoons on any mission in any terrain. To
further the development and tactical and technical proficiency required of Infantry officers there are a multitude of
functional and combat/specials skills courses available following Infantry BOLC. It is the goal of the branch to provide
all Infantry lieutenants with the opportunity to attend the Airborne Course and Ranger Course following Infantry
BOLC. The Ranger Course is essential in developing the knowledge, skill, abilities required to serve as a rifle platoon
leader. Additionally, any officer assigned to an armored BCT or a Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) should attend
the Bradley Leaders Course or the Stryker Leader Course prior to reporting for duty. Some officers will be selected to
attend the Infantry Mortar Leader Course. Regardless of unit of assignment and follow-on schools, the objective is for
Infantry lieutenants to complete all the required and branch directed training within 10 months from the 1st day of
Infantry BOLC in order to ensure that they are able to complete the requisite assignments in their first duty station to
provide them with the skills, knowledge, and experience necessary to build a strong foundation. The Infantry expects
all Infantry lieutenants to volunteer for and complete Ranger training. The Ranger course develops the technical and
tactical proficiency of Soldiers to improve their ability to plan and conduct missions to close with and destroy the
enemy in direct ground combat normally associated with Infantry platoons. Successful completion of the Ranger
Course is an indication that an officer possesses the skills and stamina necessary to effectively lead Soldiers in the
Infantry.
   (2) Operational and broadening assignments. The typical Infantry lieutenant will be assigned to a BCT as his first
unit of assignment. The KD assignment during this phase is serving as a platoon leader in an operating force unit.
Early experience as a rifle platoon leader is critical, as it provides Infantry lieutenants with the opportunity to gain
tactical and technical expertise in their branch while developing leadership skills. Other typical assignments for
lieutenants are battalion specialty platoon leader (recon, mortar, or weapons), company executive officer, or battalion
staff officer.
   (3) Self-development. Self-development during this phase should focus on Infantry tactical fundamentals, troop-
leading procedures, leadership skills, organizational maintenance, resupply operations, basic administrative operations,
and other branch technical proficiency skills. Infantry lieutenants must take the initiative to gain knowledge and
experience for the next level of assignments and responsibilities as a captain. Self-improvement and development can
be achieved through observing different activities and officers at the battalion and brigade levels, seeking out mentors
and by gaining experience in other duty positions after successfully serving as a rifle platoon leader. The CSA’s
Professional Reading List for Company Grade Officers is an excellent source of information to assist the lieutenants in
the self-development process. Additional resources are available through the U.S. Army Maneuver Center of Excel-
lence Maneuver Self Study Program available online.
   (4) Desired experience. Each Infantry lieutenant must complete all BOLC phases, successfully serve as a rifle
platoon leader in an operating force assignment, and continue development of his technical and tactical abilities
through assignment to a specialty platoon, executive officer, or in a staff position. The goal is a lieutenant with an
understanding of how to employ an Infantry Platoon independently or in support of a company or larger combined
arms team. He should have a working knowledge of special operations and air ground operations. A limited number of
Infantry lieutenants will also serve in generating force assignments as executive officers, instructor/writers, or com-
manders prior to attending Maneuver Captain’s Career Course (MC3).
   b. Captain. The professional development objective for this phase is to develop Infantry officers with the technical,
tactical, and leadership skills to serve successfully as a company commander and staff officer at the BCT level within
the operating force, and who have rounded out their knowledge through successfully completing an assignment in the
generating force. Infantry captains who have served in both operating and generating force positions have honed their
tactical skills and expanded their capabilities through their developmental assignments.
   (1) Education. Completion of the MC3 is mandatory during this period. Specialized training will be scheduled for
officers after MC3 on an as needed basis. The majority of officers attending MC3 will be assigned to a different type
of Infantry organization (vehicular or non-vehicular) than they served in at their first duty station. Exceptions may be
made based on operational needs. Infantry officers who have not successfully completed the Ranger course should
attend prior to or immediately following their career course. Infantry captains on orders to an armored BCT as a first
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             57

time assignment will attend the Bradley Leaders Course and those assigned to SBCTs will attend the SBCT Leader
Course prior to reporting.
   (2) Operational and broadening assignments. The KD assignment for a captain is command of an operating force
Infantry company for 12 to 18 months for a single command and no more than 24 months for two commands. Infantry
captains should bear in mind that they will most likely be assigned to a type of Infantry unit they did not serve with as
a lieutenant (vehicular or non-vehicular). Officers who command generating force companies encounter significant
responsibilities and are therefore, extremely well prepared for operating force command. Generating force company
commanders, having their first commands at the United States Army Infantry School, will be given a follow-on
operating force assignment and the opportunity to compete for company command in operational BCTs. The Infantry
encourages officers to seek company command opportunities on Fort Benning, prior to attendance at MC3. Infantry
captains can expect to command within these organizations for 10 to 12 months and then immediately attend MC3.
Officers who command in these generating force assignments will be provided the opportunity to compete for
command in operating force units. Captains should aggressively seek command and developmental assignments in
battalion and brigade-level staff positions in order to further their understanding of Infantry leadership and tactics.
Some officers will have the opportunity to compete for selection and assignment to unique units where they may
command again, such as the 75th Ranger Regiment, 3rd Infantry Group (Old Guard), SMUs, and the Ranger Training
Brigade. Upon completion of company command, a wide variety of developmental assignments are available. The
purpose of these assignments is to meet critical Army requirements, further develop the officer’s knowledge base and
provide him broad professional experience. Broadening assignments for Infantry captains include—
   (a) Service school instructor or small group leader.
   (b) Aide-de-camp.
   (c) AC/RC and CTC observer/coach-trainer or staff positions.
   (d) Generating force staff.
   (e) Doctrine developer.
   (f) Training developer.
   (g) ACOM and higher-level DA staff.
   (h) USMA faculty and staff.
   (i) U.S. Army Recruiting Company command and staff.
   (j) ROTC Assistant Professor of Military Science.
   (k) Multinational and coalition trainer and staff officer.
   (l) Army sponsored fellowships and scholarships.
   (m) Other combat arms or branch generalist positions.
   (n) JIIM organizations and commands.
   (3) Self-development. During this phase, Infantry officers must hone their leadership, tactical, and technical skills
and concentrate on those critical tasks required to accomplish their wartime mission while winning on the battlefield.
The officer should also begin to develop a more thorough understanding of combined arms operations in a joint
environment. Captains must take the initiative to gain knowledge and experience for the next level of assignments and
responsibilities as a field grade officer. Self-improvement and development can be achieved through observing staff
activities at the battalion and brigade levels, seeking out mentors, and by gaining experience in other duty positions
after successful completion of company command. Officers should continue their professional military reading with
books from the CSA’s Professional Reading List for Field Grade Officers.
   (4) Desired experience. There is no substitute for an operating force company command. It develops an Infantry
officer’s leadership and tactical skills and prepares him for future leadership assignments at successively higher levels
of responsibility.
   (5) Voluntary Transfer Incentive Program. This program allows officers to transfer into another branch or FA
beginning in their 4th year of active Federal service all the way through their 14th year. This program also allows
officers who are branch detailed into another branch to remain Infantry if they so desire. The VTIP panel meets every
quarter to determine if an officer is eligible to transfer into another branch/FA. Submission of a VTIP packet does not
guarantee that an officer will be branch transferred. Small numbers of Infantry officers from each year group will
volunteer and be accessed into the Army Acquisition Corps through the VTIP process. These officers form a critical
link between the operational and material development that benefits all branches.
   c. Majors. The professional development objective for this phase is to expand the officer’s tactical and technical
experience and continue to broaden the officer as a combined arms warrior and leader with a comprehensive
understanding of operations in a JIIM and expeditionary environment. Additionally, through a series of operating and
generating force developmental assignments, the Infantry major continues to increase his understanding of how the
Army operates. The goal is to provide the Infantry major with the tools that prepare the officer for future battalion
command and for increasingly complex developmental assignments.
   (1) Education. Military education required during this phase is completion of ILE conducted under the auspices of
the Command and General Staff College or sister Service/foreign equivalent. The Army conducts ILE selection boards
in conjunction with the Major ACC Promotion Selection Board to consider officers for resident or nonresident ILE
58                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

opportunities. Officers will be selected for resident Command and General Staff College, satellite ILE or DL. Officers
may also compete for sister Service ILE, foreign ILE and interagency fellowships. Officers may also compete to be
selected for the SAMS, following the Army Operating Warfighting Course. Upon graduation from SAMS, the officer is
required to serve up to two SAMS Utilization Tours (minimum of one) as a corps or division plans or operations/
assistant DCS, G–3/5/7 staff officer.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Each officer should have sufficient experience in KD assignments in order to
develop an understanding of Infantry and combined arms operations. There is no substitute for these KD assignments at
the brigade level and below for preparing an Infantry officer for future command and for building his Infantry
maneuver and combined arms skills. The Infantry major may further expand his tactical and technical skills by serving
in staff assignments at division level and higher. The division chief of plans/chief of operation position are only
considered KD assignments for the SAMS graduate Infantry officers. SAMS officers must then serve a minimum of 12
months in a battalion or brigade S3/XO position. KD assignments for an Infantry major are:
   (a) Battalion/squadron operations officer.
   (b) Battalion/squadron executive officer.
   (c) Brigade/regiment operations officer.
   (d) Operations officer and executive officer equivalent positions within a SMU.
   (e) Division chief of plans (SAMS utilization only).
   (f) Division chief of operations (SAMS utilization only).
   (g) Senior Ranger regimental liaison officer.
   (3) Infantry majors will also meet the Army’s mission requirements and broaden their experience before or after
their KD assignments. Broadening positions for Infantry majors include:
   (a) AC/RC and CTC observer/controller-trainer or staff positions.
   (b) Doctrine developer.
   (c) Training developer.
   (d) DA staff officer.
   (e) Joint staff officer.
   (f) Aide-de-camp.
   (g) Brigade, division or corps staff.
   (h) ACOM staff (CONUS and OCONUS).
   (i) Command and General Staff College staff and faculty.
   (j) Service school instructor.
   (k) USMA faculty and staff.
   (l) ROTC Assistant Professor of Military Science.
   (m) Multinational and coalition trainer and staff officer.
   (n) Army sponsored fellowships and scholarships.
   (o) JIIM organizations and commands.
   (4) Self-development. Infantry majors are expected to continue self-development efforts to build organizational
leadership, strategic perspective and hone operational skills. Infantry majors will be required to develop and use a
diverse set of skills as they move between combined arms leadership positions in operating and generating force
organizations as well as in JIIM assignments.
   (5) Desired experience. The Infantry major must hone his skills in the planning and execution of combined arms
warfare to develop expertise in the JIIM operational environment. While 12 months is the minimum standard, an
Infantry major will normally serve 24 months in a KD assignment. In order to produce agile and adaptive leaders,
Infantry majors who have not yet met the requirements of the vehicular to non-vehicular imperative may be assigned to
units for which they have not had previous experience following ILE. Moving between operating and generating force
assignments will further broaden an Infantry officer’s experience.
   (6) Additional factors. The goal of the branch is to develop an inventory of field grade officers who embody a
collective knowledge of JIIM experience. While not every officer will receive an assignment in a qualifying joint
assignment or serve a fellowship in a JIIM agency, the goal is to provide the maximum opportunity for Infantry majors
to receive JIIM experience. The JIIM assignments for Infantry majors are dependent on Army demands and position/
fellowship availability.
   d. Lieutenant colonel. The professional development objective for this phase is demonstrated excellence in tactical
skills, technical proficiency, and the ability to lead, train, motivate, and care for Soldiers in both the staff and command
environments. As the Infantry officer increases in rank, opportunities to serve within the operating force will decrease,
while opportunities to serve in the generating force will increase. The officer’s previous generating force assignments
prepare the officer for an expanded role in the generating force in positions of increasing responsibility.
   (1) Education. Lieutenant colonels selected for command-complete PCCs and may be selected for SSC following
command.
   (2) Operating and broadening assignments. The KD assignment for Infantry lieutenant colonels is to serve as a
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                               59

centrally selected (CSL) battalion command in the operating or generating force. Infantry lieutenant colonels selected
for command will normally serve 2 years in command at battalion level. Broadening positions for Infantry lieutenant
colonels include:
   (a) CTC task force trainer.
   (b) Brigade or regiment XO, and deputy BCT commander.
   (c) Division-level officer under DCS, G–3/5/7 (Normally a former battalion commander).
   (d) ROTC PMS.
   (e) Division or corps staff.
   (f) Service branch school staff and instructors.
   (g) HQDA or joint staff, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) staff, combatant commands staff.
   (h) JIIM organizations and commands.
   (i) RC support.
   (j) ACOM staff.
   (k) Battle Command Training Program observer/controller-trainer.
Note. Assignment opportunities for some Infantry lieutenant colonel positions will be limited to former battalion commanders.
   (3) Self-development. During this phase, self-assessment, off-duty civil schooling, and perfecting mentoring and
managerial skills are essential to the development of the Infantry officer. The officer should also continue to hone his
combined arms warfighting skills and his understanding of the joint operational environment. Continue to read books
from the CSA’s Professional Reading List for Field Grade Officers.
   (4) Desired experience. Command selection only includes a small percentage of the Infantry lieutenant colonel
population. Infantry lieutenant colonels not selected for battalion command continue to make significant contributions
at all levels of the Army and in JIIM assignments. Infantry lieutenant colonels can expect to serve in a wide variety of
professionally challenging and personally rewarding assignments in the operating and generating forces. Former
battalion commanders will be assigned to specific billets coded for former battalion commander and will be assigned
based on needs of the Army. All former battalion commander assignments are vetted through the Director, Officer
Personnel Management Directorate. Some examples of former battalion commander billets include division-level
officers under DCS, G–3/5/7, CTC task force senior observer/controller-trainer, Joint Staff, OSD, Army, corps, or
division staff, TRADOC duty, Infantry Branch chief in officer or enlisted assignments, USAREC duty, or 75th Ranger
Regiment CSL command.
   e. Colonel. The professional development objective for this phase is sustainment of warfighting, training, and staff
skills, along with utilization of leadership, organizational and executive talents. The majority of strategic level leaders
in the Army are colonels. Colonels are expected to be strategic and creative thinkers; builders of leaders and teams;
competent full spectrum warfighters; skilled in governance, statesmanship, and diplomacy. They must understand
cultural context and work effectively across it.
   (1) Education. Infantry colonels compete to attend a SSC. Attendance at the U.S. Army’s War College, or a Sister
Service’s SSC is only one methods to become MEL 1 qualified. Officers selected may volunteer to attend in an allied
nations SSC equivalent or gain constructive credit through an academic fellowship.
   (2) Assignments. Infantry colonels contribute to the Army by serving in crucial assignments in branch and combat
arms or branch immaterial positions. The critical task during this phase is to fully develop the broad skills and
competencies required of an agile and adaptive leader, while maintaining branch competency (warfighting skills).
Officers should make maximum use of their talents. Infantry officers will make full use of their operations and JIIM
experience, managerial skills and executive talents to meet the needs of the Army. The KD assignment for an Infantry
colonel is to serve in a CSL billet in a brigade, regimental or colonel-level garrison command. The normal command
tour is between 18–24 months. Garrison command tour lengths are 24 months but can be extended to 36 months.
Broadening positions for Infantry colonels include:
   (a) CTC operations group commander/chief of staff.
   (b) TRADOC capabilities manager.
   (c) Division or corps chief of staff.
   (d) Division, corps or field army assistant chief of staff, G–3/5/7.
   (e) Executive officer to a general officer.
   (f) Department director, U.S. Army Maneuver Center of Excellence.
   (g) HQDA or joint staff.
   (h) USMA brigade tactical officer
   (i) Senior ROTC program PMS
   (3) Self-development. Infantry colonels must maintain their branch skills and remain current on all changes that
affect the Soldiers they command and/or manage. JIIM assignments are important during this phase.
   (4) Desired experience. The primary goal at this stage is to fully use the experience and knowledge gained in a
position where the officer can provide significant contributions to the operating and generating force. The KD
assignment for an Infantry colonel is brigade-level command. No other position provides the Infantry officer the
60                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

opportunity to fully use his depth of experience in joint and combined arms warfare and to capitalize on his generating
force assignments in service to the Army. Only a limited number of Infantry officers will have the opportunity to
command. Those officers not selected for command will continue to provide exceptional service in developmental
assignments within the Army and in JIIM assignments. These officers also provide the critical bridge between the
operating and generating force, and serve as the advocate of commanders in staff positions at all echelons.
   f. Joint assignments. Infantry officers will be considered for joint duty assignment based on the needs of the Army,
professional development needs of the officer and availability of a joint assignment. Infantry officers and units will
continue to be called on to participate in joint operations around the world. Joint experience, developed through
sequential assignments, will provide the joint perspective on strategic operations to be successful now and in the future.
8–4. Assignment preferences
The professional development goal of Infantry Branch is to produce and sustain highly-qualified officers who are
tactically and operationally oriented to lead Soldiers and command units in combat and perform other assigned
missions. Assignments in combined arms organizations will be made to develop the officer’s overall ability to achieve
that goal. The officer’s assignments will be based on the needs of the Army, the officer’s professional development
needs and the officer’s preference. While Infantry Branch, HRC makes every effort to support individual officer’s
assignment preferences, the needs of the Army and the officer’s professional development needs must take priority.
8–5. Duration of critical officer life-cycle assignments
   a. Infantry Branch assignments. The Infantry Branch officer will serve in several KD and broadening positions as
they progress through their career in order to develop a joint and expeditionary mindset, tactical and technical expertise
in combined arms warfare, a firm grounding in Infantry operations, and knowledge of JIIM organizations. There is no
substitute in the Infantry Branch for service with troops in leadership positions. The goal of the Infantry officer PDM is
to provide the Infantry officer a series of leadership and operational staff positions, supplemented by opportunities to
round out their knowledge in generating force positions, in order to achieve success in positions of leadership at
successively higher levels. The primary positions that develop this level of expertise, in sequence, are platoon leader,
company commander, S3/XO, battalion command, and garrison/brigade/regimental command. The goal is to ensure
that every Infantry officer is given the opportunity to serve in each of these leadership assignments (based on their
individual manner of performance at each preceding level). While operational realities and the limited number of
positions will prevent the branch from providing every officer the opportunity to command at the battalion and brigade
level, the goal remains to provide every Infantry officer a variety of leadership, command, and developmental
assignments at each grade to develop and use their skills as combined arms warriors. Those officers who do not
command at the battalion level will continue to provide critical support to the Army.
   b. Infantry Branch life-cycle. Figure 8–1 shows how Infantry Branch time lines, military and additional training, KD
assignments, and self-development fit together to support the Infantry Branch goal of growing agile and adaptive
leaders.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             61

                                       Figure 8–1. AA Infantry officer development
8–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
   a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for all Infantry Branch officers. To do this, the field
grade inventory must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support
branch/FA generalist positions, and to provide majors with the opportunity to serve in KD assignment. The branch’s
goal is to afford every major 24 months S3/XO time.
   b. Officer Personnel Management System implementation. The number of authorized Infantry billets, by grade, will
vary as force structure decisions are made, and actions to implement them are taken. Officers who desire more
information on Infantry Branch authorizations or inventory, by grade, are encouraged to contact their HRC branch
assignment officer.
8–7. Officer life-cycle initiatives for Infantry
   a. Structure. The majority of assignment opportunities in the operating force will reside within the Armored,
Infantry, and Stryker BCTs. As an officer progresses in rank, there are significantly greater opportunities to serve
within the generating force.
   b. Acquire. Infantry officers are accessed through USMA, ROTC, and OCS. Officers are accessed into Infantry
based on proponent criteria, commissioning source selection processes, needs of the Army, and individual preference,.
Infantry is a recipient branch under the current system of branch detailing. Infantry receives officers from the other
operations, Force Sustainment, and operations support branches to fill lieutenant authorizations. Branch detailed
officers return to their basic branch upon their selection to captain and assignment to their branch transition course.
   c. Distribute. The goal of Infantry Branch is to provide a variety of assignments to Infantry officers that will
develop their skills, broaden their experience base and prepare them for higher levels of responsibility and service to
the Army. The priority is on developing a depth of experience in Infantry operations while concurrently developing a
depth of experience in JIIM organizations and combined arms warfare. They will also be provided the opportunity to
62                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

serve in generating force assignments in order to fully develop their knowledge of how the Army operates. Officers
may also rotate between CONUS and OCONUS assignments. Officers will have more time to gain the requisite skills
in their branch and their branch/FA generalist assignments. Infantry officers are rotated between assignments to ensure
they develop the full range of skills necessary to perform as senior leaders.
   d. Deploy. Infantry officers remain the Army’s principal warfighters. Whether assigned to the operating or generat-
ing force, all Infantry officers must be prepared to deploy on short notice anywhere in the world to lead Soldiers.
Infantry officers may deploy with their units or as individuals to deter potential adversaries, protect national interests,
or conduct humanitarian and peace keeping missions. Infantry Branch officers must prepare themselves and their
families for this most challenging life-cycle function.
   e. Sustain. Infantry combat skills are maintained through institutional training, assignments in the operational force,
and self-development.
   (1) Promotion. Field grade officers designated to remain in Infantry and in the Operations functional category will
compete for promotion only within this functional category. If an Infantry officer is designated to one of the two other
functional categories, he will no longer compete against Infantry officers for promotion.
   (2) Command. Infantry Branch commanders will continue to be centrally selected (CSL) for command at the
battalion and brigade level. These commands are organized into four command categories: operations, strategic support,
recruiting and training and installation. Recent changes require officers to compete for all categories and through an
additional process will be slated to units based on their skills and experience, their personal preference, their position
on the OML and Army requirements for that CSL cycle.
   (3) Officer evaluation report. The OER is the single most important tool for the management assignment, promo-
tion, selection, and slating of officers. Raters and senior raters must ensure they fairly and honestly articulate an
officers abilities, performance, and potential for service in increasingly complex and higher echelon organizations.
   f. Develop. Infantry officers are developed through a logical progression of operating and generating force assign-
ments. The focus of Infantry officer professional development is on the attainment and utilization of warfighting skills,
and the utilization of those skills to support the critical doctrine, organization, training, materiel systems, leader
development, personnel, and facility development missions of the branch. The goal is to professionally develop officers
to employ firepower and maneuver skills in support of combined arms, joint, and coalition unified land operations.
Development also occurs through the TASS; all officers selected for major should complete some form of ILE
education, and all officers selected for colonel should complete SSC.
   g. Separate. The Infantry Branch has no unique separation processes.
8–8. Infantry Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development.
   (1) RC Infantry officer development objectives and qualifications parallel those planned for their active duty
counterparts, with limited exceptions. The increase in advanced technology weaponry and the lethality of modern
weapon systems requires that RC officers train at the appropriate level. This is necessary in order to acquire those skills
required for commanding, training and managing RC organizations for peacetime operation, as well as mobilization.
The RC officer must realize that a large portion of his education and training will be accomplished on his own time, in
accordance with his unit duty assignments. A variety of correspondence courses are available as well as a full range of
schools that he may attend as a resident student. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation of Infantry tactical
and technical expertise through assignments in their branch before specializing in a specific area/skill.
   (2) The RC Infantry officer serves the same role and mission as his AA counterpart. The unique nature of his role as
a "citizen Soldier" will pose a challenge to his professional development program. However, RC officer professional
development is expected to mirror AA officer development patterns as closely as possible, except as noted below. The
two primary exceptions are: RC officers tend to spend more time in leadership positions and RC officers have
increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. Refer to chapter 7 for a detailed description of
RC officer career management and development.
   b. Branch development. Even though RC officer development is challenged by geographical considerations and time
constraints, each officer should strive for Infantry assignments and educational opportunities that yield the same
developmental opportunities as their AA counterparts.
   (1) Introduction. RC (ARNG and USAR) officers must also meet certain standards in terms of schooling and
operational assignments to be considered fully qualified in the Infantry Branch at each grade. Due to geographical, time
and civilian employment constraints, RC Infantry officers may find it difficult to serve in the operational assignments
required at each grade in order to remain fully qualified as an Infantry officer. Nevertheless, RC Infantry officers are
expected to complete the educational requirements discussed below and to aggressively seek out the operational
assignments to remain proficient in the branch.
   (2) Lieutenant. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop the
requisite Infantry Branch skills, knowledge, and abilities. The focus of the officer at this stage of his career is on
development of Infantry tactical and technical warfighting skills and the utilization of these skills in an operational
assignment.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                               63

   (a) Education. The BOLC and Infantry BOLC must be completed during this phase. Infantry BOLC provides the
Infantry lieutenant the basic skills necessary to function as an infantry platoon leader. RC Infantry lieutenants may
attend Ranger School, Infantry Mortar Leader Course, Airborne Course, or any number of unit specific functional
courses. In addition to the Lieutenant’s PME, all officers who have not earned a baccalaureate degree must complete
their mandatory civilian education requirements. Officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree from an accredited
college or university to qualify for promotion to captain.
   (b) Assignments. Officers should seek and be assigned to leadership positions in troop units whenever possible. The
critical assignment during this phase is serving as a rifle platoon leader in a BCT. The typical Infantry lieutenant will
be assigned as a rifle platoon leader or staff officer in an infantry battalion upon completion of the basic course. Other
typical assignments for lieutenants are battalion specialty platoon leader (recon, weapons, or mortar), company
executive officer, battalion liaison officer, S3 air or logistics officer (S4). An Infantry officer may also serve in a staff
position after promotion to captain, but prior to attendance at the Maneuver CCC (MC3).
   (c) Self-development. Self-development during this phase should focus on Infantry tactical fundamentals, troop-
leading procedures, leadership skills, organizational maintenance, resupply operations, basic administrative operations,
and other branch technical proficiency skills.
   (d) Desired experience. Each Infantry lieutenant must complete all BOLC phases, successfully serve in an operating
force platoon leader assignment, then supplement his technical and tactical abilities through assignment to a specialty
platoon or staff position. The goal is to develop lieutenants with an understanding of Infantry maneuver tactics at the
platoon level.
   (3) Reserve Component captain.
   (a) Formal training. Mandatory education during this phase is completion of the MC3 which is a prerequisite for
promotion to major. MC3 can be completed through attendance at the resident course or the RC course (MC3–DL) that
has a DL phase and a 2-week resident phase.
   (b) Assignments. Assignments in a company, battalion, or brigade organization should follow a progressive order.
The command of a unit is the essence of leadership development at this stage of an officer’s career. Units fill company
command positions with officers who have demonstrated the potential for and the desire to command Soldiers. Most
command tours are 36 months long with the tour length set by the higher commander and should be preceded by
attendance at the company-level PCC. The number of company command positions may not afford every officer to
have the opportunity to command at the captain level. Command can be of traditional MTOE line units or TDA units.
Some officers may receive more than one command opportunity, but those cases are rare. Battalion staff experience is
also desired during this period, but the focus should be to command a unit.
   (c) Typical duty assignments. Officers should aggressively seek Infantry company command. Following successful
company command, officers can be assigned to similar types of non-troop assignments as AA officers. In addition, they
may participate in the IMA and AGR Programs.
   (d) Functional area training. The RC officers are awarded a FA based upon the needs of the Army, the officer’s
geographic location, individual experience, education, and training. FA assignments offer the Infantry officer flexibility
and the opportunity for additional assignments in both the ARNG and USAR. Officers who received a FA designation
while on active duty may continue to serve in that FA or may request award of a different FA based upon the
availability of such assignments and the needs of the Army. FA designators are awarded at the officer’s request once
all prerequisites for award of the FA have been met.
   (4) Reserve Component major. Promotion to major normally occurs between the 12th and 14th year of commis-
sioned service. Promotion prior to consideration by the Department of the Army mandatory promotion board (position
vacancy promotion) is possible. Selection for major is based on performance and potential for further service in
positions of greater responsibility. These qualities are measured by the officer’s assignment history, level of branch
development achieved, and the relative standing of the officer to his peers as indicated in the OER.
   (a) Formal training. Officers should complete ILE but must complete ILE Common Core to be promoted to
lieutenant colonel. Officers can complete the requirements for ILE in numerous ways: Command and General Staff
College (resident or nonresident), sister Service resident Command and General Staff College or Associate Logistics
Executive Development Course.
   (b) Assignments. The KD assignment during this phase is service as a battalion S3 or XO, or brigade S3. An
Infantry major should serve for a minimum of 24 months in an S3/XO position. There is no substitute for time spent as
an S3/XO in preparing the Infantry major for battalion command and for expanding his knowledge of combined arms
maneuver warfare. Developmental assignments on brigade/division staffs (non-S3/XO positions), Joint Forces Head-
quarters (JFHQ); USARCs; general officer commands (GOCOMs); or major USAR Command staff positions is also
desired to develop the officer for positions of greater responsibility. Duty in progressively challenging assignments is
an essential ingredient in the career development of officers prior to promotion to lieutenant colonel. Officers may
participate in the AGR Program. The IRR and IMA programs for majors offer many unique opportunities for training
and development. The IMA program provides the Infantry officer an opportunity to train in the position he will occupy
upon mobilization.
   (5) Reserve Component lieutenant colonel. The promotion board considers the RC major for promotion to lieutenant
64                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

colonel at the 16th year of commissioned service. Promotion prior to consideration by the Department of the Army
mandatory promotion board (below the zone promotion) is possible. Duty in progressively challenging assignments is
an essential ingredient in the career development of officers and subsequent promotion to lieutenant colonel.
   (a) Formal training. The RC lieutenant colonel must complete ILE Common Core prior to promotion to colonel.
Selectees for battalion command attend the appropriate branch-specific Infantry PCC. Qualified Infantry lieutenant
colonels may apply for the U.S. Army War College or other SSCs (resident or correspondence).
   (b) Assignments. The KD assignment for lieutenant colonels is as a battalion/squadron commander of an MTOE or
TDA unit for 36 months (plus or minus 12 months). While every Infantry officer will not command at the battalion
level, the goal of Infantry officer professional development is to provide every Infantry officer the assignments,
institutional training, and experience to prepare the officer for command at this level. The Infantry officers selected for
command will remain competitive for promotion to colonel and brigade command. Developmental assignments
include: brigade deputy commanding officer (DCO)/XO; division primary staff; various JFHQ, USARC, GOCOM; or
major USAR Command staff positions. Colonels may also participate in the AGR, IRR, or IMA programs.
   (6) Reserve Component colonel.
   (a) Formal training. Although no mandatory education requirements (other than PCC for command selectees) exist
during this phase, officers are encouraged to complete SSC (resident or nonresident).
   (b) Assignments. The KD assignment for an RC colonel is brigade/regiment command for 36 months (plus or minus
12 months). Broadening assignments include AGR program participation and various senior duty positions at the
division, JFHQ, RSC, GOCOM, major USAR Command levels, and HQDA and joint staff assignments.
   c. Life-cycle development model. The RC life-cycle development model for Infantry officers is shown at figure 8–2.
                                         Figure 8–2. RC Infantry officer development
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              65

Chapter 9
Armor Branch
9–1. Unique features of Armor Branch
   a. Unique purpose of Armor Branch. The Armor Branch is a command centric branch that prepares officers to
command combined arms formations across the full spectrum of military operations. The Armor Branch serves two
primary functions in support of unified land operations: firstly, to provide combined arms formations the capability to
close with and destroy the enemy using fire, maneuver, and shock effect; secondly, to provide cavalry and scout
formations the capabilities to perform reconnaissance and security during combined arms maneuver and wide area
security operations.
   b. The way ahead. The Army’s continual change, limited resources, and lessons learned from more than a decade of
war continually impact how the Armor Branch trains, assigns and develops officers. The Armor Branch develops agile
and adaptive experts in branch competencies, who are multi-skilled leaders that readily operate in a JIIM environment.
Armor officers are assigned based on the needs of the Army in accordance with the HQDA manning guidance, the
professional development needs of the officer and the officer’s preference. While HRC makes every effort to
synchronize the three priorities, the needs of the Army and the professional development needs of the officer take
precedence over individual preference.
   c. Unique functions performed by Armor Branch. Armor officers initially focus on development of the core technical
and tactical Armor mobile protected firepower and reconnaissance and security skills. Following initial focus on skills
development, Armor officers continually deepen their core skills while developing broader skills in combined arms
maneuver, wide area security in support of unified land operations as they progress through their careers. Armor
officers fulfill their mission through: the application of mission command and synchronization and integration of
warfighting functions; providing expertise on the employment of combined arms forces at all command levels; and
developing doctrine, organizations, training, materiel and leaders necessary to support the mission.
   d. Unique features of work in Armor Branch. The Armor Branch currently has one AOC and eight SIs. Detailed
descriptions of the AOC and SIs listed below can be found in DA Pam 611–21.
   (1) Armor officer, general (19A). These officers will receive technical and tactical institutional Armor School and
Maneuver Center of Excellence training. Training is focused on the core competencies associated with mobile protected
firepower, reconnaissance and security to successfully lead and employ mounted and dismounted formations in
combined arms maneuver and wide area security.
   (2) SIs associated with Armor AOCs:
   (a) M1A2 Abrams Tank (3J).
   (b) M2 BIFV/M3 CFV/M7 Bradley fire integration support team leader (3X).
   (c) Stryker Leader Course (R4).
   (d) Army Reconnaissance Course (R7).
   (e) Ranger/Ranger-Parachutist (5R/5S).
   (f) Airborne (5P).
   (g) Air Assault (2B).
   (h) Pathfinder (5Q).
   e. Branch detail. Armor Branch participates in the branch detailing of officers into Armor at the grade of lieutenant.
Officers detailed Armor will lose their Armor designation once they reach their branch detail expiration date and have
been re-assigned into their basic branch.
   f. Voluntary Transfer Incentive Program. The VTIP program replaces the functional designation board. This
program allows officers to transfer into another branch or FA from their 4th year of active Federal service through their
15th year. This program also allows officers who are branch detailed into another branch to request to remain in
Armor. The VTIP panel meets quarterly. Submission of a VTIP packet does not guarantee branch transfer.
   g. Branch eligibility. Officers of other branches who desire a branch transfer to Armor should submit a request in
accordance with AR 614–100 DA Pam 611–21; and VTIP MILPER messages.
9–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Competencies. Armor officers are valued for their skills as leaders, trainers, and planners. Skills are acquired and
perfected through realistic training, PME, self-study and service in the most demanding positions. Armor Branch values
assignments in both the operational force and generating force. Armor officers are effective leaders that possess
competence, confidence, social, and cultural awareness, and effective oral and written communications skills to
cultivate trust, teamwork and commitment, all oriented towards mission accomplishment. The goal of the branch is to
provide each officer with a series of leadership, staff and functional assignments, institutional training, broadening and

self-development opportunities to develop combined arms warriors with well-rounded backgrounds and the ability to
successfully operate in the JIIM environment.
   b. Unique skills. Armor officers should display consistent outstanding performance across a wide variety of opera-
tional and generating force assignments. Armor officers demonstrate excellence in their warfighting skills, technical
and tactical proficiency, a well developed understanding of joint and combined arms warfare, a superior ability to
integrate a wide variety of lethal and non lethal assets to support the mission, and the ability to lead, train, motivate,
and care for Soldiers. Armor officers maintain a high-level of resilience to retain the ability to lead and operate across a
myriad of organizations.
9–3. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for Armor
   a. Structure. The primary operational assignments for Armor officers include combined arms battalions and cavalry
squadrons across all three types of BCTs. Armor officers may also serve in critical developmental assignments in
generating force organizations.
   b. Acquire. Armor officers are accessed through USMA, ROTC, and OCS. Officers are accessed into Armor based
on their branch preference, assessment of their talents, and the needs of the Army. Armor is a recipient branch under
the current system of branch detailing. Armor receives detail officers from the combat support and service support arms
to fill lieutenant authorizations.
   c. Distribute. The goal of Armor Branch is to provide every Armor officer a variety of leadership, staff, functional
and broadening assignments at each grade to develop and employ their skills as combined arms leaders. The priority is
on developing a depth of experience in Armor and Cavalry operations while concurrently developing a depth and
breadth of experience in JIIM organizations, combined arms maneuver and wide area security. Officers may also have
the opportunity to serve in key generating force assignments to develop their knowledge of how the Army operates.
Officers will have opportunities to serve in key staff, functional and broadening assignments to further develop their
warfighting skills and provide value to the Army. Officers may also rotate between CONUS and OCONUS assign-
ments. Armor officer assignments are managed with a goal to develop the full range of skills necessary to perform as
senior leaders.
   d. Deploy. Armor Branch officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to operational force units with high levels of readiness or fixed-site
generating force organizations, all Armor officers remain deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of
conflict. Armor officers may deploy with units at any time to deter potential adversaries and to protect national
interests, or as individuals to support joint and multinational operations. Armor officers prepare themselves and their
families for this most challenging and rewarding expeditionary mindset.
   e. Sustain. Armor combat skills develop through institutional training, experience in assignments, self-development,
and personal and professional commitment to resilience (physical, social, family, spiritual, and emotional).
   (1) Promotion. Armor Branch field grade officers designated to remain in Armor and the Operations functional
category will compete for promotion only within their functional category. If an Armor officer is designated to one of
the two other functional categories, the officer no longer competes with Armor officers for promotion.
   (2) Officer evaluation report. The OER requires the rater and senior rater to recommend a functional category for all
ACC captains through lieutenant colonels. When recommending functional categories for rated officers, rating officials
will consider the whole person with factors such as: demonstrated performance, educational background, technical or
unique expertise, military experience or training, and the personal preference of the officer. Functional category
recommendations of raters and senior raters on the OER will be an important factor taken into consideration during the
functional category designation process.
   f. Develop. Armor officers are developed through a progression of operational and generating force assignments,
broadening assignments, institutional training, and self-development. The focus of Armor officer professional develop-
ment is on the growth and utilization of warfighting skills. Armor officer development seeks to prepare officers for
ever-increasing command and staff responsibilities at higher levels to successfully lead organizations to mission
success. These skills support the critical doctrine, organization, training, material, leader development, personnel, and
facility solutions for branch Force Management.
   g. Separate. Armor Branch has no unique separation processes. All current and former Armor force Soldiers are
strongly encouraged to remain involved with the development of the branch. This involvement increases participation
in professional associations and through editorial contributions to Army official journals and online forums. Current
online sources include: the Armor School website (https://www.benning.army.mil/armor), the Maneuver Net Forum
(https://forums.army.mil), and the Office of the Chief of Armor (https://www.benning.army.mil/armor/ocoa).
9–4. Officer developmental assignments
   a. Lieutenant. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop requisite
baseline Armor Branch skills, knowledge and attributes. The focus of the Armor lieutenant is on the development of
Armor and cavalry tactical and technical warfighting skills and the utilization of these skills in an operational
assignment as a tank, MGS, or scout platoon leader.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                               67

   (1) Education. Armor BOLC provides the Armor lieutenant the baseline skills necessary to function as a tank and
scout platoon leader. Armor lieutenants receive assignment oriented training following Armor BOLC to prepare them
for their specific assignments as tank, MGS, or scout platoon leaders. These courses include, but are not limited to:
Army Reconnaissance Course, Airborne, Air Assault, Ranger, Infantry Mortar Leader Course, Bradley Leader Course,
and Stryker Leader Course. Army Reconnaissance Course is required for all Armor lieutenants. Assignment oriented
training will be synchronized to minimize the delay between courses and get the lieutenant to the unit of assignment in
the shortest time possible. The requisite assignment oriented training for the Armor lieutenant based on the officer’s
initial assignment is:
   (a) Armored brigade combat team. The officer attends the Army Reconnaissance Course and is strongly encouraged
to attend Ranger School. The officer will attend other functional training based on availability and the needs of the
unit. If the dates for Army Reconnaissance Course and any other functional training conflict, Army Reconnaissance
Course is the priority.
   (b) Infantry brigade combat team. The officer will attend Army Reconnaissance Course. The officer is also required
to attend Ranger School. If the dates for Army Reconnaissance Course and any other functional training conflict, Army
Reconnaissance Course is the priority. Armor officers assigned to an Infantry brigade combat team (IBCT) Airborne
brigade will also attend Airborne School enroute to their assignment.
   (c) Stryker brigade combat team. The officer will attend Army Reconnaissance Course and is strongly encouraged to
attend Ranger School. The officer will attend the Stryker Leader Course. The officer may also attend other functional
training courses based upon availability and the needs of the unit. If the dates for Army Reconnaissance Course and
any other functional training conflict, Army Reconnaissance Course is the priority.
   (2) Assignments. The KD assignment during this phase is serving in an operational force operational unit as a tank,
MGS, or scout platoon leader.
   (a) Armor lieutenants should be assigned as platoon leaders or staff officers in a Cavalry squadron or combined
arms battalion upon completion of Armor BOLC and requisite functional training. The goal of the branch is to assign
lieutenants to the operational force as an initial assignment.
   (b) A limited number of Armor lieutenants will serve as TRADOC training company executive officers or staff
officers for up to 12 months followed by assignment to the operational force. Armor lieutenants that have completed a
minimum of 24 months in an operational force unit may be assigned as a TRADOC training company executive officer
or staff officer.
   (c) Other typical assignments for lieutenants are battalion or squadron specialty platoon leader (scout or mortar),
company or troop executive officer, /battalion/squadron or IMCOM staff officer. An Armor officer may also serve in a
staff position after promotion to captain, prior to attendance at the MC3.
   (3) Self-development. Self-development during this phase focuses on Maneuver Leader Development Strategy
(MLDS) tactical fundamentals, technical proficiency, troop-leading procedures, leadership skills, gunnery, organiza-
tional maintenance, resupply operations, basic administrative operations, and resiliency and other technical proficiency
skills. Armor lieutenants are responsible to take the initiative to gain knowledge and experience to prepare themselves
to be a captain. Self-improvement and development is gained by observing different activities of both officers and
NCOs at the battalion and brigade levels, mentorship, gaining experience in duty positions following a tank, scout and/
or MGS platoon leader duties, and a well developed self-study program. Additional information can be found at the
following address: http://www.benning.army.mil/mssp/.
   (4) Desired experience. Each Armor lieutenant must successfully serve in an operational force tank or scout platoon
leader assignment. Ideally, the officer’s technical and tactical abilities will be augmented through assignment to a
specialty platoon, company/troop executive officer, or battalion/squadron staff officer position. The goal is to serve a
minimum of 12 months in a platoon leader position to develop lieutenants with expertise in mounted and dismounted
maneuver. A limited number of Armor lieutenants will also serve in generating force assignments prior to attending
MC3.
   b. Captain. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop officers as a
company/troop commander and staff officer in an operational unit. They may also professionally develop through
successfully completing one or more command/staff assignments in the generating force.
   (1) Education. Completion of MC3 or a branch CCC is mandatory during this period. Some Armor officers will
attend other branch CCCs or the Marine Corps Expeditionary Warfare School.
   (2) Assignments. The KD assignment during this phase is company/troop command in either the operational or
generating Army. Service as a primary or assistant staff officer is also desirable. Armor officers may serve on
operational or generating force unit staffs at the brigade/regiment and battalion/squadron level prior to and/or following
command.
   (a) Most Armor officers will be assigned to a BCT immediately following completion of the CCC. Armor captains
will attend the Cavalry Leader Course. All Armor captains assigned to IBCTs will attend the Ranger Course. All
captains assigned to SBCTs will attend the Stryker Leader Course and are encouraged to attend the Ranger Course. All
captains assigned to armored BCTs are encouraged to attend the Ranger Course. Select Armor captains will serve their
company command and staff assignments initially in a generating force organization, with a follow-on assignment to an
68                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

operational force assignment to compete for company command. Armor Branch assigns a limited number of Armor
captains to a generating force command following an operational force assignment.
   (b) Upon completion of company command and the MC3 or equivalent CCC, multiple broadening assignments are
possible. The purpose of these assignments is to meet critical Army requirements, further develop the officer’s
knowledge base and provide the officer a more well-rounded professional experience. Armor captains should serve in a
broadening assignment following company command. The Armor Branch goal is to grow an inventory of officers who
are tactically and technically proficient and have expanded their professional skills. Examples of assignments are:
   1. AC/RC training support brigade trainer and staff.
   2. Army sponsored broadening opportunities fellowships and scholarships (refer to AR 627–1 for a complete
listing).
   3. CTC observer combat trainer.
   4. Project Warrior.
   5. Doctrine developer.
   6. ROTC Assistant Professor of Military Science.
   7. Maneuver Center of Excellence or other Center of Excellence small group instructor.
   8. Battalion/brigade staff.
   9. Training developer.
   10. U.S. Army recruiting company command and staff.
   11. USMA service school faculty and staff.
   12. Warrior transition unit commander.
   13. Aide-de-camp and nominative positions.
   14. Other combat arms or branch generalist positions.
   (3) Self-development. During this phase, Armor officers will advance their leadership, tactical and technical skills,
develop a mastery of training management, resiliency, and concentrate on those critical tasks required to accomplish
their wartime mission. The officer will develop a more thorough understanding of combined arms operations in a joint
environment. Armor captains should initiate/complete a master’s degree. Additional information can be found at the
following address: http://www.benning.army.mil/mssp/
   (4) Desired experience. The KD assignment for an Armor captain is successful service as a company/troop
commander in a 19A, or 02B coded position. There is no substitute for operational company/troop command for
developing an Armor officer’s leadership and tactical skills, and preparing the officer for future leadership assignments
at successively higher levels of responsibility. To be KD complete, Armor captains must serve 18 months (+/- 6
months) company command time; ultimately, the priority for command is the quality of the the officer’s performance
over time. Armor captains may expand their tactical and technical capabilities through assignment as a battalion/
squadron or brigade/regiment staff officer prior to assuming command. Armor captains may serve as company
commanders in non-traditional commands in order to meet Army requirements in addition to operational command,
and may serve in these positions prior to or after operational command.
   c. Majors. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to expand the officer’s
maneuver tactical and technical experience and continue development as a leader with a comprehensive understanding
of combined arms warfare in a joint and expeditionary environment. Through a series of operational and generating
force assignments, the Armor major increases contributions to the larger Army and gains greater understanding of how
the Army operates.
   (1) Education. Military education required during this phase is completion of ILE through completion of the
Command and General Staff College or sister Service equivalent in residence or through distance learning. ILE is
divided into two phases. Phase 1 is a 14-week common core training block of instruction. Phase 2 is the Advanced
Operations Course which is the field grade credentialing course that is required for all Armor officers. In addition to
Army and sister Service ILE programs, officers can also compete for foreign and interagency fellowship positions,
which also meet the MEL 4 requirement. Officers may also compete for selection to the SAMS following the
Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course. Officers may also choose to compete for a seat in SAMS. SAMS
officers will serve a utilization tour as a corps or division plans/assistant G3 staff officer. Armor majors will attend the
Cavalry elective at ILE.
   (2) Assignments. KD assignments during this phase are:
   (a) Operational force battalion/squadron S3/XO.
   (b) Operational force brigade/regiment S3.
   (c) Generating force battalion/squadron S3/XO.
   (d) Generating force brigade S3.
   (e) Security force assistance assignments (along with additional operational force S3/XO time). Security force
assistance assignments are vital to the success of the Army during global contingency operations. Armor majors will
serve in these assignments. This experience, when combined with time spent as an operational force S3/XO, provides
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                               69

the Armor major the skills to prepare the officer for future operating and generating force assignments with increasing
responsibility and for battalion command.
   (f) Division chief of plans (SAMS Utilization). The division chief of plans position is considered a KD experience
for the SAMS graduate Armor officer when served in conjunction with at least 12 months service in a battalion/
squadron or brigade/regimental S3 position. Experience at the brigade/regimental level and below remain absolutely
essential to the professional growth of the Armor officer and necessary for success at future levels of command.
   (g) There is no substitute for KD time in preparing an Armor officer for future command and for building maneuver
and combined arms skills. The Armor major may further expand tactical and technical skills by serving in staff
assignments at division level and higher.
   (3) Broadening assignments. Armor majors will also meet the Army’s mission requirements and build on their
institutional skills through varied generating force, joint, interagency, intergovernmental and multinational (JIIM)
assignments. Examples of Armor major assignments beyond KD positions are provided below:
   (a) AC/RC S3/XO.
   (b) Advisor positions for foreign schools.
   (c) HQDA and ACOM staff.
   (d) Army sponsored broadening opportunities fellowships and scholarships (refer to AR 627–1 for a complete
listing).
   (e) Brigade, division or corps staff.
   (f) Combat developer.
   (g) CTC observer combat trainer.
   (h) HQDA staff officer.
   (i) Doctrine developer.
   (j) Joint staff officer.
   (k) Multinational and coalition trainer and staff officer.
   (l) ROTC Assistant Professor of Military Science.
   (m) Service school instructor, staff, and faculty.
   (n) Training developer.
   (o) USMA faculty and staff.
   (p) Advanced civil schooling.
   (q) Nominative positions.
   (4) Self-development. Armor majors are expected to continue self-development efforts to include off-duty schooling.
Majors continue to build intellectual capacity, strategic perspective, develop operational skills, and improve resiliency
conditioning. Armor majors will develop and use a diverse set of skills as they move between combined arms
leadership positions in the operational force and generating force organizations as well as functional Armor, branch
immaterial and JIIM assignments. Additional information can be found at the following address: http://www.benning.
army.mil/mssp/.
   (5) Desired experience. At this stage of the officer’s career, the Armor major hones skills in the planning and
execution of combined arms/joint warfare and develops expertise in the JIIM operational environment. While the goal
is to provide every Armor major a minimum of 18 months combined time in the KD positions, the quality of
performance in the assignment, rather than time spent in the assignment, is the critical factor.
   (6) Additional factors.
   (a) The goal of the branch is to develop field grade officers who embody a collective knowledge of JIIM
experience. While not every officer will receive an assignment in a qualifying joint assignment or serve in a fellowship
in a JIIM agency, the goal is to provide the maximum opportunity for Armor majors to receive this opportunity.
   (b) Armor majors may be credited for joint service either through assignment to a qualifying joint duty assignment
list (Joint duty assignment list) position or through the point system based on qualifying joint service via the Joint
Qualification System. The objective of the Joint Qualification System is to ensure a systematic, progressive, career-long
development of officers in joint matters and to ensure that officers have the requisite experience and education to be
highly proficient in joint matters, as directed in 10 USC, Chapter 38. Joint Qualification System allows officers to
apply for joint credit based on experience in positions in the Contemporary Operating Environment.
   d. Lieutenant colonel. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is demonstrated
excellence in tactical skills, technical proficiency and the ability to lead, train, motivate and care for Soldiers in both
the command and staff environments. An Armor officer’s opportunity to serve in the operational force will decrease as
the officer increases in rank and the percentage of generating force positions increases. The officer’s previous
assignments, institutional training, and self-development prepare the officer for role in the generating force positions of
increasing responsibility.
   (1) Education. Lieutenant colonels selected for command will complete a PCC, phases I, II, and III prior to
command. Lieutenant colonels may be selected for SSC. Lieutenant colonels not selected for resident attendance must
complete SSC by correspondence to achieve MEL 1.
70                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (2) Assignments. Lieutenant colonels in Armor seek assignments of greater responsibility in branch and branch
immaterial positions. Lieutenant colonel assignments allow the potential for greater contribution to the branch and the
entire Army. This important phase of an Armor officer’s career provides for assignments that further develop joint
combined arms skill sets and improved warfighting skills. The most critical assignment for Armor lieutenant colonels
in the Operations functional category is battalion/squadron level command. Armor lieutenant colonels selected for
command will normally serve 18 to 24 months in command at battalion level. Armor officers are selected for command
selection list commands in four major command categories: operations, strategic support, recruiting and training, and
installation. All battalion-level commands are opt-in boards, and officers will compete for all command categories.
Examples of duty assignments for lieutenant colonels are listed below. Note that assignment opportunities for some
Armor lieutenant colonel positions are limited to former battalion commanders.
   (a) Instructor at ILE.
   (b) Nominative positions.
   (c) Brigade DCO.
   (d) CTC observer combat trainer.
   (e) Division G3.
   (f) Corps staff.
   (g) HQDA or joint staff, NATO staff, combatant command staff.
   (h) AC/RC CDR/observer/controller/staff.
   (i) ROTC PMS.
   (j) Maneuver Center of Excellence staff (doctrine, capabilities).
   (k) Service branch school staff and instructors.
   (3) Self-development. During this phase of an Armor officer’s career, self-development takes the form of self-
assessment, off-duty civil schooling, perfecting mentoring and managerial skills and sustaining resiliency. The officer
continues to hone combined arms warfighting skills and the understanding of the joint operational environment.
Additional information can be found at the following address: http://www.benning.army.mil/mssp/.
   (4) Desired experience. The goal of Armor officer development is to prepare every officer for command of a
combined arms battalion, cavalry squadron, generating force training battalion, or other institutional command at the
lieutenant colonel level. While not every officer will command, Armor lieutenant colonels provide exceptional
contributions to the Army outside of command. The focus remains the development of officers imbued with technical
and tactical knowledge of the joint, combined arms, maneuver warfare. The critical assignment for an Armor lieutenant
colonel is command.
   e. Colonel. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is improvement of warfight-
ing, training, and staff skills, along with leadership, managerial and executive talents. Colonels are expected to be
multi-skilled leaders: strategic and innovative thinkers; builders of leaders and teams; competent warfighters; skilled in
governance, statesmanship, and diplomacy; and able to understand and operate within a cultural context.
   (1) Education. Historically, the majority of officers selected for promotion to colonel are selected to attend SSC.
Colonels not selected for resident attendance must complete SSC by correspondence to achieve MEL 1.
   (2) Assignments. Armor colonels contribute to the Army by serving in crucial assignments in both branch and
branch immaterial positions. The critical task during this phase is to fully develop the broad skills and competencies
required of a multi-skilled leader, while maintaining and improving branch/maneuver competency (warfighting skills).
Armor colonels will make full use of their broad operations and JIIM experiences, managerial skills and executive
talents to meet the needs of the Army. A critical assignment for an Armor colonel is selection for command. Armor
officers selected for brigade-level command will serve in the same four command CSL categories as lieutenant
colonels. Critical assignments for colonels include:
   (a) Brigade, regiment, or garrison command.
   (b) CTC operations group commander.
   (c) Combat trainer/leader developer.
   (d) Department director, Maneuver Center of Excellence.
   (e) Division chief of staff.
   (f) Division or corps G–3.
   (g) Executive officer to a general officer.
   (h) HQDA or joint staff.
   (i) TRADOC capabilities manager.
   (3) Self-development. Armor colonels maintain their branch skills and keep current on all changes that affect the
Soldiers they command and/or manage. JIIM assignments are important during this phase.
   (4) Desired experience. The primary goal at this stage is to exploit the significant breadth and depth of experiences
and knowledge gained in a position where the officer can provide a significant contribution to the operational and
generating force. The critical assignment for an Armor colonel is brigade-level command. No other position provides
the Armor officer with the opportunity to fully use depth of experience in joint and combined arms warfare and to
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              71

capitalize on functional generating force assignments in service to the Army. However, only a limited number of
Armor officers will have the opportunity to command. Those officers not selected for command will continue to
provide exceptional service in Army and JIIM assignments of increasing responsibility. These officers also provide the
critical bridge between the operational and generating force, and serve commanders in key staff elements.
   f. Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational assignments. The development of Armor officers will
also focus on the development of agile, adaptive, and multi-skilled leaders who collectively embody knowledge of JIIM
organizations. Armor officers will be considered for a billet on the Joint duty assignment list based on the needs of the
Army, professional development needs of the officer and availability of a joint assignment. JIIM experience, developed
through sequential assignments, provides the broad perspective necessary to be successful now and in the future.
9–5. Assignment preferences and precedence.
The professional development goal of Armor Branch is to produce and sustain highly-qualified officers who are
tactically and operationally oriented to lead Soldiers, command units in combat and perform other assigned missions.
Assignments in combined arms organizations develop the officer’s overall ability to achieve that goal. The officer’s
assignments are based on the needs of the Army, the officer’s professional development needs and the officer’s
preference. While the senior leader development office makes every effort to support individual officer’s assignment
preferences, the needs of the Army and the officer’s professional development needs are the priority.
9–6. Duration of officer life-cycle assignments
   a. Key developmental Armor Branch positions. The Armor Branch officer will serve in several KD positions as they
progress through their career in order to develop a joint and expeditionary mindset, tactical and technical expertise in
combined arms warfare, a firm grounding in Armor and Cavalry operations, and knowledge of JIIM organizations.
There is no substitute in the Armor Branch for service with troops in key leadership positions. The goal of the Armor
officer PDM is to provide the Armor officer a series of operational staff and leadership positions, supplemented by
opportunities to augment their knowledge in key generating force positions, in order to achieve success in positions of
leadership at successively higher levels. The primary positions that develop this level of expertise, in sequence, are
platoon leader, company/troop commander, S3/XO. The goal is to ensure that every Armor officer is given the
opportunity to serve in each of these key leadership assignments. While operational realities and the limited number of
positions will prevent the branch from providing every officer the opportunity to command at the battalion and brigade
level, the goal remains to prepare every Armor officer for command. Those officers who do not command at the
battalion level will continue to provide critical support to the Army in key positions. Their role will remain to ensure
that generating force organizations continue to maintain focus on their critical role in supporting the warfight. Armor
officers, experts in combined arms maneuver and wide area security, serve as the critical link between the operational
and generating force.
   b. Armor Branch life-cycle. The Armor Branch developmental goals directly support the goal of the Army with joint
and expeditionary capabilities. Figure 9–1 shows how Armor Branch timelines, military and additional training, KD
assignments and self-development fit together to support the Armor Branch goal of growing future combined arms
warriors.

                                        Figure 9–1. AA Armor officer development
9–7. Requirements, authorizations and inventory
   a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for all Armor Branch officers. To do this the Armor
officer assessment will be optimized to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support branch/
FA generalist positions.
   b. Officer Personnel Management System implementation. The number of authorized Armor billets, by grade, will
vary as force structure decisions are made, and actions to implement them are taken. Officers who desire more
information on Armor Branch authorizations or inventory, by grade, are encouraged to contact their HRC assignment
officer.
9–8. Armor Army National Guard officers
ARNG Armor officer career development objectives and qualifications parallel those of their AC counterparts. The two
primary exceptions are: ARNG officers tend to spend more time in key leadership positions, and ARNG officers have
increased windows to complete primary military educational requirements. A balance of realistic training, PME, self-
development, and operational experience is necessary to develop those skills required for commanding, training and
managing ARNG organizations for peacetime and deployment operations. The ARNG officer must realize that a
portion of the officer’s education and training will be accomplished during personal time. Refer to chapter 7 for a
detailed description of ARNG officer career management and development.
   a. Lieutenant. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop the requisite
Armor Branch skills, knowledge and attributes. The focus is on development of Armor and Cavalry tactical and
technical warfighting skills and the utilization of these skills in an operational assignment.
   (1) Education. PME during this phase is completion of the resident BOLC, which should be completed within 12
months (no later than 18 months) of commissioning and is a prerequisite for promotion to first lieutenant. BOLC
provides the Armor lieutenant the basic skills necessary to function as a tank platoon leader and an overview of
                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                               73

Cavalry tactics and techniques. Prior to assignment to a Cavalry platoon, the Armor lieutenant is strongly encouraged
to attend the Army Reconnaissance Course. In addition, the Armor lieutenant may attend Ranger School, Infantry
Mortar Leader Course, Bradley Leader Course, MGS Leader Course, Stryker Leader Course, Reconnaissance and
Surveillance Leaders Course, Airborne, Air Assault and Pathfinder. Additional training following BOLC is primarily
dependent on the lieutenant’s unit of assignment. Officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree from an accredited
college or university prior to consideration for promotion to captain.
   (2) Assignments. Key development during this critical phase of the officer’s career is assignment as a tank or scout
platoon leader. Every attempt should be made to assign junior officers as platoon leaders. This duty provides the officer
an understanding of operations and leadership that will build a solid foundation for future service and duties of
increased responsibility. After completing a platoon leader assignment, Armor officers should seek a variety of
broadening assignments, which will enhance their future performance and prepare them for company command.
Broadening assignments for lieutenants include battalion or squadron specialty platoon leader (support, scout, or
mortar), company or troop executive officer, and battalion or squadron liaison officer.
   (3) Self-development. Self-development during this phase should focus on tactical fundamentals, troop-leading
procedures, leadership skills, gunnery, organizational maintenance, resupply operations, basic administrative operations,
physical conditioning, and other branch technical proficiency skills. After serving as a tank, scout and/or MGS platoon
leader Armor lieutenants can gain experience by serving in other duty positions. Armor lieutenants must take initiative
to gain knowledge and experience for the next level of assignments and responsibilities as a captain. Self-improvement
and development can also be achieved by seeking mentors and participating in different activities with both officers
and NCOs at the company, battalion, and brigade levels. The Maneuver Self Study Program provides additional
resources for self-development. The Maneuver Self Study Program can be found at the following address (http://www.
benning.army.mil/mssp/).
   b. Captain.
   (1) Education. PME during this phase is completion of the MC3, which prepares the captain for company command
and battalion and brigade staff assignments. MC3 can be completed through attendance at the six-month resident
course or the RC (RC) course (MC3–RC), which has three distributed learning phases and two 2-week resident phases.
Prior to assignment to a Cavalry troop captains are strongly encouraged to attend the Cavalry Leaders Course. Officers
must obtain a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university to qualify for promotion to captain.
   (2) Assignments. Assignments in a company, battalion, or brigade organization should follow a progressive order
whenever possible. The command of a company or troop is key leadership development at this stage of an officer’s
career. The goal is for each captain to serve a minimum of 36 months company/troop command time (plus or minus 12
months); however, the quality of the officer’s performance is more important than the length of time in command. An
Armor officer may also command a mechanized infantry or rifle company, depending on various factors including
availability, geographic proximity, and leadership preference. The limited number of company command positions may
not afford every officer the opportunity to command an MTOE company or troop. Captains may command a TDA
company, but the preference is command of an MTOE company which better develops the captain’s tactical and
technical expertise. Upon completion of company command a full spectrum of assignments are possible. The purpose
of these assignments is to meet critical Army requirements, further develop the officer’s knowledge base and provide
the officer a more well-rounded professional experience. The objective of the branch is to grow an inventory of officers
who are tactically and technically proficient and have expanded their skills in a variety of challenging assignments.
Armor officers may serve on MTOE or TDA unit staffs at the battalion/squadron and brigade/regiment level prior to or
subsequent to company command.
   (3) Self-development. During this phase, Armor officers must hone their leadership, tactical and technical skills,
develop a mastery of training management, physical conditioning and concentrate on those critical tasks required to
accomplish their wartime mission. The officer continues to develop a more thorough understanding of combined arms
operations in a joint environment. Armor captains should consider beginning work on a master’s degree. The Maneuver
Self Study Program provides additional resources for self-development. The Maneuver Self Study Program can be
found at the following address (http://www.benning.army.mil/mssp/).
   c. Major. Promotion to major normally occurs on or after the tenth year of commissioned service. Selection for
major is based on performance and potential for further service in positions of greater responsibility. These qualities are
measured by the officer’s assignment history, development within the Armor Branch, and the relative standing of the
officer to peers as indicated in OER.
   (1) Education. Completion of the CCC is required for promotion to major. Officers complete the requirements for
ILE through Command and General Staff College (resident or nonresident) or a sister Service resident Command and
General Staff College. JPME courses offered through Joint Forces Staff College or Joint Continuing and Distance
Education School are available primarily to those officers with a follow-on joint assignment.
   (2) Assignments. Key development during this phase is assignment as a battalion/squadron operations officer (S3),
or battalion executive officer (XO). Successful assignments in positions such as XO and S3 best prepare officers for
the rigors of battalion/squadron command. Higher headquarters positions such as division staff and JFHQ is also
74                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

recommended. Duty in progressively challenging assignments is an essential ingredient in the career development of
officers prior to promotion to lieutenant colonel.
   (3) Self-development. Armor majors are expected to continue self-development efforts to build intellectual capital,
strategic perspective, hone operational skills and sustain physical conditioning. Armor majors will develop and use a
diverse set of skills as they move between combined arms leadership positions in operational and generating force
organizations as well as functional Armor, branch immaterial and JIIM assignments. Armor officers should complete
their masters degree before their selection board for lieutenant colonel. Although not a requirement, a masters degree
makes the Armor officer more rounded in education and more competitive for the board. The Maneuver Self Study
Program provides additional resources for self-development. The Maneuver Self Study Program can be found at the
following address (http://www.benning.army.mil/mssp/).
   d. Lieutenant colonel. The DA promotion board considers the major for promotion to lieutenant colonel at the 16th
year of commissioned service. Highly-qualified officers in this phase may be selected to command a battalion or
squadron. Other assignments include brigade/regimental S3 or XO, division primary staff, various JFHQ assignments,
or other staff positions.
   (1) Education. Completion of ILE Common Core Course is a requirement for promotion to lieutenant colonel. The
Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course (AOWC) phase of ILE is a requirement for selection for battalion
command. Selectees for battalion command attend the Maneuver Pre-Command Course. Qualified Armor lieutenant
colonels may apply for the U.S. Army War College or other SSC (resident or DL). JPME courses offered through Joint
Forces Staff College or Joint Continuing and Distance Education School are available primarily to those officers with a
follow-on joint assignment.
   (2) Assignments. Highly-qualified lieutenant colonels may be selected to command a battalion, squadron, or Armor
TASS battalion. Other typical assignments include: brigade or regimental S3 or XO, division primary staff, and various
JFHQ, or other staff positions. Joint assignments are important during this phase and may be critical for promotion to
colonel.
   (3) Self-development. During this phase of an Armor officer’s career, self-development takes the form of self-
assessment, off-duty civil schooling, perfecting mentoring and managerial skills, and sustaining physical conditioning.
The officer should also continue to hone combined arms warfighting skills and understanding of the joint operational
environment. The Maneuver Self Study Program provides additional resources for self-development. The Maneuver
Self Study Program can be found at http://www.benning.army.mil/mssp/.
   e. Colonel.
   (1) Education. Completion of ILE is a requirement for promotion to colonel. Selectees for brigade command attend
the Maneuver PCC. Colonels are encouraged to complete SSC (resident or nonresident).
   (2) Assignments. Highly-qualified colonels may be selected to command an Armored BCT, Stryker BCT or Infantry
BCT. Other typical assignments include AGR program participation and various senior duty positions at the division
and JFHQ levels, and HQDA and joint staff assignments.
   (3) Self-development. Armor colonels must maintain their branch skills and keep current on all changes that affect
the Soldiers they command and/or manage. JIIM assignments are important during this phase. The Maneuver Self
Study Program provides additional resources for self-development. The Maneuver Self Study Program can be found at
http://www.benning.army.mil/mssp/.
Chapter 10
Aviation Branch
10–1. Unique features of the Aviation Branch
   a. Purpose of the Aviation Branch.
   (1) Army Aviation is an Operations branch. Army Aviation provides a maneuver advantage to Army and joint force
commanders in unified land operations through its capabilities to overcome the constraints of limiting terrain and
extended distances. Army Aviation essentially operates in the land domain, with the majority of its combat power in
formations at the same echelon as supported ground formations and responsible to the same higher command. Aviation
combat power is integrated with the ground force at the lowest practical level, ensuring responsiveness to the needs of
the ground commander. Army Aviation conducts reconnaissance and security to develop actionable combat informa-
tion; employs fires to destroy, neutralize, or suppress enemy forces; conducts air assault to maneuver ground forces to
positions of advantage in relation to the enemy; provides air movement of personnel, equipment, and supplies to points
of need; conducts air medical evacuation and provides air traffic services (ATS). When required, select Army Aviation
units can establish and operate Army and Joint airfields in support of operations.
   (2) In general, the Aviation company equipped with either manned rotary-wing or fixed-wing platforms or un-
manned aircraft systems (UAS) is the basic ‘building block’ of the Army Aviation force. Aviation company types
include: attack-recon (equipped with attack/reconnaissance helicopters such as the OH–58D Kiowa Warrior or AH–64
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           75

Apache), assault (equipped with assault helicopters, primarily the UH–60 Blackhawk), command and control (also
primarily equipped with the UH–60 Blackhawk), heavy helicopter (equipped with the CH–47 Chinook), medical
evacuation (primarily equipped with the HH–60 Blackhawk variant), UAS (equipped with either the Hunter, Shadow,
or Gray Eagle UAS), security and support (equipped with the LUH–72 Lakota helicopter), fixed-wing (equipped with
manned fixed-wing aircraft such as the C–12 and UC–35), ATS (equipped with the a mobile ATS tower and
supporting communications equipment), and Aviation maintenance (equipped to provide maintenance and supply
support for the aircraft). These companies are organized into functional attack-recon battalions/squadrons, assault
helicopter battalions, and fixed-wing battalions or into multifunctional general support Aviation battalions, security and
support battalions, and Aviation sustainment battalions. Various mixes of these battalions are organized into Combat
Aviation Brigades (CABs) and theater Aviation brigades, Army Aviation’s primary warfighting formations. In addition
to these primary organizational structures, a number of Aviation platoons, detachments, and TDA organizations are to
be found throughout the force. There are also specialized ATS (airfield operations battalions and theater airfield
operations groups) and Aviation maintenance (theater Aviation sustainment maintenance groups) formations. In addi-
tion to conventional Aviation formations, there is also special operations Aviation units organized under the Army
Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA) Command.
   (3) Army Aviation manpower consists of Aviation officers, warrant officers, NCOs, and enlisted Soldiers. The
officers and warrant officers are categorized by various AOCs, and MOSs outlined below. The majority of Aviation
officers and warrant officers are aviators, although not exclusively so. The 150A ATS, 150U UAS, and 151A Aviation
maintenance (nonrated) warrant officers are the most notable exceptions. The majority of Aviation NCOs and enlisted
Soldiers are Aviation maintainers, but-again-not exclusively so. The major exceptions are the 15P Flight Operations
Specialist, the 15Q ATS Specialist, and the 15W UAS Operator.
   b. Aviation career development and progression. Like other branches, Aviation career development is based on
operational experience and training, institutional education, and self-study/development. Early career development
focuses on developing tactical expertise in Aviation employment and sustainment as part of the air ground, integrated,
combined arms team and technical expertise in the operation of Aviation platforms/systems. Mid-career development
continues to refine tactical and technical expertise and focuses on developing competency in operational-level employ-
ment and sustainment of Aviation and integration into JIIM environments. Later career development focuses on the
strategic level employment and sustainment of Aviation and integration into the force as a whole. Progression is
dependent upon a number of factors, including: time in grade, duty performance, experience, schooling, and skills
acquired. The Army dictates minimum time in grade requirements for progression to the next rank. Officers and
warrant officers will only be considered for promotion when they have met the minimum time in grade requirement for
their present rank. Duty performance—no matter what the position—is the single most important factor in selection to
progress to the next higher rank. Exceptional duty performance at the current rank is normally considered a strong
indicator of potential at the next higher rank. Operational experience is also a factor in progression, particularly in the
early and mid-career development periods. Operational assignments that develop tactical and technical expertise are
important at these stages. Broadening assignments that develop competencies beyond tactical and technical Aviation
expertise become increasingly important during the mid-career and later development periods. Schooling and the
acquisition of critical or unique skills can also enhance potential for progression. Certain PME courses are required for
advancement to the next rank. Overall, officers and warrant officers should strive to first establish a solid foundation of
Aviation tactical and technical expertise, then expand their operational and strategic level competence in respect to the
Army and JIIM environments. All Aviation AOCs and skills are open to women. Female Aviation officers and warrant
officers have career opportunities equal to those of their male counterparts.
   c. Unique features of work in Army Aviation. As mentioned above, most officers and warrant officers in Army
Aviation are aviators. These officers and warrant officers must achieve designation as an Army aviator at the beginning
of their officer/WOS and maintain the rating through annual flight proficiency and aeromedical assessments. Aviators
must also undergo readiness level training and certification upon arrival at each new flight unit to confirm their
competency to perform as a crew member in their assigned aircraft. Aviators must achieve pilot-in-command status in
order to be entrusted as the ‘aircraft commander’ in an aircraft crew. Certain non-flight AOC warrant officers also have
annual proficiency and medical assessments to maintain certification in their particular skill area. In order to maintain
aircrew incentive pay, Aviation officers and warrant officers must accrue mandated thresholds of total operational
flying duty credit through assignment to positions designated as operational flying positions (see AR 600–105). The
employment of Aviation units as part of combined arms or joint teams in support of the broad range of unified land
operations brings a number of unique challenges. Aviation officers and warrant officers must understand all aspects of
integrating Aviation platforms/systems/units into effective air ground operations. Aviation officers and warrant officers
must understand the fundamentals of airspace management and ATS requirements. This includes compliance with the
airspace regulations of the Joint Force Airspace Control Authority, the host nation, the International Civil Aeronautics
Organization, the Federal Aviation Administration, and/or other airspace governing bodies-as applicable. Sustainment
of Aviation platforms/systems-particularly aircraft maintenance-offers other unique aspects of work in Army Aviation.
Aviation maintenance standards, processes, and procedures are distinctly different from those for ground systems and
Aviation officers and warrant officers need a solid understanding of Aviation sustainment.

10–2. Characteristics required of Aviation officers
Talents/attributes. Army Aviation demands intellectually agile leaders who can operate within a multidimensional
world. They must be able to translate vast amounts of complex data into abstract concepts and solutions. Aviators must
be able to recognize and mitigate unacceptable risks and be able to identify new and creative solutions to problems that
occur during Aviation operations in all environments. Aviation Branch has identified six talents/attributes that are
essential to success in such environments. While this list is not all-inclusive, it does highlight those talents or attributes
that are of particular importance for Army aviators:
   a. Interdisciplinary. Defines an individual who integrates and applies expert knowledge from multiple disciplines
into a coherent overarching perspective. Aviators must operate in fast-paced, dynamic environments that call for a wide
base of knowledge and competencies. Aviation operations encompass a wide variety of complex missions conducted in
challenging and potentially unfamiliar environments. Consequently, aviators must draw from a broad-based perspective
to identify, prioritize, and develop solutions for the challenges posed by the broad spectrum of problem sets they will
face.
   b. Prudent risk taker. This person recognizes and mitigates unacceptable risks, enabling mission accomplishment
without unnecessarily compromising safety. Aviators are responsible for the safe operation of extremely expensive
aircraft in challenging environments, including combat, adverse weather, obscured battlefields, and at night. While
always focused on mission accomplishment, aviators must be able to make tough, timely decisions, often independently
and without firm guidance from higher, to find the right balance between mission accomplishment and the safe
operation of their aircraft and formations. There are often ways to accomplish difficult missions with lower levels of
risk; aviators must be able to quickly and effectively adjust their operations to reduce the likelihood of mishap,
damage, or injury while at the same time achieving the commander’s intent.
   c. Interpersonal. This individual is able to connect with others and is skilled in developing appropriate relationships.
Army aviators support many types of units and communities. Frequently called upon to bring their unique flexibility
and capabilities to bear on short notice, aviators must quickly and effectively establish relations with outside organiza-
tions. Increasingly, these organizations are outside of familiar chains of command and often outside of the military
itself. Aviators must be able to establish trust, exchange nuanced communications, and perceive the intents of others,
often in dangerous, confusing, and rapidly changing situations. Strong interpersonal skills will be essential in ac-
complishing missions under these circumstances.
   d. Spatially intelligent. This person easily perceives, understands, and operates within the multidimensional world.
Army aviators must be able to quickly and accurately define their own position with respect to other aircraft, airspace
control measures, instrument flight procedure components, and other objects that influence or operate in three-
dimensional space. The ability to quickly orient oneself and gain situational understanding in complex, crowded
airspace is increasingly important for the successful Army aviator.
   e. Innovative. Suggests an individual who is creative, inquisitive, and insightful and who easily identifies new
solutions and catalyzes change. Army Aviation’s ability to quickly overcome distances and obstacles that challenge
peers on the ground are great strengths, but will also often thrust aviators into complex, rapidly changing environments
that present unusual or unfamiliar problem sets. Aviators must be able to quickly identify and implement solutions to
these problems. The increasingly complex and technological aspects of Army Aviation operations will pose difficult
challenges for which Army aviators must quickly devise effective, executable courses of action that lead to mission
accomplishment.
   f. Multi-tasker. This person rapidly processes and prioritizes multiple demands simultaneously and then takes
appropriate action. Army aviators must be able to successfully manage a variety of tasks at once, whether personally
operating aircraft or supervising unit operations. The modern cockpit calls for the simultaneous and precise execution
of a variety of complex tasks, many of which will be vital to mission accomplishment. Aviators must prioritize,
control, monitor, assess, and sometimes take emergency actions on multiple systems and processes. Similarly, most
operations involving Army Aviation will include a wide variety of participants and systems, including those from other
branches, other services, and other nations. Successful Army aviators will be able to comprehend, communicate with
and synchronize the effects of these external organizations and systems.
10–3. Aviation branch officer development
The primary domains of leader development—PME (institutional training), KD assignments, developmental assign-
ments, broadening assignments, and self-development—define and engage a continuous cycle of education, training,
selection, experience, assessment, feedback, reinforcement and evaluation which helps to encourage officer develop-
ment throughout career progression.
   a. Lieutenant. Lieutenants must meet the requirements outlined in AR 611–110 for entry into the Aviation Branch.
   (1) Professional military education. All newly commissioned Aviation lieutenants attend BOLC and Initial Entry
Rotary Wing training at the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE), Fort Rucker, AL. BOLC includes
training on general military subjects such as leadership, weapons, combined arms operations, physical training and
warrior skills training. Initial Entry Rotary Wing or flight school, training consists of aeromedical factors, basic flight,
aerodynamics, meteorology, instrument flight and combat skills training. Training is conducted from the preflight
through the primary and instrument qualification phases in the TH–67 aircraft. Basic warfighting skills, such as
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                                 77

navigation, are trained in the OH–58C. Students then transition into one of 4 advanced aircraft: the AH–64D/E Apache,
UH–60A/L/M Blackhawk, OH–58D Kiowa Warrior and CH–47D/F Chinook to complete day and night advance
combat skills. Students must also complete survival, evasion, resistance, and escape level C and helicopter overwater
survival (dunker) training prior to being awarded the Basic Army Aviator Badge. Follow-on schooling en route to the
officer’s next assignment (for example, Airborne, Air Assault, Ranger, and Cavalry Leader’s Course) may be approved
based on mission requirements.
   (2) Key developmental assignment. The single most important assignment consideration for personnel managers and
commanders is ensuring that the new lieutenant is assigned to a job which will allow the officer adequate opportunity
to develop flight experience and troop-leading skills. Lieutenants should serve 18 to 24 months in a platoon leader
position. Due to the length of flight school, this may overlap into the officer’s first year as a captain. Promotions will
not automatically alter positions. Promotion from lieutenant to captain while still serving in an operational assignment
such as platoon leader will not be a negative consideration when determining the officer’s future potential for
promotion. The overall goal is for an officer to attain pilot-in-command status and gain as much flight and leadership
experience as possible prior to moving to another operational assignment.
   (3) Developmental assignments. Junior officers initially assigned to a CONUS or overseas installations (OCONUS)
will be stabilized at their first installation for an extended period of time that allows for branch advancement to the
rank of captain. This initial extended tour may include hardship tours or attendance at leader development schools (in
TDY or PCS status) but in each case the officer should return to their stabilization installation. Lieutenants should
serve at the platoon and company level to gain troop-leading and flight experience. The officer will concentrate on
planning and executing the tactics, techniques and procedures specific to their weapons platform and unit mission.
   (4) Self-development. All officers should be afforded every opportunity to achieve qualification as a pilot-in-
command prior to attendance of the Aviation Captains Career Course (AVCCC) or CCC equivalent. A lieutenant’s
focus should be to refine troop-leading, aviator, tactical, logistic (maintenance and supply), force protection (risk
management) and administrative skills. The key milestone in a lieutenant’s development should be attaining pilot-in-
command status. In doing so, lieutenants will acquire much needed technical and tactical experience, which will serve
them well in future assignments. For example, company commanders are expected to set the standard for other pilots
within their company. Being a pilot-in-command better enables commanders to be in the position to direct critical
assets where needed. Lieutenants should also strive to obtain key training experiences that enhance normal garrison
training, including, but not limited to: CTC rotations, joint and combined exercise deployments, and worldwide
contingency operations. To successfully compete for promotion to captain, an officer must possess a thorough
knowledge of Aviation tactics and principles and have obtained a baccalaureate degree. Officers may take advantage of
pre-commissioning educational incentives such as incurring an additional 3 year ADSO in exchange for the opportunity
to pursue a master’s degree later in their careers.
   b. Captain. A captain must successfully complete a branch CCC.
   (1) Professional military education.
   (a) Captains Career Course. Captains must earn a baccalaureate degree prior to attending a CCC. Aviation officers
will attend a branch CCC between their 5th and 8th year of commissioned service and will be awarded AOC 15B upon
successful completion. Aviation officers may attend other branch’s CCC. The branch phase of the AVCCC is 21
weeks. It prepares officers to serve as combined arms experts, company commanders and battalion/brigade staff
officers. The AVCCC meets established prerequisites for total operational flying duty credit assignments. Aviators earn
1 month of total operational flying duty credit for each month spent at AVCCC. Aviators attending another branch
CCC do not earn total operational flying duty credit.
   (b) Military Intelligence Captains Career Course. Officers selected for AOC 15C (All-Source Intelligence Officer)
attend the Military Intelligence Officer Transition Course if they did not attend Military Intelligence BOLC. The AOC
15C officers attend the 20-week Military Intelligence CCC and receive training as a branch 35 (All-Source Intelligence
Officer). They attend the Fixed Wing Multi-Engine Qualification Course before or after the Military Intelligence CCC
with appropriate follow-on Aircraft specific training.
   (c) Aviation Captains Career Course. Officers selected for AOC 15D Aviation Maintenance Officers will attend
either the AVCCC or the CLC3. The officer will also attend the Aviation Maintenance Officers Course and the
Maintenance Test Pilot course for AOC designation as a 15D.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Captains serving in one of the following assignments for 12–24 months acquire
KD time:
   (a) Platoon leader (15D) in an Aviation support company.
   (b) Captain-level company/detachment command.
   (3) Developmental assignments. Captains are utilized as the senior leader at the company level. Their primary goal
is to successfully command a TOE/TDA company for 18–24 months. Captains can hold platoon leader positions in
units authorized captains as platoon leaders. These units include the Aviation support company and ARSOA units.
Captains also fill key staff positions at the battalion and brigade level, in addition to positions within the brigade
Aviation element, Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) cell, CTC/observer/controller positions, and small
78                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

group instructor positions at the proponent and USMA. Even when assigned to staff positions, captains should continue
to hone their direct leadership skills, build flight experience, and achieve/maintain pilot-in-command status.
   (4) Broadening assignment. Opportunities available for captains include, but are not limited to:
   (a) Observer controller/evaluator at a CTC.
   (b) Course manager/instructor at USAACE/USAIC USMA.
   (c) Training With Industry.
   (d) HRC assignments.
   (e) Collection manager (15C).
   (f) Battalion primary and CAB assistant staff officer.
   (g) Brigade Aviation element.
   (5) Self-development. Captains should gain an in-depth understanding of Aviation brigade operations, combined
arms operations, and aircraft maintenance. Aviation captains should dedicate time to a professional reading program to
gain a historical perspective on solutions to tactical and leader challenges. Captains should strive for the same
qualitative leadership building experiences as during their lieutenant years: CTC rotations, joint and combined exer-
cises, and deployment on real-world contingency operations. The challenges at the captain/commander level will
greatly enhance the officer’s tactical and technical skills, as well as build critical flight experience. Captains should
strive to meet the requirements for award of the Senior Aviator Badge by the time they are promoted to major.
Captains should broaden their understanding of warfighting through extension courses and independent study. Com-
manders should maintain healthy officer professional development programs within their units.
   (6) Key developmental. Captains should seek the KD assignments that assist them in promotion and create the
qualities of a tactically and technically proficient Aviation officer. In addition, opportunities exist at TRADOC
organizations as staff and logistics officers.
   (a) Aviation captains can request to attend the Joint Air Ground Operations School at Hurlburt Field, FL 32544, or
the Cavalry Leaders Course at Fort Benning, GA 31995–3781. If attendance at Air Ground Operations School is
desired, the 3-week Joint Air Tasking Order Process Course located at Hurlburt Field, FL is recommended for officers
who are required to understand and apply airspace mission command and the application of the air tasking order. The
2–week Joint Firepower Course at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, is more suited to an understanding of the application
of joint fire support systems.
   (b) Project Warrior is a program in which captains serve 2 years as an observer-coach-trainer at a maneuver combat
trainer center, followed by 2 years as a small group instructor at a TRADOC Center of Excellence. Project Warrior was
suspended due to operational requirements in Iraq and Afghanistan. The intent in reinstituting Project Warrior is to
infuse observations, insights, and lessons gained from multiple maneuver combat trainer center decisive action rotations
against hybrid threats, back into the force through the TRADOC Center of Excellence.
   (c) Officers may receive Advanced Civilian Schooling or Expanded Graduate School Program participation if career
timeline permits or if necessary for a FA or special assignment (for example, Army Acquisition Corps, FAO or USMA
instructor). See paragraph 3–5b(4) for specifics.
   (7) Volunteer Transfer Incentive Program. VTIP boards meet to consider officers in their seventh year of service for
designation into other FAs or Branches. Officers will submit their top three choices at the seven year mark. Officers
receive a new career manager upon selection by the VTIP for a different branch or FA. Only a limited number of
Aviators will be given a FA or branch outside of Aviation, usually based on specific Aviation skill requirements in
select FAs. Aviation officers will not participate in the Army’s 4 Year VTIP.
   (a) Volunteer Transfer Incentive Program eligibility. To participate in the VTIP officers must be eligible for transfer
based on “in/out call” matrix provided in each MILPER message prior to each VTIP board. The officer must be an
ACC officer. Must be a first lieutenant promotable, captain, or captain promotable. officers must submit a DA Form
4187 (Personnel Action) (signed only by the officer requesting the transfer, block 9), a memorandum for record (MFR)
stating reason for request and one letter of recommendation from a lieutenant colonel or higher. Officers must submit
their request electronically to usarmy.knox.hrc.mbx.opmd-retention@mail.mil. Any questions or concerns about the
VTIP program or eligibility can be addressed via email at usarmy.knox.hrc.mbx.opmd-retention@mail.mil.
   (b) An aviator migrating out of the Operations functional category will serve in their new FA for the remainder of
their career, and with the exception of FA 51. Acquisition, will no longer be authorized Aviation pay. Repetitive
operational flying assignments through the grade of captain are critical in order for officers to make their first Aviation
pay gate (96 months of credible operational flying duty assignments at the 12 year Aviation pay gate audit). If an
aviator has not met their 12 year gate requirements, they will lose continuous Aviation pay beyond the 12th year of
Aviation service unless they are assigned to a credible operational flying duty authorization, and continue to ’fly for
pay’. Aviators who remain in Aviation Branch are expected to remain eligible to serve in operational Aviation
assignments. See additional sections in this pamphlet and AR 611–110 for a complete description of each functional
designation and associated skills.
   (8) Army Acquisition Corps. Between the 7th and 8th year of service select officers are assessed into the Army
Acquisition Corps by a HQDA selection board. Aviators assessed into Army Acquisition Corps do not compete for
Aviation battalion or brigade commands. Instead, they compete for lieutenant colonel and colonel-level product, project
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                                79

and program manager positions. Officers assessed into the Army Acquisition Corps are re-designated with FA 51.
Accession into FA 51 is based on the same criteria as mentioned above (Army needs, training and background, and
officer skills). Again, Aviation Branch will only access enough aviators into the Army Acquisition Corps to meet Army
Aviation acquisition requirements.
   (9) Army Special Operations Aviation. Officers interested in joining the ARSOA, 160th Special Operations Aviation
Regiment should understand the flight and leadership experience needed to be competitive for an ARSOA assessment.
The ARSOA recruiters focus their recruiting efforts on experienced captains with solid leadership and flight experi-
ence. Interested captains should pursue company command as soon as possible following the CCC.
   c. Major. Majors should complete the Command and General Staff College/ILE course, a sister Service equivalent
institution (Navy, Marine, or Air Force), or schools in other nations before they enter the primary zone of consideration
to be competitive for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
   (1) Professional military education. Following Command and General Staff College/ILE, some officers are selected
to attend the SAMS. Those officers selected for the SAMS must serve an initial utilization tour as an assistant plans
officer for DCS, G–3/5/7 on division or Corps staffs. Aviation maintenance officers are encouraged to attend the Army
Logistics Management Course (Support Operations).
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Majors regardless of their AOC (B, C, or D) should seek KD assignments that
assist them in promotion, either in the Aviation Branch or in a FA. Majors should seek KD assignments and should
serve in one or more of the following assignments for 12 to 24 months to acquire KD time:
   (a) Battalion/brigade XO.
   (b) Battalion/brigade S3.
   (c) Command positions coded for majors.
   (d) AOC 15B. Majors’ KD assignments include Aviation combined arms operating generating force assignments as
battalion CAB staff, company command, and brigade Aviation officer.
   (e) AOC 15C. Majors’ KD assignments include Aviation combined arms operating generating force assignments as
well as CAB S2 and aerial exploitation battalion S3 and XO. Additional broadening opportunities include Aviation
staff positions in Military Intelligence brigades, tactical intelligence groups, and division level all source collection
elements.
   (f) AOC 15D. Majors’ KD assignments include Aviation Combined Arms operating generating force assignments as
well as battalion staff in tactical battalions, major level company command assignments as well as Aviation support
company command, Aviation support battalion/XO/support operations, brigade S4, and division Aviation maintenance
officer. Additional opportunities exist at Army Materiel Command (AMC) depots and in Theater Aviation Sustainment
Maintenance Groups.
   (3) Developmental assignments. Aviation staff positions are at the battalion, brigade, group, HQDA, and joint staff
levels. Some majors also serve as instructors or hold staff positions at Army service schools.
   (4) Broadening assignments. Opportunities available for majors include, but are not limited to:
   (a) CTC observer controller/evaluator.
   (b) RC advisor.
   (c) USAREC staff.
   (d) USMA faculty and staff.
   (e) TRADOC service school instructors/doctrine writers.
   (f) Army Staff, joint staff and branch/FA generalist positions.
   (5) Self-development. Majors should focus self-developmental efforts on acquiring expertise in organizational leader-
ship techniques, operations at division level and above, Aviation logistical support operations. Their self-development
must focus on joint, multinational, and combined arms operations. This can be accomplished through correspondence
courses or institutional training. Majors should devote time to a professional reading program. Officers may take
advantage of the Expanded Graduate School Program and attend advanced civilian schooling if the follow-on assign-
ment requires an advanced degree. Many advanced degree programs are available in order for officers to obtain a
graduate degree. Aviation majors will likely serve in operational flying positions after being away from the cockpit for
some time due to schooling and required staff positions. Therefore, their self-development should also be focused on
refreshing themselves with new Aviation technologies in the cockpit. They should set the example for the younger
generation of officers by continuing to place a strong emphasis on their technical and tactical Aviation proficiency.
Aviation majors in BR 15 should strive to attain the Master Aviator Badge by the time they are promoted to lieutenant
colonel should seek a field grade joint duty assignment once tactical and technical experiences have been attained.
   (6) Selection. Individuals selected and assigned to a brigade Aviation element or ADAM Cell may be selected by
the CAB commander to serve in positions organic to the BCTs as the Aviation subject matter expert for the BCT
commander. Ideally, these positions will serve as a second KD position for a major, after they have completed an S3/
XO positions. Officers assigned to a brigade Aviation element/ADAM cell provide the critical linkage with the BCT’s
supporting CAB to facilitate the most efficient tactical employment of Aviation assets in the BCT’s operational
environment. Serving in a similar position at a higher level also satisfies this intent.

   d. Lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels should serve in an Aviation-coded position for 18 to 24 months.
   (1) Professional military education. No specific military education requirements exist for lieutenant colonels. A
HQDA board determines selection for resident SSC or the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course.
Officers selected for command selection list battalion command will attend the Army’s PCC at Fort Leavenworth, KS,
and the Aviation PCC at Fort Rucker, AL. Select TDA battalion command designees may also be slated for attendance
at the TRADOC PCC at Fort Jackson, SC. Battalion command designees who have special courts martial convening
authority will attend the Senior Officers Legal Orientation Course at Charlottesville, VA. A master’s degree is strongly
recommended, but is not required for promotion. Aviation maintenance officers are strongly encouraged to attend the
Army Logistics Management College (Senior Leaders Course).
   (2) Key developmental. Lieutenant colonels should seek (KD) assignments that assist them in promotion, either in
the Aviation Branch or in a FA. Lieutenant colonels serving in one of the following assignments for 12 to 24 months
acquire KD time.
   (a) Battalion commander.
   (b) Brigade deputy CDR/XO/S3.
   (3) Developmental assignments. Lieutenant colonels that successfully complete a CSL battalion-level command may
remain competitive for brigade command and enjoy a higher potential for promotion to colonel and SSC selection.
Commands on the CSL are organized into four functional categories: operations, strategic support, recruiting and
training, and installation. the following assignments are not necessarily coded as Aviation, however they are considered
developmental assignments: lieutenant colonel positions at the CTCs, brigade/regiment/corps assistant for DCS, G–3/5/
7 or DCS, G–4, deputy assistant for DCS, G–3/5/7 or DCS, G–4, operations officer for DCS, G–3/5/7, assistant plans
officer for DCS, G–3/5/7, ROTC or recruiting duty, ACOM/ASCC/DRU staff, Army Staff, joint staffs, and selected
AA/RC assignments. Performance in demanding assignments is a prime consideration for promotion and school
selection boards. Officers should complete a field grade joint duty assignment to be competitive for promotion to
brigadier general.
   (4) Broadening assignments. The following assignments are not necessarily coded as Aviation, however they are
considered broadening assignments: lieutenant colonel positions at USAACE, CTCs, brigade/regiment/group XO,
division primary staff, corps assistant for DCS, G–3/5/7 or DCS, G–4, deputy assistant for DCS, G–3/5/7 or DCS, G–4,
operations officer for DCS, G–3/5/7, assistant plans officer for DCS, G–3/5/7, ROTC or recruiting duty, ACOM/
ASCC/DRU staff, Army Staff, joint staffs, and selected AA/RC assignments. Performance in demanding assignments is
a prime consideration for promotion and school selection boards. Lieutenant colonels should also seek a joint duty
assignment.
   (5) Self-development. Officers should continue to build warfighting, joint, expeditionary, and FA expertise.
   e. Colonel. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is sustainment of warfight-
ing, training, and staff skill, along with utilization of leadership, managerial and executive talents. The majority of
strategic level leaders in the Army are colonels. Colonels are expected to be multi-skilled leaders—strategic and
creative thinkers, builders of leaders and teams, competent decisive action warfighters, skilled in governance, states-
manship, and diplomacy, and understand cultural context and work effectively across it. Aviation colonels are assigned
by the Army’s Senior Leader Development Office. Colonels should serve 18–24 months in an Aviation assignment
coded at the grade of colonel.
   (1) Professional military education. Although no specific mandatory military education requirement exists for
colonels, the primary professional development goal is completion of SSC. Resident or nonresident Attendance at a
SSC also identifies those officers with exceptional promotion potential for service in positions of increased responsibil-
ity. An HQDA board determines who attends the resident course and participates in the U.S. Army War College
Distance Education Course. Officers selected for CSL brigade Command will attend the Army’s PCC at Fort
Leavenworth, KS, and the Aviation PCC at Fort Rucker, AL. Brigade command selectees may also attend the Senior
Officers Legal Orientation Course at Charlottesville, VA. Officers selected as TRADOC capability managers (TCMs)
will attend the Combat Developers Course at Fort Lee, VA and the Project Manager’s Acquisition Category III Course
(commonly known as the Project Manager’s Survival Course) at Fort Belvoir, VA. The Acquisition Category III
Course has several prerequisites. Officers selected for TCM billets should contact their assignment officer to discuss
requirements.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Colonels serving in brigade command for 12 to 24 months acquire KD time.
Successful brigade-level command marks officers as qualified for increased responsibility at the highest levels in the
Army and DOD.
   (3) Developmental assignments. The following positions (some not necessarily coded as Aviation) are also develop-
mental assignments: senior-level joint duty, division (former brigade commander position), corps-level officer for DCS,
G–3/5/7, or DCS, G–4, U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command, or deputy chief of staff, deputy assistant
commandant, director of training development and doctrine, director, TRADOC program office-Aviation brigades,
director of evaluation and standardization (DES), director of simulations, director, organization and personnel force
development, chiefs of staff (at division, corps, USAACE) colonel positions at the CTCs, Army Staff, ACOM/ASCC/
DRU staff, joint staffs, and selected AC/RC assignments.

   (4) Broadening assignments. The following assignments are not necessarily coded as Aviation, however they are
considered key broadening assignments: colonel positions at CTCs brigade/regiment/group XO, division primary staff,
corps assistant for DCS, G–3/5/7 or DCS, G–4, deputy assistant for DCS, G–3/5/7 or DCS, G–4, operations officer for
DCS, G–3/5/7, assistant plans officer for DCS, G–3/5/7, ROTC or recruiting duty, ACOM/ASCC/DRU staff, Army
Staff, joint staffs, and selected AA/RC assignments. Performance in demanding assignments is a prime consideration
for promotion and school selection boards. Colonels should also seek a joint duty assignment. Officers should complete
a field grade joint duty assignment to be competitive for promotion to brigadier general.
   (5) Self-development. Self-development goals should focus on perfecting organizational level leadership skills, joint
and coalition operations, and theater-level operations. An advanced degree is not required but is strongly recommended.
   f. Reserve Component officer. Development opportunities. RC Aviation officer development objectives and qualifi-
cations parallel those planned for their AA counterparts (see fig 10–5). The nature of the RC Soldier’s role as a “citizen
Soldier” poses a unique challenge for professional development. The RC officers are expected to follow AC officer
development patterns as closely as possible, except that RC officers have increased time windows to complete
mandatory professional educational requirements. Civilian career opportunities, military promotions and educational
opportunities may force RC officers to transfer between ARNG units, USAR TPUs, IRR, IMA Program, and the AGR
Programs. These transfers are often hindered by geographical considerations, as well as a limited number of positions
to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions. Additionally, there may be occasions when ARNG officers will
be transferred to the IRR or Army Reserve officers to the trainees, transients, holdees, and students (TTHS) account
while they complete mandatory educational requirements. Such transfers are usually temporary and should not be seen
as impacting negatively on the officer’s career. The success of the RC officer is not measured by length of service in
any one component or control group, but by the officer’s breadth and depth of experience which are the metrics that
accurately reflect an officer’s potential to serve in positions of increasing responsibility. Officers should focus on job
performance, as there are many paths that define a successful career within the Aviation Branch.
   (1) Professional military education. As RC officers simultaneously advance both civilian and military careers, they
have less available time than their AA counterparts to achieve the same military professional education levels. To
minimize this problem, RC courses are specifically tailored to reduce the resident instruction time. This cannot be
accomplished with graduate flight training courses.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. The AGs of the 50 States, 3 U.S. Territories, and the District of Columbia (DC)
primarily manage the officers within their States. HRC and USAREC manage officers in the Army Reserve.
   (3) Self-development through the military schooling system. The Aviation RC officer plays an important role in the
Aviation Branch mission. RC officers normally develop through one AOC and in one FA. However, a lack of suitable
positions in a geographic area may lead to some RC officers becoming qualified in multiple AOC or FAs. The RC
officers must attain educational levels commensurate with their grade and assignment, using resident and nonresident
instruction options. RC officers have increased windows to complete military education requirements.
   g. Reserve Component lieutenant. Lieutenants must meet the requirements outlined in AR 611–110 for entry into the
Aviation Branch.
   (1) Professional military education. RC officers commissioned into the Aviation Branch attend BOLC and Initial
Entry Rotary Wing with their AA counterparts. RC officers must have completed this training by their 2nd year of
commissioned service.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. The single most important assignment consideration for personnel managers and
commanders is ensuring that the new lieutenant is assigned to a job which will allow the officer adequate opportunity
to develop flight experience and troop-leading skills. Lieutenants should serve 18 to 24 months in a platoon leader
position. A lieutenant normally serves at company level to gain troop-leading and flight experience.
   (a) Platoon leader.
   (b) Battalion staff.
   (c) XO.
   (d) Section leader.
   (3) Developmental assignments. Lieutenants should serve at the platoon and company level to gain troop-leading
and flight experience. The officer will concentrate on planning and executing the tactics, techniques and procedures
specific to their weapons platform and unit mission.
   (4) Self-development. Lieutenants focus on gaining and refining troop-leading, aviator, joint and combined arms
tactics, logistics, and administrative skills. Effective 1 October 1995, a baccalaureate degree from an accredited
institution is required for promotion to captain or higher.
   h. Rersve Component captain. Captains should seek the KD assignments that assist them in promotion and create the
qualities of a tactically and technically proficient Aviation officer. In addition, opportunities exist at TRADOC
organizations as staff and logistics officers
   (1) Professional military education. Captains must complete a CCC. Options are as follows: CCC–AC (CCC AA
curriculum), CCC–RC (RC curriculum), or the four-phase CCC–USAR.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Captains serving in one of the following assignments for 12 to 24 months
acquire KD time:
82                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (a) Platoon leader (15D) in an Aviation support company.
   (b) Captain-level company/detachment command.
   (3) Developmental assignments. Captains are utilized as the senior leader at the company level. Their primary goal
is to successfully command a TOE/TDA company for 18 to 24 months. Captains also fill key staff positions at the
battalion and brigade level. Even when assigned to staff positions, captains should continue to hone their direct
leadership skills, build flight experience, and achieve/maintain pilot-in-command status.
   (4) Broadening assignment opportunities available for captains include, but are not limited to:
   (a) Brigade staff.
   (b) Theater Aviation Sustainment Maintenance Group.
   (c) NGB.
   (5) Self-development. Captains should broaden their understanding of warfighting through extension courses and
independent study. Captains should gain an in-depth understanding of joint and combined arms operations.
   i. Reserve Component major. To achieve branch leadership developmental standards at this level, majors must have
enrolled in the Command and General Staff College/ILE course prior to 18 years time in service. They must have
completed 50 percent of Command and General Staff College/ILE to be competitive for promotion to lieutenant
colonel.
   (1) Professional military education. Most RC officers will complete the Command and General Staff College/ILE
Common Core via TASS or an upgraded advanced distributed learning program. Some RC officers will continue to
attend the Command and General Staff College/ILE in residence at Fort Leavenworth, some will depart upon
completion of the Core Course and others will remain for the Advanced Operations Course.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Majors serving in one of the following assignments for 18 to 24 months acquire
KD time:
   (a) Company/detachment command.
   (b) Battalion S3/XO/support operations.
   (c) Group/brigade primary staff.
   (3) Developmental assignments. RC Aviation majors serve as company commanders, and in staff assignments.
These staff positions are at the battalion, group, brigade, HQDA, or Joint Staff levels. Some majors also serve as
instructors or staff at Reserve Forces Service Schools.
   (4) Broadening assignment. Opportunities available for majors include, but are not limited to:
   (a) CTC observer controller/evaluator.
   (b) ARNG Aviation Training Site branch chief.

   (e) State JFHQ staff.
   (f) Branch chief.
   (g) Aviation staff officer at the ACOM/ASCC/DRU level.
   (h) Brigade Aviation element positions.
   (i) Army Staff, joint staff and branch/FA generalist positions.
   (5) Self-development. Self-development efforts should focus on becoming an expert in all aspects of Aviation
support operations, including joint and combined arms operations. These objectives can be accomplished through
correspondence courses or institutional training. Majors should also devote time to a professional reading program to
broaden their Joint and combined arms operations perspectives.
   j. Reserve Component lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels should serve in an Aviation-coded position for 12 to
24 months.
   (1) Professional military education. In order to qualify for promotion to colonel, RC officers must have completed
Command and General Staff College/ILE.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Lieutenant colonels serving in one of the following assignments for 18 to 24
months acquire KD time:
   (a) Battalion command.
   (b) Brigade S3/XO/support operations.
   (c) Brigade deputy commander.
   (3) Developmental assignments. RC Aviation lieutenant colonels serve in staff positions at group/brigade, major
subordinate commands, USAR GOCOMs, or joint staff levels. Some RC officers may also serve as Reserve Forces

   (5) Self-development. Self-development goals should be to continue building joint warfighting expertise. An ad-
vanced degree is preferred but optional unless required for a specific assignment.
   k. Reserve Component colonel. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is
sustainment of warfighting, training, and staff skill, along with utilization of leadership, managerial and executive
talents. The majority of strategic level leaders in the Army are colonels. Colonels are expected to be multi-skilled
leaders; strategic and creative thinkers; builders of leaders and teams; competent decisive action warfighters; skilled in
governance, statesmanship, and diplomacy; and understand cultural context and work effectively across it. Aviation
colonels are assigned by the Army’s Senior Leader Development Office. Colonels should serve 18 to 24 months in an
Aviation assignment coded at the grade of colonel.
   (1) Professional military education. Completion of SSC by resident or correspondence course is a primary profes-
sional development goal.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Lieutenant colonels serving in group/brigade command for 12 to 24 months
acquire KD time: Aviation RC colonels should serve in command of a TOE/TDA Aviation group or brigade positions.

   (d) GOCOM.
   (e) AGR/Title 10/Title 32 positions at USAACE.
   (5) Self-development. Self-development goals should continue to build on warfighting expertise. An advanced degree
is preferred but optional unless required for a specific assignment.
   l. Skill identifiers for Aviation officers.
   (1) SI help to further refine the assignment process by designation of aircraft qualification or other specialty skill.
When combined with an AOC they become CMFs, which personnel managers use in the assignment process. See DA
Pam 611–21 for a complete list of SIs.
   (2) Other Aviation participation programs. Aviation officers may participate in the following voluntary programs, if
qualified:
   (a) ARSOA.
   (b) Army Astronaut Program (contact Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC–IC–T)).
   (c) Degree completion program (see AR 621–1).
   (d) Army fellowships and scholarships (see AR 621–7).
   (e) The AMSP, also known as SAMS (apply during Command and General Staff School/ILE attendance).
   (f) Advanced civilian schooling (see AR 621–1).
   (g) USMA Instructor Program (see AR 621–1).

   (i) Experimental test pilot training program. This is an intense 11-month course at the Naval Test Pilot School,
Patuxent River, MD. Branch commissioned officers will transfer to the Army Acquisition Corps for the remainder of
their career. Applicants must be AC rated aviators in the rank of captain and have an academic background that
includes the completion of college math and hard-science courses with above average grades. (Contact HRC
(AHRC–OPE–V)).
10–4. Aviation branch officer area of concentration career paths
   a. Area of concentration 15A, Aviation, general (see fig 10–1). This AOC applies to officers that have been accessed
into the Aviation branch but have not yet completed a CCC. Officers in this AOC will first complete the BOLC and
Initial Entry Rotary Wing flight training (earning designation as an Army Aviator) along with the Survival, Evasion,
Resistance, and Escape Course. Officers in this AOC are typically lieutenants and junior captains. They typically lead
sections and platoons, serve as company executive officers, and/or serve as assistant staff officers at battalion and
brigade level. By exception, these officers can command companies and serve as primary staff officers at battalion or
brigade level. Upon completion of a CCC, AOC 15A officers will be re-designated into either the 15B, 15C, or 15D
AOCs.

   b. AOC 15B, Aviation combined arms operation (see fig 10–2). Upon completion of a CCC, all Aviation officers
that have not met the prerequisites for designation as either a 15C or 15D AOC officer will be designated as a 15B.
Officers in this command companies, battalions, and brigades. By exception, they can lead sections and platoons (this
being normally done by 15A officers). Officers in this AOC will also serve as staff officers (both primary and
assistant) in battalion and higher-level formations and in organizations outside of the operating force. Officers in this
AOC may also serve in staff positions designated as “combat arms immaterial” and “branch immaterial.” They may
also be accessed into Special Operations Aviation. For CSL positions (typically battalion and brigade command). 15B
officers may only compete for positions designated for 15Bs.

   c. AOC 15C, Aviation all-source intelligence (see fig 10–3). Aviation officers will be designated as AOC 15C upon
completion of the Military Intelligence Officer Transition Course, the Military Intelligence CCC, and the Fixed Wing
Multi-engine Qualification Course. Officers designed 15C will normally complete follow-on advanced Special Equip-
ment Mission Aircraft Airframe Courses, as required, leading their formations. These officers primarily serve in
positions designated for AOC 15C. Officers designated as 15Cs are also considered qualified as 35D Military
Intelligence Officers and are encouraged to alternately serve in 15C and 35D positions for best professional develop-
ment. Officers in this AOC will typically lead special equipment mission aircraft platoons and command companies
and aerial exploitation battalions. As staff officers, they will typically serve in the S2 (Intelligence) sections of Aviation
battalions and brigades and within aerial exploitation battalion and military intelligence brigade staffs.

   d. AOC 15D, Aviation maintenance officer (see fig 10–4). Officers in this AOC are graduates of the Aviation CCC
or the Combined Logistics CCC, as well as the Aviation Maintenance Officer Course (AMOC) and the Maintenance
Test Pilot Course in the officer’s mission/design/series aircraft. To be eligible for this AOC the officer must have
completed a platoon leader assignment and attained pilot-in-command status of their respective aircraft. They lead
sections and platoons, command companies, battalions and brigades, and serve as staff officers in battalion and higher
echelon units. They must understand air and ground logistics as well as Aviation combat arms operations to be
effective. Aviation maintenance officers plan and direct Aviation maintenance and logistics operations in home station
training, combat operations and industrial operations. Opportunities exist for selected personnel at AMC, Defense
Logistics Agency, ACOM/ASCC logistics offices, the Army Staff and Joint Staffs, Army depots, and in theater
Aviation support maintenance groups. Officers should seek additional assignments throughout the Army Aviation
combat arms environment that would enhance their ability to function in a combat operational situation. After
successful KD assignments, 15D officers will seek additional broadening opportunities prior to promotion to major.
They will attend Command and General Staff Course/ILE and the Army Logistics Manager Course-Support Opera-
tions. Major level maintenance officers will serve as Aviation support company commanders, brigade S4, division
Aviation maintenance officers, or other key logistical or operational combat arms staff officer positions. Lieutenant
colonel Aviation maintenance officers selected as Aviation support battalion commanders will attend the PCC and the
Army Logistics Manager Course-Senior Leaders Course. They will compete for colonel-level positions in operational
combat arms assignments, and serve in key staff positions at DCS, G–4 Program Executive Office (PEO) Aviation,
ARNG, or USAACE. They may compete for tactical brigade, training and maintenance brigade commands and colonel-
level brigade-equivalent CSL commands. Colonel-level maintenance commands include: Aviation Center Logistics
Command, 128th Aviation Brigade, and Corpus Christi Army Depot. These aviators compete for command opportuni-
ties in AOC 15B and 15D.

selected for their tactical expertise and leadership ability to become the ARSOA commander’s direct representative to
the supported ground force during the planning and execution of the most sensitive ARSOA missions. Only a small
98                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

percentage of special operations aviators will reach this qualification level, and as a result all ARSOA operational
planners are assigned duties at the brigade staff level.
   (d) Functional roles. Special operations aviators operate within the same functional roles and perform at the same
duty positions as conventional warrant officer aviators, although the specialized training required when entering
ARSOA may delay these career goals when compared to their conventional counterparts. In addition to the position
opportunities at battalion and brigade staff levels available to conventional aviators, ARSOA aviators may also be
assigned to positions within the ARSOA special operations Aviation training battalion (SOATB), research/development
and acquisition within the systems integration and maintenance office (SIMO), or the U.S. ARSOA Command.

   (8) Command chief warrant officer. The CCWO of the CAB is empowered by the CAB commander and a critical
component of the daily operations, mission command, and leadership of the organization. The CCWO will serve as the
principal warrant officer leader for the CAB, advise and assist the CAB commander, subordinate commanders, staff,
and warrant officers on all aspects of CAB operations. The CCWO will oversee warrant officer issues including
assignments, PME, promotion readiness, career advancement, accessions, professional development and legal matters.
The CCWO is responsible for enforcing the policies of performance, training, appearance, and conduct. The CCWO
will communicate and coordinate with the chief warrant officer of the Aviation Branch, the HR command chief of
Aviation warrant officer assignments, other CAB and higher headquarters senior warrant officer. CCWOs will also
coordinate with battalion/squadron SPs, Aviation safety officer, AMSOs, maintenance test pilots, and senior warrant
officers, as required, pertaining to their units.
10–6. Aviation Branch Reserve Component warrant officer
RC Aviation warrant officer development objectives and qualifications basically parallel those planned for their AA
counterparts (see para 10–5). As with the RC commissioned officer, the RC warrant officer’s “part-time” status also
poses a unique challenge for professional development. RC warrant officers are expected to follow AC warrant officer
                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           99

development patterns as closely as possible. RC warrant officers also have increased time windows to complete
mandatory aircraft progression and educational requirements. In most cases, the RC Aviation warrant officers have the
option of resident or DL training
   a. Assignment oriented training. Assignment oriented training is an important element in the development of the
Aviation warrant officer. The goal of assignment oriented training is for warrant officers to receive the required
specific training for the right grade, at the right time, in order to produce warrant officers who are capable, agile,
tactical and technical experts. Examples of assignment oriented training are: The Safety Officer Course, Army logistics
courses, Aviation Maintenance Technicians Course Government Flight Representative Course. The Contracting Officer
Representative Course, the Army Maintenance Manager’s Course, Small Unmanned Aircraft System course, Instructor
Pilot, Maintenance Test Pilot, AMSO, Instrument Flight Examiner, and Master Gunner course. RC Aviation warrant
officers are managed in the same manner as the RC commissioned officer. Aviation warrant officers must attain PME
levels commensurate with their grade and assignment, using resident and nonresident instruction options. As Aviation
Branch aircraft systems increase in complexity and capability, a corresponding increase occurs in tactical employment
capabilities.
   b. Professional development. Warrant officers simultaneously advance civilian and military careers. To minimize
any adverse effects on their civilian careers, USAACE and the WOCC have developed RC courses specifically tailored
to reduce the resident instructional time. Aviation warrant officers are adaptive technical experts, leaders, trainers, and
advisors. Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, they plan, administer,
manage, maintain, and operate in support of the full range of Army, joint, combined, and coalition operations. Warrant
officers are teachers, warfighters, and developers of specialized teams of Soldiers. Throughout their career warrant
officers should continue their self-development, to include the pursuit of a specialty-related graduate degree and/or
advanced industry certification programs. The following are the professional development goals for warrant officers:
   (1) Complete an associate’s degree in a MOS related degree program and/or an MOS related certification program
to remain competitive for promotion to CW3.
   (2) Complete a baccalaureate degree in an MOS related degree program and/or an advanced certification program to
remain competitive for promotion to CW4.
   (3) Complete a graduate degree in an MOS related degree program and/or a second advanced certification program
to remain competitive for promotion to CW5. Aviation RC warrant officer MOS’s align with the AA warrant officer
MOSs. (See career development models figs 10–6, 10–7, 10–8, and 10–9.)
Chapter 11
Field Artillery Branch
11–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. The mission of the Field Artillery is to destroy, defeat, or disrupt the enemy with integrated fires to
enable maneuver commanders to dominate in unified land operations.
   b. The way ahead. The Field Artillery branch develops officers who are uniquely qualified to support Army and
joint forces commanders. Field Artillery officers serve in every combined arms formation in the United States Army.
They work directly for maneuver commanders in infantry, Stryker, armor, airborne, air assault and Ranger units to
coordinate, synchronize, and integrate Army, joint (Air Force, Navy, and Marine), and multinational assets to create
effects on targets.
   c. Unique functions performed by Field Artillery officers. Field Artillery officers are multifunctional professionals
who are the Army’s experts in the coordination, synchronization and integration of joint fires and Army fires; they are
also leaders of Soldiers committed to providing precision, near precision and area fire effects. To ensure synchronized,
integrated, and effective fires that enable the maneuver commander to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative, Field
Artillery officers are proficient in the Army’s two core competencies as identified in ADP 3–0 (combined arms
maneuver and wide area security).
   d. Unique features of work in the Field Artillery Branch.
   (1) Command Field Artillery battery, battalion, brigade, and Division Artillery (DIVARTY) formations in combined
arms, joint, and multinational operations.
   (2) Command BCDs in support of Army, Theater, and Joint forces commanders to facilitate the synchronization of
air and ground operations.
   (3) Command BCTs, divisions and other senior Army and joint headquarters at corps and above.
   (4) Serve as fire support officers (FSOs) responsible for planning, coordinating, synchronizing and integrating joint
and indirect fires capabilities through the operations and targeting processes.
   (5) Create and formulate doctrine, organizations, material solutions, and leader development models to accomplish
the fire support mission worldwide.
   (6) Instruct Field Artillery and fire support skills at service schools, joint training venues, and CTC’s.
100                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (7) Lead in positions requiring advanced joint and operational experience such as staff officers in Army, special
operations and joint headquarters and activities requiring joint planning experience.
   (8) Instruct at pre-commissioning programs, service and branch schools, and service colleges.
   e. Branch eligibility. The Field Artillery branch is open to both male and female officers. As of 14 November 2013,
all Field Artillery officer positions, with the exception of SOF, are open to males and females. Throughout FY 2014,
the Army will begin integrating female officers into staff and leadership positions in cannon units and into company
and battalion fires support officer positions. The Field Artillery proponent office and the Field Artillery branch
assignment office is the best source of current information about evolving assignment policies for female officers.
11–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. General. The Field Artillery branch requires officers who are, first and foremost, leaders of Soldiers. They must
be mentally and physically disciplined and well-versed in Field Artillery, combined arms and joint tactics, techniques
and procedures. They are warriors who possess the moral, intellectual and interpersonal characteristics that enable
organizational and individual success. They must be grounded in Army Values and the Warrior Ethos. As joint fires
experts, they must be able to leverage capabilities beyond those found in the Army.
   b. Competencies and actions common to all. Field Artillery officers are valued as leaders, trainers and planners.
These competencies are developed and perfected through realistic training, strict adherence to standards, PME, and
service in the most demanding positions in the Field Artillery and across the Army and joint communities. The Field
Artillery branch, and our Army, values a broadened leader with experience serving in both operating and generating
force assignments, and in a variety of Army and joint assignments.
   c. Skills unique to Field Artillery officers. Field Artillery officers lead cannon and rocket/missile Artillery organiza-
tions in the delivery of fires. Maneuver and special operations commanders look to their Field Artillery officers to plan,
coordinate, integrate and synchronize fires. To effectively complete their mission, Field Artillery officers require the
development of unique skills. They must be:
   (1) The experts in the employment of all indirect fire systems and the coordination, synchronization and integration
of Army and joint fires.
   (2) Trained and proficient in the employment of surface to surface and air to surface precision fires capabilities.
   (3) Proficient in the art and science of combined arms, special operations, and joint warfare.
   (4) Proficient in the Army’s two core competencies—combined arms maneuver and wide area security.
   (5) Team builders who are equally skilled in leading Soldiers and collaborating with leaders from other branches,
services and nations to enable mission success.
   (6) Imaginative, agile and adaptive. Field Artillery officers are required to solve complex problems.
11–3. Officer development
   a. Lieutenants. The professional objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop requisite Field Artillery
branch skills. Specifically, lieutenants will focus on developing platoon level leadership skills, mastering basic Field
Artillery technical and tactical competencies, and developing combined arms fire support integration skills and
competencies. Lieutenants will certify in cannon and rocket platoon tactics and procedures and in the Army profession.
Those lieutenants serving in BCTs will also certify on company fire support tactics and procedures. All lieutenants will
serve in challenging leadership assignments to grow their confidence and capability to lead Soldiers.
   (1) Education.
   (a) Basic Officer Leaders Course B. Field Artillery BOLC B is an 18 week, 4 day course. The course will produce
an adaptive officer who is technically and tactically competent in Fire Support and Field Artillery tactics, techniques
and procedures. Instruction in BOLC B occurs over three phases. Phase one focuses on common Soldier skills and lasts
3 weeks. Phase II is 14 weeks long and teaches fire support and Field Artillery technical skills. Phase III is a capstone
field training exercise designed to validate learning and allow the officer to experience the employment of Field
Artillery assets in a combat environment.
   (b) Joint fires observer. Beginning in July 2014, all officers will receive Joint fires observer certification training in
Phase II of BOLC. Joint fires observer certification is a graduation requirement from FA BOLC regardless of the
lieutenant’s first unit of assignment. Lieutenants will maintain their Joint fires observer currency through their assigned
unit’s Joint fires observer program, as required. A Joint fires observer is a certified/qualified Servicemember trained to
request, control and adjust surface to surface fires, provide timely and accurate targeting information in support of
close air support to a Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), Forward Air Controller - Airborne (FAC-A), or directly
to an aircraft when authorized by the controlling JTAC/FAC-A, and perform autonomous terminal guidance operations.
Field Artillery lieutenants are expected to be subject matter experts on the planning, coordination and integration of all
fires, especially when assigned as FSOs.
   (c) Rangers. Field Artillery lieutenants may volunteer for Ranger training. Lieutenants desiring to attend Ranger
training are afforded an opportunity to participate in the Pre-Ranger Training Program as part of BOLC B. Officers
who successfully complete this program will normally attend Ranger and Airborne School immediately after BOLC B.
   (2) Assignment. The professional development of Field Artillery lieutenants is dependent upon assignment based
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              101

experiences to enable exposure to the breadth of skills required of Field Artillery officers. Brigade and battalion
commanders will actively manage their lieutenants to grow talented Field Artillery officers who possess a breadth of
fire support and Field Artillery technical skills.
   (a) The typical Field Artillery lieutenant will be assigned to a maneuver BCT or a Field Artillery brigade.
Lieutenants in BCTs can expect to be assigned as battery XOs, platoon leaders, fire direction officers, company FSOs
and staff officers within their respective battalions. Every lieutenant assigned to a BCT will perform duties as an FSO
and serve in at least one assignment in a firing battery. Geographical dispersion and other extreme circumstances may,
from time to time, prevent every lieutenant from serving in both fire support and firing battery assignments.
   (b) Lieutenants in Field Artillery brigades can expect to be assigned as battery XOs, platoon leaders, fire direction
officers, and staff officers within their respective battalions. Some lieutenants will be assigned as an XO in the target
acquisition battery. Every lieutenant assigned to a Field Artillery brigade will perform duties in at least two of these
positions to develop their knowledge and skills.
   (c) Lieutenants initially assigned to generating force training brigades can expect rewarding developmental assign-
ments that enable their professional growth and the development of leadership skills. These officers must be intensively
managed and provided an opportunity to serve in an operational force unit to ensure the development of their technical
and tactical skills during their formative years.
   (3) Self-development. As aspiring professionals, lieutenants must focus their self-development on the three broad
criteria which identify Army professionals: competence, character and commitment.
   (a) Competence. Lieutenants should focus on developing Field Artillery and fire support technical and tactical skills,
refining their troop-leading skills, and gaining an in-depth knowledge of training management, organizational mainte-
nance, supply operations, and administrative operations.
   (b) Character. Field Artillery officers must maintain a moral character that is beyond reproach. Mission success in
the Field Artillery is dependent upon precision and accuracy. Our maneuver counterparts trust that we will deliver
timely and accurate fires. Their trust is gained through the repeated demonstration of our character.
   (c) Commitment. Field Artillery lieutenants must take the initiative to gain knowledge and experience to prepare for
assignment as a captain. Structured and continuous self-development will contribute to lifelong success and honorable
service in the branch.
   (4) Desired experience. Field Artillery officers should complete their time as lieutenants with a strong capability
portfolio of technical, tactical, and procedural artillery skills, fire support employment skills, and troop-leading skills.
Lieutenants must certify on the weapon system to which they are assigned and demonstrate strong knowledge of
company-level fire support planning, coordination and integration.
   b. Captains. The professional objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to lead Soldiers and accomplish
organizational missions. Field Artillery captains will demonstrate technical proficiency in all aspects of Field Artillery
gunnery, specific to the system which they are assigned. They will have an in-depth knowledge of synchronizing and
integrating fires at the maneuver battalion level. After completion of command, captains will become exposed to
numerous opportunities to grow knowledge and experiences beyond those required in tactical formations.
   (1) Education.
   (a) Field Artillery officers will attend a CCC as soon as practicable after promotion to captain. Field commanders,
in coordination with HRC, will determine the best time for an individual to attend school based on Army requirements,
the needs of the unit, the continued professional development requirements of the officer, and the officer’s individual
preferences.
   (b) The Field Artillery CCC consists of 8 weeks of common core plus 16 weeks of branch-specific instruction. This
training prepares officers to command at battery level, perform fire support coordination as a battalion FSO, and work
as a key staff officer in a battalion or brigade.
   (c) A small number of captains will have the opportunity to attend the MC3 or the Marine Expeditionary Warfare
School. These broadening opportunities benefit officers of all branches and services. Selection is competitive and
reserved for officers with strong performance in previous assignments.
   (2) Assignments. Field Artillery company grade officers must grow experience and develop skills across the breadth
of formations and weapon systems in the Field Artillery and the Army. HRC will assign captains, who served in BCTs
as lieutenants, to Field Artillery brigades or to maneuver brigades with a different weapon system than what the officer
previously experienced. Conversely, officers who served in Field Artillery brigades as lieutenants will be assigned to
BCTs. This is specifically designed to grow the capability portfolio of each officer.
   (a) Battery command. Battery command is the KD assignment for Field Artillery captains. Command is a privilege,
not a right. DIVARTY, brigade, and battalion commanders will assess the knowledge, skills, attributes and readiness of
their Field Artillery officers and will afford command to those officers who are ready. Command tour lengths should
not exceed 18 months. A minimum of 12 months is required to be considered qualified. Some captains may be
afforded a second command opportunity. Second command opportunities are usually reserved for commands that
present a unique and more diverse challenge (where the unit and Soldiers would benefit significantly by having a
commander with previous command experience). Officers who command more than once should complete their total
command time in 24 months.
102                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (b) Battalion fire support officer. Field Artillery officers should aggressively seek to serve as a battalion FSO in a
maneuver battalion. This experience provides the greatest insights to planning, coordinating, synchronizing, and
employing Army and joint fires and reinforces skills for the integration of fires at the tactical level. Assignment as a
battalion FSO is not considered a KD assignment for branch qualification but is complementary to battery command;
together, these two assignments provide the greatest breadth of experience a Field Artillery officer can achieve at the
company grade level.
   (c) Developmental assignments. A wide variety of interesting and challenging assignments are available to Field
Artillery captains. Upon completion of a CCC, the majority of captains will be assigned to Field Artillery cannon or
rocket battalions or to fire support positions with maneuver battalions. Success in the assignments listed below will
prepare captains for command opportunities and further success within the Field Artillery:
   1. Fires battalion assistant S3.
   2. Fires battalion fire direction officer.
   3. Primary staff officer within a battalion.
   (d) Post-battery command broadening assignments. After completion of battery command, Field Artillery officers
become available for assignments across the Army and joint forces. Where possible, individual officers, in coordination
with their respective HRC assignment officer, should seek assignments that coincide with their career objectives and
goals. The assignment of post-battery command officers is an important process that integrates the desires of the
officer, input from the officer’s DIVARTY, brigade and battalion commanders, and the needs of the Field Artillery, the
Army and joint forces. Two of the most important post-battery command assignments are service as small group
instructors and CTC observer/coach/trainers. These assignments will remain nominative to ensure the best officers are
selected to grow the next generation of Field Artillery leaders. Select officers will be afforded the opportunity to serve
with SOF. Some of the more important post-battery command opportunities follow:
   1. Small group instructor.
   2. CTC observer/controller/trainer.
   3. Mission command training program (MCTP) operations officers.
   4. Ground liaison officers.
   5. SOF FSOs (includes Ranger and SF).
   6. BCT, Field Artillery brigade, and DIVARTY staff officers.
   7. Instructor positions (USMA faculty, ROTC, and other branch and service schools).
   8. AC/RC trainers or other RC duty.
   9. Branch immaterial positions (for example, USAREC staff, aide-de-camp, internships).
   10. Foreign exchange officer.
   (3) Self-development. Field Artillery captains are highly regarded as professionals. As such, captains should strive to
develop a complete understanding of combined arms operations and the related fire support tasks. This knowledge
provides the foundation of continued service in the branch. Captains must possess a working knowledge of command
principles, battalion-level staff operations, and combined arms and fire support operations. After command, they should
seek to broaden their perspectives in joint assignments due to the likelihood of future coalition warfare. All captains
should dedicate time to professional reading to gain a historical perspective on tactical and leadership challenges. Field
Artillery captains should consider beginning work on an advanced degree. Officers interested in the types of advanced
civil schooling programs and eligibility requirements are encouraged to begin an early dialogue with their branch
representative. Field Artillery captains are also encouraged to consider applying for any of several formal internships,
scholarships, and fellowships sponsored by the Army. A few of the more prominent opportunities include: the Arroyo
Fellowship, congressional fellowships, U.S. Army Cyber Command Scholarship Program, Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency and Service Chiefs’ Fellow Program, General Wayne A. Downing Scholarship, Joint Chief of Staff,
OSD, and the Department of Army Staff Intern Program, Olmsted Scholarship Program, Strategic Education and
Development Program, and the White House Fellowship.
   (4) Desired experience. The KD assignment for a Field Artillery captain is service as a battery commander. There is
no substitute for battery command. It develops the Field Artillery officer’s leadership skills and prepares him or her for
future leadership assignments at successively higher levels of responsibility. Where possible, every Field Artillery
captain should serve as a FSO to reinforce the knowledge and skills required for the integration of fires at the tactical
level.
   c. Majors. There are two primary objectives for this phase of an officer’s career: contribute experience and expertise
to the organizations to which the officer is assigned, and broaden their knowledge and skills pertaining to Army and
joint operations. Field Artillery majors are expected to be technically, tactically, and procedurally proficient in all
aspects of Field Artillery gunnery and fire support coordination and integration. Most will be afforded a KD
opportunity to serve as a brigade FSO, an S3 or XO, or a combination of these assignments. After completion of their
KD time, Field Artillery majors will be afforded opportunities to continue building on the experience they gained as
lieutenants and captains in joint assignments and operations.
   (1) Education. Majors are required to complete ILE. ILE is designed to develop leaders who will train and fight at
the tactical and operational levels of war. It prepares officers for duty as field grade commanders and staff officers,
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           103

principally at division and corps levels. The specific window when an officer attends ILE is a careful process which
takes into consideration input from the individual officer, the officer’s DIVARTY, brigade and battalion commanders,
and the current needs of the Army. Ideally, an officer will attend ILE as soon as possible after promotion to major and
prior to service in a KD assignment. While at ILE, officers may also compete for selection to attend the AMSP within
the SAMS. Those selected to attend AMSP must serve a utilization tour as a corps or division plans or operations/
assistant DCS, G–3/5/7 staff officer. Majors serving in special operations units may attend the Special Operations
Terminal Attack Controller Course resourced through the USASOC in order to conduct terminal attack control as
special operations JTACs.
   (2) Assignments. The goal of the Field Artillery branch is to provide majors the opportunity to serve 24 months in
KD positions. The KD assignments are brigade FSO, DIVARTY, BCT or Field Artillery brigade S3 or XO, and
battalion S3 or XO. While 12 months is the minimum standard, a Field Artillery major will normally serve 24 months
in KD assignments. Commanders should assign their best majors as brigade FSOs for the development of the officer
and to provide the best support to our maneuver commanders. While a 12-month assignment as a brigade FSO meets
the KD assignment requirement, officers should also serve at least 12 months in one or more battalion, brigade, or
DIVARTY KD assignments. The cumulative experience gained on battalion, brigade, and DIVARTY staffs provides
the greatest development for a Field Artillery major. Strong performance in these KD positions is a clear indicator of
future potential for service as a battalion commander.
   (a) Developmental assignments. Upon completion of ILE, field artillery majors may be assigned to a variety of
duties including division and corps fire support elements, BCT and Field Artillery brigade and DIVARTY staffs, or
directly to Field Artillery cannon or rocket battalions. Developmental assignments enable a major to further develop
knowledge and skills to succeed in a branch qualifying assignment. Example developmental assignments follow:
   1. Small group instructor.
   2. Division/corps/echelons above corps assistant FSO.
   3. BCT, Field Artillery brigade or DIVARTY assistant S3.
   4. AC/RC S3/XO.
   5. Instructor (USMA faculty and staff, ROTC Assistant Professor of Military Science, service school instructor).
   6. Multinational and coalition trainer and staff officer.
   (b) Post-key developmental broadening assignments. After completion of KD assignment(s), Field Artillery officers
become available for employment in assignments across the Army and joint forces. Where possible, individual officers,
in coordination with their respective HRC assignment officer, should seek assignments that coincide with their career
objectives and goals. A few of the more important post-KD assignments are service on the joint or Army Staff, as a
CTC observer/coach/trainer, or in the special operations command. These assignments will remain nominative to
ensure the best officers are selected to grow the next generation of Field Artillery leaders. Some of the more important
post-KD opportunities follow:
   1. Joint or Army staff positions.
   2. Operations officer of a BCD.
   3. CTC observer/controller/trainer.
   4. Ranger or SF FSO.
   5. MCTP observer/trainer.
   6. Doctrine/training developer.
   (3) Self-development. Field Artillery majors are expected to develop their organizational leadership skills, broaden
their strategic perspectives, and hone operational skills. They will be required to develop and use a diverse set of skills
as they move between combined arms leadership positions in operating and generating force organizations and joint
assignments. Majors should continue self-development and lifelong learning efforts to become an expert in all aspects
of fire support coordination to include joint and multinational operations. Self-development should include correspond-
ence courses, civilian education, and institutional training. Officers should also devote time to a professional reading
program to broaden their warfighting perspective.
   (4) Desired experience. The Field Artillery major should be able to demonstrate proficiency in planning and
executing fires for combined arms maneuver and wide area security operations in the joint environment. Beyond
qualification as a major, the need for expeditionary experiences, to include joint assignments, is essential to the
development of all field grade officers. To the greatest extent possible, Field Artillery majors should seek assignments
and schooling providing unique joint perspectives and experiences.
   d. Lieutenant colonels. The professional objective for this phase of an officer’s career is demonstrated excellence in
tactical skills, technical proficiency and the ability to lead, train, motivate and care for Soldiers in both command and
staff environments. Field Artillery lieutenant colonels are leaders in the branch and in the Fires, Army and Joint
communities. They plan, coordinate, integrate, and synchronize all fires in support of unified land operations and they
are strategic leaders who serve in joint and multinational commands.
   (1) Education. Lieutenant colonels selected for command will complete one or more PCCs and may be selected to
attend a SSC. After command, officers selected for joint assignments must complete JPME training.
   (2) Assignments. The KD assignment for Field Artillery lieutenant colonels is centrally selected battalion command
104                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

in the operating or generating force. Field Artillery lieutenant colonels may compete for CSL commands in the
following categories: field artillery operations, field artillery training, combat arms installation, branch immaterial
installation, branch immaterial strategic support, branch immaterial recruiting and training, branch immaterial opera-
tions, combat arms training, and asymmetrical strategic support. While only a small percentage of Field Artillery
lieutenant colonels will command a battalion, all lieutenant colonels have a remarkable opportunity to make significant
contributions to the branch and the Army. All Field Artillery lieutenant colonels can expect to serve in a wide variety
of professionally challenging and personally rewarding assignments in the operating and generating forces. Some of the
more significant assignments include:
   (a) Joint or Army staff positions.*
   (b) NATO staff, combatant commands staff.*
   (c) Senior fire support observer/controller at one of the CTCs (MCTP, JMRC, JRTC, NTC).*
   (d) Corps/division staff officer.
   (e) Special Operations FSO.
   (f) BCD plans officer.
   (g) Fires assignments in TRADOC, Army Air and Missile Defense Commands (AAMDCs), and ADA brigades.
   (h) AC/RC training support team chief/commander.
   (i) Service branch school staff and instructors.
   (j) ROTC Professor of Military Science. Note. *Denotes typical former battalion commander billets. Former
battalion commanders will be assigned to specific billets coded for former battalion commanders. All former battalion
commander assignments are individually approved by the CG, Fires Center of Excellence.
   (3) Self-development. Self-development should be focused on mastering mentoring and managerial skills, continuing
development of warfighting and fire support skills, and growing capabilities to serve as operational, strategic and fires
leaders for the Army and joint forces. Lieutenant colonels not selected for resident SSC should enroll in nonresident
SSC courses.
   (4) Desired experience. Not every officer will command. However, Field Artillery lieutenant colonels are highly
valued across the Army and joint communities. Their technical and tactical skills and knowledge of combined arms and
joint operations enable tremendous opportunity for assignment and contribution throughout the Army and joint
communities.
   e. Colonels. The professional objective for this phase of an officer’s career is the employment of the leadership,
managerial and executive talents developed throughout the officer’s career. Colonels are expected to be multi-skilled
leaders, strategic and creative thinkers, builders of leaders and teams, and competent warfighters. Field Artillery
colonels contribute to the Army by serving in crucial assignments in command and senior staff positions. The critical
task during this phase is to fully develop the broad skills and competencies required of an agile and adaptive leader,
while maintaining branch competency (warfighting skills).
   (1) Education. Selection for resident SSC attendance is a highly competitive process and not all officers selected for
promotion to colonel will attend a resident course. Those not CSL-selected should enroll in a nonresident SSC course.
Those selected to command will also attend one or more PCCs. Officers serving as TRADOC capability managers may
attend the Combat Developers Course.
   (2) Assignments. The KD assignment for a Field Artillery colonel is selection for brigade, DIVARTY or O6 CSL
equivalent command. Field Artillery colonels may compete for CSL commands in the following categories: Field
Artillery operations, Field Artillery/ADA (Fires) key billet, Field Artillery training, Field Artillery installation, combat
arms (maneuver) operations, combat arms installation, combat arms strategic support, branch immaterial recruiting and
training, and branch immaterial installation. Some of the more significant assignments for Field Artillery colonels
include:
   (a) Division/corps/echelons above corps chief of fires.
   (b) Division or corps chief of staff.
   (c) Division, corps, or field army assistant chief of staff, DCS, G–3/5/7.
   (d) CTC operations group commander/chief of staff.
   (e) MCTP commander or chief of operations groups
   (f) TRADOC capabilities manager.
   (g) XO to a general officer.
   (h) Department director, U.S. Army Fires Center of Excellence.
   (i) HQDA or joint staff.
   (3) Self-development. Field Artillery colonels must maintain their branch skills and keep current on all changes that
affect the Soldiers they command and/or lead.
   (4) Desired experience. The primary goal at this stage is to fully use the experience and knowledge gained to
provide significant contributions to the operating and generating force. Field Artillery colonels are expected to be
strategic and creative thinkers; builders of leaders and teams; competent warfighters and fire supporters; and skilled in
governance, statesmanship, and diplomacy. They influence policy within the Army and the DOD. Field Artillery
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                               105

colonels will encounter a variety of assignments where their fire support, operational and strategic experience will
enable success.
11–4. Assignment preferences
The goal of the Field Artillery branch is to grow a Field Artillery expert who is technically and tactically prepared to
lead Soldiers and command units in combat. Assignments in joint and combined arms organizations will develop the
officer’s overall ability to achieve that goal. Assignments are based on Army requirements, the officer’s professional
development needs and the officer’s preferences. While Field Artillery Branch will consider the individual officer’s
preferences, the needs of the Army and the officer’s professional development needs will take priority. Because of the
quantity and variety of joint and combined environments that Field Artillery officers serve in, a recognized benefit of
service in the Field Artillery is that senior Field Artillery officers are prepared to assume roles as operational and
strategic leaders in our Army and joint forces.
11–5. Duration of critical officer life-cycle assignments
   a. The Field Artillery officer will serve in several key and developmental positions as they progress through their
career in order to develop a joint and expeditionary mindset, tactical and technical expertise in combined arms warfare,
and a firm grounding in Field Artillery operations. There is no substitute for service in key leadership positions. The
Field Artillery officer development model exists to enable the best possible decisions for the development of each
officer. The goal of the Field Artillery officer PDM is to provide the Field Artillery officer a series of leadership and
operational staff positions, supplemented by opportunities to round out their knowledge in key generating force
assignments in order to achieve success in positions of leadership at successively higher levels. The model is designed
to prepare the greatest population of officers to excel across the spectrum of Field Artillery systems in platoon
leadership, battery command, S3/XO assignments, battalion, brigade and DIVARTY level command, and in planning,
coordinating and integrating fire support for our maneuver counterparts at every level from platoon through joint
headquarters.
   b. Figure 11–1 shows how PME, key and developmental assignments and self-development fit together to support
the Field Artillery branch goal of growing agile and adaptive leaders.

11–6. Key officer life-cycle initiatives
   a. Structure. The majority of assignment opportunities in the operating force will reside within the infantry, Stryker
or armored BCT’s or Field Artillery brigades. As an officer progresses in rank, there are greater opportunities to serve
in the generating force.
   b. Acquire. The Field Artillery branch will identify and actively recruit the most talented cadets to become Field
Artillery officers. Officers will continue to be accessed through USMA, ROTC, OCS, and WOCS. Accessions are
based on officer preference and the needs of the Army. The branch will also remain a recipient of branch detail officers
from other branches. Branch detailed officers return to their commissioning branch upon their selection to captain and
assignment to their branch transition course.
   c. Distribute. The assignment process supports the Field Artillery officer development model. Specifically, the
model is designed to ensure an officer achieves the broadest exposure to the variety of systems, tactics, techniques and
procedures that exist within the branch. This broadened exposure enables the greatest opportunity to develop a branch
of highly skilled joint Fires experts. Field Artillery officer assignment patterns will vary according to Army require-
ments, unit Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) timelines, individual officer development requirements, and individ-
ual officer preferences.
   d. Deploy. The purpose of the U.S. Army is to fight and win our Nation’s wars. All Field Artillery officers must
remain fully deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of operations.
   e. Sustain. Field Artillery technical and tactical skills are maintained through institutional training, assignments in
warfighting units, and self-development.
   (1) Promotion. Field Artillery officers compete for promotion within the operations functional category and are
selected for promotion based on recognized performance and identified potential.
   (2) Command. Lieutenant colonel and colonel-level commanders will be selected through a centralized selection
board process. Field Artillery officers are competitive in all command categories.
   (3) Officer evaluation report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS.
   f. Develop. Field Artillery officers are expected to be experts in the employment of all joint Fires. To achieve this,
officer development will occur across the spectrum of progressive assignments in operational and generating forces,
specific PME, integrated leader and peer development (including the MSAF tool), and self-development. In order to
lead in a rapidly changing global environment, Field Artillery officers must engage in a continuum of cultural and
foreign-language training that spans the duration of their careers.
11–7. Warrant officer development
   a. Unique knowledge and skills of a Field Artillery warrant officer. The Field Artillery warrant officer provides
assistance and advice to the commander and staff on all matters relative to targeting including the employment of Field
Artillery target acquisition assets, fire support assets, precision targeting, and collateral damage estimation. They serve
as target acquisition platoon leaders, counterfire officers, Field Artillery intelligence officers, targeting analysts, and
targeting officers. Their responsibilities include integrating lethal and nonlethal fire support from battalion through joint
Force headquarters levels.
   b. Unique attributes of Field Artillery warrant officers. Field Artillery warrant officers must possess the same
attributes of an FA Officer as well as a high degree of technical and tactical knowledge of the targeting process,
sensors, delivery assets and their employment. They are accessed from Field Artillery enlisted MOSs (CMF13) as well
as infantry mortar crewmembers (11C) who carry forward the competencies learned while serving in their respective
fields. Continuous education, training, experience, and self-development enhance the Field Artillery warrant officer’s
technical expertise.
   c. Roles and functions. Field Artillery warrant officers provide many of the same functions as the Field Artillery
officers except command of tactical units. Field Artillery warrant officers perform the following functions/tasks:
   (1) Lead Field Artillery target acquisition platoons.
   (2) Assist in managing Field Artillery target acquisition and all collection assets employment at the Field Artillery
battalion, brigade, division, and corps level.
   (3) Provide technical and tactical expertise in the coordination of the targeting process in combined arms or joint
operations at all levels.
   (4) Manage unit precision targeting program.
   (5) Provide technical and tactical expertise in target coordinate mensuration, weaponeering, and collateral damage
estimation methodologies.
   (6) Teach targeting and target acquisition asset employment at service schools and CTCs.
   d. Warrant officer one development.
   (1) Education.
   (a) Upon selection to become a warrant officer, all NCO will complete WOCS. Phase I of WOCS is a distant
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              107

learning course. There is one Phase I distance learning class scheduled, covering the entire training year. Once enrolled
in ATRRS for Course 911–09W (distance learning), warrant officers may access the training at https://blackboard3.
leavenworth.army.mil by logging in with their Army Knowledge Online (AKO) username and password. Phase II is a
four-week resident course at Fort Rucker, AL. Upon graduation from WOCS and appointment to WO1, each officer
will attend 30 weeks of WOBC at Fort Sill, OK. National Guard and Reserve warrant officers have the option to attend
a two-phased WOBC. The first phase is 12 weeks of target acquisition training followed by 19 weeks of targeting
training. These two phases must be completed within 3 years of warrant officer service.
   (b) Selectees are advised to complete the WOBC Advantage Program prior to reporting for WOBC. WOBC
Advantage Program is designed to mentally prepare warrant officer for the academic rigor and workload associated
with FA WOBC.
   (c) The purpose of the FA WOBC is to certify warrant officers as technically and tactically competent officers able
to serve in the Field Artillery. WOBC is the first major test a newly appointed FA warrant officer must pass to
continue serving in the Army as a FA warrant officer. Warrant officers in WOBC will certify in target mensuration
only and collateral damage estimation procedures as a graduation requirement. They will also receive instruction in
weaponeering procedures.
   (2) Assignments. After WOBC, WO1s are assigned as target acquisition platoon leaders and battalion targeting
officers.
   (3) Self-development. Self-development during this phase should focus on the integration of target acquisition assets,
sensor management, organizational maintenance, and leadership skills.
   (4) Desired experience. A high degree of comprehension and technical competence in Field Artillery systems,
intelligence collection assets, and targeting-related computer enhanced technology is desired.
   e. Chief warrant officer two development.
   (1) Education. CW2s will attend assignment oriented training to increase their knowledge in joint targeting or a
special skill area such as precision targeting and collateral damage estimation. It is highly recommended that CW2s
attend WOAC as early as possible once they are eligible to attend. This 12 week technical/institutional course will
greatly enhance their skills and effectiveness as targeting officers and Field Artillery intelligence officers in the BCT/
division/corps positions. Completion of an associate’s degree is a recommended goal prior to becoming eligible for
promotion to CW3.
   (2) Assignments. CW2s are normally assigned as a battalion/BCT target analyst, battalion/BCT targeting officer, or
counterfire officers. As such, they are required to have a top secret security clearance. Senior and mid-grade CW2s will
also have an opportunity to serve as corps/division Field Artillery Intelligence officers. This experience will allow
many CW2s to utilize and stay current on their joint, interagency, intergovernmental and multinational competencies.
CW2s will serve in Field Artillery brigades DIVARTYs as counterfire officers liason officers and lethal targeting
officers. CW2s will also serve in CABs.
   (3) Self-development. CW2s will need to gain knowledge and experience managing unit level precision targeting
education and collateral damage estimation. (Note: Paragraph (i) of this section shows a list of recommended

   (4) Desired experience. As a CW2, the focus is acquiring and refining the technical knowledge and tactical
experience to effectively conduct targeting operations, integration of target analyst sensors, and counterfire operations
within the BCT’s area of operations. CW2’s should acquire the knowledge and skills to perform precision targeting,
target cooordinate mensuration, and collateral damage estimation.
   f. Chief warrant officer three development.
   (1) Education. The WOAC is a 12 week course focused on advanced technical training and common leader
development subjects designed to prepare officers for assignment in senior targeting positions. The resident course
consists of advanced technical and tactical training in the targeting process at the division, corps, Joint Task Force, or
ASCC. Warrant officers in WOAC will recertify in target mensuration only and collateral damage estimation proce-
dures as a graduation requirement. They will also receive instruction in weaponeering procedures. WOAC should be
completed prior to reaching 1 year time in grade as a CW3. Completion of the DL Action Officer Development Course
(ST7000) is a prerequisite for WOAC attendance. Completion of a baccalaureate degree is a recommended goal prior
to becoming eligible for promotion to CW4.
   (2) Assignments. CW3s will be assigned as BCT, Field Artillery brigade and DIVARTY targeting officers, Field
Artillery brigade counterfire officers s, and as division/corps Field Artillery intelligence officers and Fires cell targeting
officers. Select warrant officers in the grade of CW3 can also expect to receive assignments that broaden their
experience as targeting officers and may serve in a generating force capacity such as the following:
   (a) CTC observer/controller/trainer.
   (b) MCTP O/T.
   (c) Service school instructors.
   (d) Combat developers.

108                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (3) Self-development. Assignment oriented training will be focused towards future positions that enhance the
officer’s duty performance.
   (4) Desired experience. CW3s will have served as a BCT level targeting officer prior to serving as a division, or
corps targeting officer/Field Artillery intelligence officer.
   g. Chief warrant officer four development.
   (1) Education. The WOSC is a 5-week professional development course taught at the WOCC, Fort Rucker, AL. The
course is executed in two phases which include: Phase I: distributed learning (DL) and Phase II: resident.
   (2) Assignments. CW4s will serve as Field Artillery intelligence officers and targeting officers in positions at
division, corps, and higher echelons or in generating force organizations. Select CW4s can also expect to receive
assignments consistent with the needs of the Army, such as the following:
   (a) Targeting officer in the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.
   (b) BCD targeting officer.
   (c) Service school instructor.
   (d) Combat developer.

                              Figure 11–2. AA Field Artillery warrant officer development model
11–8. Field Artillery Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. The RC career development model for Field Artillery officers/warrant officers
should essentially mirror that of the AC FA officers/warrant officers; therefore information, guidance and requirements
stated in paragraphs 11–1 to 11–7 also apply to RC Field Artillery officers. The following guidance and requirements
reflect the uniqueness of serving in RC units due to limited amount of FA units within some states and the
geographical locations of each unit.
   b. Branch developmental opportunities. RC officers should build a solid foundation in leadership, fire support skills,
and Field Artillery unit operations to successfully serve in the branch. Ideally this occurs through a variety of
assignments as FSOs at all levels, and in Artillery units, on staffs, and in support units where Field Artillery expertise
is needed. Because of geographic location or other considerations, RC Field Artillery officers may not have the
opportunity to serve in as many Field Artillery and fire support positions as active duty officers. However, this is offset
by longevity in tactical units in their geographic area. To meet career development requirements, a RC Field Artillery
officer must have the following:
   (1) Reserve Component battery/company grade officer standards.
   (a) Complete at least 90 hours of college credit to receive a commission.
   (b) Complete the Field Artillery BOLC B courses within 2 years of commissioning for an officer to be eligible for
promotion, a mobilization asset, and remain in the Army Reserve and ARNG.
   (c) Complete Field Artillery Captains Career Course (FACCC), either the resident FACCC–AC or RC course
FACCC–RC. Officers of other branches transferring to the Field Artillery are encouraged to attend a pre-course or take
advantage of home station training prior to enrolling in the FACCC.
   (d) Command a battery/company for 24 months (plus or minus 12 months) or served as one or more of the
following for 24 months (plus or minus 12 months). Other developmental assignments include: battalion FSO, battalion
FDO, or assistant operations officer at battalion or brigade level. Ideally, an officer will serve in a position through at
least two annual training periods.
110                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (2) Reserve Component field grade officer standards.
   (a) Reserve Component major. Majors must have completed 50 percent of their ILE to be eligible for promotion to
lieutenant colonel. To be best qualified, majors should seek (KD) positions as brigade or battalion XO/S3, or brigade
FSO. Optimally majors should spend 24 to 36 months in one or more of these positions.
   (b) Reserve Component lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels must have completed ILE to be eligible for promo-
tion to colonel. To be best qualified, lieutenant colonels should seek KD positions as battalion commanders. Other
developmental assignments include FSO or DCO assignments. Optimally, lieutenant colonels should spend 24 to 36
months in one or more of these positions.
   (c) Reserve Component colonel. Colonels serve as brigade-level commanders (Field Artillery brigade and BCT), and
in a variety of critical staff positions to include the senior guard advisor at the Fires Center of Excellence at Fort Sill,
division chief of fires, regional training institute commanders, and in a variety of branch immaterial positions at
division level and above.
   (3) Reserve Component selection boards. Lieutenant colonels and colonels are selected for SSC by a RC selection
board. For ARNG officers, the board is held at the NGB.
   (4) Battalion or brigade command. To be ready for Field Artillery battalion or brigade command, RC officers must
meet the appropriate educational requirements for the grade and position. Attendance at the Field Artillery PCC is also
recommended prior to assumption of command.
   (5) Continuing development. Officers desiring consideration for KD positions in RC Artillery units should aggres-
sively pursue positions that develop essential warfighting leader skills. Officers should continue self-development
efforts to become an expert in all aspects of fire support coordination to include joint and multinational operations.
Self-development should include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training. Officers should
devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their warfighting perspective. To be best qualified for the
lieutenant colonel promotion board and higher, officers should seek a master’s degree from an accredited institution of
higher learning.
   (6) Branch transfers. RC Field Artillery officers may have to branch transfer during the course of their careers due
to the lack of higher ranking positions in their geographic area. When an officer transfers into the Field Artillery,
completion of either the Field Artillery BOLC B or the FACCC is required before branch qualification is complete.
Commanders will consider the officer’s rank and experience in recommending which qualification course is required.
Commanders should closely manage branch transfer officers and assign them to a qualifying position concurrent with
enrollment in the Field Artillery BOLC B or FACCC.
   (7) Reserve Component guidance. For further guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7 in this pamphlet.
   (8) Field Artillery Reserve Component officer career life-cycle developmental and utilization model. Figure 11–3
displays the RC Field Artillery officer career developmental model.

Air Defense Artillery Branch
12–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. Army ADA organizations provide the Army and Joint forces with a capability to defend against a wide
array of hostile aerial and missile threats while ensuring a modular and expeditionary force able to meet future joint
force requirements. Combat-proven ADA weapons platforms (shooters) and early warning systems (sensors) provide
the Army and Joint forces with technologically advanced, fully digitized capabilities enabling detection and engage-
ment of air and missile threats much earlier, at greater distances, and with increased lethality while simultaneously
reducing risk to friendly forces. ADA organizations are ideally suited for frequent support to JIIM operations, and their
employment can achieve strategic, operational, and/or tactical advantage on the battlefield. ADA organizations are
constituted to remain operationally adaptable. ADAM cells at the divisions, BCTs, functional brigades (fires and CAB),
multifunctional brigades, and the ground-based mid-course defense (GMD) brigade add challenging assignment oppor-
tunities. Future relevant positions include assignments to Patriot and terminal high altitude area defense (THAAD)
batteries, indirect fire protection capability/Avenger battalions, the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated
Netted Sensor (JLENS), and the AN/TPY–2 forward based mode radar batteries.
   b. Proponent information. Chief of Air Defense Artillery, 730 Schimmelpfennig Road, Fort Sill, Oklahoma 73503.
Telephone number is DSN 495–0617 or commercial (580) 442–0617.
   c. Functions.
   (1) Air Defense Artillery unit missions vary based on system capabilities.
   (a) Avengers provide a gun/missile capability to supported maneuver elements. Integration with infantry, armor,
artillery, Aviation, and logistics elements are critical to the success of these systems on the battlefield.
   (b) Sentinel radars and the forward area air defense command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence
112                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

(C4I) digital communications architecture provide early warning, detection, and identification of enemy aircraft,
helicopters, UASs, remotely piloted vehicles, and cruise missiles.
   (c) Patriot missile systems neutralize a wide variety of air and missile threats. Routinely in support of joint and
multinational operational echelons, Patriot primarily functions as a tactical ballistic missile killer in the lower tier of the
terminal phase of flight.
   (d) THAAD missile systems defeat ballistic missile threats in the terminal phase of flight. Combatant commanders
deploy THAAD systems and radar variants as tactical and/or strategic assets.
   (e) Indirect fire protection capability systems provide advanced warning and intercept capability to Soldiers and
critical assets from indirect fire threats.
   (f) JLENS batteries provide persistent elevated coverage with a surveillance radar and fire control radar (FCR).
Combatant commands can utilize JLENS to mitigate masked terrain and provide queuing capabilities for other Air
Defense weapon systems.
   (2) The Way Ahead. As the Army experiences an era of increasing requirements in the face of diminishing
resources, ADA expects to see some growth as new units are activated. Total Army Analysis 16–20 has added an
additional THAAD battery for a total of 8 batteries. There is potential for the 16th and 17th Patriot battalions. The two
AC Avenger battalions will convert to indirect fire protection capability/Avenger battalions in FY 14 and 15. As of
November 2013, 53 percent of the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) force is forward stationed or deployed throughout
the world.
   (3) Unique features of work in Air Defense Artillery. The descriptions below provide a general overview of the
nature of work specific to ADA officers and warrant officers based on organizational design. The term ADA officer(s)
refers to both commissioned and warrant officers assigned to CMF 14. Specific career-path information is provided
throughout this document.
   (a) Assignments to MTOE units provide opportunities to command, control, and direct ADA organizations at
detachment, platoon, battery, battalion, and brigade levels. Staff assignments are also characteristic of MTOE assign-
ments. These skills are essential to professional development and expansion of experience in matters of personnel (S1),
intelligence (S2), training and operations (S3), and supply and logistics (S4).
   (b) Assignments in TDA organizations provide opportunities similar to those stated above, but lend themselves more
to broadening experiences such as capabilities, materiel, training development, and platform instruction for officers.
   (4) Air Defense Artillery officer tasks. The information below provides a broad outline of an ADA officer’s mission
essential task list:
   (a) Serve as Soldiers first and maintain the Warrior Ethos.
   (b) Integrate (plan and employ) ADA forces into Army or JIIM organizations to defeat third-dimension threats.
   (c) Plan Army airspace command and control and targeting as part of an Army or JIIM team.
   (d) Provide early warning of air and missile threats to Army and/or JIIM forces.
   (e) Serve as ADA advisors to U.S., allied, and coalition forces.
   (5) Air Defense Artillery assignment opportunities other than modified table of organization and equipment.
   (a) Develop, review, and evaluate doctrine and training for all ADA organizations.
   (b) Train, develop, and evaluate ADA skills at CTC.
   (c) Serve in positions requiring specific as well as general technical and tactical skills, such as staff officers in
organizations and activities requiring ADA expertise (includes JIIM and Army staffs).
   (d) Serve as instructors at pre-commissioning programs and service schools.
   (e) Serve as ADA advisors to ARNG and USAR component organizations.
12–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. General. For Army officers everything begins with the Warrior Ethos (see para 1–5). They must be warriors
grounded in refusal to accept failure. The Warrior Ethos is developed and sustained through discipline, commitment to
Army Values, and pride in the Army’s heritage.
   b. Knowledge and skills of an Air Defense Artillery officer. ADA officers are expected to be:
   (1) Joint and expeditionary minded.
   (2) Worldwide deployable, motivated, disciplined, and physically fit.
   (3) Grounded in core Army Values.
   (4) Capable of employing systems in tactical, operational, and/or strategic environments, training Soldiers and units
to perform their wartime missions, and developing plans as part of an Army or JIIM team.
   (5) Mentors, counselors, and coaches (see para 1–7).
12–3. Officer leader development
   a. Army Leader Development Strategy (see para 2–1). The Army Leader Development Strategy articulates charac-
teristics desired in Army leaders, providing guidance for career-long development through education, training, and
experience.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                                 113

   b. Air Defense Artillery officer development. The ADA branch provides diverse assignment opportunities allowing
for numerous career developmental paths. The branch strives to produce and sustain highly-qualified tactically and
operationally oriented officers through experience gained during a variety of assignments in either operational or
generating force units, or during broadening assignments and self-development activities.
   c. Goal. The goal is to maintain a vigorous, viable career path for ADA branch officers, through the leader
development domains of institutional training and education, operational assignments, and self-development.
   d. Branch life-cycle functions.
   (1) Structure. The preponderance of the ADA force serves in Patriot structures. There will be 13 Patriot battalions,
two composite Patriot/Avenger battalions, and two indirect fire protection capability/Avenger battalions under the
construct of five ADA brigades and three AAMDCs within the AC in accordance with the Total Army Analysis
2014–2018. The AAMDC, two ADA brigades, seven Avenger battalions, the GMD brigade and battalion in the ARNG
will remain vital to global force missions and the National Defense Strategy. Critical assignments remain in multifunc-
tional and functional BCTs, divisions, and corps and are integral to the ADAM/brigade Aviation element functional
concept as well as the Counter-UAS concept of operations.
   (2) Acquisition. Officers will continue to be accessed through USMA, ROTC, and OCS. Warrants will continue to
be recruited from the NCO Corps. Both officer and warrant officer accessions are based on preference, qualifications,
and needs of the Army. The branch will also remain a donor branch for detailed officers from other combat support/
combat service support branches.
   (3) Individual training and education. Job analysis identifying the required knowledge, skills, and abilities originally
led to the suggested training and education for CMF 14 officers listed within this publication. The training and
education has been periodically updated to conform to changing requirements and to maintain a clear path to
professional development.
   (4) Distribution. Officers will be provided assignment opportunities to develop the skills and experience base
necessary for service at the next higher grade. The sequencing and timing of assignments is driven by Army priorities.
As the Army draws down from overseas contingency operations, some legacy force structures will be eliminated or
changed, and new force structures will be added, which will ultimately drive assignments.
   (5) Deployment. ADA officers are warfighters who must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to warfighter-centric units or training organizations, readiness is imperative to
the success of the mission. ADA officers must prepare themselves and their families for planned and no-notice
deployments.
   (6) Sustainment. OPMS.
   (a) Promotion. Skills, experience, duty performance, and adherence to branch requirements are all factors influenc-
ing promotion; promotion rates will be determined by Army needs and the DOPMA goals.
   (b) Command. Commands at battalion and brigade level are organized into four functional categories: operations,
strategic support, recruiting and training, and installation. Officers have the option to compete for selection within a
desired command category and can decline other categories without prejudice. Officers selected for command may
submit operational and personal deferment requests. Since the CSL process may change, officers should contact ADA
assignments officers at HRC to receive the latest information. The results of the command selection process are
announced in the CSL. (Note. This subparagraph is not applicable to warrant officers.)
   (c) Officer evaluation report. The OER will reinforce the link between officer development and the OPMS.
   (7) Professional development. Officer development should occur through a methodological sequence of institutional
training and education, progressive operational and broadening assignments in tactical, training, and staff assignments,
and self-development. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly perform ADA mission essential task
list-related functions during joint and combined arms operations. A detailed discussion of officer development can be
found in this publication at paragraph 3–4.
   (8) Transition. The officer separation process remains unchanged; however ADA officers need to be mindful of the
coming fluctuations of the Army force structure and leverage opportunities to transition to a shortage career field
should ADA become overstrength.
   e. Lieutenant development. See paragraph 3–5.
   (1) Education. The lieutenant attends the ADA BOLC B (proponent institutional training) after completing pre-
commissioning training in BOLC A.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Lieutenants are assigned to battery platoon leader positions in pure Patriot,
Patriot/Avenger composite, or Avenger battalions, or THAAD batteries. As platoon leaders, lieutenants will gain
valuable experience and training that becomes the "cornerstone" of their career development. Platoon leaders in Patriot
and THAAD batteries are expected to train and perform as tactical control officers.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. See figure 12–1.
   (4) Self-development. By law, officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree before promotion to captain. A self-
development program enhancing professional development through lifelong learning must also begin at the grade of
lieutenant.
   (5) Desired experience. The focus of effort during the lieutenant years is to master the basic skills of the ADA
114                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

Branch and acquire, reinforce, and hone troop-leading skills. Lieutenants must seek leadership positions in troop units
whenever possible as this is the best means to become educated in Army operations, building a strong foundation for
future service as an Army officer. Accompanying development of technical, tactical, logistics, and administrative skills
are important in these assignments, but leading Soldiers embodies the essence of leadership development for lieutenants
and captains. Inculcation of the Warrior Ethos and Army Values are essential to the character development of young
officers. Prior to promotion to captain, officers must possess an in-depth knowledge of ADA and combined arms
operations gained through experience in MTOE warfighting units.
   f. Captain development. See paragraph 3–5.
   (1) Education. Officers generally attend the CCC following selection for promotion to captain. Select ADA officers
may have an opportunity to attend the resident phase of another combat arms branch CCC or the U.S. Marine Corps
Expeditionary Warfare School. These schools are extremely competitive and provide increased benefits to the officer
and both branches.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Captains must aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience to
prepare them for duties at the grade of major. The following are considered KD assignments for ADA captains:
   (a) ADA battery command (exceptions may include command of another combat arms battery or company).
   (b) Headquarters and headquarters battery or maintenance company/service battery commander of an AC ADA
organization.
   (c) Headquarters and headquarters company (HHC) commander of an AC non-ADA organization (such as company
command of divisional HHC units, company commander of basic training company, or initial entry training company).
   (d) Battery command of Joint Tactical Ground Station or AN/TPY–2 forward based mode radar battery.
   (e) Officers in cohort YG 2004 or earlier receive KD credit for ADAM Cell officer in charge (OIC) assignments
within a divisional BCT, multifunctional brigade, or functional brigade to include Aviation, Fires, and battlefield
surveillance brigades (in accordance with HRC assignment policy during that timeframe).
   (f) Officers in cohort YG 2010 or earlier receive KD credit for ADA fire control officer positions.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. See figure 12–1.
   (4) Self-development. All captains must exercise continuous self-development to fully master all aspects of ADA
operations including JIIM operations. Self-development initiatives may include (among others) online/correspondence
courses, civilian education, professional reading programs, and other institutional training to broaden their warfighting
perspective. Officers are eligible for functional designation at both their 4th and 7th years of service. The formal
designation of FAs is based on the needs of the Army, officer preference, military experience, and civilian schooling.
Several FAs provide advanced civil schooling, which may be granted upon selection to the FA (subject to change).
   (5) Desired experience. Developmental assignments, both branch specific and generalist, will provide ADA captains
with exposure to the Army and in some cases JIIM organizations. The captains must have mastered their troop-leading
skills and fully understand operations at battery, battalion, and brigade levels. At this stage in their career development,
ADA captains must recognize how the Army functions and fights.
   g. Major development. See paragraph 3–6.
   (1) Education. At the 7th year, an HQDA-level board considers Army requirements and each officer’s skills,
experience, and preferences before assigning each officer to a branch or FA in one of three functional categories.
Officers selected to remain in the ADA basic branch (functionally designated) must successfully complete ILE/JPME I
and their KD assignment(s) to become competitive for promotion to lieutenant colonel (lieutenant colonel). ILE/JPME
I is critical at this point in an ADA officer’s career and must be completed prior to the 15th year of commissioned
service. (See para 4–7e for further discussion of ILE.) This prepares them for success in their next 10 years of service
and is a prerequisite for SSC attendance. Upon completion of ILE/JPME I, ADA majors must continue to aggressively
prepare for and seek the skills and experience that will prepare them for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. The following are considered KD assignments for AC ADA majors:
   (a) Battalion/brigade S3 or XO of an AC ADA organization.
   (b) Battalion/brigade S3 or XO of a special troops battalion or another AC combat arms unit.
   (c) 10th AAMDC deputy G–3.
   (d) AAMDC chief of war plans (future).
   (e) AAMDC chief of war plans (current).
   (f) AAMDC plans officer.
   (g) AAMDC or ADA brigade, ADA fire control officer element section, active duty coordination management
officer.
   (h) Multinational transition team trainer/advisor.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. See figure 12–1.
   (4) Self-development. All majors must exercise continuous self-development to fully master all aspects of ADA
operations, including JIIM operations. Majors should also begin the process of mastering the Fires functional concept.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                               115

Self-development initiatives may include (among others) online/correspondence courses, civilian education, profes-
sional reading programs, and other institutional training to broaden their warfighting perspective. Skills and experience
continue to drive an officer’s career path and future assignments. See figure 12–1.
   (5) Desired experience. At this stage, an ADA major must hone skills in the planning and execution of ADA TTPs
and develop expertise in the JIIM operational environment.
   h. Lieutenant colonel development. See paragraph 3–7.
   (1) Education. Officers selected for lieutenant colonel must seek assignments of greater responsibility in branch
positions. ADA lieutenant colonels’ records will be screened by the SSC selection board after their 16th year of service.
Completion of ILE/JPME I is required for attendance consideration. SSC is the final major military educational
program available to prepare officers for position of greatest responsibility in the DOD. Approximately 30–35 percent
of a cohort year group is selected to attend during their years of eligibility that run between the 16th and 23rd years of
service. Officers selected for command will attend the PCC.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. ADA lieutenant colonels must continue to aggressively prepare for and seek the
skills and experience that will prepare them for promotion to colonel. The objective in lieutenant colonel assignments is
to give ADA officers the opportunity to make a greater contribution to the branch and the Army. KD assignments for
lieutenant colonels include the following:
   (a) CSL battalion-level command.
   (b) Transition team commander.
   (c) Brigade deputy commander.

   (5) Desired experience. ADA lieutenant colonels must have mastery level understanding of ADA operations,
logistics, and the command and control required for combatant command level operations. Officers are expected to
complete a minimum of 12 months of assignment at a theater-level command; (AAMDC, ASCC, Combatant Com-
mand); at a major subordinate command, (TRADOC, U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM)); or Army/Joint staff.
Officers selected as battalion commanders should have this experience prior to or immediately following command.
   i. Colonel development. See paragraph 3–8.
   (1) Education. The annual SSC selection board reviews the files of colonels until their 23rd year of service. The
majority of colonels will attend the resident training or be awarded MEL SSC certification from the U.S. Army War
College Distance Education Course during the latter 3 years of their eligibility window. (See para 3–7b(6) for more
information on the available SSC-level courses. Officers selected for command will also attend the PCC. Colonels and
lieutenant colonels (P) selected to serve as TRADOC capabilities manager should attend the Combat Developers
Course.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. ADA colonels contribute to the branch by serving in key and developmental
assignments to include the following:
   (a) CSL brigade-level command (for example, 10th AAMDC, ADA brigade, garrison command, recruiting, and
GMD brigade).
   (b) AAMDC deputy commander/chief of staff.

12–5. Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. The RC career development model for ADA will essentially mirror that of AC
officers/warrant officers, except that assignments will not be limited to one component or control group within a
component. Figures 12–1 (officers) and 12–2 (warrant officers) delineate the mandatory timeline for promotion to the
next higher grade. In certain cases, an RC officer can be promoted to the next higher grade after meeting minimum
time in grade requirements. The ADA officer should count on being dual branched to facilitate career progression. In
addition, an ADA officer will most likely be required to branch transfer to another basic branch due to limited
geographical and upward mobility positions; however, these officers should remain proficient.
   b. Role. ADA RC officers/warrant officers serve in most of the same roles and missions as their AC counterparts.
The unique nature of the RC Soldier’s role as a citizen Soldier poses a challenge for professional development;
however, RC officers/warrant officers are expected to follow AC development patterns as closely as possible. RC
officers/warrant officers have increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. To meet profes-
sional development objectives, RC officers/warrant officers must be willing to rotate between ARNG and USAR TPUs,
IRR, the IMA program, and other AC and RC programs. Geographical considerations necessitate these transfers, as
well as the need to provide as many officers/warrant officers as possible the opportunity to serve with troops in
leadership and staff positions. Additionally, there may be occasions when RC officers/warrant officers will be
transferred to the IRR while they complete mandatory education requirements. Such transfers will be temporary and
should not be seen as impacting negatively on the officer’s/warrant officer’s career. The success of an RC officer/
warrant officer is not measured by the length of service in any one component or control group, but by the officer’s/
warrant officer’s breadth of experience, duty performance, and adherence to branch requirements. (Note. Figures 12–1,
12–2, and 12–3 illustrate the typical AC and RC officer and warrant officer careers from accession to separation.)
   c. Warrant officer assignments. Warrant officers, as the branch’s technical experts, are considered certified upon
successful completion of the WOBC and remain so throughout their warrant officer career (140X specialty code
denotes a position that can be filled by either a 140A or 140E, currently only approved for GMD positions).
   d. Reserve Component officer qualification and development. Career development model is at figure 12–1.

   (1) Lieutenant (years 1 through 6). RC officers must complete a minimum of 90 hours of college/university credits
to receive a commission. ADA BOLC B is the starting point for newly accessed RC ADA officers. RC ADA officers
should complete the resident initial leadership instruction by the eighteenth month for ARNG officers (the second year
for USAR officers), or prior to the end of the third year for OCS graduates and direct appointees. Officers should seek
to serve in more than one unit position during this phase, allowing for maximum exposure to the diversified functions
within an ADA unit. Typical ADA lieutenant assignments include tactical control officer, platoon leader, battery XO,
battery maintenance officer, and battalion staff officer. Officers are encouraged to actively participate in professional
reading programs and continue correspondence studies. Officers must earn a baccalaureate degree from an accredited
college/university to qualify for promotion to captain.
   (2) Captain (years 7 through 13). ADA officers must complete the resident CCC in the AC or RC curriculum. The
RC CCC program is divided into three phases of instruction that is to be completed within a 13 month timeframe. The
course includes two phases of DL includes nonresident instruction and two phases of 2 weeks of active duty in
residence at USAADASCH. During this phase, all officers are highly encouraged to pursue a specialty-related
undergraduate or graduate degree. RC ADA officers should aggressively seek opportunities to command an ADA
battery for a minimum tour of 2 years (optimally 3 years). RC ADA command opportunities are only available in
ARNG units. Typical assignments for captains include battery command; TASS/regional training institute tactical
officer; battalion, brigade, division, joint force headquarters, or USAR RSC staff officer; battalion liaison officer; CTC
observer/controller; and multifunctional billets. Officers may select a FA designation between the seventh and tenth
years of service. The designation of FAs should be based upon the needs of the Army, geographical considerations, and
officer preference. FA assignments are useful for bypassing temporary roadblocks to career progression in the ADA
branch due to geographical constraints or position availability; however, RC ADA officers should endeavor to return to
an ADA assignment as soon as practicable. A limited number of qualified officers will be accessed into the Army
Acquisition Corps.
   (3) Major (years 14 through 21). During this phase, officers should enroll in and complete common core ILE and
pursue a specialty-related graduate degree. ADA officers should seek further development in ADA assignments during
this phase. Branch standard assignments include (but are not limited to) battalion/brigade/division staff officer,
battalion/brigade XO/S3, ADAM Cell OIC, CTC observer/controller, TASS/regional training institute battalion tactical
officers, and ROTC instructor duty.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel (years 21 through 26). During this phase, officers should seek PME at the SSC level. Officers
may seek assignments to senior command and staff positions. Additionally, many assignments in both HQDA and joint
staffs are available in the IMA Program for RC officers. Lieutenant colonels with 3 years time in grade must complete
JMPE Phase I to qualify for assignment to any principal staff position at brigade or higher levels of command. If
transferring from another branch and designated to command at the battalion level, RC officers must have attended a
transition course and PCC under the auspices of USAADASCH. (Note: Exceptional officers selected to command an
ADA battalion (minimum 2-year, optimum 3-year tour) may also be selected for resident SSC or the Army War
College Distance/Distributive Education Course.) Branch standard assignments include (but are not limited to) battalion
commander, TASS/regional training institute commanders, brigade XO, brigade XO/S3/operations officer, division staff
officer; and CONUSA/JIIM/HQDA-level staff assignment. RC ADA command opportunities are only available in
ARNG units.
   (5) Colonel (years 26 through 30). Assignments during this phase should provide for maximum utilization skills in
ADA or FA. Assignment standards include regional training institute/garrison commander, brigade deputy commander,
division/corps staff officer, and training support/combat division chiefs of staff. Senior staff assignments include (but
are not limited to) positions at NGB Headquarters, USARC, and on CONUSA/JIIM/HQDA staffs. If transferring from
another branch and designated to a colonel-level command, officers must have attended a transition course and PCC
under the auspices of USAADASCH. (Note. Exceptional officers selected to command an ADA brigade [minimum 2
years, optimum 3 years] may also be selected for resident SSC or the Army War College Distance/Distributive
Education Course.)
   e. Reserve Component warrant officer qualification and development.
   (1) MOS 140A, Command and control systems integrator. The ADA warrant officer development and utilization
model (RC) is at figure 12–2. The 140X specialty code allows GMD positions to be filled by 140A or 140E.
   (a) WO1 and CW2. Same as AC MOS 140A description at paragraph 12–3b(1)(a). (References to THAAD do not
apply and reference to Theater Missile Warning Detachment is replaced by GMD.) ARNG CW2s are required to
successfully complete WOAC to meet eligibility requirements for promotion to CW3.
   (b) CW3. Same as AC MOS 140A description at paragraph 12–3b(1)(b). (References to USAADASCH do not
apply.) Additionally, successful completion of WOSC is required for both ARNG and USAR warrants prior to being
eligible for promotion to CW4.
   (c) CW4. Same as AC MOS 140A description at paragraph 12–3b(1)(c). (References to THAAD, TRADOC, Joint
commands, Army/ACOM staffs, and career managers do not apply.) These CW4s also serve in directorate staff
positions at the JFHQ. Both ARNG and USAR warrants are required to successfully complete WOSSC prior to
eligibility for promotion to CW5.

140E.
   (b) CW4. Same as AC MOS 140E description at paragraph 12–3b(2)(c) except that positions are only available in
the ADA brigades and AAMDC. ARNG warrants are required to successfully complete WOSSC prior to being eligible
for promotion to CW5. At this juncture, CW4s should begin, continue, or complete graduate-level studies. CW5. Same
as AC MOS 140E description at paragraph 12–3b(2)(d) except that positions are only available in the ADA brigades
and AAMDC.
Chapter 13
Engineer Branch
13–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose/mission of the Engineer Regiment. The Engineer Regiment is a sub-profession of the larger profession of
arms. It is a body of people—not just equipment or organizations—with a passion to serve as an engineer Soldier who
embodies the Warrior Ethos and a technical set of skills. These technical skills set the Engineer Regiment apart via its
unique services and knowledge that the Army needs to accomplish its missions. The purpose of the Engineer Regiment
and its role within the U.S. Army is first and foremost to bring the three unique capabilities of combat, general, and
geospatial engineering to support the overall efforts of the Army. Engineer warriors lead to serve ground forces: a
regiment inspired to answer the commander’s call.
   b. Proponent information. The proponent for the Engineer Regiment is the U.S. Army Engineer School (USAES);
Fort Leonard Wood, MO. Contact information for all agencies and directorates of the Engineer School can be found on
the public Web page at: http://www.wood.army.mil/usaes/. From this website, those individuals with a valid AKO
account can find more refined information on the Engineer School Knowledge Network. Support for proponent
functions is provided to the commandant of the U.S. Army Engineer School by the CG, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE), 441 G Street, Washington, DC 20314–1000 and the Commander, Installation Management Command, 2405
Gun Shed Road, Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234–1223.
   c. Functions.
   (1) Terms.
   (a) The Engineer Regiment. The Engineer Regiment represents the Army’s engineer capabilities in both the
operating and generating force. The Engineer Regiment consists of all active and RC Army, ARNG, and USAR
engineer organizations (as well as the DOD Civilians and affiliated contractors and agencies within the civilian
community) with a diverse range of capabilities that are all focused toward supporting the Army and its mission.
   (b) The Active Component. The AC of the Engineer Regiment consists of AA military engineer units within
combatant and ACOMs, USACE (defined below), and individual officers, NCOs, and civilians working inside non-
engineer organizations including maneuver enhancement brigades, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and Direc-
tors of Public Works and Housing in Installation Management Command.
   (c) The Reserve Component. The RC of the Engineer Regiment consists of the Army Reserve and the ARNG and
constitutes more than three fourths of Army engineer forces. The RC of the Engineer Regiment includes a wide range
of specialized units and capabilities.
   (d) The Engineer Branch. The Engineer Branch includes both the HR managers in HRC and the Engineer Branch
proponent (USAES) under TRADOC. Together these components generate and manage the centerpiece of those forces
conducting engineer operations—Engineer Soldiers. The branch trains, educates, and manages Engineer Soldiers in a
variety of military occupational specialties and skills. The mission of the USAES is to execute training, leader
development education, and personnel proponency while advocating to the Maneuver Support Center of Excellence
(MSCoE) Engineer priorities in doctrine, organizations, materiel, and facilities.
   (e) The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The USACE is the Army’s DRU assigned responsibility to execute Army
and DOD military construction, real estate acquisition, development of the nation’s infrastructure and management of
water resources through the Civil Works Program. USACE serves the Armed Forces and the nation by providing vital
engineering services and capabilities, as a public service, across the full spectrum of operations—from peace to war—
in support of national interests. Most of USACE’s assets are part of the generating force, but selected elements are a
part of the operational Army. Other USACE services include wetlands and waterway management, environmental
restoration, and disaster relief support operations. With its subordinate divisions, districts, laboratories and centers,
USACE provides a broad range of engineering support to the military departments, Federal agencies, state govern-
ments, local authorities, and foreign partners.

   (2) Support.
   (a) Lines of engineer support. The unique capabilities of the Engineer Regiment are combined together along four
lines of engineer support to assure mobility, enhance protection, enable expeditionary force projection & logistics, and
develop partner capacity and infrastructure in order to provide freedom of action to ground forces at every echelon
executing unified land operations. With the publication of ADP 3–0 and the increased demand for stability operations,
engineer requirements across the range of military operations have increased. Engineers provide support to Army and
Joint maneuver commanders and staffs at all levels, installations, and the nation at the tactical, operational, and
strategic levels. By its very nature the Engineer Regiment is broad with many diverse developmental opportunities.
Along the lines of engineer support, the Regiment supports emergency management in support of federal agencies,
management and control of military construction programs for the Army and other Federal agencies, water and flood
control, natural resource development, environmental restoration, civil works, maintenance and repair of utilities
equipment, maintenance support to medical hospitals, installation of fixed or mobile power plants, interior and exterior
repair of facilities to include carpentry, masonry, plumbing and electrical equipment, interface between the engineering
and intelligence communities for planning and execution of Geospatial Intelligence and management of Geospatial
Intelligence operations.
   (b) Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational. The Engineer Regiment is joint in its integration
capabilities and supports the planning, preparation, execution, and assessment of joint operations by complementing
and augmenting U.S. Navy SEABEE units, U.S. Air Force REDHORSE and PRIME BEEF units, and host nation
engineer capabilities. The Regiment is experienced at interagency support and leveraging nonmilitary and non-
governmental engineer assets to support mission accomplishment. It is capable of supporting or leading multinational
engineer efforts.
13–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for the 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army
Values and the Warrior Ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the
range of military operations. All officers must be physically and mentally fit, maintain and display self-control, remain
calm under pressure, and adhere to published standards and regulations. They must be able to operate in JIIM
environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving their objectives. Our officers must be culturally
astute and able to use their awareness and understanding to conduct operations innovatively and courageously to
exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the operational environment. Army officers must be premier
warfighters who possess the Warrior Ethos and effectively apply the four core dimensions of leadership: values,
attributes, skills, and actions. The four core leadership dimensions provide the basis for what an engineer leader must
be, know, and do. The Army Values and attributes set the basis for the character of the leader—what a leader must be.
The Soldier’s Creed and skills developed by leaders establish his or her competence—what a leader must know. The
actions that leaders conduct and execute constitute leadership—what a leader must do. This leadership framework
describes a leader of character and competence who acts to achieve excellence across the full range of military
operations. Further explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in AR 600–100, ADP 3–0, ADP 6–22, and in
chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of an Engineer officer. The Engineer Regiment requires officers who are well-
grounded in engineer doctrine and possess the skills and attributes to solve the commander’s toughest problems.
Engineer officers are warriors first, but lead to serve ground force commanders and are masters of combined arms
operations. Additionally, because of the technical nature of many engineer assignments, officers are required to
continuously update their education and professional certifications. Engineer officers who have an undergraduate
engineering degree should seek to become licensed as a Professional Engineer and obtain a master’s degree in
engineering or a related technical field. Engineer officers without an undergraduate engineering degree should seek to
obtain a master’s degree in an engineering related discipline and professional certification relevant to the Engineer
mission, such as Project Management Professional (PMP), Project Engineer, or Geographic Information Systems
Professional. To add the best value possible to the Army and the nation, Engineer officers must be lifelong learners
who are experts in the technical and tactical domains across the full range of military engineering. They gain
competency through a logical sequence of institutional training and education, experience gained in operational
assignments, and continuous self-development initiatives. Engineer officers are classified into a single,AOC 12A.
Engineer lieutenants and captains develop core technical competencies through attendance at PME. There are several
branch-unique skills that require further professional development and qualification through completion of functional
courses, self-development, and operational experience. The Engineer Branch uses SIs to further classify officers and
code unit positions that require the skills, to provide commanders with engineer leaders who have the right skills for
the job. Engineer officers obtain various SIs throughout their career to increase their value to the Army, increase their
depth of expertise in applied engineering, increase their mastery of leveraging combinations of the three engineer
capabilities, and increase the types of units/positions in which they may serve. An engineer officer with broader skills
has more flexibility in being assigned to KD and developmental/broadening positions. The Engineer Branch has
proponency for the following skills (detailed descriptions contained in DA Pam 611–21):
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            125

   (1) S4—Sapper Leader.
   (2) W1—Facilities Planner.
   (3) W2—Geospatial Engineer Officer.
   (4) W3—Professional Engineer.
   (5) W4—Degreed Engineer.
   (6) W5—Project Management Professional.
   (7) W6—Project Engineer.
   (8) W7—Environmental Officer.
13–3. Officer development
   a. Officer development model. The officer development model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain engineer technical and tactical skills to develop a Warrior Ethos and gain important
leadership experience. During these company grade assignments, officers gain critical tactical understanding that
engineers are part of the joint and combined arms team and technical experience in general and geospatial engineering
and construction management. They begin to develop combined arms competency that will allow them to lead
combined arms formations during unified land operations.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the Army’s officer development model highlights the need to gain JIIM
experience and exposure. The breadth of tactical and technical assignments within the Engineer Regiment ensures that
officers are provided with JIIM developmental and broadening opportunities at installations and in contingency
environments to achieve increasing levels of technical competency expected by field and garrison commanders.
   (3) For broadening opportunities officers should view the concept of broadening as a purposeful expansion of a
leader’s capabilities and understanding provided through opportunities internal and external to the Army. Broadening is
accomplished across an officer’s full career through experiences and/or education in different organizational cultures
and environments. The intent for broadening is to develop an officer’s capability to see, work, learn and contribute
outside each one’s own perspective or individual level of understanding for the betterment of both the individual
officer and the institution. The result of broadening is a continuum of leadership capability at direct, operational, and
strategic levels, which bridges diverse environments and organizational cultures. The broadening process will be
dynamic and variable across cohorts, grades, and branches or FAs. Opportunities will change in response to the Army’s
emerging missions, evolving structure and professional culture. Deliberate career management that carefully limits KD
time to prescribed intervals, allowing exceptions only under limited extenuating circumstances is fundamental to the
concept of broadening. Broadening opportunities may vary in scope, responsibility, and developmental outcomes and
typically fall in four major categories listed below.
   (4) Functional designation, that often occurs at the 4th or 7th year develops functional competencies inside or outside
of the Engineer Regiment. The ACC groups interrelated branches and FAs into officer management categories called
functional categories and functional groups. The functional designation process determines in which specialty officers
will continue their development; either in their accession branch or in a different FA. Management of officer
development in functional categories recognizes the need to balance specialization of the officer corps with the inherent
requirement for officers to gain more breadth in an increasingly complex environment. Officers have periodic
opportunities after the 4th year of officer service to transfer to a different branch or FA. The process is known as the
VTIP and is managed by HRC to balance inventories with Army requirements and to leverage individual officer
preferences and demonstrated abilities. VTIP panels are conducted at least three times a year and are announced via
MILPER message describing procedures and specialties to be considered for cross leveling. VTIP allows HRC to
identify and target officers with critical skills early in their development, allowing them to obtain additional training
and experience to bring those skills to bear as quickly as possible. The VTIP balances the force across the three
functional categories. The intent of the VTIP panel is to fill requirements and provide the FAs enough time to send
their officers to school and training prior to utilization. The VTIP process ensures that the needs of the Army are met
for future field grade officer requirements in each functional category. Each functional category has its own unique
characteristics and development model for officers, which reflects the readiness requirements of the Army today and
into the 21st century. Officers in all functional categories are assigned across the Army in TOE and TDA
organizations.
   (5) An experience with civilian industry or within a community of students, scholars, and instructors at institutes of
higher learning where the officer can gain new perspectives and knowledge, skills, and abilities not generally obtained
from organic experiences, training, or education. Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education as
well as professional societies and associations, is necessary for Engineer officers to become technically competent in
combat, general, and geospatial engineering and construction management, as well as joint and expeditionary opera-
tions. While the Army provides support, Engineer officers must be self-motivated to achieve lifelong learning.
   (6) The paragraphs below represent a career guide by defining those professional development opportunities
available at each rank that prepare the Engineer officer for further service at the next higher rank. It presumes a heavy
focus on tactical/maneuver support operations for company grade officers, transitioning to a combined/Joint operational
126                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

focus coupled with varied technical requirements for senior company grade and field grade officers. A constant theme
throughout the career guide is the increased use of the self-development domain to produce technically and tactically
competent leaders for the Army.
   b. General career development. Engineer officer career development includes training, education, self-development,
and KD assignments. The three domains of leader development—PME/functional training, operational assignments,
and self-development—define and engage a continuous cycle of education, training, selection, experience, assessment,
feedback, reinforcement, and evaluation to encourage officer development throughout career progression. The emphasis
within each domain of leader development shifts throughout an officer’s career to meet the ARFORGEN, mobilization,
and warfighting needs of the Army. The AC Army engineer officer career map is at figure 13–1.
   (1) Professional military education. The institutional Army (schools and training centers) is the foundation for
lifelong learning.
   (2) Operational assignments. Upon completion of institutional training, leaders are ideally assigned to operational
assignments. This operational experience provides them the opportunity to use, hone, and build on what they learned
through the formal education process. Experience gained through on-the-job-training in a variety of challenging
assignments and additional duties prepares officers to lead and train Soldiers in garrison commands and, ultimately, in
combat. The officer’s breadth and depth of experience are the metrics that accurately reflect the potential for promotion
and service in positions of increased responsibility. Assignments that increase officers’ overall technical and tactical
knowledge and improve their understanding of combined, joint, interagency, and multinational operations will also help
to broaden the skill sets that make them more effective combat leaders.
   (3) Self-development. Leaders must commit to a lifetime of professional and personal growth to stay at the cutting
edge of their profession. Every officer is ultimately responsible for their own self-development plan. Key elements of a
leader’s self-development program should include cultural, language, and JIIM environments. Officers should set self-
development goals and explore opportunities to serve in JIIM environments throughout their careers as a way to
expand their overall knowledge base and increase their ability to lead in those environments. Officers should concen-
trate their efforts on attaining and honing a broad set of skills by holding KD positions that allow them to explore
various aspects of their professional abilities.
   (4) Skill identifier. The use of SIs supports career development, officer tracking, and management of assignments to
develop multi-skilled Engineer officers to meet the Army’s need and the goals of the officer. It is expected that officers
will be managed and assigned to coded positions based on the officer’s SIs. An officer will select which skills training
meets their personal developmental goals and the technical focus they would like to have in their career. Skills training
and classification will allow the Army to fill coded positions with officers that possess the right mixture of skills.
   (a) Engineer officers should obtain at least one SI and are encouraged to obtain several SIs. This broadens both their
technical engineer competence and their use to the Army.
   (b) To support ARFORGEN, Engineer officers selected to serve in positions coded with Engineer SIs should
complete the required training before being assigned to these positions.
   (c) Engineer officers must complete their KD operational assignment and schooling to be best qualified at each
grade and exceptionally qualified for future promotions.
   c. Lieutenant development.
   (1) Education. Engineer lieutenants are required to graduate from Engineer BOLC to ensure a strong foundation in
officer common core/leadership training and in military specific engineer training. It is this strong foundation that
allows for continued leader development in the operational and self-developmental domains. Follow-on specialized
Engineer and non-Engineer tactical training such as Sapper, Ranger, Airborne, Route Reconnaissance Clearance
Course-Leader, Urban Mobility Breacher, Explosive Ordnance Clearance Agent (EOCA), Stryker or Mechanized
Leader, and others is encouraged to support company grade assignments.
   (2) Assignment.
   (a) KD (12–24 months) assignment as a platoon leader is critical for an engineer lieutenant and should be held for a
minimum of 12 months.
   (b) The following assignments for lieutenants are examples of developmental/broadening opportunities. A mixture of
these assignments provides company grade officers with technical experience and the opportunity to lead, train, and
support small units. This provides the foundation critical to continued growth as an engineer officer.
   1. Company XO.
   2. Battalion staff officer.
   3. Task force engineer.
   4. Aide-de-camp.
   5. USACE project engineer.
   (3) Self-development. Numerous opportunities exist for self-development at the lieutenant level. For those lieutenants
without a bachelor’s degree, planning for degree completion is critical. Opportunities exist for lieutenants to become
full-time students and also to attend online and off-duty courses. Officers who have a Bachelor of Science degree from
an Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology accredited institution are highly encouraged to take the
Fundamentals of Engineering exam so they can become an Engineer in training to prepare for Professional Engineer
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            127

registration (licensure) later in their career. Various professional reading lists and doctrinal publications are available
that officers should use to generate discussion in professional development sessions, as well as self-assessment tools to
increase self-awareness. To stay current in emerging technologies and ideas, engineer lieutenants should become
members of engineer professional/technical organizations. Completion of online courses through AKO Distributive
Learning, DAU, or learning a foreign language is also encouraged.
   (4) Desired experience. Engineer lieutenants must acquire and master troop-leading procedures, platoon and com-
pany operations, basic maintenance and logistical concepts, and administrative requirements inherent to platoons and
companies. Each engineer lieutenant must also embody the Army’s Warrior Ethos and values so that they can train and
lead Soldiers to win our Nation’s wars.
   d. Captain development.
   (1) Education. After selection for promotion to captain, engineer officers will attend the Engineer Captain’s Career
Course (ECCC). It is highly encouraged for captains to attend ECCC prior to command. Options exist to attend other
branch’s CCC for those officers deemed qualified by their chain of command and desiring to do so. Engineer captains
are encouraged to pursue technical engineer training through the USACE Proponent Sponsored Engineer Corps
Training (PROSPECT) program. Engineer-specific technical training in project management, construction management,
facilities management, geospatial engineering, environmental engineering, contracting officer representative, quality
assurance, and other related areas is available. Tactical training such as Sapper, Ranger, Airborne, Route Reconnais-
sance Clearance Course-Leader, Urban Mobility Breacher, and the Joint Engineer Operations Course is also available.
   (2) Assignment.
   (a) KD (12–24 months) assignment as a company commander is critical for an engineer captain and should be held
for a minimum of 12 months.
   (b) The following assignments for captains are examples of developmental/broadening opportunities. A mixture of
these assignments further develops technical and tactical competencies and the experience base necessary to succeed at
the field grade level and beyond. Engineer captains should serve in developmental/broadening assignments following
their KD assignment.
   1. Battalion/brigade staff officer.
   2. CTC observer/controller/trainer.
   3. Small group leader.
   4. Transition team.
   5. Provincial reconstruction team.
   6. Instructor (USAES/USMA/ROTC).
   7. Doctrine/training developer.
   8. USACE project officer.
   9. Exchange officer.
   10. Aide-de-camp.
   11. AC/RC observer/controller/trainer.
   (3) Self-development. Numerous opportunities exist for self-development at the captain level. Engineer officers who
plan to make the Army a career beyond company grade should obtain a graduate degree prior to promotion to the rank
of lieutenant colonel. To assist with this goal, officers attending the ECCC are afforded an opportunity to get a
master’s degree from the University of Missouri Science and Technology’s cooperative degree program. Additionally,
the advanced civil schooling option is a fully funded program that supports advanced degree requirements for certain
branches and FAs. Many universities award constructive credit for military courses, which can facilitate earning an
advanced degree at an accelerated pace. Lastly, an officer can obtain an advanced degree at his or her own expense or
by using tuition assistance during off-duty hours. A full explanation and eligibility requirements for these programs are
contained in AR 621–1. For those officers with undergraduate engineering degrees, their master’s degree should be in
the field of engineering or a related technical discipline. For those officers without an undergraduate engineering
degree, obtaining a master’s degree in Geospatial Engineering/Geographic Information Systems, Business Administra-
tion, Operations Research, Management, Architecture, or a related technical discipline may support qualification for a
SI or support a FA designation and provide the skills necessary for higher-level command and staff positions. Officers
who have passed the Fundamentals of Engineering exam should actively begin preparation for the professional
engineer exam. Various professional reading lists and doctrinal publications are available that officers should use to
generate discussion in professional development sessions, as well as self-assessment tools to increase self-awareness.
To stay current in emerging technologies and ideas, engineer captains should be members of engineer professional/
technical organizations. Completion of online courses through AKO Distributive Learning, DAU, or learning a foreign
language is also encouraged.

13–4. Warrant officer development
   a. Unique functions, knowledge, and skills of the engineer warrant officer. The Army warrant officer is an adaptive
technical expert, leader, trainer, and advisor. Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and
education, the warrant officer administers, manages, maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment
through all levels of unified and decisive Engineer operations. They support a wide range of Engineer and Army
missions throughout their career. Warrant officers in the Army are accessed with specific levels of technical ability.
They refine their technical expertise and develop their leadership and management skills through tiered progressive
assignment and education. The following are specific characteristics and responsibilities of the separate, successive
warrant officer grades.
   (1) Warrant officer one/chief warrant officer two. A WO1 is an officer appointed by warrant with the requisite
authority pursuant to assignment level and position given by the Secretary of the Army. CW2s and above are
commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the President
of the United States. WO1s and CW2s primary focus is becoming proficient and working on those systems linked
directly to their AOC/MOS. As they become experts on the systems they operate and maintain, their focus migrates to
integrating their systems with other branch systems.
   (2) CW3s are advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader,
trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other branch-related
duties assigned to them. As they become more senior, their focus becomes integrating branch systems into larger Army
systems.
   (3) CW4s are senior-level technical and tactical experts who perform the duties of technical leader, manager,
maintainer, sustainer, integrator and advisor and serve in a wide variety of branch level positions. As they become
more senior they focus on integrating branch and Army systems into Joint and national-level systems.

   (b) Developmental and broadening assignments.
   1. 120A CW5s will serve as the regimental chief warrant officer, commander of the Prime Power School or as the
engineering control officer at NATO’s military headquarters.
   2. 125D CW5s will serve as the geospatial engineer technical advisor for the Engineer Research and Development
Center at the Topographic Engineer Center (TEC) or as the senior geospatial engineering technician for doctrine,
organization, training, materiel, leadership, and education, personnel, and facilities integration at the MSCoE. Select
CW5s can also expect to receive assignments consistent with the needs of the Army, such as service school instructors
or as HQDA staff members.
   3. Engineer CW5s will serve the remainder of their careers in positions designated for that grade. The regimental
chief warrant officer is a capstone, nominative assignment for an Engineer warrant officer and should be considered
MOS immaterial.
   (3) Self-development. Engineer CW5s should continue self-development efforts to enhance expertise in all aspects of
engineering missions and support.
   (4) Desired experience. Engineer CW5s should attend the Army’s Force Management School to become familiar
with the constitutional, statuary, and regulatory basis for the Army and the capabilities that must be sustained through
the management of doctrine, organization, training, material, leadership, and education, personnel, facilities. Engineer
CW5s must become familiar with Army and Engineer organizational roles, functions, and missions, especially at the
ACOM and Army staff levels and with the force management process.

13–5. Engineer Reserve Component officers
   a. Officer development model. The officer development model for the RC officers is the same as the AA officers
except for these unique aspects of RC officer development and career management. The Engineer RC officer plays an
important role in the Engineer Regiment and in the USACE. The wartime effectiveness of the Engineer Regiment is
dependent upon the quality of the Engineer officers in USAR and ARNG units, as well as the IRR. Additionally, the
quantity and quality of training that RC Engineer officers receive prior to mobilization dictates to a large extent their
wartime effectiveness. RC Engineer officer development, in general, should parallel that of their AA counterparts. Even
though RC Engineer officers are limited by geographical and positional considerations, they should strive for assign-
ments in engineer units and maneuver enhancement brigades that yield the same developmental and competitive
opportunities as their AA counterparts. There may not be a sufficient number of positions within a geographic area to
allocate Engineer assignments. Therefore, planned rotation into progressively challenging engineer positions by RC
commands is essential to producing the best qualified and trained Engineer officer. To meet professional developmental
objectives in the Army Reserve, Engineer officers must be willing work with their personnel management officer team
to rotate between TPU, the IRR, the IMA program, DIMA, Joint Reserve units, the IRR Augmentee (IRR–A) program,
AGR programs, and even apply for short active duty tours. National Guard engineer officers should contact their state
officer manager or their senior branch officer to ensure they can meet their professional development objectives. These
transfers are necessitated by geographical considerations, as well as the need to provide as many officers as possible
the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions, or to complete PME requirements. Transfers
within a component will normally be temporary, and should not be seen as impacting negatively on an officer’s career.
The success of an RC engineer officer is not measured by length of Service in any one component or control group,
but by the officer’s breadth of experience, assignments, duty performance, training, and adherence to branch require-
ments. Officers may elect to apply for a FA beginning at the rank of captain. Engineer officers in the IRR may find
assignments in TPU IMA, DIMA positions in AA organizations, installations or HQDA agencies, tours of active duty
in support of administrative support, contingency operations in support of administrative support annual training, or
temporary tour on active duty. Assignments in the IRR can also be used for completing PME requirements. When IRR
engineers are mobilized they are expected to complete Engineer Officer Refresher Course in residence before
deploying.
   b. General career development. As much as possible, RC officers should not be assigned to fill engineer SI coded
positions until they have completed the training and have been classified with the SI. The USAES supports FORSCOM
and the states in the development of Engineer officers and the training of engineer units in the USAR and ARNG.
Through the Chief, NGB, the UAES also provides technical assistance to the respective State AG for the career
management of ARNG Engineer officers. In general, qualifications and professional development are similar to AA
officers. The RC Engineer officer career map is at figure 13–2.
   (1) Award of Engineer SIs for ARNG officers. ARNG officers, regardless of status, seeking award of the SIs must
apply to the HR organization of their affiliated state, in coordination with the USAES. Each individual state, territory,
and the District of Columbia holds final authority for the SI designation of affiliated commissioned officers, dependent
on the needs of the state and the organization where the officer is currently assigned. Exceptions to policy will be
handled by each state on a case-by-case basis, in coordination with the ARNG. Documents substantiating successful
completion of education and experience should be included with the designation request (usually DA Form 4187).
Award of the Engineer SIs to ARNG officers will be based on a combination of educational instruction and experience
in qualified positions (see AR 611–1).
   (2) Award of the Engineer SIs for USAR officers. SIs are awarded by area commanders and CG, U.S. Army
Reserve Personnel Center (see AR 611–1).
   c. Lieutenant development.
   (1) Education. RC Engineer lieutenants must successfully complete Engineer BOLC B by the end of the second year
(USAR) or 18 months (ARNG) of commissioned Service.
   (2) Assignment. RC Engineer lieutenants will serve in leadership and Engineer staff positions at the company and
battalion level for a minimum of 18–24 months.
   (3) Self-development. Same as the AA.
   (4) Desired experience. Same.
   d. Captain development.
   (1) Education. RC Engineer captains must successfully complete the ECCC through either the RC or residence
courses.
   (2) Assignment. RC Engineer captains will serve in at least one primary Engineer staff assignment for no less than
24 months, and additionally should serve as an Engineer company commander. Additional developmental assignments
that will increase the basic warfighting competency of the officer should be sought if available.

Chapter 14
Chemical Branch
14–1. Introduction
  a. Purpose of the Chemical branch. The CM branch is aligned under the maneuver support functional group in the
operations functional category, and is focused primarily on the development, integration, and employment of tactical
capabilities that identify, prevent, and mitigate the entire range of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear
(CBRN) threats and hazards through CBRN operations; that support operational and strategic objectives to combat
weapons of mass destruction (WMD) through nonproliferation, counterproliferation, and CBRN consequence manage-
ment; and allows our sister Services and unified action partners to operate safely in a CBRN environment. Additional
functions include scientific, developmental, and material management activities for these programs. The branch
provides the Army with a highly trained corps of CBRN experts to advise commanders and staffs at all levels in DOD.
Officers assigned to the CM branch carry branch code 74.
  b. Proponent information. The branch proponent is the Commandant, U.S. Army Chemical, Biological, Radiological
and Nuclear School (USACBRNS), Ft Leonard Wood, MO, phone (573) 563–7691, email leon.
usacbrnsdotmlpf@conus.army.mil.
  c. Unique functions performed by Chemical branch. CBRN officers plan, employ, and coordinate CBRN systems
140                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

from platoon level through corps and Joint Task Forces in support of joint and unified land operations. These systems
include CBRN reconnaissance systems, warning and reporting systems, CBRN protection systems, and CBRN decon-
tamination systems. CBRN officers coordinate assets and efforts in support of CBRN operations; provide security
cooperation and partnership and threat reduction cooperation support; conduct WMD-interdiction operations, WMD-
offensive operations, WMD-elimination operations, CBRN active defense, CBRN passive defense, and CBRN conse-
quence management. CBRN officers work at all levels of command to advise and provide protection from the range of
CBRN threats and hazards. CBRN officers are generally the sole subject matter experts on CBRN operations within
their organization. CBRN Soldiers and units are recognized for their unique mission capabilities that include expertise
in: planning, preparing, executing, and assessing CBRN operations within the range of military operations in a CBRN
environment; sensitive site exploitation; CBRN reconnaissance; CBRN decontamination; CBRN contamination avoid-
ance, protection; and consequence management. These traits make CBRN Soldiers and units invaluable in supporting
both foreign and domestic contingency operations. Additionally, CBRN officers perform the following functions and
tasks:
   (1) Command and lead CBRN units from platoon to brigade, to include:
   (a) CBRN platoons (reconnaissance, biological integrated detection systems, and decontamination).
   (b) CM companies.
   (c) Technical escort companies and teams.
   (d) SF CM reconnaissance detachments.
   (e) CM battalions and brigades.
   (2) Command CM weapons storage and demilitarization activities/installations and ammunition manufacturing and
storage activities/installations.
   (3) Command and supervise environmental activities.
   (4) Serve as CBRN staff officers in tactical through strategic national-level organizations including Army staffs
from battalion through Army level and in OSD, joint, other federal departments, and combatant command staffs. As
staff officers, CBRN officers plan, prepare, execute, and assess CBRN operations within the range of military
operations in a CBRN environment to include: analyzing CBRN threats and hazards; conducting CBRN vulnerability
assessments; planning, conducting, and supervising CBRN training and operations; evaluating CBRN technical and
tactical intelligence data; planning CBRN reconnaissance and surveillance missions; planning and coordinating re-
sources for decontamination operations; planning and coordinating WMD-elimination operations; and integrating
CBRN into the scheme of protection for the force.
   (5) Analyze capability requirements, determine gaps, and develop/revise doctrine, organizational structure, training
and leader development, personnel, facilities, and material solutions to enhance the current and future regiment.
   (6) Serve as CBRN advisors to USAR and ARNG organizations.
   (7) Support CBRN protection and CBRN military support of civil authorities. Advise civil, federal, state, and
international agencies in CBRN operations and consequence management for incidents involving CBRN materials.
14–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army Values
and the Warrior Ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across unified land
operations. They must be able to operate in joint, interagency, intergovernmental and multinational (JIIM) environ-
ments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving their objectives. Our officers must be culturally astute
and use their awareness and understanding to conduct operations innovatively and courageously to exploit opportunities
in the challenges and complexities of the operational environment. They must be dynamic, competent warriors who
apply the character attributes and core competencies required of contemporary leaders. Further explanation of these
characteristics can be referenced in ADP 3.0, ADRP 6–22, and chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique skills.
   (1) Decision-making skills. CBRN officers must be able to work in an environment where the volatility, uncertainty,
complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) of a situation influences the time available for problem analysis but where sound
and timely decisions are urgent. Information gained in this environment will vary in its completeness and ambiguity.
An ability to operate under stress, make decisions, and act under a variety of conditions is critical to success.
   (2) Tactical and technical skills. CBRN officers must be technically proficient with branch and mission-unique
equipment, tools, and systems. CBRN mission success requires the proper balance between technical skills and the
ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactical skills at the right moment. These skills must be gained and
developed through repetitive operational and institutional assignments and continuous professional study and self-
development. CBRN officers must not only know their own unique branch skills, tactics, techniques, procedures, and
specialized equipment; but they must also know the uniqueness of the units to which they are assigned or are
supporting.
   c. Unique knowledge.
                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            141

   (1) Officers must possess expert knowledge of CM branch requirements, wide area security/combined arms maneu-
vers CBRN unit support, and coordination principles. This knowledge includes practical experience in tactics, com-
bined arms operations, and the employment of all assets available to the CM branch, as well as general knowledge of
JIIM operations and how the CM Corps supports each of them. Officers gain this knowledge through a logical
sequence of broadening assignments, continuous education, training, and experience sustained through mentoring.
Individual officers sustain knowledge through institutional training and education, experience gained in operational
assignments, and continuous self-development.
   (2) Serving as staff and faculty at the USACBRNS allows officers with operating force assignments to share field
experience with the school and students. In turn, officers from the generating force return to the operating force with an
updated knowledge of doctrinal, training, organizational, leadership, and materiel developments. With such an ex-
change of knowledge and experience between the field and the USACBRNS, these officers ensure that the CM Corps,
sister Services, and the Army are fully prepared to fight and win on the increasingly complex battlefields.
   d. Unique attributes.
   (1) Personal attributes. CBRN officers must know and routinely execute drills and operate within established
standard operating procedures. Officers must be physically fit, flexible, agile, adaptable, and values-based if they, as
warfighters, are to lead CBRN Soldiers effectively across the range of military operations.
   (2) Multifunctionality. CBRN officers initially will perform duties that are branch oriented; however, as the officer
becomes more familiar with systems and their specialty, he or she can expect to be called upon for a wide range of
duties including those providing JIIM exposure. Officers must develop and use a diverse set of skills as they move
between branch TOE and TDA leadership positions and as they serve in branch/generalist assignments. CBRN officers
must be able to design and lead CBRN organizations and personnel that enable the warfighter to retain the highest
levels of combat power.
   (3) Situational understanding of the operational environment. The ability to quickly judge terrain, weather effects,
friendly capabilities, and threat capabilities is vital. This transcends viewing the terrain, analyzing the weather, and
knowing the range capability of threat weapon systems and our weapon systems. It is the ability to visualize the area of
operations and know how terrain and weather impact threat employment of CBRN weapons and how to optimize
CBRN systems in a multidimensional environment.
14–3. Critical officer developmental and broadening assignments
   a. Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear officer career development. CBRN officers develop in the
operations functional category. A CBRN officer should expect, over the span of a 20 to 30 year career, to be assigned
to a variety of units, organizations, and developmental and broadening assignments. An officer will serve in several
troop assignments in CBRN and other units from platoon to Army level; CTC; TRADOC service schools; CM
weapons storage and demilitarization; DA, DOD, field operating agency, OSD, interagency, joint and combatant
command staff positions; and AC assistance to the RC (AC/RC) positions. KD assignments for each grade are listed
below. These positions impact the Army and the CBRN mission over the longer term and are especially challenging.
Officers should seek one or more of these assignments at each level of their career. (See fig 14–1 for an AC career
development model and fig 14–2 for a RC career development model.) Regardless of the assignment, individual
success is ultimately tied to performance.
   (1) Lieutenant.
   (a) Education. Newly commissioned officers will attend the CBRN BOLC at the USACBRNS at Fort Leonard
Wood, Missouri. CBRN BOLC emphasizes leadership, tactics, combined arms operations, maintenance, supply, and
physical fitness. Additional AOCs include CBRN decontamination, obscuration operations, hazardous materials,
radiological operations, CM and biological warfare agents, and CBRN reconnaissance operations. CBRN lieutenants
also undergo training with actual toxic CM agents, biological stimulants, and radioactive sources in the CM Defense
Training Facility. Upon graduation lieutenants are DOD certified at the hazardous materials technician level, prepared
to lead platoons, and serve as battalion CBRN officers. Lieutenants have the opportunity after BOLC to attend
Airborne and other schools if follow-on duty assignments require specific training. Ranger training is authorized for
officers with a projected assignment to the 75th Ranger Regiment.
   (b) Assignment. BOLC graduates should expect to serve in a variety of positions ranging from battalion-level
assistant S3/CBRN officer to CBRN company positions that will develop critical leadership and CM branch skills. KD
duty positions include platoon leader (decontamination, CBRN reconnaissance, or Biological Integration Detection
System), battalion/squadron staff officer, and company executive officer. These positions build a solid foundation that
is the bedrock for the remainder of the officer’s career. Assistant team leader in a CM response team and Aide-de-
Camp assignments are broadening experiences for lieutenants.
   (c) Self-development. Officers who have not completed an undergraduate degree must do so during this point in their
careers. The Degree Completion Program enables selected commissioned officers to complete degree requirements at
accredited civilian colleges and universities as a resident full-time student. Officers interested in the Degree Completion
Program must submit applications through their chain of command to Commander, U.S. Army Human Resources
142                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

Command (AHRC–OPA–C), 1600 Spearhead Division Road, Fort Knox, KY 40121, no later than 7 months prior to
the requested Degree Completion Program start date.
   (d) Desired experience. The focus during the lieutenant years is to acquire and refine leadership and branch-related
coordination, logistics, and administrative skills. Inculcation of the Warrior Ethos and Army core values is essential in
the development of young officers. CBRN lieutenants should also become proficient in both common core and branch
tasks. Before promotion to captain, officers should possess an in-depth knowledge of unified land operations as well as
knowledge of CBRN operations. Experiences on a contingency deployment or other real-world operational mission are
invaluable in preparing lieutenants for detachment/company-level command in an expeditionary Army.
   (2) Captain.
   (a) Education. Officers will attend the CBRN Captains Career Course (CBRN C3 to prepare for detachment/
company-level command and duties in brigade or higher-level staff positions. Officers have another opportunity to
attend Airborne and other military schools en route from the career course to a follow-on assignment Officers are
strongly encouraged to participate in a master’s degree program offering enrollment while attending the CBRN C3. If
not already certified, captains receive incident commander hazardous materials level certification as part of the CBRN
C3.
   (b) Key developmental assignments.
   1. Following attendance at the CBRN C3, captains should expect to serve as a CBRN officer in a BCT or brigade-
level command. In this position, the officer has a major impact on the CBRN preparedness of that unit.
   2. Command is highly desirable for professional development in the CM Corps. CBRN company command opportu-
nities are few and, as a result, are highly competitive. Therefore, many CBRN officers strive for branch generalist
company commands, such as, battalion and brigade HHCs. Captains should aggressively prepare for and seek
detachment/company-level command.
   (c) Developmental and broadening assignments. Officers who have served at least 24 months in a branch-coded
position, preferably to include company command, can be assigned to positions that round out leadership and technical
proficiency listed below:
   1. Division/corps CBRN staff.
   2. Battalion/brigade primary staff.
   3. RC observer controller.
   4. Small group leader.
   5. CTC combat trainers.
   6. Technical escort team leader.
   7. USMA faculty and staff.
   8. ACOM/DRU or joint staff officer.
   9. ROTC staff.
   10. HQDA/Pentagon staff.
   11. USAREC.
   12. Scholarships and internships.
   13. Aide-de-camp.
   14. HRC assignments manager.
   15. Training With Industry.
   16. Instructor, USA Element, Naval Academy.
   17. Contingency support detachment, White House military office.
   (d) Self-development. An officer should dedicate time to complete the CM Corps Professional Reading Program to
gain a historical perspective on tactical, strategic and leadership challenges of interest to CM Corps Soldiers.
   (e) Desired experience. Officers may opt to change their anytime after their 4th year of service through the VTIP
process conducted by HRC. The VTIP panel will approve transfers between AOCs based on needs of the Army and the
suitability of officers to serve in a functional category. The three functional categories are - operations, operations
support, and force sustainment. The change is based upon the needs of the Army, officer preference, military
experience, and civilian schooling. A limited number of officers will be accessed into the AAC upon completion of
detachment/company command. Captains should continue to gain an in-depth understanding of unified land operations
and become proficient in all captain-level common core and branch tasks for CBRN officers. These tasks provide the
foundation of CBRN operations and leadership required to effectively serve in the branch at increasing levels of
responsibility. Captains require a working knowledge of command principles, battalion and brigade-level staff opera-
tions, and combat power/CBRN operations at the battalion to brigade levels.
   (3) Major.
   (a) Education. CBRN officers who remain in the operations functional category will serve in branch, functional
group (maneuver support), or branch/FA generalist assignments. Their primary professional development objective is to
continue to strengthen CM Corps tactical skills and leadership; at this level officers begin to attain JIIM experience and
exposure. Majors will compete for the opportunity to attend the resident ILE common core and Advanced Operations
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             143

and Warfighting Course; successful completion qualifies for the award of JPME I. Note. Completion of ILE is required
prior to 15th year of commissioned service. Completion of ILE is also required to remain competitive for promotion to
lieutenant colonel.
   (b) Key developmental assignments. CBRN majors should aggressively seek one of the following assignments:
   1. Battalion/brigade S3.
   2. Battalion XO.
   3. Deputy division CBRN staff officer.
   4. Joint staff officer (refer to para 3–13 for information on Joint assignments).
   5. Major level commander.
   6. Separate brigade CBRN officer.
   7. Brigade primary staff officer.
   (c) Developmental and broadening assignments.
   1. Division/CORPS/ASCC CBRN staff officer.
   2. ACOM/DRU/HQDA staff officer.
   3. TRADOC staff officer.
   4. SF Group CBRN officer.
   5. USMA faculty and staff.
   6. CTC combat trainer.
   7. RC observer/controller.
   8. Command and General Staff College.
   9. HRC assignments manager.
   10. ROTC.
   11. Maneuver enhancement brigade.
   12. CM/biological arms control/verification.
   13. USAREC.
   (d) Self-development. Majors should continue self-development efforts to become experts in all aspects of the CM
Corps and joint and multinational operations. Self-development should include correspondence courses (such as the
Defense Strategy Course) and civilian education. Officers should devote time to a professional reading program to
broaden their warfighting perspective. Officers should strive to complete a master’s degree or equivalent at this point in
their career. CBRN officers should also seek opportunities to attend the CBRN Senior Staff Planners Course at the
USACBRNS. The course focuses on providing CBRN organizational capabilities, real-time threat and plans briefings,
targeting information, protection, counter improvised explosive devices threats, environmental concerns, combating
WMD, homeland security information sharing, planning at division and higher headquarters and existing intelligence
on the current conflicts.
   (e) Desired experience. For requirements at this grade, officers should have completed multiple developmental
assignments as a major and assignments in CM branch-coded positions for at least 24 months, and ILE.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel.
   (a) Education. Selection for SSC is extremely competitive. Officers are selected to either attend SSC in residency or
to complete SSC through the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course. A HQDA board centrally selects
both of these courses. Self-development objectives should continue to build warfighting and branch technical expertise
as well as support the officer’s FA when applicable. Officers selected for lieutenant colonel in the operations functional
category should seek assignments of greater responsibility in the branch, functional group, and branch/FA generalist
positions. The objective for lieutenant colonel assignments is to seek positions that provide greater contributions to the
branch and the Army that continue to develop overall JIIM skills.
   (b) Key developmental assignments. The pinnacle assignment for CBRN lieutenant colonels is battalion commander.
CBRN lieutenant colonels are centrally selected by a DA board to serve as commanders of CBRN battalions, brigade
special troops battalions, training battalions, ammunition plants, CM facilities, depots, garrisons and recruiting battal-
ions. Commands are typically 24 months in length. In addition, CBRN lieutenant colonels are chosen to serve as
division CBRN officers by the Chief of CM at the USACBRNS. Division CBRN officer assignments are typically 24
months for CONUS and Korea. A SAMS assignment is considered KD after completion of the utilization tour. KD
assignments include:
   1. Lieutenant colonel-level command.
   2. ACOM/ASCC/DRU, HQDA, OSD staff officer.
   3. Joint staff officer (refer to para 3–13 for information on Joint assignments).
   4. Division CBRN officer.
   5. Brigade DCO.
   6. SAMS.

   9. USMA faculty and staff.
   (d) Desired experience. Lieutenant colonels should have successfully completed requirements as a major as well as
assignments as a lieutenant colonel in CM branch-coded positions for at least 24 months.
   (5) Colonel.
   (a) The primary objective for this grade is optimal application of a colonel’s tactical and technical capabilities and
executive and leadership skills in those positions that best support the OSD, combatant command, and multinational
force requirements.
   (b) CBRN colonels are assigned to command and senior staff positions in a wide variety of branch and branch/FA
generalist positions.
   (c) Key developmental assignments. The following assignments are considered KD for CBRN colonels:

   3. USMA faculty and staff.
   4. 01C coded positions in corps and ASCC.
   b. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Officers above the rank of lieutenant can expect to serve in
branch/FA generalist assignments that may or may not be directly related to the CM branch. As the inventory of CBRN
officers dictates, the opportunity to serve in positions such as ROTC instructor, recruiting command, and Inspector
General may be available.
   c. Joint assignments-field grade. CBRN officers can expect to be considered for joint duty assignments worldwide.
After assignment to other KD positions, majors and lieutenant colonels should aggressively seek opportunities for joint
qualification. Joint experience is important to the Army and professionally develops officers for advancement into
senior leadership positions. At this point in their career, officers should be working toward JPME II qualification. Joint
qualification is a benchmark qualification for promotion to colonel. Refer to paragraph 3–13 for information on Joint
assignments.
   d. Other assignments. CM branch officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated
above. These other assignments may include White House/Congressional fellowships, National Security Council duty,
United Nations duty, and CM branch representative at Allied service schools. The spectrum of possible assignments is
large. These assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and important, requiring mature, skilled, and well-
grounded officers. Officers should continue to broaden their experiences by also serving in JIIM assignments as well as
functional group assignments (Maneuver Support).
   e. Army Acquisition Corps. Qualified CBRN officers may request accession into the Army Acquisition Corps. An
annual Army Acquisition Corps accession board selects a small number of CBRN officers following successful
completion of command. These officers are managed as Army Acquisition Corps (FA 51) officers and work strictly
within the acquisition arena in the Force Sustainment functional category for the rest of their careers. An Army
Acquisition Corps officer’s career development is focused toward serving as a program manager or as a commander of
an acquisition command. Throughout their acquisition career, they continue as members of the CM Corps Regiment.
This link between the CM Corps and Army Acquisition Corps should be strong so that the best possible CBRN-related
equipment and systems are developed and procured.
   f. Advanced civil schooling. Some CM Corps positions require advanced degrees. An advanced degree can provide
additional opportunities for select assignments. The corps annually sends officers to graduate school to obtain advanced
science degrees in disciplines, such as chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, and environmental engineering. Selection
is strongly tied to the manner of performance, undergraduate grade point average (GPA), graduate record examination
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            145

scores, and the individual officer’s career timeline. Officers incur a service obligation of 3 years for each year of school
in accordance with AR 350–100. Upon graduation, officers will serve a follow-on utilization tour in a validated
position for 2 or 3 years. (Further details on the Advanced Civilian Schooling Program can be found in AR 621–1.)
   g. Additional military schooling. Officers have additional opportunities to become proficient in several areas that
provide ASIs. Some of these programs and courses are: CBRN Senior Staff Planners Course, Explosive Ordnance
Disposal (EOD), Technical Escort/L3, Stryker NBC Reconnaissance Vehicle/L6, and CBRN Responder/R1.
   h. Branch detail officers. The following applies to branch officers who are detailed:
   (1) Under the branch detail program, some AG, Signal, Finance, MP, Transportation, Military Intelligence, Ord-
nance, and Quartermaster Corps officers are detailed to recipient branches from three to 5 years. As a recipient branch,
the CM Corps receives officers each year from donor branches to fill its lieutenant authorizations. See AR 614–100 for
specific details on the branch detail program.
   (2) Lieutenants detailed to the CM Corps follow the same career development path as basic branch CBRN
lieutenants. They can expect opportunities to serve at the battalion level as an assistant S3/CBRN officer and in platoon
leader and executive officer positions at the company level. These officer development opportunities are the foundation
for successful careers in every branch of the Army. At the end of the detail period, officers revert to their basic branch.
These officers normally attend a transition course sponsored by their basic branch before serving subsequent assign-
ments. (See chap 3 for additional information concerning the branch detail program.)
                                        Figure 14–1. AA Chemical officer development

14–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
   a. Preferences. The CM branch has diverse assignment opportunities that allow for numerous career development
paths. The professional development goal of CM branch officers is to produce and sustain highly-qualified technically,
tactically, and operationally oriented officers to lead the CM branch in combat and on other assigned missions.
Assignments in the CM branch that provide experiences on a contingency deployment or other real-world operational
mission are particularly important in developing leaders in an expeditionary Army. Requirements for individuals in the
Married Army Couples Program are listed in AR 614–100 and requirements for the Exceptional Family Member
Program are listed in AR 608–75. All family concerns for individuals in these programs will be considered by
assignment officers to support these individuals.
   b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility
on the sequence of assignments. Typically, CM branch officers should seek assignments in the following order: CBRN
BOLC, battalion staff (as an assistant S3/CBRN officer), platoon leader, CBRN C3, BCT/brigade staff, detachment/
company command, post-command assignment, battalion S3 or XO or brigade S3 (as a major), ILE, JIIM assignments,
HQDA staff assignment, battalion-level command, division CBRN officer, SSC, JIIM assignments, HQDA staff
assignment, brigade-level command, and Corps or ASCC CBRN officer.
14–5. Duration of critical officer life-cycle assignments
   a. Key chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear positions. At the company grade level, because of the wide
variety of assignments, no one quantitative standard will define success. The most important objective for the CBRN
officer is to become versatile and proficient in the full range of CBRN operations. Captains should strive to serve as a
company or detachment commander for a minimum of 12 months, with a goal of 18 months. Majors should seek to
serve in an S3 and/or XO position for 12 to 24 months. Selected lieutenant colonels and colonels will serve 2 years in
battalion and brigade commands. Colonels selected for garrison command have command tours of 2 years in length,
with an option of a third year.
   b. Chemical branch life-cycle. Figure 14–1 displays a CM branch life-cycle with typical developmental assignments.
14–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
   a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for CBRN officers. To do this the field grade
inventory must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support branch/
generalist positions, and to provide majors the opportunity to serve as a battalion S3/XO while attempting to stabilize
for 3 years.
   b. Officer Personnel Management System implementation. The numbers of authorized CBRN billets, by grade, will
vary as force structure decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring additional
information on CM branch authorizations or inventory are encouraged to contact the personnel development office at
the USACBRNS.
14–7. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for Chemical Corps
   a. Structure. The Army will make changes to the structure of CBRN organizations through the Total Army Analysis
process. Other minor changes are possible due to the iterative nature of the restructuring and recoding process.
   b. Acquire. Officers will continue to be accessed into the CM branch through the USMA, ROTC, and OCS.
Accessions are based on the needs of the Army and officer preference. Because of the lack of branch-specific civil
schooling and opportunities for relevant experience, there will be few opportunities for direct commissioning in the CM
branch.
   c. Distribute. CM branch officers will continue to rotate between TOE and TDA units in CONUS and OCONUS
with a goal of longer assignments at one station.
   (1) Stabilized installation assignments. Officers assigned to installations with ample professional development
opportunities may be stabilized for extended periods. Some company grade officers may be offered the opportunity to
attend CBRN C3, and return to their initial installation.
   (2) Life-cycle units. Officers at all levels assigned to life-cycled units (generally the SBCTs and BCTs) will remain
in the unit for a minimum of 3 years. Branch detailed officers will remain in their detail branch until after completion
of the assignment to the BCT.
   (3) Cyclic units. The majority of the installations will be managed on a cyclic manning system. Replacements will
be sent to these units and installations periodically to maintain readiness of the units. Tour lengths and developmental
positions opportunities can vary. Branch detail officers will remain on standard branch detail timelines.
   d. Deploy. CM Corps officers are warriors who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide
at all times. Whether assigned to deployable TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed-site TDA organizations,
all CM Corps officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the range of military operations. CBRN
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                          147

officers may deploy at any time with their units to deter potential enemies or adversaries and to protect national
interests or as individuals to support joint and multinational operations in stability or defense support of civil
authorities. CM Corps officers must prepare themselves and their families for this most challenging life-cycle function.
   e. Sustain.
   (1) Promotion. CM branch officers will compete for promotion only within the Operations functional category.
Knowledge, skills, experience, duty performance, and adherence to branch requirements are all factors that influence
promotion. Promotion rates will be determined by Army needs/DOPMA goals.
   (2) Command. CM branch officers will continue to be centrally selected for battalion and brigade-level command.
CBRN officer command opportunities are in the operations category. Commands are located in four functional
categories: operations, strategic support, recruiting and training, and installation. Officers have the option of selecting
the category or categories in which they desire to compete for command.
   (3) Officer evaluation report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS. Starting
with captain, the rater will recommend the rated officer for the functional category which best suits his or her abilities
and interests.
   f. Develop. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in
TOE units with troops, staff/TDA assignments, and institutional training assignments. Self-development continues to be
an essential component of officer development. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly employ
CBRN assets and have knowledge of maneuver skills in support of combined, joint, and multinational/coalition
operations. Development occurs through the Army and joint school systems as well. Other officer development areas
include advanced civilian schooling to support the needs of the Army and individual preferences.
   g. Separate. The officer separation process remains unchanged.
14–8. Branch transfer
   a. All officers desiring to transfer into the CM Branch must follow the guidance provided in the CBRN officer
branch-transfer policy memorandum (available upon request).
   b. This policy intends to assist officers in the rank of first lieutenant through non-promotable major who reclassify
to AOC 74. Officers reclassifying into AOC 74 will receive CBRN technical training while limiting redundancy of
previously received tactical (common core, or other) training. The AOC granting authority will award AOC 74 based
on completion of CBRNC3.
   c. Officers in the rank of major (promotable) and above are considered for branch transfer on a case-by-case basis.
Officers may request a grade waiver exception to policy for 74A branch transfer. All requests for grade waiver
exception to policy must be approved in writing by the Commandant, USACBRNS.
14–9. Chemical Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. RC CBRN officer development objectives essentially parallel those planned for their
AA counterparts. Company grade officers must develop a strong foundation through assignments in their branch before
broadening begins. The U.S. Army RC CBRN officer plays a vital role in the CM Corps mission. The RC comprises
the majority of all CBRN units and personnel associated with the CM Corps force structure. Therefore, interaction and
interoperability between the components is essential. Reserve officers commissioned into the CM Corps are designated
branch code 74 (CM) by the Commander, HRC. See chapter 7 for guidance on RC officer development.
   b. Branch developmental opportunities.
   (1) RC CBRN officers should strive for CBRN assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as their
AA counterparts, while understanding that certain assignment opportunities may often be constrained by the geographic
dispersion of units and positions. Therefore, planned rotation into progressively challenging CBRN positions by RC
commands is essential to producing the best-qualified CBRN officer.
   (a) To meet professional development objectives in the USAR, CBRN officers must be willing to serve in the
following Army Reserve categories: TPU, the IRR, the IMA, Army Reserve Element, and the AGR programs.
   (b) Professional development objectives in the ARNG differ from the USAR in that ARNG officers serve in a
variety of assignments within their own states force structure. ARNG officers also have an opportunity to apply for and
serve in Military Technician Programs and the Title 32 or Title 10 AGR Programs.
   (c) Transfers between RC categories are necessitated by geographical considerations, and the need to provide as
many officers as possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions. Such transfers will
normally be temporary, and should not be seen as impacting negatively on the officer’s career. The success of an RC
CBRN officer is not measured by length of service in any one category, but the officer’s breadth of experience, duty
performance, and adherence to branch development goals. Officers may elect to apply for a FA beginning at the rank
of captain. AGR officers will be boarded and accessed into a valid assignment by HRC. The Army Reserve AGR
program is currently open to CBRN second lieutenant to major applicants. For additional guidance on RC officer
development, see chapter 7.
   (2) CBRN officers in the IRR may find assignments in reinforcement units, IMA positions in AC organizations,
148                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

installations, or HQDA agencies, as well as tours of active duty for special work, annual training, or temporary tour on
active duty. Servicemembers are authorized to complete their PME requirements while serving in the IRR and IMA.
   (3) Typical assignments may include the following:
   (a) TPU positions in CBRN units, CBRN positions in non-CBRN units, or TPU branch immaterial positions.
   (b) IMA positions that provide officers the opportunity to train and serve in 74 or branch immaterial assignments
typically in support of AC commands or structure.
   (c) Counterpart training program.
   (d) Positions in Army Reserve Elements.
   (e) AGR tours where AGR officers serve full-time in support of either the ARNG or USAR. Officers receive similar
benefits as AA officers, including the opportunity for retirement after 20 years of active Federal service.
   c. Life-cycle development model. Professional development requirements are normally satisfied by attendance at
military schools combined with planned, progressive assignments in CBRN units or positions. The RC life-cycle
development model for CBRN officers is shown in figure 14–2. In order for a CBRN officer to achieve the desired
branch experience at each grade, the length of service in a given position is not the focus; the key is assignment
diversity and sufficient time served during each assignment to develop branch competence. The following paragraphs
describe how company and field grade RC officers may gain and maintain CM branch experience throughout a career.
The desired goal for CBRN officer assignments is at least one assignment in a CM branch-coded position for a total of
24 months at the company grade level and at least two assignments in a CM branch-coded position for a total of 48
months at the field grade level. Officers should pursue the following experiences:
   (1) Lieutenant.
   (a) Newly commissioned officers branched CM will attend CBRN BOLC Phase III at the USACBRNS, Fort
Leonard Wood, MO. CBRN BOLC prepares lieutenants to lead platoons and serve as battalion CM officers. During
CBRN BOLC, CM lieutenants also undergo instruction with actual toxic CM agents, biological simulants and
radioactive sources in the CM Defense Training Facility. USAR lieutenants must complete CBRN BOLC by the end of
their 2nd year of commissioned service. ARNG officers must report to CBRN BOLC by the end of 18 months
commissioned service or request waiver from NGB.
   (b) A baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university is required for promotion to captain.
   (c) Officers should seek assignments as platoon leaders, company XOs, or battalion assistant S3s/CBRN officers.
These positions build a strong foundation for subsequent development as a CBRN officer.
   (d) Lieutenants should also become proficient in common core tasks.
   (2) Captains.
   (a) All officers should complete a CCC, preferably the resident CBRN C3 at Fort Leonard Wood, MO.
   (b) Officers who have completed the CBRN BOLC or other branch basic BOLC III and are unable to attend the
resident CBRN C3 may receive credit by attending the RC CBRN C3 that consists of a combination of distance
learning course work and resident training at the USACBRNS.
   (c) Officers should seek assignments or experience equivalent to brigade/group-level CBRN officer or other brigade-
level staff positions. Company command is highly desirable for continued professional development. The survey team
leader on a WMD-civil support team is a very desirable developmental assignment in the National Guard.
   (d) CBRN captains should continue to become proficient in common core tasks. An officer should also dedicate
time to complete the CM Corps Professional Reading Program to gain a historical perspective on tactical, technical,
strategic, and leadership challenges of interest to CM Corps Soldiers.
   (e) The desired goal for CBRN officer assignments at the company grade level is at least one assignment in a CM
branch-coded position for a total of 24 months.
   (3) Major.
   (a) The key requirement for development and progression at this grade is enrollment in and completion of ILE
Common Core.
   (b) Field grade officer development paths reflect a greater variety of assignment possibilities. Developmental
positions for majors include maneuver enhancement brigade, sustainment brigade, armored cavalry regiment, or group
CBRN officer; battalion XO and S3; and division or other major command level staff positions.
   (c) CBRN majors should continue self-development efforts to become experts in all aspects of the CM Corps, joint
and multinational operations, as well as in a FA when applicable. Time should be devoted to a professional reading
program to broaden the warfighting perspective.
   (d) Majors should strive to obtain a master’s degree from an accredited college or university, but it is not a
requirement for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
   (e) RC CBRN officers should apply for and if selected participate in USAR additional professional development
opportunities, such as the RC National Security Course.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel.
   (a) ILE Common Core is mandatory for promotion to lieutenant colonel. Note. RC majors must complete ILE
Common Core for promotion to lieutenant colonel (see chap 7).
                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            149

   (b) Developmental positions include lieutenant colonel-level staff positions, CBRN or other battalion-level com-
mands, RSC staff positions, and operational and functional command staff positions. In the National Guard, state joint
force headquarters staff positions and division CBRN officer positions are available and desirable. Self-development
objectives should continue to build warfighting and technical expertise and support the officer’s FA when applicable.
   (c) Assumption of CBRN position duties at the lieutenant colonel level with no prior CBRN training or experience
is discouraged. Fully successful performance generally requires the skills and instincts developed over time by practice
of the CBRN segment of the military art. (Refer to chap 7 for a detailed description of RC career management and
development.)
   (d) RC officers should compete for selection at resident/nonresident SSC.
   (5) Colonel.
   (a) RC lieutenant colonels must complete ILE Common Core for promotion to colonel (see chap 7).
   (b) CBRN positions available at this grade include colonel-level commands, Deputy CBRN brigade commander,
Deputy Assistant Commandant-USACBRNS, NGB, USARC, DA, and Joint staff.
   (c) Assumption of CBRN position duties at the colonel level with no prior CBRN training or experience is
discouraged. Successful performance generally requires the skills and instincts developed over time by practice of the
CBRN segment of the military art. (Refer to chap 7 for a detailed description of RC career management and
development.)

Chapter 15
Military Police Branch
15–1. Unique features of Military Police branch
   a. Unique purpose of Military Police branch. MP Corps officers contribute to operational success by leading MP in
missions supporting unified land operations including offensive, defensive, stability, and civil support operations. These
missions span across the range of military operations from stable peace to major decisive action consisting of lethal or
nonlethal engagement against a wide range of threats. The MP Corps’ diverse capabilities are fully integrated at every
level and mission within the operating environment. MP officers are developed to meet the challenges and demands
inherent across the range of military operations. MP officers must understand: campaign plan execution; cultural,
ethnic, political, tribal, religious and ideological factors; and the dimensions of war (measured in maturity, timing,
infrastructure, and civil authority) that cross through all MP disciplines. MP officer experiences and competencies at
each progressive level of operations (tactical, operational, and strategic) are inherent in developing leaders within the
MP Corps. The MP Corps has three unique critical disciplines: police operations, detention operations and security and
mobility support. These functions are further defined in paragraph b, but introduced here:
   (1) Police operations encompass the associated law enforcement activities to control and protect populations and
resources to facilitate the existence of a lawful and orderly environment and uphold the rule of law.
   (2) Detention operations involves the detainment of a population or group that pose some level of threat to military
operations
   (3) Security and mobility support is a MP discipline conducted to protect the force, noncombatants, and preserve the
commander’s freedom of action.
   b. Unique disciplines performed by the Military Police branch. MP perform three critical disciplines, which support
the range of military operations in all environments. These functions and supporting actions are performed during
unified, JIIM operations as well as during operations exclusive to the Army:
   (1) Police operations is the primary discipline of MP and shapes the actions and perspective of MP Soldiers and
leaders in the conduct and execution of all other disciplines. Police operations encompass the associated law enforce-
ment activities to control and protect populations and resources to facilitate the existence of a lawful and orderly
environment and uphold the rule of law. Police operations and the associated skills and capabilities inherent in that
discipline provide the fundamental base on which all other MP functions are framed and conducted. Within the military
community, the police operations discipline is an enabler of the commander’s inherent responsibility to maintain order
and discipline within the ranks of their formation. This is the most visible application of the police operations
discipline to most Army personnel and includes law enforcement in support of posts, camps, and stations on CONUS
and OCONUS U.S. military installations and base camps. It is through the execution of garrison law enforcement that
MP gain critical interpersonal skills and technical policing and investigative capabilities critical to police operations in
any operational environment. Outside of U.S. territory, MP execute police operations to establish or preserve civil
security, civil control, and support the rule of law. In many operations, especially following major combat operations or
disasters in which host nation capabilities have been destroyed or rendered ineffective, establishing civil security and
civil control are critical to gaining a stable and secure environment. MP execute the police operations discipline early
in these operations in conjunction with security and mobility support missions enabled by police intelligence opera-
tions, to set conditions for successful transition to stability and eventual transfer of authority to host nation police and
security elements. As stability becomes the dominant operation in the operational environment, the focused demand for
MP capabilities generally transitions from primarily security and mobility support to police operations. MP units
provide police development and transition teams to build police capability within the security force assistance
framework as part of a comprehensive effort that includes all instruments of national power. Stability operations
typically produce the highest magnitude of requirements for police operations within the context of the range of
military operations.
   (2) Detention operations are conducted by MP to shelter, sustain, guard, protect, and account for populations
(detainees or U.S. military prisoners) as a result of military or civil conflict or to facilitate criminal prosecution.
Detention involves the detainment of a population or group that pose some level of threat to military operations. The
detention operations discipline ensures the humane treatment of all detainees and is of significant tactical and strategic
importance. MP performing detention operations preserve the capturing unit’s combat effectiveness by relieving it of
the responsibility to secure and care for detainees. Similar to police operations, as stability becomes the dominant
operation in the operational environment, a large part of the demand for MP detention capabilities will transition to and
focus on advising/mentoring the host nation in reestablishing the host nation’s detention capability and capacity to
support the rule of law. MP units perform their detention discipline of collecting, evacuating, and securing detainees
throughout the area of operations. MP MOS 31E, Correction/Detention Specialist, are specifically trained for detention
and confinement of detainees and U.S. military prisoners. Police intelligence operations, the MP integrating function, is
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              151

conducted during detention operations. The police information collected on analysis, may contribute to the command-
er’s critical information requirements; intelligence-led, time-sensitive operations; or detention strategies necessary to
forecast, anticipate, and preempt crime or related disruptive activities to maintain order.
   (3) Security and mobility support is a MP discipline conducted to protect the force, noncombatants, and preserve the
commander’s freedom of action. MP play a critical role in opening a theater and expedite the secure movement of
theater resources to ensure commanders receive forces, supplies, and equipment needed to support the operational plan
and changing tactical situations. Throughout all aspects of the security and mobility support discipline, MP conduct
proactive measures to detect, deter, and defeat threats within the area of operations. During forcible entry operations,
MP provide security and mobility support for lodgments near key points of entry in the operational area that offer
central access to air, land, and sea transportation hubs. MP also provide security and mobility support during major
combat operations to protect the mission command headquarters, equipment, and services essential for mission success
as prioritized by the joint force commander or geographic combatant commander. MP provide the joint force
commander or geographic combatant commander with a wheeled-armor, mobile fighting force that can move, shoot,
and communicate against any threat. Major subtasks associated with the security and mobility support include;
movement support to mobility operations, traffic regulation and enforcement, enforcement of main supply route
regulations, route reconnaissance, movement of dislocated civilians, resettlement operations, populace and resource
control, reconnaissance, surveillance, area and base security, protective services, response force operations, secure
supply routes and convoys, antiterrorism, physical security, logistical security and crime prevention. Police intelligence
operations, the MP integrating function is integrated throughout security and mobility support. Analysis of the police
information collected, may contribute to the commander’s critical information requirements; intelligence-led, time-
sensitive operations; or policing strategies necessary to forecast, anticipate, and preempt crime or related disruptive
activities to maintain order.
   c. Unique features of work in the Military Police branch. MP officers work at all levels of command and staff,
providing daily interaction with JIIM law enforcement organizations participating in Joint Task Forces and multina-
tional force missions. Additionally, MPs participate in a broad spectrum of protection and contingency operations
ranging from security assistance missions to combat operations. MP Soldiers frequently deploy as the contingency
force in support of U.S. policy objectives. MP Soldiers and units are recognized for their unique mission capabilities.
These capabilities include, but are not limited to: expertise in dealing with the demands of cross-cultural operations,
universal acceptability as a force focused on security and safety, and the ability to apply interpersonal communication
skills in conflict resolution using minimum force techniques enhanced through practical experience gained during post,
camp, and station L&O mission execution. These traits make MP units invaluable in supporting contingency and
nation-building assistance operations. Additionally, MP officers will:
   (1) Command and control MP, detention, and Criminal Investigation Division (CID) units and organizations.
   (2) Provide MP coordination and liaison at all Army, joint, and allied levels, as appropriate.
   (3) Serve as host nation police/detention advisors and mentors up to the national level (Ministry of Justice and
Ministry of Interior).
   (4) Develop doctrine, organizations, and equipment for future MP missions.
   (5) Serve as instructors at various pre-commissioning programs, service schools, and service colleges.
   (6) Serve as MP advisors and commanders to USAR and ARNG organizations.
15–2. Officer characteristics required
The MP branch requires officers who are skilled in leadership at all levels, knowledgeable in MP tactics, techniques,
and procedures, possess strong Army Values, leader attributes and leader skills, can quickly adapt to changing
dynamics when dealing with people and encountering complex situations, and fully understand the key leadership
actions that must be taken to ensure success. Additionally, there are branch-unique skills, knowledge, and attributes that
require professional development.
   a. Unique skills. MP officers must possess skill proficiency related to the individual and associated collective tasks
that are part of the three MP disciplines. This includes not only knowledge of the tasks, but the ability to execute them
under a variety of conditions and at progressive levels of command responsibility. MP officers must be versatile leaders
as they deal with complexity in both peace and war where decisions are always critical and high impact, from saving
lives, to conducting combat operations, to enforcing laws in a manner that will be upheld under court scrutiny.
   (1) Decision-making skills. MP officers often work in an environment where time available for problem analysis is
severely constrained, and sound, timely decisions are urgent. Available information in this environment will vary in its
completeness and ambiguity. The ability to operate under stress, develop viable courses of action, make decisions, and
accomplish the mission regardless of constraints is critical to an MP officer’s success.
   (2) Human dimension skills. MP officers must develop skills that allow them to deal effectively with various cross-
cultural, ethnic and human dimensional attitudes encountered in the majority of MP-related activities. A thorough
understanding of these attitudes and emotions is critical to MP success. MP officers deal with a broad range of
152                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

domestic and international issues that require application of the core human values of fairness, patience, and compas-
sion. Therefore, an effective grasp of the human dimension is pivotal in managing situations of stress or conflict, and in
the proper use of conflict resolution or deterrence.
   (3) Leadership skills. Effective leadership is the overarching trait required of all MP officers. It summarizes the
Army’s seven core values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless-service, honor, integrity, and personal courage. Leaders
inspire Soldiers with the will to win and provide purpose, direction, and motivation in all operational environments.
MP officers are expected to study the profession, becoming both tactically and technically proficient. Equally impor-
tant, however, they must continually demonstrate strong character and high ethical standards in order to infuse these
traits into their units and Soldiers. Lastly, MP leaders must take responsibility for their decisions, be loyal to superiors,
subordinates, and peers, inspire and direct assigned resources toward a purposeful end, and provide a vision that
focuses and anticipates the future. The MP officer must constantly refine these skills if he or she is to successfully lead
MP Soldiers.
   b. Unique knowledge. Army and MP professional development programs produce versatile and competent Soldiers
and leaders. The unique aspects of MP knowledge include the development of special qualifications needed to perform
such duties as provost marshal (PM), area security/force protection officer, physical security officer, detention, and
criminal investigations. To be successful, MP officers must possess a high degree of technical knowledge about how
the Army, as well as the MP Corps, functions, and laws and regulations at local, state, federal, and international levels.
Knowledge of the Army should include general knowledge of combined arms; joint, interagency, and multinational
operations; and how the MP Corps supports each of them. Branch officers must maintain a proper balance between
technical skills and the ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactics, techniques, and procedures at the right
time and place. These abilities can only be gained and developed through repetitive operational assignments and
continuous professional study and self-development. MP officers must have the ability to operate independently and
articulate the capabilities of MP Soldiers to others across the full spectrum of military operations.
   c. Unique attributes. The skills and knowledge needed to function as an MP officer supplement core attributes
required of all Army officers. Army officers are expected to maintain the technical proficiency and flexibility necessary
to perform any branch-related mission. However, the nature of the three MP disciplines often demands that MP officers
possess certain attributes unique to the MP Corps. The most critical of these unique requirements are:
   (1) Personal attributes. MP officers must possess exceptionally high moral and ethical values. The MP mission is to
enforce laws, directives, and punitive regulations. This demands that the standards of the MP officer be above
reproach. The diversity of MP functions, particularly those associated with collecting, analyzing and disseminating
information also require MP officers to continually seek self-improvement across a wide range of skills, from computer
applications to interpersonal communications. MP officers have several professional certifications and credentialing
opportunities such as Certified Protection Professional, Professional Certified Investigator, Certified Corrections Execu-
tive and certified corrections manager; a list of all credentialing and certifications for MP officers can be found on the
Credentialing Opportunities On-Line (COOL) Web site (https://www.cool.army.mil/index.htm). Finally, MP officers
must also recognize the critical importance of physical fitness and personal bearing if as warfighters, they are to lead
MP Soldiers effectively across the full range of MP disciplines.
   (2) Professional attributes. MP officers must demonstrate professional attributes that reinforce MP Corps values and
traditions. Skill proficiency, dedication, teamwork, and flexibility, coupled with fairness and respect for others,
highlight the essential traits demanded of every MP Soldier, regardless of rank. These professional attributes form the
basis for the trust that the Army has placed in the MP Corps and is reflected in the mission to impartially enforce the
law.
   (3) Multifunctionality. As MP branch officers progress in their careers, they can expect their assignments to become
increasingly diverse. Initially, officers will perform duties related to their branch. Eventually, as the officer becomes
more familiar with his or her specialty and the Army, he or she can expect to be called upon to perform a wide range
of military duties. This may include serving in various leadership positions, as well as serving in branch/functionally
aligned generalist assignments. MP officers may perform duty outside the branch working JIIM opportunities utilizing
their unique skills. Some MP officers may perform in a joint, intergovernmental or interagency billet as an expert in
protection, working at the Drug Enforcement Administration or Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in countering
terrorism (Joint Terrorism Task Force) or in a multifunctional billet such as Secretary of General Staff, Office Chief of
Legislative Liaison, and so forth.
15–3. Officer developmental assignments
   a. Branch officer key development. MP officers are a part of the Operations functional category. This is an
environment which places great emphasis on leading Soldiers. For company grade officers, the focus is on the platoon
leader, company or detachment command, BCT staffs, MP brigade and battalion staffs and PM operations officers as
key and developmental assignments. In the field grade ranks, the focus is on critical troop-related duty positions such
as battalion S3, battalion XO, brigade S3, division deputy PM, detention unit staff, installation DES or PM, or MP-
coded division staff positions in the command posts, PM or deputy PM of an installation, and battalion and brigade
command. A field grade officer should seek the opportunity for an internship at a large metropolitan police department
to broaden the policing skill set. Other professional development assignments include instructor duty at the MP School
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              153

or one of the senior leadership institutions (Command and General Staff College, USMA, and others), and service on
Joint/DOD/Army/ACOM, ASCC, or DRU staffs. SAMS utilization tours are developmental (not key) assignments
accomplished after an MP officer attends Command and General Staff College. After completion of a SAMS utilization
assignment, the MP officer should spend 12–24 months in MP major KD positions such as battalion or brigade S3/XO
or deputy division PM. Regardless of the duty position, individual success is ultimately and inseparably dependent
upon performance.
   (1) Lieutenant.
   (a) Education. The MP lieutenant’s first objective is to complete BOLC. BOLC emphasizes leadership, tactics,
training operations, maintenance, supply, and physical training. Additional AOCs include MP law and order operations,
communication skills, personnel administration, drivers training, and weapons training. Graduates of BOLC possess the
technical and tactical skills, physical fitness, and leadership qualities required to successfully lead a platoon. They are
familiar with the three disciplines of the MP Corps and are trained on the most critical tasks required of a platoon
leader. These officers demonstrate a thorough understanding of and willingness to live by the Army Values and a firm
grasp of the attributes, skills, and actions that form the foundation of a competent and confident leader. Following
BOLC, selected officers may attend specialized courses, such as the Interservice Nonlethal Individual Weapons
Instructors Course, Special Reaction Team, DA Police Academy, Antiterrorism/Force Protection program manager
(designed for those engaged in Antiterrorism/Force Protection at brigade-level organizations or higher), and Airborne,
Air Assault or Ranger School, to support follow-on assignment requirements and to complement professional develop-
ment. Key MP Schools include Physical Security, Criminal Antiterrorism and Police Intelligence Management, and
Special Reaction Team.
   (b) Assignment. The second objective is a branch assignment with troops. Consistent with Army requirements,
lieutenants can expect an initial assignment as a platoon leader in an MP company. Platoon leader is a KD assignment.
All lieutenants should serve a minimum of 12–18 months as a platoon leader. While serving as a platoon leader,
lieutenants should develop a comprehensive understanding of Army operations and military life that will provide a
solid foundation for assuming the challenge of company command. Additional skill sets learned as a platoon leader are
conducting police operations with their platoons and serving as a duty officer, both of which enhance lieutenants’
tactical policing skill set at the platoon level. Beyond a platoon leader assignment, lieutenants should take advantage of
opportunities to broaden their technical, tactical and leadership skills in company XO or staff officer positions at
battalion or brigade level (MP or BCT) or within an installation PM office. Participation in a combat or contingency
deployment or other real-world operational mission is especially valuable in preparing lieutenants for company or
detachment command in today’s expeditionary Army. Other valuable assignments for MP lieutenants are area security/
force protection officer, detention officer, operations officer, and law and order operations officer.
   (c) Self-development. Platoon leaders should seek to observe/intern with a local police agency (40 hours, ideally)
and/or jail/detention agency. Platoon leaders should also seek professional certifications with accredited civilian
agencies such as the American Society for Industrial Security International, Federal Emergency Management Agency,
and certified corrections manager. Additionally, officers who have not completed an undergraduate degree must do so
at this point in their careers. The Degree Completion Program allows selected officers to complete baccalaureate
degrees at their own expense while still drawing full pay and allowances at their current rank as full-time students at
accredited colleges or universities. Officers are required to have a baccalaureate degree from an accredited university
prior to promotion to captain. Time allotted for degree completion is normally limited to 12 months. Officers interested
in the Degree Completion Program must submit applications through their chain of command to HRC Operations
Division, OPMD, no later than 3 months prior to the requested Degree Completion Program start date.
   (2) Captain.
   (a) Education. Officers are eligible to attend the MP Captains Career Course (MPCCC) between their third and
eighth year of commissioned service. This course prepares officers to command at the company or detachment level
and to serve in MP staff positions. MPCCC trains officers to successfully function as staff officers and ensures that
officers possess the technical, tactical, and leadership skills required to successfully lead companies. Graduates of
MPCCC will have a firm grasp of the attributes, skills, and knowledge that form the foundation of competent and
confident leaders.
   (b) Key developmental assignments. Command of an MP unit (company or detachment) provides invaluable leader-
ship experience for an MP captain. Captains who have not commanded an MP unit will be assigned, if possible, to
locations that provide an opportunity for command for a minimum of 12–18 months. Command of a MTOE or selected
TDA units are considered equivalent assignments. Because of current and projected strengths and the number of
available companies, MP company grade officers should not expect more than one assignment to a command or other
key and developmental position. Some captains may be offered a second command at the U.S. Army MP School, U.S.
Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) Protective Services Unit, Army Corrections Command, brigade
special troop battalions, or BCT HHC, or USAREC.
   (c) Developmental and broadening assignments. MP captains should continue developing their technical and tactical
skills. Maximum hands-on experience in a variety of MP leadership positions should be sought during this phase (CID,
detention, PM, division staff, counter staging units). Other valuable assignments for MP captains include staff officer
positions at the battalion or brigade level, small group leader or staff officer at the U.S. Army MP School, DES, or PM
154                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

operations officer at the installation or ACOM, combat developer or system development officer at the MSCoE, ASCC,
or DRU level. Captains should seek out DES or installation PM operations officer positions when available to include
dual-hatting when serving in command positions. Attendance at branch-specific functional training courses is recom-
mended, depending on timing and opportunity. Opportunities exist to attend the following courses: Law Enforcement
Senior Leaders (LESL) course, Antiterrorism Level II Program Manager Course, Criminal Antiterrorism and Police
Intelligence Management and Physical Security.
   (d) Nominative or generalist assignments. Captains are also eligible for nominative or generalist jobs, such as
USMA faculty and staff, U.S. Army Cadet Command, USAREC, or RC. Assignment to one of these career opportuni-
ties is discussed between the Soldier and the HRC branch assignment manager, and will be confirmed based on the
professional development needs of the officer and Army requirements.
   (e) Functional designation. Functional designation is now through VTIP, but generally occurs between the 4th and
7th year of service.
   (f) Project Warrior. A small number of captains may participate in Project Warrior, a program designed to spread
the expertise developed by CTC observer/controllers to the rest of the MP Corps. After 12 to 24 months at a CTC,
Project Warrior officers are assigned to the MP School as small group leaders to provide additional combined arms
tactical experience to MP instruction and allow CTC lessons learned to be incorporated into the training base.
   (g) Self-development. Though not a requirement for promotion, officers are encouraged to obtain a master’s degree
from an accredited college or university. A number of opportunities exist for highly-qualified MP officers to participate
in fully funded and partially funded graduate civilian education. Two fully funded programs exist, the MP branch
advanced civil schooling program and the Army’s Expanded Graduate School Program. These programs are generally
focused for officers in their 8th to 12th year. MP branch focuses advanced civilian schooling allocations in disciplines
such as detention, criminal justice, or security management. The goal of the Expanded Graduate School Program,
offered post-commissioning to officers with high potential, is development of broader skills such as language, regional
knowledge, diplomacy, governance, etc. Officers selected to participate in a fully funded civilian training or education
program will be assigned to a follow-on utilization tour within an MP unit that best utilizes their degree (for example,
corrections master to the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks or a like unit). MP officers may attend a partially funded
cooperative degree program while attending the MPCCC.
   (h) Attendance at the FBI National Academy is offered to high potential, active duty MP captains and majors who
have completed a baccalaureate degree and the MPCCC, and have successfully commanded. Subjects taught during the
nine-week course include: forensic science, criminal law, behavioral science, and management applications. Upon
graduation officers will be assigned to a follow-on utilization tour that best utilizes the skills learned at the FBI
National Academy. MP captains should also seek out professional certifications from accredited civilian organizations
such as American Society for Industrial Security International, Federal Emergency Management Agency and American
Correctional Association.
   (i) Captains should intern (usually 1 to 3 months) at mid-sized police departments and/or detention agencies.
Internships will allow for officers to gain critical law enforcement practical experience as well as detention experience.
   (3) Major.
   (a) Education. Command and General Staff College for majors is essential for their professional development.
Officers should continue to pursue other professional development goals to include completing a graduate-level degree
if their job requirements permit. The 3-month Command and General Staff College Common Core Course will be
delivered in residence at Fort Leavenworth for most basic branch officers and RC officers, and a complement of sister
Service and international officers. Immediately following the common core course, AC basic branch officers attend a 7-
month Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course at Fort Leavenworth, focused on planning and executing the
range of military operations at the tactical and operational levels. RC officers may attend through TASS which has
classrooms located in the CONUS and overseas, or can take the common core via an advanced distributed learning
course. Officers completing the Command and General Staff College Common Core Course and Advanced Operations
and Warfighting Course are JPME I qualified. History, leadership, and joint instruction receive heavy emphasis
throughout the curriculum. Simulations are used extensively to drive the learning, and officers have multiple opportuni-
ties to practice their warfighting competencies and skills. Other valuable qualifications include language skills and
proficiency.
   (b) Key developmental assignments. KD assignments include MP battalion S3 or XO, MP brigade S3 or XO, CID
battalion/group S3 or XO, deputy division PM, installation deputy DES or PM (when authorized major or higher),
brigade/division MP Planner, OPMG staff officer and Regional Corrections Facility (RCF) or CID Field Office
commander (when authorized a major).
   (c) Developmental and broadening assignments. MP majors should perform duty in strategic staff positions (that is,
HQDA, U.S. Army MP School, ACOM, ASCC or DRU staff) and maneuver unit staffs (for example, Corps, Division,
BCT), and acquire institutional experience to include detention and CID experience. Other typical assignments include
corps staff, ACOM, ASCC, DRU/joint/DOD/Army staff, Command and General Staff College faculty and staff, USMA
faculty and staff, USACIDC, Inspector General, service school instructor, MSCoE concept officer, or RC support.
Majors can also serve in other branch/generalist positions. A small number of officers are selected for the SAMS.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            155

SAMS utilization tours are ’developmental’ (not key) assignments and are completed upon graduation from Command
and General Staff College. After SAMS utilization tours MP majors should seek out 12–24 months in MP major KD
positions.
   (d) Assignments after promotion to major will be closely managed by HRC. MP Branch is responsible for branch
assignments and generalist assignments.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel.
   (a) Education. Lieutenant colonels are encouraged to continue their individual professional development by complet-
ing the SSC program. Selection for the resident phase and the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course
continues to be done by a HQDA central selection board. Lieutenant colonels should consider attending the LESL
course early for added value to DES or PM duties.
   (b) Key developmental assignments. MP lieutenant colonels can expect assignment to senior staff positions where
they will be employed in a wide variety of operational or key branch/generalist positions or Protection Functionally
aligned positions. Key and developmental assignments include division PM, installation DES or PM (when authorized
a lieutenant colonel), MP battalion commander, MP brigade S3 or XO, MP deputy brigade commander, OPMG
division/branch director and MP School staff. A HQDA central selection board will select a limited number of officers
for battalion command and key billet positions. Selection rates for command vary because of the number of commands
available and the size of the year group under consideration.
   (c) Developmental and broadening assignments. MP lieutenant colonels can also be assigned to JIIM/DOD/Army/
ACOM, ASCC, DRU staff assignments, ROTC or RC support and should seek JIIM assignments and internships with
appropriate state and federal law enforcement/detention agencies.
   (5) Colonel.
   (a) The primary objective during this phase of an officer’s career is to maximize use of his or her technical and
tactical capabilities, leader and management skills and other executive skills in positions of senior responsibility. A
wide variety of critical positions are available, to include brigade command, corps, ACOM, ASCC or DRU PM, service
school director, OPMG division director, corps/ASCC protection directors and JIIM/DOD/Army staff assignments.
   (b) A HQDA centralized board will select a limited number of officers for brigade command and key billets.
Selection rates for command vary because of the number of commands available and the size of the year group under
consideration.
   b. Branch, functionally aligned (protection) and area generalist assignments. Officers above the rank of lieutenant
can expect to serve in generalist assignments, such as ROTC, AC/RC liaison, U.S. Army Recruiting, USMA faculty
and staff, and Inspector General, which may or may not be directly related to the MP branch but are important to the
Army.
   c. Joint assignments. MP officers can expect to be considered for joint duty assignments worldwide. After assign-
ment to key and developmental positions, majors and lieutenant colonels should aggressively seek opportunities for
joint qualification. Joint experience is important to the Army and is essential to individual officers for their advance-
ment into senior leadership positions. An officer on the active duty list may not be appointed to the grade of O7 unless
the officer has completed a full tour of duty (36 months) in a joint duty assignment. Although the Assistant Secretary
of Defense (FMP) may waive that Joint duty assignment requirement on a case-by-case basis for scientific and
technical qualifications for MP officers, officers receiving scientific and technical waivers must serve continuously in
the specialized field or serve in a Joint duty assignment before reassignment to a nonscientific and technical position.
(See the National Defense Authorization Act of 2007 for further information).
   d. Other assignments. MP branch officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated
above. These other assignments may include White House Fellowships, duty with the National Security Council, Joint
Chiefs of Staff Internship, or the United Nations, as well as MP branch representatives at allied service schools. The
spectrum of possible assignments is large, and these assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and
important, requiring mature, skilled officers. MP officers should broaden their assignments by serving in positions in
JIIM opportunities and seeking functionally aligned assignments within the protection warfighting: MP, CM, and EN.

computer crime courses.
   (2) Military occupational specialty qualification and development.
   (a) MOS qualification. At all warrant officer grades, CID special agents must be U.S. citizens and qualify for a
security clearance of top secret. The qualifications outlined in AR 195–3 must be met and the Commander, USACIDC,
must accredit CID special agents.
   1. Basic level MOS qualification (WO1). In addition to the general MOS qualifications, CID special agents must
complete the WOCS and the MP WOBC. This course emphasizes the necessary skills to become a team chief that
include leadership, investigative and technical skills, and physical training.
   2. Advanced level MOS qualification (CW2/CW3). Continuation of the CID special agent career path provides for
completion of the MP Warrant Officer Advance Course. This course emphasizes the necessary skills to be a special
agent-in-charge, battalion, group, brigade, and ACOM operations officers and focuses on broad managerial skill sets
required to manage geographically separated and remote organizational assets. This course provides specific technical
and tactical training required at the mid-level supervisory echelon.
   3. Senior-level MOS qualification (CW4). Each selection to higher grade provides for additional training require-
ments. CID special agents are required to complete the WOSC, which is a branch immaterial course provided to all
Army warrant officers of this grade. This course provides specific training that focuses on the ability to work in senior
advisory or supervisory positions and to perform Army staff operations functions.
   4. Master-level MOS qualification (CW5). CID special agents, who acquire the master level for warrant officers,
must complete the WOSSC, which is a branch immaterial course provided to all Army warrant officers of this grade.
Warrant officers at this skill level receive specific training that focuses on senior-level staff skills, leadership,
mentorship, and organizational operations at the strategic level.
   (b) Professional development.
   1. Warrant officer one.
   a. The primary performance objective for the new MP WO1 special agent is a leadership role within a CID unit.
Consistent with Army requirements, WO1 special agents can expect an initial assignment as a senior special agent
assistant to the team chief at a large installation or as a team chief at a small installation. Each WO1 can also expect to
be the senior member of a two-person tactical, deployable investigative team. Each WO1 should continue to develop a
comprehensive understanding of investigative techniques, tactics, and procedures. Each WO1 should develop an
understanding of CID and Army operations that will provide a solid foundation for assuming duties as a detachment
commander/special agent-in-charge.
   b. The WO1 must have experience as an enlisted CID special agent (MOS 31D) and have graduated from WOCS.
The new warrant officer’s first objective is to complete WOBC. Following WOBC, selected WO1s may attend
specialized courses, such as Airborne or Air Assault School, Hostage Negotiation School, or Protective Services
Training to support follow-on assignment requirements and to continue professional development needs.
   c. Warrant officers who obtained a waiver and have not completed an undergraduate degree should continue to work
towards that goal. Qualification for selection as a warrant officer candidate in MOS 311A requires a waiver for any
applicant who has not already earned a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university.
   2. Chief warrant officer two.
   a. CW2 special agents will continue to fill junior leadership roles within a CID unit. The primary performance
objective as a CW2 will be a successful tour as a team chief. CW2 SAs can expect to continue to be the senior member
of a two-person tactical, deployable investigative team.
   b. CW2s should continue developing as leaders and investigators. They should seek functional training and opera-
tional assignments that enhance specific leadership and investigative skills. Examples of training opportunities include
the FBI National Academy, Canadian Police Academy, and advanced training in specific investigative skills that focus
on advanced investigative techniques, such as drug suppression, economic crime, protective services, interviews and
interrogations, forensics, and police intelligence operations or criminal intelligence management. Assignments such as
personal security officer (PSO) and operations staff officer at a CID battalion or brigade are available. A limited
number of opportunities exist for highly-qualified CW2s to participate in fully funded advanced civil schooling as
forensic science officers, or for training and utilization as a polygraph examiner. Staff and specialty training and
assignments should normally only be considered after a successful tour as a team chief. Assignments for a very select
few superior CW2s, as an instructor at the U.S. Army MP School are available. CW2s must complete the Action
Officers Development Course prior to attending the WOAC. Every CW2 eligible for selection to CW3 is expected to
have completed undergraduate studies and have earned a baccalaureate degree.
   3. Chief warrant officer three.
158                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   a. The primary performance objective for the CW3 is a successful tour as a special agent-in-charge (SAC). Any
CW3 who has not served as a SAC should be selected for a SAC position, based on the availability of that position and
the needs of the Army. Other duties include staff and specialty positions, such as personal security officer, police
intelligence operations officer, battalion, group, brigade, or USACIDC staff officer, MP school instructor, and poly-
graph examiner.
   b. No later than 1 year after promotion to CW3, the warrant officer special agent should complete WOAC. This
course must be completed prior to promotion to CW4. CW3s should continue to seek functional training and
operational assignments that enhance specific leadership and investigative skills. They remain eligible for training
opportunities like the FBI National Academy, Canadian Police Academy, and advanced training in specific investiga-
tive skills, such as FSO. Those selected for duties as a SAC will be eligible to attend the annual SAC training course.
Assignments to the U.S. Directorate of Training as branch chiefs are also available. A limited number of opportunities
remain for highly-qualified CW3s to participate in fully funded advanced civil schooling such as forensic science
officers, training, and utilization as a polygraph examiner or digital forensics examiner (DFE) and digital media
collector (DMC). In addition, CW3s should continue to pursue other professional development goals to include work
towards a graduate-level degree. Regardless of the duty position, individual success is ultimately and inseparably tied
to performance.
   4. Chief warrant officer four.
   a. The primary performance objective for the CW4 is a successful tour as a CID battalion operations officer or a
large CID detachment commander. Field investigative unit operations officer, police intelligence operations officer, and
protective service unit operations officer are additional critical CW4 assignments. CW4s can expect assignments to
senior staff or supervisory positions where they will be employed in a variety of operational or instructional positions.
   b. No later than 1 year after promotion to CW4, he or she should complete WOSC. This course must be completed
prior to promotion to CW5. In addition, CW4 should continue to pursue other professional development goals to
include completing a graduate-level degree. CW4s should be given consideration for technical operational assignments
in environments for exposure and experience.
   5. Chief warrant officer five.
   a. The primary objective in utilizing the CW5 is to maximize his or her technical and tactical capabilities, leadership
and management skills, and other executive skills in positions of the highest responsibility in the warrant officer ranks.
Critical positions include battalion operations officer, group operations officer, senior special agent on the Inspector
General team, USACIDC chief of investigative operations, policy and CCWO advisor to the CG, CID, and regimental
chief warrant officer of the MP Corps Regiment.
   b. CID special agents selected for promotion to CW5 will be scheduled to attend the WOSSC. CW5s should
complete a graduate-level degree if they have not already done so. CW5s must be given consideration for technical
operational assignments in JIIM environments for exposure and experience for a minimum of six months. Designees
for regimental chief warrant officer of the MP Corps Regiment will be required to complete the Army Force
Management Course.
15–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
   a. MP Corps Branch Officer preferences and precedence.
   (1) Preferences. The MP branch has diverse assignment opportunities that allow for numerous career development
paths for commissioned officers. The goal of the professional development of MP branch officers is to produce and
sustain highly-qualified, tactically and operationally oriented officers to lead MP Soldiers during wartime, contingency,
and other assigned missions. Assignments in the MP Corps will develop the officer’s ability to achieve that goal.
Requests from officers for assignments that do not contribute to achieving that goal will likely be rejected. MP field
grade officers should look at opportunities to perform as a strategic leader on a Joint Staff.
   (2) Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility
on the sequence of assignments. Typically, MP branch officers should seek the following assignments: MP BOLC,
platoon leader, staff officer in an MP battalion or brigade, installation PM operations officer; MPCCC, company or
detachment command, battalion, brigade or division staff, nominative assignments, JIIM opportunities, Command and
General Staff College, battalion S3 or XO or brigade S3 (as a major), battalion command, division PM, installation
PM, SSC, brigade command, and ACOM, ASCC or DRU PM.
   (3) MP branch officer assignments. MP officers should use the chart at figure 15–1 to determine key and develop-
mental positions throughout their careers.
   (4) Requirements. Officers should meet certain standards in terms of schooling, operational assignments, and manner
of performance within the MP Corps at each rank. Meeting these standards ensures that the officer has acquired the
skills, knowledge and attributes to remain proficient in the MP Corps at that rank. With this proficiency, the officer is
qualified for promotion/retention in the branch. These standards for schooling and operational assignments best prepare
an officer for command or positions of greater responsibility in the branch. All MP branch officers should seek the
opportunity to perform in key and developmental assignments at each rank/grade.
   (5) Company grade key and developmental assignments. Because of the wide variety of MP missions and units, no
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            159

one quantitative standard will define success. The most important objective for MP Corps company grade officers is to
have served in leadership positions (preferably platoon leader and company commander). Platoon leader and company
command positions are critical in that they ensure the MP officer is able to lead, train and care for Soldiers.
Additionally, the MP officer must be well-rounded in the basic techniques needed to execute wartime missions.
Company grade officers should complete the following requirements within the MP Corps.
   (a) Lieutenant. As an MP lieutenant, the officer must complete MP BOLC and one assignment as a platoon leader.
Lieutenants should serve as platoon leaders for a minimum of 12 months, with a goal of 18–24 months.
   (b) Captain. As an MP captain, the officer must meet the following requirements:
   1. Complete the MPCCC. Officers who are branch transferred after successful completion of any branch CCC will
be considered to have met this educational prerequisite.
   2. Captains should serve as a company or detachment commander for a minimum of 12 months, with a goal of
18–24 months.
   (6) Field grade key and developmental assignments.
   (a) Major. As an MP major, the officer should meet the following requirements:
   1. Complete Command and General Staff College.
   2. Serve a minimum of 12 months, with a goal of 18–24 months, as a battalion or brigade S3 or XO, deputy division
PM, RCF/CID field office commander (when authorized a major), installation deputy PM, branch-related position on
joint/DOD/Army ACOM, ASCC, DRU or multinational staffs, instructor at a branch service school, transition team
member, or in any MP branch position that is coded at the rank of major or above.
   (b) Lieutenant colonel. As an MP lieutenant colonel, the officer should serve a minimum of 12 months, with a goal
of 18–24 months, as a battalion commander, division PM, installation PM (when authorized a lieutenant colonel),
brigade S3 or XO, deputy brigade commander, transition team commander, branch-related position on joint/DOD/
Army/ACOM, ASCC, DRU or multinational staffs, or in any MP branch position which is coded at the rank of
lieutenant colonel or above. If selected by a HQDA board, MP lieutenant colonels should complete resident or
nonresident SSC.
   (c) Colonel. As an MP Corps colonel, the officer should serve a minimum of 12 months, with a goal of 18–24
months, in any one of the positions listed below that is coded at the rank of colonel in the MP Branch:
   1. Brigade commander.
   2. Branch-related positions on joint/DOD/Army/ACOM, ASCC, DRU or multinational staffs; ACOM, ASCC, DRU,
or Corps PM; senior director at U.S. or other service schools.
   3. Staff or faculty position at a Command and General Staff College-equivalent service school or USMA.
   4. Division chief or higher position on joint/DOD/Army/ACOM, ASCC, DRU, or interagency staff.
   5. Garrison commander or installation chief of staff.
   6. Nominative or specialized position outside DOD.
   b. Military Police warrant officer Criminal Investigation Division special agent preferences and precedence.
   (1) Preferences. The MP warrant officer has diverse assignment opportunities, which allow for numerous career
development paths. The goal of the professional development of MP warrant officers is to produce and sustain highly-
qualified and tactically and operationally oriented warrant officers to lead CID special agents and other Soldiers during
wartime and on other assigned investigative missions in tactical and garrison environments for the joint and expedition-
ary Army force. Assignment within the MP Corps and the USACIDC will develop the warrant officer’s ability to
achieve that goal. Requests from warrant officers for assignments which do not contribute to achieving that goal will
likely be rejected.
   (2) Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility
on the sequence of assignments. Typically, MP warrant officers should seek assignments and training in the following
order: WOCS, MP WOBC, CID team chief, special agent-in-charge of a small CID office, MP WOAC, special agent-
in-charge of a large CID office or CID detachment commander, MP School instructor, battalion/group investigative
staff officer, MP WOSC, battalion operations officer, USACIDC investigative staff officer, MP School division chief,
WOSSC, group or USACIDC level investigative operations officer, CCWO advisor to the CG of USACIDC, and
regimental warrant officer of the MP Corps Regiment.
   c. Miltary Police warrant officer Criminal Investigation Division special agent assignments. Figure 15–2 displays an
MP branch time line with key and developmental positions for warrant officers. Additionally, it identifies those
positions that serve as key and developmental jobs for MP warrant officers.

                                   Figure 15–2. Military Police warrant officer development
15–5. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
The number of authorized MP billets, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions are made, and actions to
implement them are taken. The goal of the MP Corps is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for MP officers while
providing an agile, adaptive, and ready force to execute all assigned missions. To do this, the field grade inventory
must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support branch/FA
generalist positions, and to provide majors with up to 2 years of key and developmental position time. Officers desiring
more information on MP branch authorizations or inventory, by grade, are encouraged to contact the U.S. Personnel
Proponency Office or HRC MP Branch assignment officer.
15–6. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for Military Police Corps
   a. Structure. Any changes to the authorizations of MP units will be based on the restructuring and recoding.
Additional changes may result due to the iterative nature of the restructuring and recoding process.
   b. Acquire. The majority of commissioned officers in the MP Corps are accessed directly from ROTC and USMA
and, to a lesser extent, OCS. All officers should meet the physical and aptitude requirements specified in AR 40–501.
Designation of the MP Corps as an initial branch is regulated by HQDA through the various commissioning sources.
The remainder of commissioned officers in the MP Corps is acquired through in-service branch transfers. Accession
via branch transfer is directed by HQDA and may be voluntary or involuntary based upon the needs of the Army.
Officers of other branches who desire a transfer to the MP Corps may submit a written request for branch transfer in
accordance with AR 614–100.
   c. Distribute. MP branch officers will continue to rotate between operating force and generating force units in
CONUS and OCONUS with a goal of longer assignments at one station (consistent with Army Force Stabilization
policies). Officers should have more time to gain the requisite skills in their branch and their branch/FA generalist
assignments. In particular, majors should receive more key and developmental position time and increased stability.
Operations functional category MP officers will work either in branch or branch/FA generalist positions.
   (1) Officers assigned to installations with ample professional opportunities may be stabilized at that installation for
extended periods. Additionally, some company grade officers may be offered the opportunity to attend the MPCCC and
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            161

return to their initial unit of assignment. Individual timelines are affected by Army, MP, and ARFORGEN
requirements.
   (2) Life-cycle managed (LM) units. Consistent with Army focus on force stabilization, officers at all levels assigned
to LM units (generally SBCT/IBCT/HBCT) will remain in the unit for a minimum of 3 years.
   (3) Cyclic units. The majority of installations will be managed on a cyclic manning system. Replacements will be
sent to these units and installations periodically to maintain readiness of the units. Tour lengths and developmental
position opportunities can vary.
   d. Train and develop. Today’s MP officer is confronted by two diverse and complex challenges. First, the officer
should lead and train Soldiers who can achieve tactical success; protect and expedite the movement of critical
resources; evacuate, process, and intern enemy prisoners of war; and support law enforcement operations. Second, in
the garrison environment the officer manages technical planning and supervision in the areas of law enforcement, crime
prevention, criminal investigations, antiterrorism, physical security, and detention. To master the skills required to meet
these challenges, MP officers selected for major must complete Command and General Staff College. Officers selected
for colonel should complete SSC if selected by a HQDA board. Professional development can also occur through
TASS via select self-development courses.
   e. Deploy. MP branch officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to Operating Force (MTOE) units or generating force (fixed-site TDA)
organizations, all MP officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. MP
officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests, or as
individuals to support joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping
missions. MP branch officers must prepare themselves and their families for this most challenging experience.
   f. Sustain.
   (1) Promotion. MP branch officers will compete for promotion only within the Operations functional category.
   (2) Command. Senior MP branch officers will continue to be centrally selected for command. Command opportuni-
ties for MP Corps officers are included within the operations, strategic, recruiting and training, and installation
categories. MP commands generally fall within four groups: combat support, detention, criminal investigation, and law
enforcement. The results of the command selection process are announced in the CSL.
   (3) Officer evaluation report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS starting
with captain, the rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the functional category which best suits his
or her abilities and interests.
   g. Transition. The separation process for MP officers remains unchanged.
   h. Compensate. Pay and benefits are handled through the DCS, G–1 with special recruiting or retention benefits
staffed through the Office of the PM General.
15–7. Military Police Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. MP officers in the RC play a vital role in the total force structure during peace as
well as mobilization. A majority of requirements in the MP Corps are in the RC, and certain specialized organizations
such as detention units exist almost entirely within the USAR and ARNG. To fulfill its wartime mission, the MP Corps
must rely on extensive interaction with the RC. Wartime effectiveness will depend to a large extent on the quality and
level of training RC MP officers receive. RC MP officers serve the same roles and missions as their AC counterparts.
   b. Reserve Component officer qualifications and development. To meet professional development objectives, RC
officers should rotate among TPUs (USAR) or M–Day units (ARNG), IRR, and IIMA assignments. Those interested in
serving the National Guard or Army Reserve on a full-time basis may apply for entry into the AGR program. Officers
selected for the AGR program may elect to complete an active duty career in support of either the National Guard or
Army Reserve. RC officers are assigned to positions in MTOE and TDA organizations; however, the vast majority of
positions are in MTOE units. Their duties and responsibilities will be fundamentally the same as their AC counterparts,
with the exception of those personnel management, administrative and operational requirements unique to the National
Guard and Army Reserve. All RC MP assignments are open to both male and female officers.
   (1) The RC MP officer has a challenging and complex mission. The officer should lead and train Soldiers who can
achieve tactical success. He or she must be tactically and technically proficient and capable of executing the three MP
disciplines of police operations, detention and security, and mobility support. Additionally, the ARNG MP officer plays
a major role in preparing for and providing assistance to their state during natural disasters, sensitive public activities,
consequence management events, and civil disturbances. A requirement for proficiency in both battlefield operations
and peacetime MP skills usually means a wide variety of educational opportunities and challenging assignments for the
MP officer.
   (2) The majority of RC officers appointed for assignment in the MP Corps come from ROTC, federal OCS, and
state OCS programs. All officers meet the prerequisites specified in AR 135–100 for appointment in the RC of the
Army. HQDA and area commanders regulate appointment to the MP Corps as an initial branch. Additional require-
ments for appointment of ARNG officers are listed in NGR 600–100.
   (3) Positions in all MP skills are available to RC officers. National Guard warrant officers Federal recognition and
162                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

related personnel actions are found in NGR 600–101. The qualifications and professional development for RC CID
special agents are in paragraph 18–3.
   c. Development model. There are three phases of professional development for RC MP Corps officers (see fig 15–3).
These phases are related to military rank and depict broadly based goals and career opportunities at each rank so that
an officer may expand capabilities and optimize performance. These objectives are flexible since the actual course of
an officer’s professional development and utilization will be influenced by RC requirements and the officer’s strengths,
experiences, performance and desires.
   d. The professional development objectives for Reserve Component officers by grade are as follows:
   (1) Lieutenant.
   (a) The MP lieutenant’s first objective is to complete MP BOLC. Lieutenants appointed without concurrent active
duty should complete MP BOLC within 24 months of the date of appointment. This course emphasizes leadership,
tactics, training operations, maintenance, supply, and physical training. Additional areas of study include MP opera-
tions, law, communication skills, personnel administration, drivers training, and weapons training. Graduates of MP
BOLC possess the technical and tactical skills, physical fitness, and leadership qualities of the MP Corps and are
trained on the most critical tasks required of a platoon leader. These officers demonstrate a thorough understanding of
and willingness to live by the Army Values and a firm grasp of the attributes, skills, and actions that form the
foundation of a competent and confident leader. Following MP BOLC, selected officers may attend such specialized
courses as Airborne and Air Assault to support their follow-on assignment.
   (b) The second objective is a branch material assignment with troops. Consistent with Army requirements, RC MP
lieutenants can expect an initial assignment as a platoon leader for a minimum of 24 months (with a goal of 24 to 36
months). This will ensure lieutenants develop a comprehensive understanding of Army operations and military life that
will provide a solid foundation for assuming the challenge of company or detachment command. Lieutenants should
seek leadership positions and every opportunity to broaden technical, tactical and leadership skills in support of the MP
combat and peacetime missions. Some assignments may also be with a battalion or brigade headquarters staff. Nearly
all are with counter staging or detention organizations.
   (c) RC MP lieutenants are eligible for promotion to captain when they meet the service and educational require-
ments contained in chapter 7.
   (2) Captain.
   (a) RC officers of the MP Corps in the rank of first lieutenant or higher who have completed an officer BOLC are
eligible to attend the MPCCC. The MPCCC may be taken in residence at the MP School or an RC officer may
complete the MPCCC–RC, which consists of four phases in combination of DL and resident training, and is designed
for the RC officer to complete each resident phase in an annual training period. This course is sequential; therefore, the
student must complete each phase before moving to the next. Phases one and three are DL and Phases two and four are
resident phases. The DL portions are taken online with instructor-to-student and student-to-student interaction capabil-
ity either in asynchronous or synchronous mode through the MSCoE’s Life Long Learning Center. Each DL phase
prepares the officer to successfully complete each resident phase. The culminating event of MPCCC–RC is the Joint
Warfighter Exercise (Phase four). MP, CM, and EN captains participate in this exercise, taking everything they have
learned and effectively applying it throughout the exercise. The phases, coupled with the resident phases, allow
instructors to keep the course material current and compliant with the operating environment. MPCCC–RC prepares
officers to command at the company or detachment level and to successfully function as a staff officer and ensure that
the officers possess the technical, tactical, leadership, and physical fitness skills required to lead successfully a
company or detachment.
   (b) The most critical leadership position for an MP captain to hold is commander of a company or detachment for a
minimum of 24 months (with a goal of 24 ot 36 months). Officers should seek maximum hands-on experience in a
variety of MP leadership positions as captains. RC captains should actively pursue assignments in both TPU/M-day
units and as IMAs to broaden their professional experience and enhance opportunities for training and education.
Captains can expect to serve in a broad range of command and staff assignments, including a variety of generalist
opportunities. MP captains should continuously strive to develop their technical and tactical skills in preparation for a
field grade assignment.
   (c) RC captains are required to complete CCC to be considered for promotion to major. RC captains who are
serving in an active status and meet educational, performance and service requirements may be selected for promotion
by a centralized mandatory board or by a unit board convened to fill vacancies.
   (3) Major.
   (a) The primary professional development objective of an RC MP Corps major is to continue to strengthen MP
skills. Key and developmental assignments at this rank are battalion or brigade S3 or XO, or deputy division/RRC PM
for a minimum of 24 months (with a goal of 24 to 36 months).
   (b) The needs of the service increasingly dictate that an officer serve in positions away from troops. Key and
developmental positions at this rank include observer/controller in an exercise division in support of unit training and
readiness; instructor/staff officer in an institutional training division in support of the TASS; and staff officer at a
brigade or above.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             163

   (c) Regardless of their career track, MP majors should ensure they attend DL or resident Command and General
Staff College. RC officers are required to complete Command and General Staff College common core to be
considered for promotion to lieutenant colonel, timely completion is key to remaining competitive. RC officers may
attend Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course through TASS which has classrooms located in the CONUS and
overseas, or can take the common core via an advanced distributed learning course.
   (d) RC majors who are serving in an active status and meet educational and service requirements may be selected
for promotion by a centralized mandatory board or by a unit board convened to fill position vacancies based on status.
Majors not selected for promotion after consideration by two consecutive mandatory boards are not retained beyond 20
years of commissioned service unless selectively continued.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel.
   (a) Lieutenant colonels can expect assignments to senior staff positions where they will be employed in a variety of
branch and generalist positions in units, training centers and headquarters elements. Division PM, brigade S3 or XO, or
deputy brigade commander are key assignments during this phase.
   (b) At this phase, officers may be selected for battalion command or its equivalent, as identified by their JFHQ or
U.S. all-designated positions list. Only a very small percentage of eligible officers will actually have an opportunity for
battalion command because of the limited number of command positions available. RC officers not selected for
battalion command should seek out positions of increased responsibility that capitalize on skills. Promotion to colonel
without battalion command is possible based on the overall strength of the officers’ file.
   (c) Lieutenant colonels are required to complete Command and General Staff College common core to be consid-
ered for promotion to the rank of colonel. RC lieutenant colonels are encouraged to complete SSC, if selected by the
ARNG and the USAR boards. Standards for the selection process can be found in AR 350–1.
   (d) RC lieutenant colonels are eligible for selection to colonel upon completion of the requisite service requirements
listed in chapter 7. Lieutenant colonels remain eligible for promotion to colonel as long as they continue to serve in an
active status and meet the selection criteria.
   (5) Colonel.
   (a) The primary objective for this phase is maximum use of the officer’s technical and tactical capabilities and his or
her managerial and executive skills in positions of senior responsibility.
   (b) Colonels are encouraged to complete SSC. Both the ARNG and USAR conduct SSC selection boards, and
standards for the process can be found in AR 350–1. Only a very small percentage of eligible officers will actually
have an opportunity for brigade or equivalent command because of the limited number of command positions available.
RC officers not selected for brigade command should seek out positions of increased responsibility that capitalize on
skills. Promotion to brigadier general without brigade command is possible based on the overall strength of the
officers’ file.

Chapter 16
Special Forces Branch
16–1. Unique features of the Special Forces Branch
   a. Unique purpose of the Special Forces Branch. The mission of the SF is to conduct special operations across the
full range of military operations in any operational environment. SF expands the range of available options to the
geographic combatant commander in a variety of scenarios where the commitment of conventional military forces is
not feasible or appropriate. They provide military capabilities not available elsewhere in the armed forces. They are the
only force specially selected, trained, and equipped to conduct Unconventional Warfare. SF operations are inherently
JIIM. These operations are conducted at the operational and strategic level. SF Soldiers are language trained, culturally
astute, and regionally oriented. SF frequently conduct their operations with or through indigenous forces.
   b. Unique functions performed by the Special Forces Branch. The SF Branch is within the operations functional
category. As representatives of the United States in foreign countries, SF often serve as trainers and advisors as well as
Soldiers. In war, SF provide unique combined, joint, or unilateral capabilities to the combatant commander. They
interact closely with and live under the same conditions as the indigenous forces. They conduct peacetime operations
and promote regional stability in areas where conventional forces normally do not operate. Their continuous forward
presence assists in creating the conditions necessary for stable development, thereby reducing the risk of armed
conflict.
   c. Unique features of work in the Special Forces Branch. The U.S. Army organizes, trains, and equips SF to
perform their core tasks of Unconventional Warfare (UW), Foreign Internal Defense, Direct Action, Special Reconnais-
sance, Counterterrorism (CT), Counterproliferation, and support to Information Operations. Through the conduct of
these seven core tasks, SF supports the United States Special Operations Command’s (USSOCOM) specified SOF core
tasks. SF missions are dynamic, constantly evolving in response to political-military considerations, technology, and
other considerations.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            165

   d. Special Forces nine principal tasks.
   (1) UW is the core activity for Army SF. UW is defined as activities conducted to enable a resistance movement or
insurgency to coerce, disrupt, or overthrow a government or occupying power by operating through or with an
underground, auxiliary, and guerrilla force in a denied area (FM 3–18).
   (2) Foreign Internal Defense is defined as participation by civilian and military agencies of a government in any of
the action programs taken by another government or designated organization to free and protect its society from
subversion, lawlessness, and insurgency (JP 3–22).
   (3) Security force assistance is defined as DOD activities that contribute to unified action by the U.S. Government
(USG) to support the development of the capacity and capability of foreign security forces and their supporting
institutions (JP 3–22). Foreign Internal Defense and security force assistance are both subsets of security cooperation;
neither is considered a subset of each other. Security force assistance also prepares Foreign Security Forces to defend
against external threats and to perform as a part of an international coalition as well.
   (4) Counterinsurgency (COIN) operations are those military, paramilitary, political, economic, psychological, and
civic actions taken by a government to defeat an insurgency (JP 3–24).
   (5) DA is defined as short duration strikes and other small-scale offensive actions conducted as a special operation
in hostile, denied, or politically-sensitive environments and which employ specialized military capabilities to seize,
destroy, capture, exploit, recover, or damage designated targets (JP 3–05).
   (6) Special Reconnaissance is defined as reconnaissance and surveillance actions conducted as a special operation in
hostile, denied, or politically-sensitive environments to collect or verify information of strategic or operational signifi-
cance, employing military capabilities not normally found in conventional forces (JP 3–05).
   (7) CT is defined as actions taken directly against terrorist networks and indirectly to influence and render global
environments inhospitable to terrorist networks (JP 3–26).
   (8) Counterproliferation is action taken to defeat the threat and/or use of WMD against the United States, our forces,
allies, and partners (JP 3–40). Special Forces Operational Detachments (SFODs) designated in national and theater
contingency plans to participate in Counterproliferation may be specially task-organized, trained, and equipped.
   (9) Information Operations are defined as the integrated employment, during military operations, of IRCs in concert
with other lines of operation, to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp the decision-making of adversaries and potential
adversaries while protecting our own (JP 3–13).
   e. Special Forces officer roles.
   (1) SF officers plan, coordinate, direct, and participate in SF operations in all operational environments. An SF
captain commands a Special Forces Operational Detachment-Alpha (SFOD–A). The SFOD–A is a flexible and highly
trained unit, which includes one SF warrant officer and ten SF NCOs. The NCOs hold one or more of the following
specialties: operations, intelligence, weapons, communications, engineering, or medical. The SFOD–A must be adept at
accomplishing a wide range of requirements to include training management, mission planning, logistical planning,
resource management, training plan development for foreign forces, and negotiating and working with foreign and U.S.
government agencies and country teams. SF officers that successfully command an SFOD–A may later command larger
SF units. They serve on upper echelon SF, Army and Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF) staffs, as SOF
observer/controllers at CTC, in SMUs, and in interagency assignments. They also serve as special operations staff
officers at various higher-level conventional Army and joint staffs as well as on the staff and faculty of the U.S. Army
John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS).
   (2) The SF warrant officer is an adaptive technical expert, combat leader, trainer, and advisor. They are experienced
subject matter experts in UW, as well as operations and intelligence fusion, JIIM operations, training management, and
mission planning and execution at all levels across the operational continuum. Through tiered progressive levels of
expertise in assignments, training, and education, SF warrant officers support a wide range of SF missions throughout
their career. They advise commanders on all aspects of special operations. SF warrant officers are accessed with
specific levels of technical ability from the SF NCO ranks. The following are specific characteristics and responsibili-
ties of the separate, successive warrant officer grades:
   (a) Warrant officer one/chief warrant officer two. The SF WO1, CW2, and selected CW3s serve on the SFOD–A as
the assistant detachment commander or detachment commander in his absence. In this role they serve to ensure the
maintenance of institutional knowledge and continuity on the operation detachment alpha. As they gain expertise in
special operations, they focus on integrating SOF systems with other branch systems. CW2s may serve on SFOD–Gs
as well. SFOD–Gs are equivalent to SFOD–As.
   (b) Chief warrant officer three. The SF CW3 is an advanced level expert in special operations who performs the
primary duties of company operations warrant officer, serves as an institutional instructor, and leads specialized staff
sections at the battalion and group levels. They also perform any other branch-related duties assigned to them. CW3s
may serve on SFOD–Gs and SFODEs as well. SFOD–Gs and SFODEs are equivalent to SFOD–As and Special Forces
Operational Detachment-Bravo (SFOD–Bs) respectively.
   (c) Chief warrant officer four. The SF CW4 is a senior-level expert in special operations who performs the duties of
a battalion operations institutional instructor, leads specialized staff sections at group or higher special operations
166                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

commands and serve in branch immaterial assignments in accordance with the needs of the Army. CW4s may serve on
SFODEs as well. SFODEs are equivalent to SFOD–Bs.
   (d) Chief warrant officer five. The SF CW5 is a master-level expert in special operations who performs the primary
duties of senior warrant officer advisor at the group level and higher in both Army and Joint assignments. Select SF
CW5s may serve in nominative positions as CCWOs at the SF group level and higher or as Commandant of the SF
Warrant Officer Institute.
16–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Unique skills.
   (1) SF officers will—
   (a) Be proficient infantry tactical commanders and should be Ranger-qualified or attend the U.S. Army Ranger
Course prior to arriving at their first group of assignment.
   (b) Be experts in SF operations and the nine SF principal tasks.
   (c) Be tactically and technically proficient in the skills required of an SFOD–A.
   (d) Have an aptitude for learning a foreign language. They must sustain foreign-language proficiency throughout
their careers. This is an essential skill and is critical for all SF officers. During the Special Forces Qualification Course
(SFQC), officers who do not already meet language requirements receive extensive foreign language and cultural
training. All officers must successfully meet the current USAJFKSWCS published language course standard require-
ments before graduating and joining an SF group. The language trained in at the SFQC is the officer’s control
language.
   (e) Be qualified military parachutists, with a goal of attaining a senior parachutist rating by promotion to major.
   (2) SF warrant officers will—
   (a) Be proficient in the nine SF principal tasks, intelligence operations, and tactical skills.
   (b) Be familiar with all the technical skills of an SFOD–A.
   (c) Have an aptitude for learning a foreign language. They must sustain foreign-language proficiency throughout
their careers. This is an essential skill and is critical for all SF warrant officers.
   (d) Be qualified military parachutists, with a requirement of successfully completing Jumpmaster training by
promotion to CW3.
   b. Unique knowledge.
   (1) SF officers and warrant officers require an in-depth knowledge of at least one region of the world and
proficiency in at least one of the region’s languages.
   (2) Officers must complete the SFQC. This provides officers with entry-level knowledge of SF operations. As they
develop, officers gain a broader understanding of SF tactics, techniques, and procedures; the special operations
targeting and mission planning process; the special operations support and sustainment process; and the joint, multina-
tional, and interagency aspects of special operations.
   (3) SF officers and warrant officers must have a unique knowledge of many specialized tactics, techniques, and
procedures that support SF operations.
   c. Unique attributes. SF officers and warrant officers will—
   (1) Have the ability to solve complex political-military problems and to develop and employ conventional or
unconventional solutions. Develop and employ non-doctrinal methods and techniques when applicable. Be capable of
decisive action for missions in which no current doctrine exists.
   (2) Have good interpersonal and cross-cultural communications skills as well as political acumen and cultural
sensitivity. Mission success will often depend on their ability to establish rapport and influence the attitudes and
behaviors of people from foreign cultures.
   (3) Be an adaptive thinker who is able to thrive in complex and ambiguous situations.
   (4) Be mentally flexible and willing to experiment and innovate in a decentralized and unstructured environment.
   (5) Be self-reliant team players who can function as leaders independently or in tightly knit small groups.
   (6) Have the cognitive resilience and mental dexterity to act autonomously under extreme stress and be able to
inspire others to perform effectively in highly stressful environments.
   (7) Be able to learn new skills, accept new ideas, and teach others.
   (8) Have unquestioned personal integrity and moral courage.
   (9) Be physically fit.
16–3. Professional development overview
   a. Commissioned officers. The SF Branch is one of three branches that make up the ARSOF group within the
operations functional category. The SF Branch consists of officers in the grade of WO1 through Colonel. The SF
Branch is a volunteer non-accession branch that draws its officers from other branches of the Army, or in the case of
warrant officers, from within enlisted CMF 18. The USAREC recruits SF officer volunteers. A DA Secretariat
accession board selects promotable First Lieutenants who volunteer in the targeted year group. The volunteers must
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              167

undergo and pass a rigorous assessment and selection program prior to starting SF training. SF officers must first serve
a successful initial tour as a Lieutenant in a small-unit leadership position in one of the Army’s other basic branches.
This ensures that they have knowledge of conventional Army operations and leadership experience. All SF officers are
airborne qualified and maintain that proficiency throughout their careers. They attend the SOF CCC. Based on
operational requirements, SF officers will undergo training in advanced special operations skills such as Military Free
Fall, Combat Diver, military mountaineering, and completion of the Advanced Training and Language Course (ATLC).
Throughout their careers, SF officers enhance their knowledge by increasing their understanding of the joint and
interagency aspects of special operations while they command SF units at levels of increasing responsibility. SF
captains lead detachments; majors lead companies; lieutenant colonels lead battalions; and colonels lead groups. SF
officers should seek post-KD assignments to USAJFKSWCS at all grade levels.
   b. Warrant officers. The SF warrant officer is a volunteer accessed from CMF 18. All candidates attend the Special
Forces Warrant Officer Technical and Tactical Certification Course (WOTTC) at USAJFKSWCS, Fort Bragg, NC. The
WOTTC is comprised of Army common core officer leadership tasks and SF WOBC tasks. At key points in their
career, SF warrant officers will attend the WOAC, WOSC, SFWOSC, and WOSSC. SF warrant officers serve at SF
detachments, companies, battalions, groups, ACOMs, and joint and interagency commands. Based on operational
requirements, SF warrant officers may also undergo training in advanced special operations skills such as military free
fall parachuting, combat diver, advanced special operations techniques, ATLC, and military mountaineering.
   c. Regional focus. SF officers and warrant officers continuously undergo intensive preparation for assignment in
their unit’s designated geographic areas. Whether the mission profile calls for clandestine employment in a denied area
or a low-visibility Foreign Internal Defense mission in a developing nation, the overall requirement for regional
orientation, language proficiency, and cross-cultural interpersonal skills remain the same. SF officers and warrant
officers gain and maintain area orientation through military and civilian schooling, language study, area study, mission
preparation, and repetitive operational experience during their careers. While Soldiers gain initial language qualification
through formal instruction, they maintain language skills through practice and self-study. Defense Language Profi-
ciency Test and Oral Proficiency Indicator scores reflect language proficiency. Soldiers must update their Defense
Language Proficiency Test scores annually through formal testing. The organization of SF groups is by region,
however, the management of regional expertise is subject to modification as the needs of the Army change.
16–4. Officer development assignments
An officer must first successfully serve in his basic branch to be eligible for SF (see paragraph 16–8b, below). Upon
graduation from the SFQC, the officer serves in a KD position as a SF captain, followed by other developmental
positions described in the following paragraphs.
   a. Captain.
   (1) SF Branch is a non-accession branch. To meet Army MEL requirements, every SF officer must complete the
SOFCCC before attending the SFQC.
   (2) Upon successful completion of the SOFCCC, captains will attend the SFQC (60–64 weeks).
   (3) SF captains should successfully command an SFOD–A, optimally for 24 months. This is the KD position for all
SF captains. Specially selected captains may command an SFOD–G in a group’s 4th Battalion which is key and
developmentally equivalent to SFOD–A command. Both of these commands equate to company, battery, or troop
command in the other operations branches.
   (4) All SF captains should optimally serve a minimum of 36 months in a 18A coded position within a SF group.
Select captains may remain assigned for up to 4 years in a SF group.
   (5) The primary preferred developmental assignment for a SF captain is in a position coded 18A as a staff officer in
an SF operational battalion or group headquarters. Other preferred developmental assignments include the following:
   (a) Service in a second command following the officer’s initial detachment command. Selection to a second
command is appropriate for an officer with high potential. Preferred second commands include group HHCs as well as
Battalion Headquarters and Support Company (HSC).
   (b) Service in a SMU.
   (c) Service as a joint staff officer.
   (d) Service as an instructor at the 1st Special Warfare Training Group (SWTG).
   (e) Service as an observer/controller at a CTC.
   (f) Service in a broadening opportunity program.
   (6) In addition to professional development through operational assignments, SF captains should begin an intensive
self-development program. Their efforts should focus on gaining an in-depth understanding of combined arms opera-
tions, gaining and maintaining regional and linguistic expertise, and increasing proficiency in SF and infantry officer
common core and branch tasks.
   (7) It is strongly encouraged that captains attend Ranger school if not already qualified and may attend advanced
special operations skill courses such as combat diver, combat diving supervisor, military free fall (MFF); MFF
jumpmaster; advanced special operations techniques; ATLC: and SF Advanced Reconnaissance, Target Analysis, &
Exploitation Course (SFARTAETC) to meet mission requirements.
168                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (8) SF officers, as commanders of airborne units, must successfully complete static-line jumpmaster training as a
Captain.
   (9) Because of the extensive training involved in SF, officers volunteering for SF who do not already have a
Baccalaureate degree must complete their degree before attending the SFQC.
   b. Major. SF majors should successfully serve for approximately 24 months in any of the KD positions listed below
or a combination of these positions:
   (1) SF company commander. Majors command SF companies. Each line company commander is responsible for his
company headquarters, the SFOD–B, and six subordinate SFOD–As. Majors who served in the group’s 4th Battalion as
captains may command an SFOD–F, SFOD–H, or Detachment X which are key and developmentally equivalent to
SFOD–B command.
   (2) SF battalion operations officer. The S3 performs duties as the battalion operations officer, similar to other
operations battalion S3s.
   (3) SF battalion executive officer. The XO performs duties similar to other operations battalion XOs.
   (4) SF group S3 operations officer. The SF group S3 operations officer performs duties relating to planning for
future operations.
   (5) SF group support company commander. The group support company commander is responsible for intelligence,
training, and operations support within SF groups.
   (6) SF group operations detachment commander. The group operations detachment commander is responsible for
training support and oversight of designated special or advanced skills within the groups.
   (7) Positions corresponding to statements one through five above in the USAJFKSWCS, 1st SWTG(A), Special
Operations Recruiting Battalion, an SMU, at the International Special Training Center (Vilseck, GE) or in the Western
Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation.
   (8) Designated positions in the Combined Arms Center SOF cell and JRTC plans.
   (9) Commander, Operational Detachment-39, Korea.
   (10) Designated operations or plans staff officer positions at USASOC, in a Theater Special Operations Command
(TSOC), or equivalent Joint Special Operations and Interagency organizations.
   (11) Preferred developmental assignments for SF majors include the following:
   (a) Service as a joint or combined staff officer. Special operations are inherently joint operations, and SF majors
should seek joint or combined duty after their KD assignment.
   (b) Service as an SF assignment officer or Chief, Special Mission Division at HRC.
   (c) Attendance at the highly competitive AMSP at the SAMS. SF majors that graduate from SAMS and are key and
developmental qualified will serve in an SF-coded SAMS assignment. Officers that are not key and developmental
qualified will serve in an SF key and developmental qualifying position before fulfilling their SAMS utilization.
   (d) Attendance at the highly competitive DOD Analysis Program at the Naval Postgraduate School. The Special
Operations Master’s Degree Program at the Naval Postgraduate School is 18 months of advanced study for selected
officers. It provides a broad education in the art and science of Unconventional Warfare at the tactical, operational, and
strategic levels. This training is followed by a tour (normally after serving in a KD position) as an operational planner
at USSOCOM, USASOC, a TSOC, or in designated JSOTFs. SF officers who attend the P950 ILE Preparatory Course,
and the Naval Command and Staff Distance Education Courses while attending Naval Postgraduate School will receive
full ILE/JPME I credit.
   (e) Participation in the Interagency Studies Program which provides SF officers with an accredited master’s degree,
preparing them for post-key and developmental assignments in joint and interagency SOF billets.
   (f) Participation in the National Defense University program of study at USAJFKSWCS which provides SF officers
with an accredited master’s degree focused on Strategic Security Studies with a concentration in Irregular Warfare or
International Security Studies. It prepares officers for post-key and developmental assignments in joint and interagency
SOF billets. National Defense University does not provide ILE credit but does provide AOC credit; it is recommended
for SF majors who have already served in a key and developmental position.
   (12) There is much greater emphasis on self-development at the field grade levels, with the focus on more general
areas of knowledge rather than specific tasks. Officers without a master’s degree are highly encouraged to enroll in a
civilian college or university to earn an advanced degree either off-duty or, if applicable, through a fully funded
program in conjunction with ILE. However, completion of a master’s degree should not take precedence over
completion of ILE or the successful execution of any assignment. SF majors should also maintain and enhance their
foreign language and cultural proficiency and continue their self-development program aimed at the mastery of
Unconventional Warfare doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures.
   c. Lieutenant colonel. Promotion to lieutenant colonel constitutes success, and subsequent assignments focus on
developing the officer for broader contributions to the branch, the Army, and special operations in general. KD
assignments for a SF lieutenant colonel include successful service as a tactical, training, institutional, or recruiting
battalion commander (CSL billet at the battalion level). Preferred developmental assignments for SF lieutenant colonels
include the following:
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             169

   (2) Service as an XO of an SF Group, within the 1st SWTG(A), or in an equivalent position at a SMU.
   (3) Service as a DA, DOD, or Joint Chiefs of Staff staff officer or in interagency positions requiring SF experience
and expertise.
   (4) Service as a staff officer or commander in a joint or combined headquarters and earning a joint service SI.
   (5) Service in U.S. Army Special Forces Command (Airborne) (USASFC (A)) as the DCS, G–3/5/7, Chief of
Operations, Chief of Training, or DCS, G–7. The USASFC (A) DCS, G–3/5/7 position is designated for fill by a
former battalion commander.
   (6) Service in USAJFKSWCS as the DCS, G–3/5/7, DCO 1st Special Warfare Training Group or Director, SF
Proponency positions designated for fill by a former battalion commander.

for fill by a former battalion commander.
   (9) Service on the staff and faculty of the Command and General Staff College.
   (10) For self-development, SF lieutenant colonels focus on general areas of knowledge. They should enhance their
regional knowledge and improve their language proficiency as well as continue their mastery of unconventional
warfare.
   d. Colonel. SF colonels continue to serve the branch, special operations, and the Army through service in any SF-
coded Colonel position or combination of positions within USSOCOM, USASOC, USAJFKSWCS, USASFC (A),
HQDA, joint staffs, service schools, and other key organizations.
   (1) Key development for a SF colonel is successful service as a tactical, training, institutional, or recruiting
commander (CSL billet at the group or brigade level) or command of a designated JSOTF. SF colonel assignments aim
to develop the officer for broader contributions to the branch, the U.S. Army, and special operations in general.
   (2) Other developmental assignments include the following:
   (a) Service as the deputy commander of an SF Group or SMU.
   (b) Service as a TSOC Deputy Commander, Chief of Staff, J–3 or J5.

   (j) Service on a combined staff.
   (3) For self-development, SF colonels focus on general areas of knowledge. Colonels should further enhance their
regional orientation and language proficiency and continue to follow an extensive professional self-development
regimen.
   e. Warrant officers. AA and ARNG SF warrant officers serve in KD positions at the SF detachment level. SF
warrant officers serve in developmental and broadening assignments. SF warrant officers should begin an intensive
self-development program. Their efforts should focus on gaining an in-depth understanding of Unconventional Warfare
and joint operations, gaining and maintaining regional and linguistic expertise, and maintaining proficiency in SF
common core tasks.
   (1) SF WO1/CW2 (AA and ARNG).
   (a) SF WO1s must successfully complete the SF WOTTC. WO1/CW2s must successfully serve as either the
assistant detachment commander or commander of an SFOD–A/G. This is the KD position for all SF warrant officers.
The WO1/CW2s must successfully serve for a minimum of 3 years at the SFOD–A/G level, with a preferred minimum
of 6 years at the SFOD–A level. Assignment as an SFOD assistant detachment commander will be a warrant officer’s
initial assignment following completion of his WOTTC. The key responsibilities on a SFOD–A are mission planning
and coordination, interagency coordination, training management, and resource and information management.
   (b) SF WO1s and CW2s should plan and implement an intensive self-development program. Their efforts must

SF Warrant Officer Institute USAJFKSWCS.
   (d) SF CW5s must maintain a current foreign-language proficiency that corresponds to their regional affiliation.
   f. Branch and generalist assignments. SF officers who remain in the operations functional category above the rank
of Captain will have increasing opportunities to serve in branch and generalist assignments. SF officers must ensure
their minimum assignment requirements are met in SF Groups to remain competitive.
   g. Joint and interagency assignments. The Army will consider SF officers and warrant officers for joint as well as
interagency duty assignments. They should strive to serve in these critical positions. Joint experience is important to
the Army and essential to individual officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions.
   h. Combined assignments. The Army will consider SF officers and warrant officers for duty as commanders or staff
officers of combined commands at a rate that equals or exceeds that of the other operations functional category officers
and warrant officers. Experience in combined commands provides extensive professional development to individual
officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions.
   i. Command selection criteria. The main criterion for SF command selection is exceptional performance. To remain
competitive for command selection in both SF groups and SMUs, officers should balance key assignments in both
types of units. SF officers are strongly encouraged to volunteer for recruiting and garrison command consideration, as
well as critical command and staff billets in joint and JSOTFs. SF officers with post-KD or preferred developmental
assignments outside of USASFC, in such places as a TSOC, USSOCOM, USAJFKSWCS, Department of the Army or
other broadening assignment will be regarded as strong competitors for command selection.
16–5. Assignment preferences
   a. Preferences. Officers should strive to serve in KD positions at each grade plate while expanding experience and
expertise through broadening assignments throughout DOD. Officer development will continue to occur through a
methodical sequence of progressive assignments in TOE units, staff, and TDA billets, joint and coalition assignments,
and institutional training positions. Self-development continues to be an essential component of officer development.
The goal is to develop officers that can expertly conduct SF operations in support of the combatant commanders.
Development occurs through TASS with all officers selected for promotion completing some form of resident PME
training.
   b. Assignments.
   (1) SF officers’ assignments to developmental leadership positions have precedence. Typically, officers should seek
assignments in the following order:
   (a) Service as the commander of an SF detachment (SFOD–A/-G).
   (b) Service on a battalion or group staff, as an SFOD–B XO, or on a designated specialty SFOD–A.
   (c) Service in USAJFKSWCS, USASFC (A) and other SOCOM, Army and joint assignments.
   (d) Attendance at the Command and General Staff Officer Course ILE or equivalent program.
   (e) Attendance at the AMSP, the Special Operations Master’s Degree Program in the DOD Analysis at the Naval
Postgraduate School, or the Interagency Studies Program
   (f) Service as the commander of a SF company (SFOD–B/-F-/H), as a battalion S3 or XO, plans officer, operations
detachment commander, or group support company commander, group S3, or designated KD position.
   (g) Joint assignment.
   (h) Service as the commander of a CSL-selected battalion-level command.
   (i) Attendance at a SSC.
   (j) Service as the commander of a CSL-selected group/brigade-level command.
   (2) AA and ARNG SF warrant officer assignments to positions of leadership and technical expertise have prece-
dence. Typically, SF warrant officers should seek assignments in the following order:
172                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (a) Service as an SFOD–A assistant detachment commander.
   (b) Service on a SFOD–G.
   (c) Service as a company (SFOD–B) operations warrant officer.
   (d) Service on a SFODE.
   (e) Service as a battalion (SFOD–C) operations warrant officer.
   (f) Service as a group operations warrant officer or CCWO.
   (g) Service as an operations warrant officer or staff officer, instructor, or writer at USAJFKSWCS, USASFC (A),
USASOC or a joint assignment may be sought after promotion to CW3. (Applicable to USAR when serving on AA
orders).
16–6. Duration of developmental officer life-cycle assignments
All captains will optimally serve 24 months in their KD position in a SF group as an SFOD–A commander. The goal is
for all majors to serve for 24 months in key and developmental positions in an operational group, training group, or
other designated 18A coded position. Figure 16–1 depicts the KD positions of the SF Branch.
                                  Figure 16–1. Special Forces officer development model
                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                        173

                               Figure 16–2. Special Forces warrant officer development model
16–7. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
   a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for officers who remain in the operations functional
category. To accomplish this, the field grade inventory must be structured to meet branch authorizations, to provide
sufficient flexibility in supporting branch and generalist participation, and to allow all officers to serve in KD
assignments for the period needed to achieve requisite professional development.
   b. Captain accessions. The CG, USAJFKSWCS, validates captain accessions requirements in an annual mission
requirements letter to DA G–1. The goal for all captains is to graduate the SFQC between their fifth and sixth years in
service and to serve in multiple assignments and obtain professional development in SF before consideration for
promotion to major.
16–8. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for Special Forces
   a. Structure. SF structure is somewhat different from that of the other operations branches because of its high officer
content and the absence of lieutenants.
   b. Acquire. The SF Branch is a non-accession branch. The USAREC recruits officers as SF volunteers. Officers are
accessed upon selection for promotion to captain. Normally they complete all training and reach their first operational
assignment 2 years later. The accessions window for applicants is the ARSOF Officer Accessions Board, which follows
the HQDA captain promotions board. SF warrant officers are accessed from all CMF 18 MOSs. The SF proponent,
USAJFKSWCS, publishes recruitment guidance each FY. The primary recruiters for new accessions are SF warrant
officers. Individuals meeting MOS 180A prerequisites submit an application packet through the USAREC Web page to
USAREC, where a centralized warrant officer selection board will select the best-qualified applicants based on the
needs of the Army. The ARNG applications will be returned through the NGB to the AGs office of the state where a

federal recognition board is conducted to select qualified applicants. Board-selected individuals will be scheduled to
attend the SF Warrant Officer Technical and Tactical Certification Course at USAJFKSWCS, Fort Bragg, NC.
   c. SF officer training prerequisites. Officers applying for selection for SF training will meet the following
prerequisites:
   (1) Be an AA male Soldier.
   (2) Be in their third year of active federal commissioned service when the SF Accessions Board convenes (AA
only).
   (3) Be a captain or be selected for promotion to captain.
   (4) Have enough time remaining as a captain to complete SF training and serve a minimum of 3 years in an SF unit
before consideration in the primary zone for promotion to major. This allows for the completion of key and
developmental assignments and attainment of sufficient SF experience before selection for major.
   (5) Be airborne qualified. If not airborne qualified, the applicant must volunteer for airborne training.
   (6) Have passed the Army Physical Fitness Test in his age category, with a minimum of 240 points overall, 60
points minimum per event.
   (7) Be able to swim 50 meters unassisted while wearing the full Army combat uniform with boots.
   (8) Have scored at least 85 on the Defense Language Aptitude Battery or have met USAJFKSWCS language-school
graduation standards on the Defense Language Proficiency Test in an SF-required language (other than English).
   (9) Have met the medical standards for SF training per AR 40–501.
   (10) Have a secret security clearance and be eligible for a top secret security clearance.
   d. Branch-transfer policies. Although SF Branch controls volunteers throughout their training, they remain members
of their basic branches of assignment during training. The training pipeline begins with TDY attendance to SF
Assessment and Selection (SFAS), which an officer must successfully complete to continue onto subsequent phases of
SF qualification training. Upon successful completion of the SFQC, the officer receives his first assignment to an SF
operational unit. HRC transfers officers to SF upon successful completion of the SFQC. Officers failing to be selected
at SFAS or failing to achieve SFQC course standards must return to their initial branches of assignment. Officers who
completed SF training as enlisted Soldiers will still complete the SFQC before transferring to SF. However, they will
not normally attend SFAS nor will they be required to re-attend Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape training if
they have already completed the Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape Level C (High Risk) Course. AA and
ARNG SF qualification training requirements are identical. ARNG officers who successfully complete the AA SFQC
do not have to repeat SFQC training if accessed into the AA.
   e. Waiver authority. The CG, USAJFKSWCS is the final waiver authority for course prerequisites as well as
qualification and branch-transfer requirements. All requests for waivers should be addressed to the CG,
USAJFKSWCS, (AOJK–CDI–SF), Fort Bragg, NC 28310–5200.
   f. Special Forces warrant officer training prerequisites. AA and ARNG SF warrant officer training requirements are
identical. SF NCOs applying for selection for SF warrant officer (MOS 180A) training must meet the following
prerequisites:
   (1) Must be a U.S. citizen or possesses U.S. citizenship. No waivers are accepted.
   (2) Have a general technical score of 110 or higher. No waivers are accepted.
   (3) Be a high school graduate or have a general equivalency diploma. No waivers are accepted.
   (4) Have a secret-level security clearance and have initiated a request for a top secret security clearance.
   (5) Be able to pass the standard Army Physical Fitness Test in accordance with FM 7–22 and to meet height and
weight standards in accordance with AR 600–9.
   (6) Be able to pass the appointment physical for technicians as verified by an appropriate medical authority.
   (7) Have at least 12 months remaining on their enlistment contract.
   (8) Be less than 46 years of age.
   (9) Be serving as a SSG (E–6) or above.
   (10) Have at least one CMF 18 MOS.
   (11) Have a minimum of 3 years experience at the SFOD–A level.
   (12) Have a current Defense Language Proficiency Test with at least a 1/1 foreign-language proficiency score.
   (13) Must be Achilles Dagger qualified and current (24 months) prior to the applicable accession board.
   (14) Must be Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape Level C (High Risk) qualified or attend Survival, Evasion,
Resistance, and Escape Level C training prior to attending WOTTCC.
   (15) Have letters of recommendation from the chain of command (company, battalion, and group commanders), as
well as the SF group CCWO. If applying from outside of an SF group or requesting transfer to a different group than
currently assigned, additional letters of recommendation are required from the commander and CCWO of the gaining
group.
   g. Distribution. Careful management is required to balance the need to retain sufficient experienced officers in the
branch with the need to keep the inventory small enough to allow for sufficient KD assignments. The Army will make
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                         175

every effort to provide professional development opportunities for officers to ensure they are able to compete for
advancement.
   h. Deployment. SF officers will remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all times.
Whether assigned to deployable TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed-site TDA organizations, all SF
officers must be ready to deploy and able to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. SF officers may
deploy on short notice with their units to conduct combat operations, deter potential adversaries, and to protect national
interests or as individuals to support joint and multinational combat operations or sustainment and support operations.
SF officers must prepare themselves and their families for this challenging life-cycle function.
   i. Sustainment. Recent OPMS updates have changed the manner of execution in some areas affecting officer career
development.
   (1) Promotion. Following functional category designation, SF officers will compete for promotion only within the
operations functional category.
   (2) Command. Central selection of SF lieutenant colonel and Colonel commanders will continue in four functional
categories: operations, strategic support, recruiting and training, and installation. The SF personnel proponent at the
USAJFKSWCS closely monitors the number of commands available to SF officers to achieve branch professional
development on par with that of the other operations branches. A special DA board fills selected SMU commands.
Officers are selected to command SMUs generally in lieu of CSL commands, not as a second command though
selected SMUs are designated as second commands.
   (3) Officer evaluation report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and officer personnel
management. Starting with captain, the rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the functional
category that best suits his abilities and interests. SF raters and senior raters thus perform a critical function that helps
ensure that both the operations functional category and other functional categories possess quality officers.
   j. Separation. The branch separation process remains the same as for the rest of the Army.
16–9. Army National Guard Special Forces officers
   a. General career development. ARNG officer career development requirements are normally satisfied by attend-
ance at military schools combined with planned, progressive assignments in SF units or positions and continuous self-
development. To be considered a qualified SF officer at each grade, the length of Service in a given position is not the
focus; the key is the assignment opportunities, experiences, and sufficient time served during each assignment to
develop SF competence. Because of geographical and recruiting realities,Lieutenants may be assigned to ARNG SF
companies.
   b. Developmental opportunities. ARNG captain, major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel key and primary develop-
mental assignments, as well as branch-transfer requirements, are the same as for AA officers. ARNG SF officer
development, in general, should parallel that of their AA counterparts. The ARNG officers may not find an SF unit
with openings at their grade or may be ineligible for promotion until finding a unit position at the proper grade. ARNG
officers’ civilian careers and other considerations may limit them to serving in geographically available units. Even
though ARNG SF officers are limited by geographical and positional considerations, they should strive for assignments
in SF units that yield the same developmental and competitive opportunities as their AA counterparts. ARNG SF
officers should contact their state officer manager or their senior branch officer to ensure they can meet their
professional development objectives. These transfers are necessitated by geographical considerations, as well as the
need to provide as many officers as possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions, or to
complete PME requirements. Transfers within a component will normally be temporary, and should not be seen as
impacting negatively on an SF officer’s career.
16–10. U.S. Army Reserve Special Forces officers and warrant officers
   a. General career development. The USAR has no SF force structure in their organization but may have individual
SF officers within the ranks. Options for such officers include duty in the IRR with possible IMA program positions or
short tour positions, AGR program positions, branch immaterial positions, or positions in non-SF units. Some officers
may have to branch transfer. A USAR officer may branch transfer several times during his career and may not be able
to follow the normal SF career model.
   b. Assignments. SF officers and warrant officers in the USAR may find assignments in TPU, IIMA, and DIMA
positions in AA organizations, installations or HQDA agencies, tours of active duty in support of administrative
support, contingency operations in support of administrative support annual training or temporary tour on active duty.
When IRR SF officers and warrant officers are mobilized in an SF position, they are expected to complete SF officer
refresher course in residence before deploying. To meet professional developmental objectives in the Army Reserve,
SF officers and warrant officers must be willing to work with their personnel management officer team to rotate
between TPU, IRR, the IMA program, DIMA, Joint Reserve units, the IRR–Augmentee (IRR–A) program, AGR
programs, and even apply for short active duty tours.

Chapter 17
Psychological Operations Branch
17–1. Unique features of the Psychological Operations Branch
   a. Unique purpose of the Psychological Operations Branch. U.S. Army Military Information Support Operations
(MISO) forces provide the primary DOD capability to influence foreign audiences in permissive, semi-permissive, and
non-permissive environments. MISO, formerly known as psychological operations (PSYOP), contribute to the ac-
complishment of the full range of conventional and special operations missions by informing, educating, persuading,
directing and influencing foreign audiences and populations in a manner consistent with U.S. national objectives. The
Army’s conventional and special operations MISO forces support military and interagency objectives through peace-
time military engagements, defense support to public diplomacy, limited interventions, contingency operations, irregu-
lar warfare, and unified land operations. MISO are designed to maintain stability, prevent crisis, create understanding,
shape operational environments, deter aggression, and prevent escalation of armed conflict on the part of state and non-
state actors, their sympathizers, and supporters. When prevent and shape fail, MISO are a combat multiplier to win in
both limited conflicts and unified land operations.
   b. Unique functions performed by the Psychological Operations Branch.
   (1) Military commanders, U.S. Chiefs of Mission and country teams, other interagency partners, lead federal
agencies, allies, host nations/partner nations, and supported foreign nation counterparts use MISO across the range of
military operations to support policy initiatives, public diplomacy and military objectives, and to shape the operational
environment favorable to U.S. national objectives. U.S. MISO capabilities are integrated into the commander’s scheme
of maneuver to increase the effectiveness of combat power, protect friendly forces, reduce the likelihood of noncom-
batant injury, and to erode the enemy’s will to resist. MISO create conditions where military operations result in fewer
friendly, civilian, and enemy casualties (when desired) and shorten engagements, thereby limiting the negative
consequences of collateral damage. Importantly, MISO save lives and ultimately reduce suffering, undermine enemy
objectives, increase the purpose and potency of U.S. military and interagency operations on contemporary and future
battlefields, and ease the transition to sustainable peace.
   (2) Commanders employ information-related capabilities in all phases of military operations to amplify the effective-
ness of lethal and nonlethal engagements. Commanders have developed an appreciation for the physical and psycholog-
ical effects that military activities have on populations. In the information age, synchronization of word and deed
matter more as the traditional media, emerging social media, and the internet carry across both borders and across
boundaries, and individual access to these means of communication and dissemination are increased by emerging
technologies. Accordingly, MISO offer commanders and other supported partners a means to influence individuals and
groups in ways that support strategic, operational, and tactical objectives. The U.S. Army’s conventional and special
operations MISO units are the only robust and operationally agile DOD information capability with organic communi-
cation assets sufficient to directly and indirectly engage a foreign audience. These units also are prepared to provide
information dissemination support to lead Federal agencies responding to natural and man-made disasters in the United
States and its territories.
   c. Unique features of work in the Psychological Operations Branch. PO personnel perform three primary missions:
   (1) Military information (MILINFO). MILINFO is the use of MISO capabilities to influence foreign target audi-
ences in support of DOD activities and operations. The MILINFO mission is conducted across the range of military
operations by conventional and special operations MISO forces. MILINFO enhances conventional and SOF activities
during peacetime military engagements and is a combat multiplier during unified land operations. MISO are planned,
integrated, synchronized, and executed as part of conventional and special operations to defeat the enemy and shape the
operational environments in which the U.S. military operate. Conventional MISO forces that reside in the USAR
typically conduct MILINFO in support of conventional maneuver elements’ information-related capability. Special
operations MISO forces execute MILINFO while supporting the special operations core activities as an integrated
capability or as a main effort. When directed, special operations MISO forces can also support conventional units
during initial phases of contingencies, typically being relieved upon mobilization and arrival of USAR conventional
MISO forces. (JP 3–13.2 and FM 3–53).
   (2) Interagency-intergovernmental support. Interagency-intergovernmental support shapes and influences foreign
decision-making and behaviors in support of U.S. regional objectives, policies, interests, theater military plans, and
contingencies. Interagency-intergovernmental support is a MISO mission that leverages the special operations MISO
force’s language skills, cultural analyses, regional expertise, planning capability, and media knowledge to support non-
DOD information efforts to convey the U.S. narrative, and to further regional and country team initiatives and strategic
communication. Interagency-intergovernmental support facilitates non-DOD missions that support the geographic
combatant commander’s theater security cooperation plan, defense support to public diplomacy, Department of State
programs and activities, and other government agencies’ and departments’ objectives. MISO forces conduct Civil
Affairs Operations (CAO) interagency-intergovernmental support when operating in foreign countries under the guid-
ance of the American Embassy or similar U.S. Government entity, in association with the American Embassy and the
host nation government, primarily in permissive and semi-permissive environments. (JP 3–13.2 and FM 3–53).
   (3) Civil Authority Information Support (CAIS). MISO forces execute the CAIS mission, as part of Defense Support
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           177

of Civil Authorities, when use of DOD information dissemination capabilities are requested by a lead federal agency in
support of relief operations in the wake of natural or man-made disasters within the geographical area of the United
States and its territories. The CAIS mission directly supports the National Response Framework and Emergency
Support Function #15, External Affairs, by producing, distributing, and disseminating public information approved and
provided by the lead federal agency to the local populace in affected areas. Influence activities are prohibited within
the United States and its territories. Information delivered during CAIS typically covers public safety issues and relief
efforts and is intended strictly for those populations affected by the disaster or its related effects. Due to the typically
critical need for timely action, special operations MISO units may be directed to deploy initially during relief
operations as task-organized Civil Authority Information Support Elements (CAISE) to provide direct support to the
lead federal agency. Conventional MISO forces are mobilized at the earliest possible opportunity to continue long-term
support until the relief operation is determined to be complete. (JP 3–13.2 and FM 3–53).
   d. Unique Force Structure of the Psychological Operations Branch. PSYOP officers serve in the AA and RC of the
U.S. Army. AA PSYOP officers are special operations officers. AA MISO Forces primary mission is to conduct
special operations and support other SOF. AA MISO Forces are specifically organized, trained, and equipped to
conduct special operations and support SOF. RC PSYOP officers are conventional force officers. The RC MISO Forces
primary mission is to support Conventional Forces. RC MISO Forces are specifically organized, trained, and equipped
for these purposes. Information pertaining specifically to RC officers can be found in paragraph 17–7.
17–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. General attributes. The PO branch requires officers who are able to apply problem solving and decision-making
skills to defeat an enemy who may have capabilities comparable to our forces. The enemy may be able to present
asymmetric threats, be a fleeting target and embedded in the populace. The enemy may also be adaptive and
unpredictable, have the capability to shift between irregular and conventional warfare, and be capable of conventional
offense and defense operations. PO officers must have the leadership capabilities to fight among the populace, and
deny support to our adversaries while encouraging support to the local government. Leaders in the PO Branch must
recognize changing operational environments and remain fully prepared to reconfigure resources to undertake a range
of altered missions. PO officers must embody the following attributes:
   (1) Integrity. PO officers must be trustworthy and honest with honor and unwavering adherence to ethical standards.
   (2) Courage. PO officers must act on one’s own convictions despite consequences and be willing to sacrifice for a
larger cause; not paralyzed by fear of failure.
   (3) Perseverance. PO officers must work towards an end; have commitment; physical or mental resolve; be
motivated; give effort to the cause; and not quit.
   (4) Personal responsibility. PO officers must be self-motivated and autonomous self-starters; anticipate tasks and act
accordingly. They must take responsibility for their actions.
   (5) Professionalism. PO officers will be the standard-bearers for the regiment. They must have a professional image;
to include a level of maturity and judgment mixed with confidence and humility. They must form sound opinions and
make their own decisions; stand behind their sensible decisions based on their experiences.
   (6) Adaptability. PO officers must possess the ability to maintain composure while responding to or adjusting their
own thinking and actions to fit a changing environment. They must possess the ability to think and solve problems in
unconventional ways; through their ability to recognize, understand, and navigate within multiple social networks; and
the ability to proactively shape the environment or circumstance in anticipation of desired outcomes.
   (7) Teamwork. PO officers must be able to work on a team for a greater purpose than themselves. They must be
dependable and loyal, work selflessly with a sense of duty and respect for others, and recognize diversity.
   (8) Capability. PO officers must excel at physical fitness to include strength and agility. They must have operational
knowledge and be able to plan and communicate effectively.
   b. Unique attributes. PO officers must also possess these unique attributes:
   (1) Have the ability to solve complex political-military problems and develop and employ conventional or uncon-
ventional solutions. PO officers must be able to develop and employ non-doctrinal methods and techniques when
applicable and be capable of executing decisive action for missions in which no current doctrine exists.
   (2) Have good interpersonal skills and display political acumen and cultural sensitivity. Mission success often
depends on an officer’s ability to establish rapport and influence the attitudes and behaviors of people from foreign
cultures.
   c. Competencies and actions common to all.
   (1) The PO Branch is one of three branches that make up the SOF functional group within the operations functional
category. The PO branch is a volunteer non-accession branch that draws its officers from other branches of the Army.
For the AA only, the Special Operations Recruiting Battalion recruits PO volunteers in accordance with the force
stabilization procedures. PO officers must serve a successful initial tour as a lieutenant in a small-unit leadership
position in one of the Army’s other basic branches. As a result, volunteers should possess knowledge of conventional
Army operations and possess Army leadership experience. For the AA only, a DA-centralized ARSOF accession board
selects lieutenants who volunteer for special operations duty in the targeted year group; these individuals will undergo
178                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

a rigorous assessment and selection program followed by attendance to the Special Operations Forces Army Common
Core (SOFCC) to qualify for continued PO officer training. Completion of both the SOFCC and the designated ARSOF
Branch Qualification course meet the requirements for MEL F CCC completion. In the event an officer is returned to
their basic branch without completing both components, that officer must meet the requirements of their basic branch
CCC in order to receive MEL F CCC credit.
   (2) Completion of the Psychological Operations Qualification Course (POQC) provides officers with entry-level
knowledge of MISO. As they develop through operational experience, officers gain a broader understanding of USG
and DOD policy and resultant MISO authorities; the Human Domain and its impact on campaigns and operations;
MISO tactics, techniques, and procedures; the MISO targeting and mission planning process; the support and sustain-
ment process for MISO’s unique equipment and requirements; special operations and conventional forces interdepend-
ence; and joint, multinational, and interagency aspects of MISO. The master practitioner is uniquely trained, educated,
and experienced in advanced influence, analysis communications and planning skills. Those skills set the master
practitioner apart as an expert operating within the human domain and as a trusted advisor, planner and executor for
sensitive strategic and operational influence planning and operations.
   (3) PO officers continuously undergo intensive preparation for assignment in their unit’s designated geographic
areas. PO officers gain and maintain area orientation through military and civilian schooling, language study, area
study, mission preparation, and repetitive operational experience during their careers. AA, special operations PO
officers are expected to maintain regional orientation, language proficiency, and cross-cultural interpersonal skills.
While these special operations PO officers gain initial language qualification through formal instruction, they maintain
language skills through practice and self-study. Defense Language Proficiency Test and Oral Proficiency Interview
scores reflect language proficiency. Soldiers must update their Defense Language Proficiency Test/Oral Proficiency
Indicator scores annually through formal testing. The organization of MISO battalions is by AOC; however, the
management of regional expertise is subject to modification as the needs of the Army change.
   (4) AA special operations PO officers possess the required expeditionary competencies—regional knowledge, cul-
tural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, and statesmanship to be an integral part in an expeditionary force.
   d. Unique skills. PO officers must:
   (1) Understand the concept of the human domain and operations conducted within that domain.
   (2) Be proficient in tactical-level operations and experts in MISO.
   (3) Understand and be capable of employing Army and joint doctrine in planning and operations.
   (4) Be capable of planning and conducting MISO at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels.
   (5) Be subject matter experts and known authorities in the psychological aspects of warfare, the influencing of the
individuals and groups, joint and interagency operations, planning, operations, and intelligence, as well as technical and
tactical skills.
   (6) AA Special Operations PO only. Have an aptitude for learning a foreign language and sustain foreign-language
proficiency throughout their careers. This is one of the most important and difficult skills to gain and sustain; it is
critical for all special operations PO officers. Immediately after completing the PO Assessment and Selection Course,
special operations PO officers who do not already meet the language requirements receive extensive foreign language
and cultural analysis training at USAJFKSWCS and elsewhere. Special operations PO officers must successfully meet
all language course requirements with a score of 1/1/1 on the Defense Language Proficiency Test and Oral Proficiency
Indicator before assignment to the operational force.
   (7) AA Special Operations PO only. Be airborne qualified before starting PO training. Special operations PO
officers must remain eligible to perform airborne duties throughout their careers. If the officer’s airborne status is
medically terminated, the regimental proponent, Commander, USAJFKSWCS (AOJK–CDI–PO) can waive this
requirement.
17–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
An officer must successfully serve in a basic branch to be eligible for PO. Upon graduation from the POQC, the officer
serves in a KD position as a PO captain, followed by other branch developmental positions described in the following
paragraphs. PO Branch development enables captains to achieve mastery of common core and PO branch skills,
knowledge, and attributes that assures the strong professional development foundation essential for success in the field
grades.
   a. Captain.
   (1) PO Branch is a non-accession branch. To meet Army MEL requirements, every PO officer must complete the
SOFCC before attending the POQC.
   (2) Upon successful completion of the SOFCC, captains will attend the POQC (42–45 weeks). Upon successful
completion of the POQC, captains will be assigned to a MISO unit for their 36 months utilization tour as a PO Officer.
All PO captains should optimally serve a minimum of 36 months in a position coded 37A within the MISOC. A
captain serves optimally 2 years as Detachment commander followed by a third year as a company XO or staff officer
within the MISOC. In addition, select captains may remain assigned for up to 4 years at the MISOC.
   (3) PO captains should successfully command a detachment, optimally for 24 months. Detachment and or company
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             179

command are the two KD positions for a PO captain. Detachment command equates to company, battery, or troop
command in the other branches within the operations functional category. Selection to a second command (detachment,
HSC or HHC) is appropriate for an officer with high potential.
   (4) The primary preferred developmental assignments for a PO captain are in positions coded 37A as a staff officer
within a MISO battalion or group, as staff and faculty at the USAJFKSWCS and as an observer/controller/trainer at a
CTC.
   (a) Service at USAJFKSWCS and CTCs. PO officers serving as staff and faculty at the USAJFKSWCS and as an
observer/controller/trainer at a CTC must have served in key leadership and developmental positions and have attained
a superior performance record. They must also possess superb training skills, coaching abilities, and tactical
proficiencies. These officers should be the best-qualified officers in PO branch.
   (b) Positions as platform instructors, small group leaders, doctrine writers or other positions in the institutional
Army are critical broadening opportunities for our officers that will enhance an officer’s standing in competition for
command, key billet or senior executive-level positions.
   (5) Developmental assignments for a PO captain consist of all positions not designated KD.
   (a) Developmental assignments enhance the PO captain aspects of warfighting skills, increase their level of respon-
sibility, develop their understanding of interoperability among Army branches, or expose them to PO branch-related
generating force/JIIM opportunities that directly contribute to success as an innovative and adaptive leader.
   (b) Broadening assignments, education, or experiences expand a PO officer’s capabilities by exposing them to
different organizational cultures and environments. Such assignments are often JIIM in nature, and expose officers to
problem sets not routinely addressed at the tactical level. A balanced mix of assignments offers the best path to
development of strategic level thinkers and leaders. The broadening process will be dynamic and variable across each
cohort year group. Opportunities will change in response to the Army’s emerging missions, evolving structure and
professional culture. Deliberate career management that carefully limits KD time to prescribed intervals, allowing
exceptions only under limited extenuating circumstances is fundamental to the concept of broadening. Broadening
opportunities may vary in scope, responsibility, and developmental outcomes and typically fall within these four
categories: Institutional/functional, Academia and Civilian Enterprise (Training With Industry), Joint/Multinational, and
Interagency/Intergovernmental.
   (c) Training With Industry. This competitive program provides training in industrial procedures and practices not
available through military service schools or civilian education. The Training With Industry provides PO officers with
vital knowledge, experience, and perspective in management and operational techniques to fill responsible positions
within the MISOC and other Army activities that normally interface with civilian industry. It provides the PO trainee
an opportunity to grapple with real problems inherent to the business environment. Currently, these programs for PO
branch are concentrated in the area of media broadcasting, advertising and marketing essential to the success of our
operations. The PO program is normally 10 months with a predetermined MISOC 3rd Battalion follow-on assignment
focusing on the experience gained. AR 621–1 provides information on application procedures.
   (d) Select special operations PO officers will be offered an advanced civil schooling opportunity in conjunction with
the POQC. PO officers are also highly encouraged to apply for the fully funded advanced civil schooling opportunities
in conjunction with Army nominative programs. Information on these programs will be distributed annually through
HRC.
   (e) Select special operations PO captains may attend the highly competitive National Defense University, College of
International Security Affairs. The Masters of Arts Degree program mirrors the Master of Arts in Strategic Security
Studies degree offered by National Defense University’s College of International Security Affairs to students enrolled
in the 10-month full-time program from U.S. departments and agencies, congressional staffs, and military and civilian
representatives of the international community who operate in the Washington, DC area. The Master of Arts in
Strategic Security Studies curriculum offers a strategic perspective on the global threat environment, the rise of newly
empowered and politicized ideological movements, the relationship between political objectives, strategy, all instru-
ments of national power, and the roles of power and ideology. This assignment prepares officers for their role as PO
officers in joint and interagency billets.
   (6) PO officers must sharpen their leadership, tactical, and technical skills and concentrate on those critical tasks
required to accomplish their unique mission. It consists of individual study, research, professional reading, practice, and
self-assessment. It is accomplished via numerous means (studying, observing and experiencing), and is consistent with
an officer’s personal self-development action plan and professional goals. Self-development is the key aspect of
individual officer qualification that solidifies the Army leader development process. A critical component of the self-
development domain is MSAF. Captains must take the initiative to gain knowledge and experience for the next level of
assignments and responsibilities as a field grade officer. Self-improvement and development can be achieved through
observing staff activities at the battalion and group levels, seeking out mentors, and gaining experience in other duty
positions after successful completion of a detachment command. Officers should focus self-development efforts on
gaining and maintaining regional and linguistic expertise and increasing proficiency in MISO and officer common core
and branch tasks. Officers should become intimately familiar with their geographical areas and seek higher training and
education in the art of influence, ethnographic studies, sociology, psychology, and other educational fields that relate to
180                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

the MISO mission. Officers should continue their professional military reading with books from the CSA’s professional
reading list for field grade officers.
   (7) PO officers serving in airborne units are expected to successfully complete static-line jumpmaster training early
in their careers. PO officers should also complete Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape training.
   b. Major. PO majors should successfully serve for approximately 24 months in any of the KD positions listed below
or a combination of these positions:
   (1) Company commander. Majors command PO companies.
   (2) Battalion S3 (operations officer). The S3 performs duties as the battalion operations officer, similar to other
operations battalion and brigade S3s.
   (3) Battalion XO. The XO performs duties similar to other operations functional category battalion and brigade
XOs.
   (4) Group S3 (Operations Officer). The group S3 operations officer performs duties relating to planning for future
operations.
   (5) Positions corresponding to statements one through four above in the USAJFKSWCS, 1st SWTG(A), Special
Operations Recruiting Battalion, SMU or deployed Joint/Military Information Support Task Force.
   (6) Staff officer in a PO position at a SF group and division staff officer.
   (7) It should be noted that in all branches majors’ positions that support transitional functions, such as training teams
and provincial reconstruction teams, are designated as KD positions. Positions created to address specific emerging
missions or capabilities are considered KD opportunities for career development/advancement.
   (8) Developmental assignments for a PO major consist of all positions not designated KD including branch, joint
duty, and branch generalist assignments.
   (a) Attendance at the highly competitive AMSP at the SAMS. The AMSP is 1 year of advanced study for selected
officers that have completed ILE. The Aviation mission planning system provides a broad education in the art and
science of war at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. Historically, the greater population of a SAMS class is
drawn from officers who have completed Command and General Staff College and are then selected to continue on for
a second year of attendance in the AMSP. Participation in this competitive program is also available for KD-qualified
field grade officers. They can attend SAMS through the field nomination process. PO majors graduating from SAMS
who are key and developmental qualified will serve in a PO-coded SAMS assignment. Any officer who is not key and
developmental qualified will serve in a PO key and developmental qualifying position before fulfilling their SAMS
utilization.
   (b) Attendance at the highly competitive DOD Analysis Program at the Naval Postgraduate School. The Special
Operations Master’s Degree Program at the Naval Postgraduate School is 18 months of advanced study for selected
officers. It provides a broad education in the art and science of unconventional warfare at the tactical, operational, and
strategic levels. This training is followed by a tour (normally after serving in a KD position) as a PO planner at
USSOCOM, USASOC, a TSOC, or a deployed Joint/Military Information Support Task Force. PO officers who attend
the P950 ILE Preparatory Course, and the Naval Command and Staff Distance Education Courses while attending
Naval Postgraduate School will receive full ILE/JPME I credit.
   (c) The Interagency Studies Program will provide PO officers with an accredited master’s degree that prepares
officers for post-key and developmental assignments in joint and interagency SOF billets.
   (d) National Defense University provides a broad education focusing on Strategic Security Studies with a concentra-
tion in Irregular Warfare or International Security Studies. It provides PO officers with an accredited master’s degree
that prepares officers for post-key and developmental assignments in joint and interagency SOF billets. National
Defense University does not provide ILE credit; it is recommended for PO majors who have already served in a key
and developmental position.
   (e) The Special Operations Campaign Artist Program (SOCAP). SOCAP, operated by Fort Leavenworth’s Univer-
sity of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies and tied to that organization’s Red Team program, is an 18 week
program, suited to an officer identified to begin ILE in the late summer. The course begins in January and officers can
be prepositioned at Fort Leavenworth to attend this program, which is timed to complete just prior to the start of the
ILE academic year. Officers who are ILE complete or who are attending a nonresident ILE can also attend this
program in a TDY-and-return status. PO officers completing SOCAP will be awarded the 7G ASI. PO planners’
positions within the MISOC and SF Group are designated with the 7G ASI.
   (9) There is greater emphasis on self-development at the field grade levels, with the focus on general areas of
knowledge rather than specific tasks. Officers without a master’s degree are highly encouraged to enroll in a civilian
college or university to earn an advanced degree either off-duty or, if applicable, through a fully funded program in
conjunction with ILE. However, completion of a master’s degree should not take precedence over completion of ILE or
the successful execution of any assignment. PO majors should also maintain and enhance their foreign language and
cultural proficiency and continue their self-development program aimed at the mastery of MISO and unconventional
warfare doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures.
   c. Lieutenant colonel. Promotion to lieutenant colonel constitutes success in the Army, and subsequent assignments
focus on developing the officer for broader contributions to the branch, the U.S. Army, and special operations in
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                               181

general. Command selection only includes a small percentage of the PO lieutenant colonel population. PO lieutenant
colonels not selected for battalion command continue to make significant contributions at all levels of the Army. KD
assignments for a PO lieutenant colonel include successful service as a tactical, training, institutional, or recruiting
battalion commander (CSL billet at the battalion level), MISOC G3, staff officer in a PO position at a Corps and
ASCC. The majority of lieutenant colonels assignments will focus on developing the officer for broader contributions
to the branch, the U.S. Army, and special operations in general.
   (1) Developmental assignments for PO lieutenant colonels consist of all positions not designated KD including
branch, joint duty, and branch generalist assignments.
   (2) Former battalion commander assignments. PO lieutenant colonels completing battalion command are assigned to
positions designated as requiring the skills of former battalion commanders. These post-command assignments may be
to Army nominative, branch, branch area generalist assignments, or joint coded positions. Emphasis is placed on joint
duty assignments for those officers without a joint qualifying tour. The following positions are designated former
battalion commander assignments for PO officers: Group Deputy Commander, Deputy Commander 1st Special Warfare
Training Group(A) (USAJFKSWCS), G3 USAJFKSWCS or other ARSOF command, PO Proponent, Personnel
(USAJFKSWCS), Chief, PO Branch (HRC), Chief, ARSOF Branch EPMD (HRC).
   d. Colonel. PO colonels continue to serve the branch, special operations, and the Army through service in any PO-
coded colonel position or combination of positions within USSOCOM, USASOC, USAJFKSWCS, MISOC(A),
HQDA, joint staffs, service schools, and other key organizations.
   (1) Key development for a PO colonel is successful service as a tactical, training, institutional, or recruiting
commander (command selection list billet at the group or brigade level) or command of a designated Joint/Military
Information Support Task Force. PO colonel assignments aim to develop the officer for broader contributions to the
branch, the U.S. Army, and special operations in general.
   (2) Developmental assignments for a PO colonel consist of all positions not designated KD including branch, joint
duty, and branch generalist assignments.
   (3) For self-development, PO colonels focus on general areas of knowledge. Colonels should further enhance their
regional orientation and language proficiency and continue to follow an extensive professional self-development
regimen.
17–4. Assignment preferences
   a. Preferences. Officers should attempt to serve in KD positions at each grade plate while expanding experience and
expertise through broadening assignments throughout DOD. Officer development will continue to occur through a
methodical sequence of progressive assignments in TOE units, staff, and TDA billets, joint and coalition assignments,
and institutional training positions. Self-development continues to be an essential component of officer development.
The goal is to develop officers that can expertly conduct MISO in support of the combatant commanders. Development
occurs through TASS with all officers selected for promotion completing some form of resident PME training.
   b. Assignments. PO officers’ assignments to developmental leadership positions have precedence. Typically, officers
should seek assignments in the following order:
   (1) Service as a detachment commander.
   (2) Service as a company XO.
   (3) Service on a battalion or group staff.
   (4) Advanced Civil Schooling or Training With Industry.
   (5) Service as a staff and faculty at the USAJFKSWCS and as an observer/controller/trainer at a CTC, MISOC(A)
and other Army and joint assignments.
   (6) Attendance at the Command and General Staff Officer Course ILE or equivalent program.
   (7) Attendance at the AMSP, the Special Operations Master’s Degree Program in the DOD Analysis at the Naval
Postgraduate School, or the Interagency Studies Program at Kansas University.
   (8) Service as a company commander, as a battalion S3 or XO, group S3, or designated KD position.
   (9) Attendance at JPME II enroute to Joint assignment.
   (10) Service as a battalion-level CSL commander.
   (11) Service in a former battalion commander assignment, senior-level SOF, senior-level conventional force, or
Army developmental position.
   (12) Attendance at a SSC.
   (13) Service as a group-level CSL commander or senior executive-level SOF, or senior executive-level conventional
force, joint, or Army position.
17–5. Duration of critical officer life-cycle assignments
All captains will optimally serve 24 months in their KD position in a group as a detachment commander. The goal is
for all majors to serve for 24 months in KD positions. Majors will serve in an operational group, training group or
other coded 37A position designated as KD. Figure 17–1 displays the PO branch life-cycle model.

17–6. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for Psychological Operations
   a. Structure. The PO branch structure is somewhat different from that of the other operations functional categories
because it contains a high number of officers and the absence of lieutenants. Its structure will continue to reflect those
characteristics.
   b. Acquire. PO is a non-accession branch. For the AA only, the Special Operations Recruiting Battalion recruits PO
volunteers. Officers are accessed upon selection for promotion to captain. An officer signals his interest in joining the
branch by submitting a packet to the Special Operations Recruiting Battalion, when eligible. A DA-centralized ARSOF
accession board selects lieutenants who volunteer for special operations duty in the targeted year group. If selected by
the ARSOF board, HRC will schedule them for attendance at assessment and selection. They normally complete all
training and reach their first operational assignment 1 to 2 years later. Over 150 officers typically apply for the
program each year. Of these, approximately 50 successfully graduate POQC and become qualified PO branch officers.
The goal for all captains is to graduate POQC at between 4 to 6 years in service, serve in PO assignments, and obtain
professional development in the branch before consideration for promotion to major. The CG, USAJFKSWCS,
validates captain requirements in an annual mission requirement letter to the DCS, G–1.
   (1) Psychological Operations training prerequisites. Officers applying to attend PSYOP Qualification Course and
branching into the PO Branch must:
   (a) Be a volunteer for PO training.
   (b) Have reached their third year of active federal commissioned service when the ARSOF Officer Selection Board
meets. Upon successful selection by the ARSOF Selection Board, active officers must attend and successfully complete
PO assessment and selection (AA only).
   (c) Be selected for promotion to captain (AA only).
   (d) Have enough time remaining as a captain to complete PO training and serve 3 years in a MISO unit before DA-
centralized selection board consideration in the primary zone for promotion to major. This permits completion of KD
assignments before selection for major.
   (e) Be airborne qualified or volunteer for airborne training (AA only).
   (f) Have passed the Army Physical Fitness Test.
   (g) Have scored at least 85 on the Defense Language Aptitude Battery or have met USAJFKSWCS language-school
graduation standards of a 1/1/1 on the Defense Language Proficiency Test and Oral Proficiency Indicator in a PO-
required language (other than English) (AA only).
   (h) Have met the medical standards for PO training in accordance with AR 40–501.
   (i) Have a minimum physical profile of 111221.
   (j) Be eligible for a top secret security clearance.
   (k) Be a SOFCC graduate by the time of enrollment in the POQC.
   (l) (RC Only) Be assigned in a valid PO authorization in a MISO unit.
   (2) Branch-transfer policies.
   (a) PO branch controls volunteers throughout their PO training, and the training begins with attendance to assess-
ment and selection for active duty officers, continues for all officers with the POQC, and ends with the assignment of
the officer to their first operational assignment in a Group. HRC branch transfers AA officers to PO upon successful
completion of the POQC. PO officer training is a multipart entity with a single AA service obligation. Officers failing
to achieve POQC standards will not be PO qualified. These officers will return to their initial branch of assignment.
   (b) Active duty officers who completed PO training as enlisted Soldiers must still successfully attend and complete
PO Assessment and Selection and the POQC before branch transfer to PO.
   (c) AA and RC PO qualification training requirements (with the exception of language, regional studies, cultural
analysis, and selected advanced skills training) are identical. However, officers who successfully completed the 37A
POQC as an RC PO officer must attend PSYOP assessment and selection, the Basic Airborne Course, and must
successfully complete the AC POQC if accessed into the AA.
   (d) The CG, USAJFKSWCS, is the final waiver authority for course prerequisites as well as PO qualification and
branch-transfer requirements. All requests for waivers should be addressed to the CG, United States Army John F.
Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, (AOJK–CDI–PO), Fort Bragg, NC 28310–5200.
   c. Deploy. PO officers must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all times.
Whether assigned to TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed-site TDA organizations, all PO officers must be
able to deploy and accomplish missions across the range of military operations. PO officers may deploy on short notice
with their units to conduct combat operations, deter potential adversaries, and protect national interests. PO officers
must prepare themselves and set their families expectations for this most challenging but rewarding lifestyle.
   d. Sustain. The OPMS changes the manner of execution of three major areas affecting officer career development.
184                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (1) Promotion. PO branch officers will compete for promotion as a basic branch within the operations functional
category.
   (2) Command. The PO branch lieutenant colonel and colonel commanders will continue to be centrally selected for
command. All PO officer command opportunities are in the Operations Command and key billet categories. Armywide,
these commands are organized into five functional categories: operations, strategic support, recruiting and training, and
installation, and key billet. The PO personnel proponent at USAJFKSWCS closely monitors the number of commands
available to PO officers to achieve branch professional development on par with that of the other operations branches.
   (3) Officer evaluation report. The PO branch along with the Army officer structure is pyramidal. The apex contains
very few senior grades in relation to the wider base. Advancement to increasingly responsible positions is based on
relative measures of performance and potential. The mechanism to judge the value of an individual’s performance and
potential is the OER described in detail in chapter 6. All OPMS subsystems are affected by the evaluation report.
Promotion, school selection, functional designation and command and key billet selection, retention in service, and
development opportunities are all based on the information contained in the OER.
   e. Develop. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments
in TOE units with troops, staff and TDA billets, joint and coalition assignments, and institutional training positions.
Throughout an officer’s career, self-development continues to be an essential component of officer development. The
goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly conduct MISO in support of combatant commanders. Development
also occurs through TASS, with all officers selected for major completing some form of Command and General Staff
College/ILE training, in accordance with OPMS and operations functional category guidelines.
   f. Separate. The branch separation process remains the same as for the rest of the Army.
17–7. Psychological Operations U.S. Army Reserve officers
   a. General career development.
   (1) The RC PO officer developmental objectives and qualifications parallel those planned for their AA counterparts,
with limited exceptions.
   (2) The RC PO officer serves the same role and mission as an active counterpart. Junior officers must have a
successful initial tour as a lieutenant in a small-unit leadership position in one of the Army’s basic branches. As a
result, the officer should possess knowledge of conventional Army operations and experience in Army leadership prior
to volunteering for the PO branch.
   (3) RC officers tend to spend more time in key leadership positions and have increased windows to complete
mandatory educational requirements than their active counterparts. Assignment options in the RC may be constrained
by force structure, and demographic and geographic limitations. The RC PO officer may not find a MISO unit with
openings available at their grade or may not be eligible for promotion until finding a TPU position at the proper grade.
The RC officer’s civilian careers and other considerations may limit them to serving in geographically available units.
The RC officer may need to rotate between TPU, IMA, and IRR assignments to reach his professional development
objectives. A RC officer may serve in other basic branch or FA positions that they are qualified in or become qualified
in during their career. The RC officer may not be able to follow a pure PO career model. Refer to chapter 7 for a
detailed description of RC officer career management and development.
   b. Branch development. Even though RC officer development is challenged by geographical considerations and time
constraints, each officer should strive for PO assignments and educational opportunities that yield the same develop-
mental opportunities as their active counterparts. RC PO officers are expected to complete their required education and
aggressively seek out operational assignments to stay proficient in the branch.
   (1) Introduction. As a non-accession branch, RC officers volunteer to become PO officers just as their counterparts
in the AA. The officer target group for branch transfer to RC PO includes basic branch-qualified captains who are
SOFCC or CCC graduates.
   (2) Reserve Component Psychological Operations captain.
   (a) Formal training. Mandatory education during this phase is completion of a basic branch CCC. The goal is for
captains to complete CCC prior to joining a MISO unit and completing the POQC. These officers must instead rely on
their basic branch career managers at HRC to obtain school allocations.
   (b) Assignments. Assignments in a company, battalion, and group organization should follow a progressive order.
Newly branch transferred PO officers must be able to serve for 24 months in an MTOE MISO unit. This unit
assignment is considered critical branch experience following completion of PO qualification training, and company
grade officers should focus their efforts on mastering their newly acquired skills as PO officers. All PO captain
positions are considered critical branch experience for initial development. Not all positions are available to RC
officers depending on their category of service. The KD assignment for TPU captains is as a Tactical MISO
Detachment commander. AGR captains are not afforded this assignment opportunity. For AGR captains, the KD
assignment is assistant operations officer or S3–Air of a MISO Battalion. Both TPU and AGR captains are afforded the
opportunity to command headquarters and headquarters companies in MISO Battalions.
   (3) Reserve Component Psychological Operations major.
   (a) Formal training. The developmental goal for majors is to complete Command and General Staff College or an
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            185

ILE equivalent. Officers should complete Command and General Staff College/ILE but must complete ILE Common
Core or 50 percent of the legacy Command and General Staff College to be educationally qualified for promotion to
lieutenant colonel.
   (b) Assignments. Major TDA and TOE assignments for PO at the MISO unit level are limited and officers should
seek KD assignments and then pursue broadening assignments prior to consideration for their next 10 years of service.
The KD assignment for majors is PO Company Commander for both AGR and TPU officers. The KD assignment for
AGR majors is battalion operations officer. TPU majors have the opportunity for KD assignments as a MISO battalion
executive officer or MISG plans officer.
   (4) Reserve Component Psychological Operations lieutenant colonel.
   (a) Formal training. The RC lieutenant colonel must complete 100 percent of the legacy Command and General
Staff College or ILE Common Core to be considerate educationally qualified for promotion to colonel. Qualified
lieutenant colonels may apply for the U.S. Army War College or other SSCs (resident or distance learning).
   (b) Assignments. The KD assignment for lieutenant colonels is to serve as a battalion commander of an MTOE or
TDA unit for 24 months. While not every PO officer will command at the battalion level, the goal of the officer’s
professional development is to provide every officer the assignments, institutional training, and experience to prepare
him for command at this level. Additional KD assignments are available as group/brigade DCOs and S3s.
   (5) Reserve Component Psychological Operations colonel.
   (a) Formal training. Completion of SSC.
   (b) Assignments. The KD assignment for highly-qualified colonels is to command a MISO or training brigade. To be
slated for a PO colonel-level command, PO colonels should be enrolled in or have previously completed SSC.
   c. Life-cycle development model. The RC life-cycle development model for PO officers is shown in figure 17–2.

Chapter 18
Civil Affairs Branch
18–1. Unique features of the Civil Affairs Branch
   a. Unique purpose of the Civil Affairs Branch. The CA (38) is a non-accession operations functional category
branch. The mission of CA forces is to mitigate or defeat threats to civil society and conduct responsibilities normally
performed by civil governments across the range of military operations by engaging and influencing the civil populace
and authorities through the planning and conduct of CAO, or to enable Civil Military Operations, to shape the civil
environment and set the conditions for military operations. CA forces plan, prepare for, execute, assess, and transition
CAO at all levels of war. CA forces conduct CAO supported by other forces. CAO support the Joint Firepower
Course’s CMO intent and are synchronized with the supported commander’s operational concept. CA forces support
unified land operations in every environment across the range of military operations that are nested within the overall
mission and commander’s intent. CAO are a cornerstone to the successful execution of stability tasks. The mission of
CA forces is to mitigate or defeat threats to civil society and conduct responsibilities normally performed by civil
governments across the range of military operations. CA forces accomplish this by engaging and influencing the civil
populace and authorities through the planning and conduct of CA operations in support of civil-military operations. CA
forces support commanders by engaging the civil component of the operational environment to achieve civil-military
operations or other stated U.S. objectives and by ensuring the sustained legitimacy of the mission and the transparency
and credibility of the military force before, during, or after other military operations. CA forces interface with
indigenous populations and institutions, intergovernmental organizations, nongovernmental organizations, other civilian
and government organizations, and military forces to assist the supported commander to accomplish the mission. Army
CA forces are organized to support conventional forces and SOF, the Services, U.S. Government agencies, allied
forces, agencies of other countries, various intergovernmental organizations, and associated nongovernmental organiza-
tions. CA forces are the supported commander’s primary asset in the planning, execution, and assessment of stability
and transitional military authority operations by virtue of their area and linguistic orientation, cultural awareness,
training in military to host nation advisory activities, and civilian professional skills that parallel common government
functions.
   b. Unique functions performed by the CA Branch. The primary function of all Army CA units is to support the
commander by engaging the civil component of the operational environment. CA forces interface with indigenous
populations and institutions, intergovernmental organizations, nongovernmental organizations, other civilian and gov-
ernment organizations, and military forces to assist the supported commander to accomplish the mission. CA forces
enhance stability through the mitigation or defeat of immediate threats to the civil society and develop indigenous
capacity to deter or defeat future civil threats. To meet this broad requirement, Army CA units are organized to support
conventional forces and SOF, the Services, USG agencies, allied forces, agencies of other countries, various inter-
governmental organizations, and their associated nongovernmental organizations. Mission guidance and priorities-
including prioritized regional engagement activities and language requirements-from respective combatant commanders
(CCDRs) provide regional focus.
   (1) The mission of the RA CA brigade assigned to USASOC is to rapidly deploy regionally focused, language
capable, initial entry CATAs, Civil Military Affairs Operation Center, CA battalions, and CA companies to plan,
enable, shape, manage, and execute CAO in support of a geographic combatant command, Joint Task Force, TSOC,
joint forces special operations component, interagency, corps, division, or BCT. The brigade can serve as the core of a
joint civil-military operations task force and can provide mission command system capabilities for assigned forces. The
CA brigade headquarters provides mission command and staff supervision of the operations of the brigade and assigned
CA battalions or attached units. This headquarters is rapidly deployable, providing USASOC with a responsive,
flexible, and modular CA force package. While serving in an initial entry role during contingency operations, the
brigade is able to transition with the follow-on CA forces supporting conventional forces.
   (2) The mission of the RA CA brigade assigned to FORSCOM is providing supported commanders with an initial
entry capable, responsive, flexible, and modular CA force package. The brigade can rapidly deploy expeditionary
forces, captains, Civil Military Affairs Operation Center, CA battalions and CA companies, that are regionally focused,
language capable, and possess the ability to plan, enable, shape, manage, and execute CAO in support of a geographic
combatant commands, ASCC, joint forces special operations component, Joint Task Forces, interagency, corps,
division, or BCT. The brigade can serve as the core of a joint civil-military operations task force and can provide
mission command system capabilities for assigned forces. While serving in an initial entry role during contingency
operations, the brigade is able to transition with the follow-on CA forces. The CA brigade possesses a limited special
functions cells and a Public Affairs staff capability.
   (3) USAR CA units can be mobilized to provide support to conventional forces and the theater security cooperation
activities of the geographic combatant command under FORSCOM, as part of ongoing shaping operations in each
188                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

theater; for engagement or exercises. The Civil Affairs Command’s (CACOM’s) primary mission is to provide theater-
level CAO planning, coordination, policies, and programs in support of the geographic combatant command’s regional
civil-military operations strategy and stabilization, reconstruction, and development efforts. The CACOM may deploy a
theater-level Civil Military Affairs Operation Center to coordinate, analyze, and enable policies, programs, and civil-
military operations capabilities in support of the geographic combatant command or JFLCC, and to develop and
manage the strategic level civil inputs to the common operating picture. The CA brigade functions as the regionally
focused, expeditionary, operational-level CA capability that supports the Army corps and the Joint Task Force
headquarters. The USAR CA brigade supports the corps and possesses a CA functional specialist (38G MOS) cell not
present within the RA CA brigades. The 38G applies to civilian-acquired core competencies found within the six CA
functional specialty areas—governance, rule of law, public health and welfare, infrastructure, economic stability, and
public education and information—provide CA the capability to conduct responsibilities normally performed by civil
Governments and emergency services. Functional specialists are unique within CA forces because they provide special
or unique civilian core competency skills which are enhanced through advanced military education programs. These
programs are designed to operationalize their skills within a cultural context for the application in foreign lands. The
CA brigade focus is development, reconstruction, and stabilization. The CA brigade enables support to civil administra-
tion and is the operational mission command system structure to form a joint civil-military operations task force. The
brigade headquarters provides mission command and staff supervision of the operations of the CA brigade and assigned
CA battalions or attached units. Its focus is on tactical and operational employment of CA forces and attached civil-
military operations forces. The CA brigade plans, enables, shapes, and manages CAO by and with indigenous
populations and institutions, intergovernmental organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and other governmental
agencies through its civil liaison team. The brigade has a functional specialty cell with limited capabilities in four of
the six functional specialty areas (rule of law, governance, public health and welfare, and infrastructure). The brigade
provides operational-level support to the corps or an equivalent-level ACOM/Joint Task Force during stability tasks.
   (4) CA elements in all capacities enable the force to assess, advise, monitor, establish, train, and transition political,
economic, social, and cultural indigenous institutions and capabilities to achieve U.S. national goals and objectives at
the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of operation.
18–2. Active Component Civil Affairs officer
   a. Officer characteristics required.
   (1) Unique skills. The core competencies for AC CA officers: cross-cultural communications, regional expertise,
language ability, and interpersonal skills, make them ideally suitable to operate in the human domain. The CA officer
is an expert in the command and employment of CA forces and functional specialists. Foreign-language skills are
acquired through institutional training, maintained and enhanced through unit funded training, operational employment,
and self-study. The AC CA officer must achieve a proficiency score in accordance with AR 11–6 and USAJFKSWCS
Regulations and Policy in their target language. CA officers are expected to maintain and improve language proficiency
with professional development. They must have the ability to analyze complex political-military problems and to
develop and employ conventional and unconventional solutions. They also must be able to devise and execute
nonstandard and non-doctrinal methods and techniques, when applicable, to remedy unforeseen circumstances.
   (2) Unique knowledge. The CA officer applies their knowledge of the human domain and cultural expertise to
support or enhance military operations and advance U.S. political objectives. The CA officer understands how to
interact effectively with civilian representatives of foreign and indigenous populations and institutions located in the
operational area. They are trained to assess how civil areas, structures, capabilities, organizations, people, and events
will help, hinder, or affect U.S. and coalition military operations.
   (3) Unique attributes.
   (a) The human dimension is the differentiating factor that separates CA forces from all other military organizations.
CA forces are people-centric. Though fully comfortable and capable in highly technological combat operations, their
unique strength is their ability to accomplish the goals and objectives of the United States by operating with or through
host nation populations and institutions.
   (b) CA officers must be able to act independently. CA officers must be warfighters able to work in remote, austere,
and often hostile environments. They must be able to make important decisions with little or no immediate supervision.
They must be self-reliant team players that can function as leaders in small units.
   (c) Because of the nature of the work, CA officers must be mature professionals. Even at junior grades, the U.S.
Army requires CA officers to work at the highest levels of command organizations on sensitive issues, often briefing
and advising general officers, senior U.S. officials, and foreign government officials.
   (d) CA officers must be adaptable, flexible, and capable of independent operations in unstructured environments.
They must be able to thrive in complex and ambiguous situations, and work in and understand the complexities of JIIM
and joint operations.
   (e) CA officers must be diplomatic, influential, and persuasive in their interactions with persons from all cultures,
including their own. They must possess good interpersonal skills and display political awareness and cultural
sensitivity.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                               189

   (f) CA officers must possess unquestioned character and integrity.
   (g) CA officers must demonstrate mental, intellectual, and physical aptitude.
   b. Officer accessions.
   (1) Branch recruitment. The CA Branch recruits officers from all other branches and facets of military service
through the Special Operations Recruiting Battalion at http://sorbrecruiting.com/CA.htm. The CA branch is open to
both males and females. The U.S. Army expects CA officers to serve a successful initial tour as a small-unit leader in
one of the other U.S. Army branches as a lieutenant to gain a working knowledge of Army operations and tactics. The
U.S. Army assesses officers into CA as promotable first lieutenants in the target year group. Limited Exception to
Policy Waiver request are accepted and approved through the CA personnel proponent.
   (2) Application procedures. Commissioned officers who meet the minimum criteria outlined above and desire a
branch transfer to the CA Branch may apply as follows. AA officers may apply through the U.S. Army Special
Operations Recruiting Battalion, Bldg. 2–1120, Fort Bragg, NC 28310, Fax: (910) 396–4994, http://www.bragg.army.
mil/SORB/Pages/default.aspx, between their second and third year of commissioned service. The centralized ARSOF
Officer Selection Board will board the packets. The ARSOF Board is held each FY per the annual MILPER message
announcing the board timing and application requirements. Each cohort year group will have only one window in
which to apply to the ARSOF board. Officers missing this window must request an exception to policy per paragraph
18–2b(6) to be considered for branch transfer.
   (3) Branch transfer acceptance. Upon selection from the AC annual ARSOF Board and acceptance of a CA branch
transfer, HRC will manage these officers as untrained CA personnel. The AC CA Branch future readiness officer at
HRC will schedule the ARSOF Board-selected officers for CA assessment and selection, airborne (if needed), SOF
Officers Common Core, and the Civil Affairs Qualification Course (CAQC) before assigning them to an entry-level
CA position. The CA Branch is awarded once all of the requirements of paragraph (4) are met.
   (4) Accession. The CA Branch is a year group specific non-accession branch. Interested officers should refer to the
current ARSOF Board MILPER message for qualification guidance; contact the Special Operation Recruiting Battalion
at http://sorbrecruiting.com/CA.htm for submission of ARSOF board packet requirements and submission. Of the
following criteria, requirements per paragraphs (4a) through (4l) will not be waived. Waiver authority is per paragraph
(6). Officers selected for branch transfer must—
   (a) Complete a resident BOLC.
   (b) Complete an initial tour as a small-unit leader
   (c) Possess a valid secret security clearance; and must be eligible for access to top secret clearance or assigned to

   (l) Attend the CA Qualification course, including language training and meet language requirements in accordance
with AR 11–6 and USAJFKSWCS Regulations and Policy.
   (5) Desired qualifications. Because of the regional orientation of U.S. Army CA units, a foreign-language skill and
regional or cultural expertise is required. Officers must have an aptitude for learning a foreign language and must
achieve, sustain and improve foreign-language proficiency throughout their careers. In addition, advanced civilian
education and a strong background in one of the civilian-acquired functional specialties are desirable.
   (6) Waiver authority. The CG, USAJFKSWCS is the proponent for all CA forces and the final authority for award
of branch, course prerequisites, as well as CA qualification and branch-transfer requirements. All requests for excep-
tions to policy should be routed through the chain of command and addressed to the CG, USAJFKSWCS
(AOJK–CDI–CA), Fort Bragg, NC 28310. Email the CA personnel proponent at swapersonnel@ahqb.soc.mil.
   c. Officer management.
   (1) Career life-cycle development overview. CA officers will command CA units at levels of increasing responsibili-
ty. Captains will command at team level. Majors will command companies. Lieutenant colonels will command
battalions. Colonels will command brigades. CA officer development continues throughout their career life-cycle with
progressive assignments across both SOF and Conventional organizations in troop unit, staff, interagency and institu-
tional training assignments. In addition, officers complete their PME requirements to remain competitive for HQDA
selection boards and professional growth. Self-development is essential for all CA officers. The uniqueness of the
190                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

branch requires officers to sustain and enhance regional expertise and a foreign-language capability through self-
development. The development goal is to assess CA officers at the tactical level and grow them into CA joint planners
and advisors at the strategic level in support of combatant commanders and interagency partners.
   (2) Opportunities for female Soldiers. Branch 38-coded positions are open to women; including all positions in CA
units and command positions, the exception to this are male-coded positions or exclusions through non-CA unit policy.
AR 600–13.
   (3) Assignment and schooling requirements. To be considered the best-qualified officers in the branch at each grade,
CA officers must complete their operational assignments and schooling (fig 18–1). By meeting these requirements, the
officer acquires the skills and knowledge to remain proficient in the CA Branch at their grade and becomes the best-
qualified candidate for promotion in the branch. Officers are strongly encouraged to attain exceptional qualification
requirements in the CA Branch at each grade. Meeting exceptionally qualified requirements will increase the officer’s
probability of being selected for promotion and will also improve the possibility of command selection for lieutenant
colonel and colonel grades. Officers at all grades must recognize, however, the importance of performance in all
assignments.
   (4) Key developmental assignments. The following assignments for captains through colonels are recommended to
make the CA officer the best qualified in the CA Branch at each grade and exceptionally qualified for future
promotion.
   (a) Captain.
   1. PME—completion of SOFCC or CCC and CAQC.
   2. Assignments—CA captains should successfully serve 36 months in any combination of the 38A coded positions
listed below, both KD and broadening.
   a. Key developmental assignments. CA captains must successfully command a CA team for at least 18 months -
optimally for 24 months. This is the KD position for all CA captains. This duty equates to company, battery, or troop
command in the other operations branches. Only after CA team command KD assignments will AC CA captains be
considered for broadening opportunities as a pre-ILE assignment.
   b. Additional key developmental assignments. The following are considered additional KD assignments that the best-
qualified captains will hold after commanding a CA team:
—    Instructor at USAJFKSWCS.
—    CA battalion.
—    HHC commander.
—    CA brigade.
—    HHC commander.
—    Chief, Civil Information Management Section at a CA battalion
—    S–9, 38A primary staff captains positions (BCT, Ranger battalion, SF battalion)
   c. Other preferred developmental assignments. Positions coded with 38A in CA operational units, USAJFKSWCS,
Combined Training Centers, SF groups, and other Army and Joint Headquarters which include but are not limited too:

—    CA Proponent at USAJFKSWCS.
—    Training With Industry.
—    Army Fellowships.
—    Other assignments: operational, institutional, JIIM, and Academia.
   3. Self-development goals. In addition to professional development through operational assignments, CA captains
should begin an intensive military self-development program. Their efforts should focus on gaining an in-depth
understanding of combined arms, JIIM operations, improving and maintaining regional and linguistic expertise achiev-
ing a 2/2 or better in their assigned language. Officers should also become proficient in CA common core and branch
tasks.
   4. Suggested captains’ development courses. Ranger, Jumpmaster, Sapper, Pathfinder, Air Assault, SOF courses at
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                                  191

the Joint Special Operations University, Civil Military Cooperation NATO courses, Reconstruction, and Stabilization
courses through the Foreign Service Institute at the U.S. Department of State, and Federal Emergency Management
Agency courses.
                                       Figure 18–1. Civil Affairs captain development
   (b) Major.
   1. Professional military education. Officers must complete 100 percent of ILE PME requirements and Stability,
Security, and Development in Complex Operations (SSDCO). Officers in the primary zone cohort year group will be
assigned and expected to attend ILE as directed. The SSDCO is required for all CA officers in addition to Army
required PME. This program prepares officers for assignments to theater Army, TSOC, combatant command, or
interagency positions.
   2. Assignments.
   a. Key developmental assignments. Majors should successfully serve 18 months, with a goal of 24 months, in any of
the positions listed below or a combination of these positions:
— CA company commander.
— Company commander, Special Operations Recruiting Battalion.
— SF Group (A) S–9.
   b. Additional key developmental assignments. The following are considered additional KD assignments that the best-
qualified majors will hold after commanding a CA company:
—   Battalion XO or operations officer (S3).
—   Positions within USAJFKSWCS and the regimental proponent.
—   TSOC CA planner.
—   Chief, CA planning team at a CA battalion.
   c. Other preferred developmental assignments.
— Complementary to key assignments, CA majors can expect to serve in other staff positions.
— General staff officer. In this position, an officer provides professional development at one of the staff sections at the
    command, division, corps, ASCC, or joint duty positions.
— Senior staff. As senior staff members, majors serve as HQDA, DOD, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Special Operations
    Command, and joint or combined headquarters staff officers or in interagency positions requiring CA experience
    and expertise.
   d. Broadening assignments:
—   Interagency fellowships.
—   USASOC staff.
—   Service school staff.
—   Allied Command Europe.
—   Combined Arms Center.
192                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

— Other assignments—operational, institutional, JIIM, and Academia.
   3. Self-development goals. There is much greater emphasis on self-development at the field grade level, with the
focus on more general areas of knowledge rather than on specific tasks. Officers without a master’s degree should
consider enrolling in a civilian college or university and earning an advanced degree to remain competitive. AC CA
majors should maintain and enhance their language proficiency to 2+/2+ or better, enhance regional and cultural
expertise and continue their military self-development reading program and physical fitness.
   4. Suggested majors’ development courses. SOF courses at the Joint Special Operations University, NATO courses,
and JPME II. Additionally, since many major positions are coded with 96 “Master’s degree required”, it is highly
encouraged to obtain a master’s degree during the ILE window.
   a. National Defense University. Select CA officers may attend the highly competitive National Defense University,
College of International Security Affairs. This education better prepares CA officers for assignments in joint and
interagency billets.
   b. Naval Postgraduate School. The Special Operations Master’s Degree Program at the Naval Postgraduate School is
18 months of advanced studies for selected officers. It provides a broad education in the art and science of unconven-
tional warfare at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels followed by a tour (normally after serving in a KD
position) as an operational planner at USSOCOM, USASOC, a TSOC, or in designated JSOTFs. CA officers who
attend the P950, ILE Preparatory Course, and the Naval Command and Staff Distance Education Courses while
attending Naval Postgraduate School will receive full ILE/JPME 1 credit.
   c. The Interagency Studies Program will provide CA officers with an accredited master’s degree that prepares
officers for post-key and developmental assignments in joint and interagency SOF billets. This is done in conjunction
with attendance at ILE while at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
   d. Attendance at AMSP at the SAMS. The AMSP is 1 year of advanced study for selected officers that have
completed ILE. The AMSP provides a broad education in the art and science of war at the tactical, operational, and
strategic levels. Any CA officer who graduates from SAMS who is key and developmental qualified will serve in a
CA-coded SAMS assignment. Any CA officer who is not key and developmental qualified will serve in a CA key and
developmental assignment prior to fulfilling their SAMS utilization.
                                        Figure 18–2. Civil Affairs major development
   (c) Lieutenant colonel.
   1. Professional military education. Lieutenant colonels who want to remain competitive for subsequent promotion
and command should attend a SSC. All lieutenant colonels should strive to complete JPME II. Officers selected to
command battalions will attend the Army PCC and will also attend the ARSOF PCC and the Joint Special Operations
PCC.
   2. Assignments.
   a. Key developmental assignments. Battalion command. Command of a CA TOE or TDA battalion or other (CSL) is
the most critical assignment for a CA lieutenant colonel. Service as an AC CA battalion commander develops the
lieutenant colonel for future responsibilities as a CA brigade commander.
   b. Additional key developmental assignments. The following are considered KD assignments that the best-qualified
lieutenant colonel will hold after commanding a CA battalion:
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                          193

— Primary staff, division CA officer (G9).
— Deputy commander of a CA brigade or other O6 headquarters.
— Primary staff officer at a CA brigade or other O6 headquarters.
   c. Other preferred developmental assignments.
— Staff officer at CA brigade or command.
— CA planning team.
— HQDA, DOD, Joint Chiefs of Staff, ASCC, major command, joint or combined headquarters staff officer or
    interagency positions requiring CA experience and expertise.
Note. Former battalion commander positions are approved and slated per USAJFKSWCS policy.
   d. Broadening assignments. Other assignments—operational, institutional, JIIM, and Academia
   3. Self-development goals. CA lieutenant colonels should maintain and enhance their language expertise and regional
knowledge and continue their military self-development professional readings and mastery of branch skills. Officers are
encouraged to begin a doctorate degree in one of the CA disciplines, complete continuing education programs in
acquired civilian skills, and remain physically fit.
                                    Figure 18–3. Civil Affairs lieutenant colonel development

   1. Professional military education. Completion of SSC.
   2. Assignments.
   a. Key developmental assignments. CA colonels continue to serve the branch, special operations, and the Army
through service in any CA-coded colonel position or combination of positions within USSOCOM, USASOC,
FORSCOM, U.S. Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command (USACAPOC[A]), USAJFKSWCS, HQDA,
joint staff, service schools, interagency and other key organizations. Command of a CA TOE or TDA brigade or other
(CSL) is the most critical assignment for a CA colonel.
— The commander of a CA brigade.
— Primary staff officer in the Corps G9.
   b. Additional key developmental assignments. The following are considered KD assignments that the best-qualified
colonel will hold after commanding a CA Brigade:
— CA Commandant, USAJFKSWCS.
— The assistant chief of staff for one of the primary staff positions at the GOCOM level.

    requiring CA experience and expertise.
   c. Broadening assignments.Other assignments—operational, institutional, JIIM, and Academia.
   3. Self-development goals. Colonels should further enhance their negotiation and military diplomacy techniques
language and regional orientation and continue their professional readings and mastery of branch skills; complete a
194                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

doctorate degree in one of the CA disciplines; and complete continuing education programs in acquired CA disciplines,
if applicable.
                                       Figure 18–4. Civil Affairs colonel development
   d. Assignment preferences and precedence.
   (1) Preferences. The Army assigns CA officers based upon its needs, the regional alignment of the officer, and the
desires of the individual officer. Worldwide assignments are available. The goal of CA officer development is to
produce officers that can assimilate into staffs and organizations and immediately integrate CA plans and principles
into the deliberate planning process.
   (2) Precedence. Assignment of officers to KD leadership positions has precedence over other assignments; however,
there is flexibility on assignment sequence. Ideally, CA branch officers should seek assignments in the following order
at each grade plate:
   (a) Completion of required PME.
   (b) Command or other KD billet.
   (c) Nominative, broadening, or developmental billets.
   (d) Service in assignments at the joint, SOCs, joint theater staffs, HQDA, and OSD are important to the Army and
essential to individual officer’s advancement to senior leadership positions.
   e. Duration of developmental officer life-cycle assignments. Officers in the CA branch should ideally serve for a
minimum of 18 months with a goal of 24 months in all assigned positions and strive to achieve best-qualified ratings.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                          195

18–3. Civil Affairs officer development
   a. Officer characteristics required.
   (1) Unique skills. The core competencies for CA officers: cross-cultural communications, regional expertise, lan-
guage ability, and interpersonal skills, make them ideally suitable to operate in the human domain. The CA officer is
an expert in the command and employment of CA forces and functional specialists. Functional specialists are unique
within CA forces because they provide special or unique civilian core competency skills which are enhanced through
advanced military education programs. These programs are designed to operationalize their skills within a cultural
context for the application in foreign lands. Foreign-language skills are acquired through institutional training, self-
development, or unit training. The CA officer should strive to achieve a Defense Language Proficiency Test score of 1/
1/1 in their target language. They must have the ability to analyze complex political-military problems and to develop
and employ conventional and unconventional solutions. They also must be able to devise and execute nonstandard and
non-doctrinal methods and techniques, when applicable, to remedy unforeseen circumstances.
   (2) Unique knowledge. The CA officer applies his knowledge of the human domain and cultural expertise to support
or enhance the military operations, and advanced U.S. political objectives. The CA officer understands how to interact
effectively with civilian representatives of foreign and indigenous populations and institutions located in the operational
area. He is trained to assess how civil areas, structures, capabilities, organizations, people, and events will help, hinder,
or affect U.S. and coalition military operations.
   (3) Unique attributes.
   (a) The human dimension is the differentiating factor that separates CA forces from all other military organizations.
CA forces are people-centric. Though fully comfortable and capable in highly technological combat operations, their
unique strength is their ability to accomplish the goals and objectives of the United States by operating with, or through
indigenous or surrogate populations and institutions.
   (b) CA officers must be able to act independently. CA officers must be warfighters able to work in remote, austere,
and often hostile environments. They must be able to make important decisions with little or no immediate supervision.
They must be self-reliant team players that can function as leaders in small units.
196                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (c) Because of the nature of the work, CA officers must be mature professionals. Even at junior grades, the U.S.
Army requires CA officers to work at the highest levels of command organizations on sensitive issues, often briefing
and advising general officers, senior U.S. and foreign government officials.
   (d) CA officers must be adaptable, flexible, and capable of independent operations in unstructured environments.
They must be able to thrive in complex and ambiguous situations, and work in and understand the complexities of
JIIM, and joint operations.
   (e) CA officers must be diplomatic, influential, and persuasive in their interactions with persons from other cultures.
They must possess good interpersonal skills and display political awareness and cultural sensitivity.
   (f) CA officers must possess unquestioned character and integrity.
   (g) CA officers must demonstrate mental, intellectual, and physical aptitude.
   b. Officer accessions.
   (1) Branch recruitment. The CA Branch draws its officers from all other ACC branches. The U.S. Army expects CA
officers to serve a successful initial tour as a small-unit leader in one of the other U.S. Army branches as a lieutenant
to gain a working knowledge of Army operations and tactics. The U.S. Army assesses officers into CA as promotable
first lieutenants and captains. As a non-accessions branch, USAR CA units do not benefit from the annual accessions
mission which provides USAR units with officers. Unit commanders in CA units are therefore responsible for the
recruiting of officers into their unit. Unlike the AC, the RC assigns and then trains personnel; therefore, it is imperative
that unit leadership recruit and accept only those officers who meet branch qualification and accession standards
outlined in DA Pam 611–21 (https://smartbook.armyg1.pentagon.mil/default.aspx).
   (2) Application procedures. USAR TPU officers who successfully graduate from the CAQC will branch transfer to
CA. The proponent will request through the Army Reserve Careers Division the re-branching action.
   (3) Branch-transfer acceptance. Upon acceptance for branch transfer Army Reserve Careers Division manages these
officers as trained CA personnel.
   (4) Accession. The CA Branch is a non-accession branch. To ensure officers are eligible for branch transfer, they
must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (h) in order to attend the CAQC. Upon graduation of the CAQC
they are eligible and will have their branch changed to CA. Of the following criteria, requirements paragraphs (a)
through (e) will not be waived. Waiver authority is per paragraph (6). Officers selected for branch transfer must—
   (a) Possess a bachelor’s degree.
   (b) Complete a resident BOLC.
   (c) Complete a CCC.
   (d) Be assigned to a valid entry-level CA 38A position (must be assigned to position prior to enrollment into
CAQC).
   (e) Possess a valid secret security clearance in accordance with AR 380–67.
   (f) Hold the rank of captain or of first lieutenant selected for promotion to captain.
   (g) Meets medical standards per AR 40–501 and USAJFKSWCS policy.
   (h) Officers assigned to paid parachutist positions are required to be airborne qualified.
   (i) Complete the CAQC.
   (5) Desired qualifications. Because of the regional orientation of U.S. Army CA units, a foreign-language skill, and
regional or cultural expertise is highly desirable. Officers should have an aptitude for learning a foreign language and
strive to sustain foreign-language proficiency throughout their careers.
   (6) Waiver authority. The CG, USAJFKSWCS, is the proponent for all CA forces and the final authority for award
of branch, course prerequisites, as well as CA qualification and branch-transfer requirements. All requests for excep-
tions to policy should be routed through the chain of command and addressed to the CG, USAJFKSWCS,
(AOJK–CDI–CA), Fort Bragg, NC 28310. Email requests to swcscapersonnel@ahqb.soc.mil.
   c. Officer management.
   (1) Career life-cycle development overview. CA officers will command CA units at levels of increasing responsibili-
ty. Captains will command at team level. Majors will command companies. Lieutenant colonels will command
battalions. Colonels will command brigades. Brigadier generals will command commands. CA officer development
continues throughout their career life-cycle with progressive assignments in troop unit, staff, and interagency and
institutional training assignments. In addition, officers complete their PME requirements to remain competitive for
HQDA selection boards and professional growth. Self-development is essential for all CA officers. The uniqueness of
the branch requires officers to sustain and enhance regional expertise and a foreign-language capability through self-
development. The development goal is to access CA officers at the tactical level and grow them into CA joint planners
and advisors at the strategic level in support of combatant commanders and interagency partners. Officers seeking to
become the best qualified should aggressively seek operational assignments of increasing responsibility and complexi-
ty. Due to constrained assignment options in the RC environment, officers may need to accept assignments throughout
the Selected Reserve or voluntarily seek assignments in distant geographic locations. RC officers must realize the
possibility of occasional temporary transfers to the IRR to facilitate the completion of PME.
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             197

   (2) Opportunities for female Soldiers. All branch 38-coded positions in the USAR are open to women, including all
positions in CA units and command positions, per AR 600–13.
   (3) Assignment and schooling requirements. To be considered the best-qualified officers in the branch at each grade,
CA officers must complete their operational assignments and schooling. By meeting these requirements, the officer
acquires the skills and knowledge to remain proficient in the CA Branch at his grade and becomes the best-qualified
candidate for promotion in the branch. Officers are strongly encouraged to attain exceptional qualification requirements
in the CA Branch at each grade. Meeting exceptionally qualified requirements will increase the officer’s probability of
being selected for promotion and will also improve the possibility of command selection at lieutenant colonel and
colonel grades. Officers at all grades must recognize, however, the importance of performance in all assignments.
   (4) Key developmental assignments. The following assignments for captains through colonels are recommended to
make the CA officer the best qualified in the CA Branch at each grade and exceptionally qualified for future
promotion.
   (a) Captain.
   1. Professional military education. Mandatory education during this phase is completion of a basic branch CCC.
The requirement is for captains to complete a CCC prior to attending the CAQC. USAR officers coordinate basic
branch CCC attendance through their appropriate career counselors.
   2. Assignments. CA captains should successfully serve 36 months in any combination of the 38A coded positions
listed below, both KD and broadening.
   a. Key developmental assignments. CA captains should successfully command a CA team, optimally for 24 months.
This is the KD position for all CA captains. This duty equates to company, battery, or troop command in the other
operations branches.
   b. Additional key developmental assignments. The following are considered additional KD assignments that the best-
qualified captains will hold after commanding a CA team:
— Chief, civil information management section at a CA battalion.
— Chief, civil liaison team at a CA battalion.
— Instructor at USAJFKSWCS.
   3. Other preferred developmental assignments. These positions continue officer development while assigned to CA
units and complement the time spent in key captain’s positions:
—    CA officer in a CA company Civil Military Affairs Operation Center.
—    CA officer on the CA planning team at a CA battalion.
—    CA officer in the Sustainment platoon at a CA brigade.
—    CA officer in the Operations section at a CA brigade.
—    CA officer positions in DCS, G–3/5/7 at the U.S. Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command
     (Airborne) (USACAPOC(A)).
   4. Self-development goals. In addition to professional development through operational assignments, CA captains
should begin an intensive military self-development program. Their efforts should focus on gaining an in-depth
understanding of combined arms, JIIM operations; improving and maintaining regional and linguistic expertise; and
becoming proficient in CA common core and branch tasks and in any civilian-acquired expertise. Suggested captains’
development courses are Ranger, Jumpmaster, Airborne, Civil Military Cooperation NATO courses, Reconstruction,
and Stabilization courses through the Foreign Service Institute at the U.S. Department of State, Federal Emergency
Management Agency courses, and the French Army Reserve Staff Officer Course.
   (b) Major.
   1. Professional military education. Officers must complete ILE Common Core and the SSDCO for consideration to
lieutenant colonel. SSDCO is required for all CA officers in addition to Army required PME. CA officers are
encouraged to completed ILE Common Core by their 3rd year of service as a major and complete SSDCO by their 4th
year as a major. SSDCO prepares officers for assignments to CACOMs, geographic combatant commands, and
interagency positions.
   2. Key assignments. Majors should successfully serve 12 months with a goal of 24 months in any of the positions
listed below or a combination of these positions:
   a. Key developmental assignments.
— CA company commander.
— HHC commander.
— Battalion XO.
   b. Additional key developmental assignments. The following are considered additional KD assignments that the
best-qualified majors will hold after commanding a CA company:
198                                       DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

— Chief, Functional Specialty Cell (battalion).
— Chief, CA Planning Team (battalion).
— Chief, Civil Information Management (brigade).
   c. Other preferred developmental assignments. These positions continue officer development while assigned to CA
units and complement the time spent in key major’s positions. CA positions in RC units are actively sought and highly
competitive.
— CA officer in the Sustainment platoon at a CA brigade.
— CA officer in the Operations section at a CA brigade.
— CA officer positions in DCS, G–3/5/7 at the U.S. Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command
    (Airborne) (USACAPOC(A)).
— General staff officer. In this position, an officer provides professional development at one of the staff sections at the
    command, division, corps, ASCC, or joint duty positions.
— Senior staff. As senior staff members, majors serve as HQDA, DOD, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Special Operations
    Command, and joint or combined headquarters staff officers or in interagency positions requiring CA experience
    and expertise.
   3. Self-development goals. There is much greater emphasis on self-development at the field grade level, with the
focus on more general areas of knowledge rather than on specific tasks. Officers without a master’s degree should
consider enrolling in a civilian college or university and earning an advanced degree. CA majors should maintain and
enhance their language, regional and cultural expertise, develop their civilian-acquired expertise, and continue their
military self-development reading program. All officers must remain physically fit. Suggested officer development
courses are NATO courses and JPME II.
   4. Suggested majors’ development course. Attendance at AMSP at the SAMS. The AMSP is 1 year of advanced
study for selected officers that have completed ILE. The AMSP provides a broad education in the art and science of
war at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. Any CA officer who graduates from SAMS who is key and
developmental qualified will serve in a CA-coded SAMS assignment. Any CA officer who is not key and developmen-
tal qualified will serve in a CA key and developmental assignment prior to fulfilling their SAMS utilization. Additional
professional development education opportunities include: the French Army Reserve Staff Officer Course, RC National
Security Course, Defense Strategy Course, and the Canadian Joint Command and Staff Programme.
   (c) Lieutenant colonel.
   1. Professional military education. Lieutenant colonels who want to remain competitive for subsequent promotion
should attend a SSC. All lieutenant colonels should strive to complete AJPME II. Officers selected to command
battalions will attend the Army PCC.
   2. Assignments. KD assignments for lieutenant colonels include:
   a. Battalion command. Command of a CA battalion (CSL) is the most critical assignment for a CA lieutenant
colonel. Service as a CA battalion commander develops the lieutenant colonel for future responsibilities as a CA
brigade commander.
   b. Battalion command (01A).
   c. Service as the deputy commander of a CA brigade or other O6 headquarters.
   d. Chief; Civil Liaison Team Chief (brigade); Civil Information Management (CACOM); or operations/INTEL
(CACOM).
   e. Service as a G9 staff officer in a USAR major command.
   3. Other developmental positions.
   a. Service as a CA staff officer in the USASOC support unit.
   b. Service as a CA officer with the USAR element at JFCOM.
   c. Operations officer for the CA planning team at brigade and CACOM level.
   4. Self-development goals. CA lieutenant colonels should maintain and enhance their language expertise and regional
knowledge and continue their military self-development professional readings and mastery of branch skills and civilian-
acquired skills. Complete a master’s degree in one of the CA disciplines; complete continuing education programs in
acquired civilian skills; and remain physically fit. Additional professional development education opportunities include:
the French Army Reserve Staff Officer Course, RC National Security Course, Defense Strategy Course, and the
Canadian Joint Command and Staff Programme.
   (d) Colonel.
   1. Professional military education. Completion of SSC.
   2. Assignments. CA colonels continue to serve the branch and the United States Army Reserve through service in
any CA-coded colonel position or combination of positions within U.S. Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations
Command (USACAPOC[A]), 322nd CA Brigade, the 361st CA Brigade, and USASOC support unit. KD assignments
include:
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              199

   a. Brigade command.
   b. Brigade command in 01A assignment.
   c. Service as the chief of staff at USACAPOC(A).
   d. Service as the headquarters element chief at a CACOM.
   e. Service as the team chief of a CA planning team or civil liaison team.
   3. Other developmental positions. General staff officer.
   4. Self-development goals. Colonels should further enhance their negotiation and military diplomacy techniques
language and regional orientation and continue their professional readings and mastery of branch and civilian skills;
especially as they relate to joint, interagency and multinational context; complete a master’s degree in one of the CA
disciplines; complete continuing education programs in acquired civilian skills. Additional professional development
education opportunities include: the RC National Security Course, the Canadian Joint Command and Staff Programme
and the Senior Managers Course in National Security.
   d. Assignment preferences and precedence.
   (1) Preferences. Assignments in the Army Reserve will be in accordance with AR 140–10.
   (2) Precedence. Positional assignment occurs at the unit level. Assignment of officers to KD leadership positions
has precedence over other assignments; however, there is flexibility on assignment sequence. Ideally, CA branch
officers should seek assignments in the following order at each grade plate:
   (a) Completion of required PME.
   (b) Command or other KD billet.
   (c) Nominative, broadening, or developmental billets.
   (d) Service in assignments at joint theater staffs, HQDA, OCAR, and OSD are important to the Army and essential
to individual officer’s advancement to senior leadership positions.
   e. Duration of developmental officer life-cycle assignments. Figure 18–2 displays the CA branch life-cycle with KD
positions.

18–4. Active Guard Reserve Civil Affairs officer
   a. Officer characteristics required. In accordance with Title 10 USC 101(16), the term “Active Guard and Reserve”
means a member of a RC who is on active duty pursuant to Title 10, USC 12310 or Title 32 USC 502(f) and 709(a).
These officers are Guard or Reserve members who are ordered to active duty or full-time National Guard duty for the
purpose of organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the RC units. The AGR status is defined as
officers serving on active duty who have been accessed into the AGR program performing administrative and training
duties in direct support of the USAR. The primary objective of the AGR program is to improve the readiness of the
Army Reserve.
   (1) Unique skills. The core competencies for CA officers: cross-cultural communications, regional expertise, lan-
guage ability, and interpersonal skills, make them ideally suitable to operate in the human domain. The CA officer is
an expert in the command and employment of CA forces and functional specialists. Functional specialists are unique
within CA forces because they provide special or unique civilian core competency skills which are enhanced through
advanced military education programs. These programs are designed to operationalize their skills within a cultural
context for the application in foreign lands. Foreign-language skills are acquired through institutional training, self-
development, or unit training. The CA officer should strive to achieve a Defense Language Proficiency Test score of 1/
1/1 in their target language. They must have the ability to analyze complex political-military problems and to develop
and employ conventional and unconventional solutions. They also must be able to devise and execute nonstandard and
non-doctrinal methods and techniques, when applicable, to remedy unforeseen circumstances.
   (2) Unique knowledge. The CA officer applies his knowledge of the human domain and cultural expertise to support
or enhance the military operations, and advanced U.S. political objectives. The CA officer understands how to interact
effectively with civilian representatives of foreign and indigenous populations and institutions located in the operational
area. He is trained to assess how civil areas, structures, capabilities, organizations, people, and events will help, hinder,
or affect U.S. and coalition military operations.
   (3) Unique attributes.
   (a) The human dimension is the differentiating factor that separates CA forces from all other military organizations.
CA forces are people-centric. Though fully comfortable and capable in highly technological operations, their unique
strength is their ability to accomplish the goals and objectives of the United States by operating with, or through
indigenous or surrogate populations and institutions.
   (b) CA officers must be able to act independently. CA officers must be warfighters able to work in remote, austere,
and often hostile environments. They must be able to make important decisions with little or no immediate supervision.
They must be self-reliant team players that can function as leaders in small units.
   (c) Because of the nature of the work, CA officers must be mature professionals. Even at junior grades, the U.S.
Army requires CA officers to work at the highest levels of command organizations on sensitive issues, often briefing
and advising general officers, senior U.S. and foreign government officials.
   (d) CA officers must be adaptable, flexible, and capable of independent operations in unstructured environments.
They must be able to thrive in complex and ambiguous situations, and work in and understand the complexities of JIIM
and joint operations.
   (e) CA officers must be diplomatic, influential, and persuasive in their interactions with persons from other cultures.
They must possess good interpersonal skills and display political awareness and cultural sensitivity.
   (f) CA officers must possess unquestioned character and integrity.
   (g) CA officers must demonstrate mental, intellectual, and physical aptitude.
   b. Officer accessions.
   (1) Branch recruitment. The CA Branch draws its officers from all other ACC branches. The U.S. Army expects CA
officers to serve a successful initial tour as a small-unit leader in one of the other U.S. Army branches as a lieutenant
to gain a working knowledge of Army operations and tactics. The U.S. Army assesses officers into CA as promotable
first lieutenants and captains. There is no active recruitment of AGR officers. Self-motivated officers with the desire to
support the USAR in a full-time status seek the opportunity through the AGR Program.
   (2) Application procedures. Commissioned officers who desire to serve as a CA officer as an AGR officer must
meet the minimum criteria outlined in paragraphs (4)(a) through (g), and meet basic eligibility criteria for entry in the
AGR Program as a commissioned officer per AR 135–18 (qualifications for entry in the AGR Program, waiverable
disqualifications and nonwaiverable disqualifications for entry in the AGR Program). Officers will then need to
successfully complete and be selected for continued service through attendance at the CA Assessment and Selection
Course. Selected officers will then apply for the AGR Program by submitting an AGR application on the HRC Portal
at: http://www.hrcapps.army.mil/portal.
   (3) Branch-transfer acceptance. HRC manages AGR officers as either trained or untrained CA personnel upon
accessions into the AGR Program. The CA Branch assignments officer at HRC will assign fully trained officers to CA
positions. HRC will schedule untrained officers for all courses not completed. A fully trained CA AGR officer will
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              201

have successfully completed Regional Studies, Branch Technical, and CULEX portions of the AC CAQC. Current
qualified CA TPU officers who transition to the AGR program will need to receive Regional Studies training to
become fully qualified. Officers will be assigned to CA positions upon graduation. The CA Branch is awarded once all
of the requirements of paragraph (4) are met.
   (4) Accession. The CA Branch is a nonaccessions branch. Of the following criteria, requirements from paragraph (a)
through (d) will not be waived. Waiver authority is per paragraph (6). Officers selected for branch transfer must—
   (a) Possess a bachelor’s degree.
   (b) Complete a resident BOLC.
   (c) Complete a CCC.
   (d) Possess a current Secret security clearance in accordance with AR 380–67.
   (e) Hold the rank of captain or of first lieutenant selected for promotion to captain.
   (f) Meets medical standards per AR 40–501 and USAJFKSWCS policy.
   (g) Officers being assigned to paid parachutist positions are required to be airborne qualified.
   (h) Must be in an AGR status.
   (i) Complete regional studies, branch technical, and CULEX portions of the AC version of the CAQC.
   (5) Desired qualifications. Because of the regional orientation of U.S. Army CA units, a foreign-language skill, and
regional or cultural expertise is highly desirable. Officers should have an aptitude for learning a foreign language and
strive to sustain foreign-language proficiency throughout their careers.
   (6) Waiver authority. The CG, USAJFKSWCS is the proponent for all CA forces and the final authority for award
of branch, course prerequisites, as well as CA qualification and branch-transfer requirements. All requests for excep-
tions to policy should be routed through the chain of command and addressed to the CG, USAJFKSWCS
(AOJK–CDI–CA), Fort Bragg, NC 28310. Email requests to swcscapersonnel@ahqb.soc.mil.
   c. Officer management.
   (1) Career life-cycle development overview. CA officers will command CA units at levels of increasing responsibili-
ty. Majors will command companies. Lieutenant colonels will command battalions. Colonels will command brigades.
CA officer development continues throughout their career life-cycle with progressive assignments in troop unit, staff,
and interagency and institutional training assignments. In addition, officers complete their PME requirements to remain
competitive for HQDA selection boards and professional growth. Self-development is essential for all CA officers. The
uniqueness of the branch requires officers to sustain and enhance regional expertise and a foreign-language capability
through self-development. The development goal is to access CA officers at the tactical level and grow them into CA
joint planners and advisors at the strategic level in support of combatant commanders and interagency partners.
Officers seeking to become the best qualified should aggressively seek operational assignments of increasing responsi-
bility and complexity. Due to the employment of AGR officers in training and administrative roles, commanders must
afford junior AGR officers the opportunity to serve as CA team leaders, either through training exercises or operational
deployments.
   (2) Opportunities for female Soldiers. All branch 38-coded positions in the USAR are open to women, including all
positions in CA units and command positions, per AR 600–13.
   (3) Assignment and schooling requirements. To be considered the best-qualified officers in the branch at each grade,
CA officers must complete their operational assignments and schooling. By meeting these requirements, the officer
acquires the skills and knowledge to remain proficient in the CA Branch at his grade and becomes the best-qualified
candidate for promotion in the branch. Officers are strongly encouraged to attain exceptional qualification requirements
in the CA Branch at each grade. Meeting exceptionally qualified requirements will increase the officer’s probability of
being selected for promotion and will also improve the possibility of command selection for lieutenant colonel and
colonel grades. Officers at all grades must recognize, however, the importance of performance in all assignments.
   (4) Key developmental assignments. The following assignments for captains through colonels are recommended to
make the CA officer the best qualified in the CA Branch at each grade and exceptionally qualified for future
promotion.
   (a) Captain.
   1. Professional military education. Mandatory education during this phase is completion of a basic branch CCC.
The requirement is for captains to complete a CCC prior to attending the CAQC. USAR officers coordinate basic
branch CCC attendance through their appropriate career counselors.
   2. Assignments. AGR CA captain positions are extremely limited. Captains should successfully serve 36 months in
any combination of the 38A coded positions listed below, both KD and broadening.
   a. Key developmental assignments. The best qualified CA captains serve at least 24 months at a CA battalion as
either an operations officer (assistant S3) or plans officer. These positions provide the developmental opportunities
needed for future success. To better support the CA team, AGR officers should have experience as a CA team leader.
Battalion commanders should afford AGR captains opportunities to lead a CA team as part of their development in the
branch.
   b. Additional key developmental assignments. The following are considered additional developmental assignments
that captains may hold after a KD assignment:
202                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

—    Instructor at USAJFKSWCS.
—    CA training officer (1st CA/PO Training Brigade).
—    CA officer (1st CA/PO Training Brigade).
—    CA officer (361st CA Brigade).
—    CA officer (USACAPOC(A)).
—    CA officer (377th Theater Sustainment Command (TSC)).
   3. Self-development goals. In addition to professional development through operational assignments, CA captains
should begin an intensive military self-development program. Their efforts should focus on gaining an in-depth
understanding of combined arms, JIIM operations; improving and maintaining regional and linguistic expertise; and
becoming proficient in CA common core and branch tasks and in any civilian-acquired expertise. Suggested captains’
development courses are Ranger, Jumpmaster, Airborne, Civil Military Cooperation NATO courses, Reconstruction,
and Stabilization courses through the Foreign Service Institute at the U.S. Department of State, Federal Emergency
Management Agency courses, and the French Army Reserve Staff Officer Course.
   (b) Major.
   1. Professional military education. Officers must complete ILE Common Core and the SSDCO for consideration to
lieutenant colonel. SSDCO is required for all CA officers in addition to Army required PME. CA officers are
encouraged to completed ILE Common Core by their 3rd year of service as a major and complete SSDCO by their 4th
year as a major. SSDCO prepares officers for assignments to CACOMs, geographic combatant commands, and
interagency positions.
   2. Key assignments. Majors should successfully serve 12 months with a goal of 24 months in any of the positions
listed below or a combination of these positions:
   a. Key developmental assignments.
— Chief, headquarters element at a battalion (S3).
— CA company commander.
   b. Additional key developmental assignments. The following are considered additional KD assignments that the
best-qualified majors will hold after serving as a battalion S3 or CA company commander:
— Generating force assignment at USAJFKSWC.
— Geographic combatant commander assignment.
   c. Other preferred developmental assignments. These positions continue officer development while assigned to CA
units and complement the time spent in key major’s positions.
—    Operations officer at CA brigade.
—    Plans officer at CA brigade.
—    Assistant operations officer at CACOM.
—    CA officer at USACAPOC.
   3. Self-development goals. There is much greater emphasis on self-development at the field grade level, with the
focus on more general areas of knowledge rather than on specific tasks. Officers without a master’s degree should
consider enrolling in a civilian college or university and earning an advanced degree. CA majors should maintain and
enhance their language, regional and cultural expertise, develop their civilian-acquired expertise, and continue their
military self-development reading program. All officers must remain physically fit. Suggested officer development
courses are NATO courses, and JPME II.
   4. Suggested majors’ development course. Attendance at AMSP at the SAMS. The AMSP is 1 year of advanced
study for selected officers that have completed ILE. The AMSP provides a broad education in the art and science of
war at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. Any CA officer who graduates from SAMS who is key and
developmental qualified will serve in a CA-coded SAMS assignment. Any CA officer who is not key and developmen-
tal qualified will serve in a CA key and developmental assignment prior to fulfilling their SAMS utilization. Additional
professional development education opportunities include: the French Army Reserve Staff Officer Course, RC National
Security Course, Defense Strategy Course, and the Canadian Joint Command and Staff Programme.
   (c) Lieutenant colonel.
   1. Professional military education. Lieutenant colonels who want to remain competitive for subsequent promotion
should attend a SSC. All lieutenant colonels should strive to complete JPME II. Officers selected to command
battalions will attend the Army PCC.

— Battalion command. Command of a CA battalion (CSL). Service as a CA battalion commander develops the
     lieutenant colonel for future responsibilities as a CA brigade commander.
— Chief, headquarters element at a CA brigade (S3).
— Operations officer at a CACOM.
— Service at USACAPOC(A).
   b. Additional key developmental assignments. The following are considered additional KD assignments that the
best-qualified lieutenant colonels will hold after serving in a primary KD assignment:
—    Generating force assignment at USAJFKSWCS.
—    Service at the OCAR.
—    Service at the USARC.
—    Service on the Joint Staff.
—    Service in a geographic combatant commander assignment.
   3. Self-development goals. CA lieutenant colonels should maintain and enhance their language expertise and regional
knowledge and continue their military self-development professional readings and mastery of branch skills and civilian-
acquired skills. Complete a master’s degree in one of the CA disciplines; complete continuing education programs in
acquired civilian skills; and remain physically fit. Additional professional development education opportunities include:
the French Army Reserve Staff Officer Course, RC National Security Course, Defense Strategy Course, and the
Canadian Joint Command and Staff Programme.
   (d) Colonel.
   1. Professional military education. Completion of SSC.
   2. Assignments. CA colonels continue to serve the branch and the USAR and the Army through service in any CA-
coded colonel position or combination of positions within U.S. Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command
(USACAPOC[A]), USAJFKSWCS, geographic combatant commands, Joint Staff, Secretary of Defense, and US-
SOCOM. KD assignments include:

   c. Deputy commander at a CACOM.
   d. ACoS, G–3/5/7 at USACAPOC(A).
   e. Deputy commandant at USAJFKSWCS.
   f. Service on the Joint Staff.
   g. Assistant for CA policy (Secretary of Defense).
   h. Service in a geographic combatant command assignment.
   i. USAR advisor at USSOCOM.
   3. Self-development goals. Colonels should further enhance their negotiation and military diplomacy techniques
language and regional orientation and continue their professional readings and mastery of branch and civilian skills;
especially as they relate to joint, interagency and multinational context; complete a master’s degree in one of the CA
disciplines; complete continuing education programs in acquired civilian skills. Additional professional development
education opportunities include: the RC National Security Course, the Canadian Joint Command and Staff Programme
and the Senior Managers Course in National Security.
   d. Assignment preferences and precedence.
   (1) Preferences. Assignments in the USAR will be in accordance with AR 140–10.
   (2) Precedence. Positional assignment occurs at the unit level. Assignment of officers to KD leadership positions
has precedence over other assignments; however, there is flexibility on assignment sequence. Ideally, CA branch
officers should seek assignments in the following order at each grade plate:
   (a) Completion of required PME.
   (b) Command or other KD billet.
   (c) Nominative, broadening, or developmental billets.
   (d) Service in assignments at joint theater staffs, HQDA, OCAR, and OSD are important to the Army and essential
to individual officer’s advancement to senior leadership positions.
   e. Duration of developmental officer life-cycle assignments. Figure 18–7 displays the CA branch life-cycle with KD
positions.

                                        Figure 18–7. AGR Civil Affairs life-cycle model
18–5. Army National Guard Civil Affairs officer management
The vast majority of positions for RC officers exist in USAR TPU. The ARNG possesses CA positions as BCT or SF
Group S–9. Using these positions as an RC CA officer offers broadening opportunities. The lack of density in these
positions precludes a successful career model in just the National Guard. Policies must permit officers to transition
between components to provide a feasible career model.
18–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for CA branch officers. The numbers of CA authorized billets
must be created at each pay grade to provide the opportunity for adequate career progression for CA officers. The
proponent will work with Army to ensure availability of appropriate authorizations and a healthy number of CSL, KD,
and Joint requirements to support the Army and branch developmental goals.
18–7. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for Civil Affairs
   a. Structure. A MOCS proposal has been submitted to DADCS, G–1 to establish the 38G (Military Government)
AOC.
   (1) Description of duties. The Military Government officer must possess expertise in civilian core competencies,
represented by a CA related SI, that support one of the functional specialty skills related to systems or organizations of
public health and welfare, public safety, public administration, public works/infrastructure, economics and commerce,
and public education and information. They are expected to understand how to utilize their civilian core competencies
to assist in the accomplishment of the core CA tasks: populace and resources control, foreign humanitarian assistance,
civil information management, support to civil administration, and nation assistance in all operational environments.
There are four levels of expertise denoted by professional development proficiency codes which are used to distinguish
the levels of competencies. They are granted based on civilian credentials, education, and experience. Military
Government officers serve in CA units based on their professional development proficiency codes at the company,
battalion, brigade, and command levels. Military Government officers enable the force to assess, monitor, protect,
reinforce, establish, and transition political, economic, social, and cultural institutions and capabilities to achieve U.S.
national goals and objectives. The professional development proficiency codes codes are—

   b. Acquire. Annual recruit goals for AC and RC officers will be established to sustain force manning and balance
cohort year groups. Priority will be given to accessing officers at the appropriate career point to establish a viable CA
career path.
   c. Distribute. Under OPMS, CA officers will only serve in CA and branch immaterial positions. Only CA officers
are authorized to fill CA positions and to command CA units. The CA Assignments Branch, Operations Division at
HRC and Officer Personnel Management Directorate manage AA and AGR CA officer assignments. USAR CA officer
TPU assignments are coordinated with ACRD/USACAPOC(A). Distribution priorities will be per official manning
guidance.
   d. Development. The USAJFKSWCS CA Qualification Course is the only branch-producing course for all Army CA
officers. USAJFKSWCS is working to normalize branch qualification standards for CA officers of all components. AA
officers will be required to attain and maintain language proficiency at the 1/1/1 level. Officer development will
continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in TOE units with troops, staff/TDA
assignments, and institutional training assignments. Self-development will continue to be an essential component of
officer development.
   e. Deployment. CA officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide
on short notice. All CA officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full range of military operations.
CA officers may deploy with their units. CA officers and enlisted Soldiers may be deployed as individuals to support
operations in all environments. CA branch officers must prepare themselves and their families for this most challenging
career development function.

   f. Transition. The separation process is the same as for all Army officers.
Chapter 19
Information Operations Functional Area
19–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose of information operations.
   (1) The Secretary of Defense and JP 1–02 defines Information Operations as the integrated employment, during
military operations, of information-related capabilities in concert with other lines of operation to influence, disrupt,
corrupt, or usurp the decision-making of adversaries and potential adversaries while protecting our own. This definition
leads to a reassessment of how essential the information environment is to unified land operations and how informa-
tion-related capabilities can be effectively integrated into joint operations to create effects that help achieve the joint
force commander’s objectives. The Army supports joint Information Operations through the execution of the mission
command staff tasks of inform and influence activities and cyber electromagnetic activities and the integration of
information-related capabilities. An FA 30 officer may also be called upon to fulfill the role of a joint Information
Operations officer in a joint environment.
   (2) ADP 3–0 states the mission command warfighting function includes two staff tasks: to conduct inform and
influence activities and to conduct cyber electromagnetic activities, as well as the additional tasks of conducting
military deception and information protection. ADRP 3–0 defines the cognitive aspect of Information Operations as
inform and influence activities. Inform and influence activities is the integration of designated information-related
capabilities in order to synchronize themes, messages, and actions with operations to inform U.S. and global audiences,
influence foreign audiences, and affect adversary and enemy decision-making. The technical aspect is facilitated by
cyber electromagnetic activities, which when required, are integrated with inform and influence activities. Unified land
operations require commanders to consider what will affect their operational environment. Commanders lead inform
and influence activities while considering the following: combat power, mission command, network enabled system,
themes, information management, knowledge management, legal considerations, and intelligence support. Inform and
influence activities is an integration process that assists commanders with coordinating and synchronizing the use of all
information-related capabilities available to them and requesting the support of external information-related capabilities,
while taking account of the above considerations into the operations plan. FM 3–13 contains detailed information about
inform and influence activities.
   (3) An FA 30 officer’s role is to serve as the commander’s coordinating staff officer for the planning and
synchronization of information-related capabilities. The FA 30 officer is the information environment subject matter
expert and the primary advisor to the commander when operational activity and its direct or indirect message or
perception could influence the information environment. The commander addresses the global audiences in each area of
operation through mission command and inform and influence activities, while acknowledging the social aspects and
dynamics of the information environment in an area of operation.
   (4) Activities occurring within, through, or by means of the information environment have a consequential affect on
the operational environment and as a result impact military operations and outcomes. Therefore, it is important that
commanders and staffs understand their operational environment as well as its information environment. The FA 30
officer is the subject matter expert on the information environment and its three dimensions-the physical, informational,
and cognitive.
   (5) Information-related capabilities are capabilities, techniques, or activities employing information, in order to
affect any of the three dimensions within the information environment to generate an end(s). Public affairs, military
information support operations, combat camera, Soldier and leader engagement, CA operations, human terrain system,
operations security, and military deception are designated information-related capabilities. Additionally, the commander
can designate other capabilities which include but are not limited to cyber electromagnetic activities, special technical
operations, presence, posture and profile, physical attack, and physical security.
   (6) The FA 30 officer’s primary responsibilities include:
   (a) Integrating, coordinating, and synchronizing all information-related capabilities being executed as part of the
commander’s inform and influence activities efforts.
   (b) Developing and maintaining the combined information overlay.
   (c) Developing measures of effectiveness and performance for each plan.
   (d) Continuously assessing measures of effectiveness and performance against the intended plan.
   (e) Providing information requirements for the information collection plan.
   (f) Advising the commander on how subordinate commanders can help shape an operational environment.
   (g) Developing and maintaining the combined information overlay.
   (7) FA 30 officers serve mostly in Army echelons and serve as the unit’s G–7 (S–7) or in those staff sections.
   b. Proponent information.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             207

   (1) FA 30 resides within the standard requirements code of operations.
   (2) The CG, Combined Arms Center, is the Army proponent for Information Operations and the FA 30. The
Combined Arms Center CG’s action agency is the Information Operations Proponent Office, located at 950 Bluntville
Avenue, Building 391, Fort Leavenworth, KS 66027–2100. The personnel proponent phone number is 913–684–5318
(DSN 552).
   c. Functions performed by the FA 30.
   (1) Though FA 30 officers are assigned elsewhere in the force, they serve primarily as the G7 (S7) on staffs at BCT
through ASCC.
   (2) Features of work in FA 30 include:
   (a) Understanding the information environment as it affects the operational environment and its implications on the
unit’s assigned mission.
   (b) Translating strategic communication guidance from higher into operational and tactical activity.
   (c) Integrating the information-related capabilities and resources at the disposal of the command, both military and
nonmilitary, required to implement the commander’s guidance.
19–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders in the 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army
Values and the Warrior Ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the
spectrum of conflict. They must be able to operate in JIIM environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in
achieving their objectives. Our officers must be culturally astute and able to use their awareness and understanding to
conduct operations innovatively and courageously to exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the
operational environment. Further explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in ADP 3–0 and in chapter 3 of
this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of an FA 30 officer.
   (1) Remain up-to-date on Army organizations, structure, and doctrine.
   (2) Be familiar with all information-related capabilities and resources.
   (3) Possess the necessary tactical and operational expertise to advise the commander and staff on the benefits of
inform and influence activities.
   (4) Possess an undergraduate degree, in one the following or closely related fields of study:
   (a) Advertising.
   (b) Cultural Anthropology.
   (c) Area Studies.
   (d) Broadcasting.
   (e) Mass Communications.
   (f) Political Science.
   (g) History (non-American).
   (h) International Relations.
   (i) Journalism.
   (j) Marketing.
   (k) Psychology.
   (l) Sociology.
   (m) Public Diplomacy.
   (n) Civil Governance.
   (o) Public Administration/Management.
   (5) Possess the potential for advanced civil schooling, Training With Industry, and training with Government

guished military graduate from commissioning source, undergraduate grade point average above 3.25, military aca-
demic reports in the top 20 percent, graduating as honor graduate from the FA 30 Qualification Course (QC) or
qualifying graduate record examination scores.
   (6) Understand cultural and/or social anthropology, cross-cultural communications, media and information network
dissemination and gain the required cultural acuity necessary to advise commanders, staffs and units about the area in
which the unit is operating. Officers that have been immersed in a different culture (college junior year abroad, church
mission, family situation, and so forth) may possess this understanding.
   (7) Have experience in operational assignments, preferably command at company level and staff experience in plans
or operations.
   (8) Have completed the CCC.
208                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (9) Exhibit capacity and capability to understand, articulate, and apply complex concepts as well as properly frame
and solve ambiguous problems.
   c. Unique attributes of an FA 30 officer. FA 30 officers are 21st Century warriors who possess the highest standards
of discretion, integrity, and professional ethics. In addition, they are:
   (1) Adaptive leaders, strategic thinkers.
   (2) Creative problem solvers.
   (3) Expert communicators.
   (4) Masterful negotiators, mediators, and arbitrators.
   (5) Creators of exploitable opportunities.
   (6) Ultimate team players.
   d. Security clearance requirements. FA 30 officers must have a secret clearance and be able to obtain and maintain
a top secret/sensitive compartmented information clearance as determined by the position they hold. FA 30 officers
must immediately initiate procedures to obtain the proper level of clearance upon notification of the FA 30 functional
designation.
19–3. Officer development
   a. Officer development model. The officer development model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a Warrior Ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation allows officers both specific and broad functional competencies.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation, the officer should strive for training and
assignments that will broaden and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These broadening
opportunities are multinational in nature.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force—regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (6) Flexible timelines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   b. Lieutenant. FA 30 has no authorized/assigned lieutenants.
   c. Captain. Captains who are designated as an FA 30 officer and successfully complete the FA 30 QC, are
competitive for promotion to major. FA 30 assignments for captains are developmental assignments which are required
for promotion to major. This provides a timeline after accession into the FA that supports the attendance at the FA 30
QC and the completion of a FA 30 follow-on assignment before the major selection board. Developmental assignments
for captains include: serving on division staff, corps, or a DRU.
   d. Major. FA 30 majors serve as BCT S–7 officer or in staff organizations at division, corps, ASCC or a DRU.
These assignments ensure that FA 30 officers further develop their knowledge and understanding of the operational
force. FA 30 officers have three avenues to become MEL 4 certified.
   (1) Complete the FA 30 QC and complete the distance learning requirements for ILE online.
   (2) Complete FA 30 QC and attend an ILE Common Core at a satellite location.
   (3) Complete the FA 30 QC and attend the resident ILE and Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course at the
Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. FA 30 majors will be able to compete to attend the
SAMS, Training With Industry, an Advanced Civilian Schooling Program, Naval Postgraduate School or other
initiatives. Majors that successfully complete the FA 30 QC and ILE and have served 24 months cumulative service in
an FA 30 assignment are competitive for promotion to lieutenant colonel. Majors that graduate from SAMS must serve
a SAMS utilization tour and at least 12 months in a FA 30 assignment to be competitive for promotion to lieutenant
colonel. Majors that graduate Naval Postgraduate School must serve one joint utilization tour and at least 12 months in
a FA 30 assignment to remain competitive for promotion to lieutenant colonel. In accordance with the CSA’s guidance,
assignments with transition teams/provincial reconstruction teams are considered KD assignments. Majors that serve on
these teams should also seek to serve at least 12 months in a FA 30 assignment in order to be considered competitive
for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
   e. Lieutenant colonel. FA 30 lieutenant colonels serve as DCS, G–3/5/7 primary staff officers at Army division
headquarters or on the staff at corps, ASCC, Army or a DRU. Lieutenant colonels will have the opportunity to compete
for command of 1st Battalion, 1st Information Operations Command. With additional training, they may serve on a
joint or combatant command staff. Lieutenant colonels that successful complete the FA 30 QC and ILE, and have
served 48 months cumulative service in an FA 30 assignment are competitive for promotion to colonel.
   f. Colonel. FA 30 colonels serve as DCS, G–3/5/7 primary staff officers at Army Corps and ASCC headquarters and
on the staff at Army or a DRU. FA 30 colonels may compete to command 1st Information Operations Command.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                          209

Additionally, and with additional training, they may serve on a joint or combatant command staff. If not selected for
resident SSC, FA 30 colonels should apply for the nonresident U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course.
   g. Overview of FA 30 officer development. Captains interested in becoming FA 30 officers may submit a VTIP
application through HRC. Majors with less than 14 years of active Federal commissioned service may request a
transfer into FA 30 through HRC. Captains, majors, and lieutenant colonels are functional area designated into FA 30
through an Army VTIP Panel. The FA 30 career manager at HRC reviews VTIP applications in order to identify and
gain officers who meet the criteria and possess the required skills and experience to serve as FA 30 officer.
   h. FA 30 qualification and development. FA 30 officers will receive initial training and education before they begin
a FA 30 assignment. After selection into FA 30, officers will attend the 12-week FA 30 Qualification Course (QC) at
Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The FA 30 QC is the sole credentialing course for FA 30 designated officers. The FA 30
QC develops FA 30 officers with the requisite competencies to serve successfully on staffs at the BCT through ASCC
level. FA 30 officer participation in other Army educational opportunities is based on Army needs. A limited number
of officers will be selected for fully funded Advanced Civilian Schooling or Training With Industry Programs.
Although it is not required for promotion consideration, a graduate degree should be a goal of every FA 30 officer.
   i. Command opportunities and key billets.
   (1) There are two command opportunities for FA 30 officers: Commander, 1st Battalion, 1st Information Operations
Command at the rank/grade of lieutenant colonel/O5, and Commander, 1st Information Operations Command at the
rank/grade of colonel/O6.
   (2) There are several key billet opportunities for FA 30 Corps-level officers for DCS, G–3/5/7 (colonel/O6) and
division-level DCS, G–3/5/7 (lieutenant colonel/O5) positions.
   j. Nominative assignments. FA 30 officers have several opportunities to serve in nominative assignments including:
OSD, Army Staff, joint assignments, SMUs and NATO.
   k. Joint assignments. Joint FA 30 positions are on the Joint duty assignment list. Officers assigned to those billets
will receive the joint duty assignments after selection to major. FA 30 officers assigned to a Joint, Combatant
Command, or other non-Army headquarters will most likely serve in the J39 section.
   l. Branch functional area generalist assignments. Captains and above can serve in branch/FA generalist assignments
such as ROTC, USMA faculty and staff, and Inspector General. Although not associated with a specific branch or FA,
these assignments are important to the Army.
   m. Assignment preferences and precedence. The assignment sequencing in a FA is not as rigid as that of a branch.
FA assignments should professionally develop FA 30 officers in a variety of environments such as developmental
positions at the division and corps level with follow-on KD assignments. After receiving their initial training, FA 30
officers should seek different types of responsibilities within the FA 30 force structure to provide breadth to their
experiences and professional development. Normally, FA 30 officers will complete at least one operational assignment
in a FA 30 coded position before ILE attendance.
   (1) Preferences. The FA 30 career development path provides for many diverse opportunities. The objective of these
opportunities is to develop FA 30 officers with the ability to help commanders and staffs achieve the full potential of
Information Operations at increasing levels of responsibility in both Army and joint assignments. Officers will attend
the FA 30 QC prior to their initial assignment to a FA 30 position.
   (2) Precedence. Assignments to FA 30 positions deployed in support of ongoing operations will have precedence
during this era of persistent conflict. FA 30 officers will complete at least one developmental Army FA 30 assignment
before a joint assignment. Typically, FA 30 officers should seek the following assignments: BCT S–7; field support
team chief; division-level officer for DCS, G–3/5/7; commander, 1st Battalion, 1st Information Operations Command;
commander, 1st Information Operations Command; corps-level officer for DCS, G–3/5/7; director, information opera-
tions proponent; and chief, DAMO–ODI.
   n. Duration of critical officer life-cycle assignments. Most assignments for FA 30 officers will be 24 to 36 months
in length. Tours may be longer in areas with a high concentration of billets, such as the national capital region.
Locations OCONUS will continue to require specific tour lengths. There is no single position that fully qualifies an FA
30 officer. Figure 19–1 depicts an Information Operations FA life-cycle development model for an AA officer.
   o. Requirements, authorizations and inventory. FA 30 officers are personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. The FA 30 career progression goal is to maintain a viable career path for FA 30 officers. To
meet this goal, the field grade inventory is prioritized to fill FA 30 authorizations for the current and future force
requirements. FA 30 officers are provided sufficient time in assignments to fully qualify them before consideration for
promotion.
   (1) Acquire. The criteria for selecting an officer into FA 30 include the needs of the Army and United States Army
Information Operations Proponent Office, type of civilian degree and grade point average, duty performance, and
personal preference. Officers wanting to become FA 30s must submit a VTIP application based on Army military
personnel messaging system. Officers may begin applying after 4 years of Federal commissioned service.
   (2) Distribute. The FA 30 career manager at HRC manages FA 30 officers from their functional designation through
the rank of lieutenant colonel. Once selected for colonel, the senior leadership division gains control over the FA 30
210                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

officer’s career path and assignments. Assignments will depend upon the needs of the Army, professional development
considerations, officer qualifications, and officer preference.
   (3) Deploy. Whether assigned to TOE or TDA organizations, all FA 30 officers must be deployable to accomplish
missions across unified land operations. FA 30 officers may deploy with their units or as individual support to various
worldwide operations.
   (4) Sustain. FA 30 officers will compete within the functional category of operations, for promotion to major,
lieutenant colonel, and colonel.
   (5) Develop. FA 30 incorporates a professional officer development plan offering maximum diversity for assignment
and schooling. FA 30 officers apply and develop their skills through a series of progressively challenging assignments.
As FA 30 officers progress through their careers, they become eligible for additional educational training, preparing
them for positions of increased responsibility.
   (6) Train. The FA 30 officers attend the FA 30 QC, ILE, both the Common Core Course and the Advanced
Operations and Warfighting Course at the Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, KS, or at a satellite
location. The FA 30 officers are MEL 4 ILE and JPME 1 qualified after successfully completing the FA 30 QC and
ILE Common Core Course.
   (7) Separate. The FA 30 officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
                                       Figure 19–1. FA 30 officer career development
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           211

19–4. Warrant officer development
FA 30 has no authorized/assigned warrant officers.
19–5. Reserve Component information operations officers
   a. General career development. RC FA 30 officer development objectives and qualifications parallel those planned
for their AC counterparts. Officers must develop a strong foundation through assignments in their basic branches
before specializing in FA 30 assignments.
   b. FA qualification and development opportunities. RC officers should strive for FA 30 assignments that yield the
same development opportunities as their AC counterparts. RC officers retain their basic branch with a SI for FA 30,
since they do not FA designate into FA 30 through an HRC FA designation board.
   (1) The qualification standards at each rank, PME and length of service in FA 30 assignments are the same as for
AC officers.
   (2) RC officers with FA 30 SIs can expect to serve in a theater Information Operations group, TPU, as an IMA, or
in an IRR assignment. These varying assignments bolster Total Army FA 30 capabilities, develop officer leadership
skills, and increase the individual’s knowledge of the RC roles and mission.
   (3) RC officers with civilian-acquired skills in communications, marketing, organizational behavior, or other related
fields are a valuable Army resource. Officers with skills in these areas through employment or civilian education will
be competitive for promotion.
   (4) The nonresident FA 30 QC is the credentialing course for RC officers designated to serve as FA 30 officers.
Part Three
Operations Support
Chapter 20
Signal Corps Branch
20–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose of the Signal Corps branch. Signal Corps (BR 25) is a branch within the operational support functional
category. Signal officers command and lead units that provide, operate, and defend the Army’s portion of the
cyberspace domain (the LandWarNet) consisting of telecommunications and computer networks, information services
(to include visual information), and the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) at all levels, from sustaining military bases to
global strategic communication facilities to forward deployed fighting forces in support of unified land operations.
Signal officers conduct or support operations that plan, integrate, synchronize, coordinate, and/or direct activities that
ensure freedom of action in and through cyberspace and EMS. Signal warrant officers provide in-depth technical
expertise and leadership to operations in cyberspace that ensure network and information system availability, informa-
tion protection, and information delivery.
   b. Proponent information. CG, U.S. Army Signal Center of Excellence, Fort Gordon, GA. Further information can
be obtained through http://www.gordon.army.mil and by emailing usarmy.gordon.sigcoe.mbx.sigcoocosod@mailbox.
mil. The U.S. Army Signal Center of Excellence is also the proponent for FA 24 Telecommunications Systems
Engineer and FA 53 Information System Management which are aligned with BR 25 and the Signal Regiment.
   c. Functions. Signal branch and warrant officers are responsible for the Army’s communication and information
systems and serve as Joint command, control, communications, and computers systems integrators. It is the Signal
Corps’ responsibility to—
   (1) Provide and manage the communications and information systems support that connect the force across a
multitude of battlefield platforms and mission areas.
   (2) Encompass all aspects of planning, designing, installing, operating, maintaining, managing and securing and
defending information networks to include communications links, computers, and other components of local and wide
area networks.
   (3) Integrate user owned and operated systems into the networks.
   (4) Plan, install, operate, maintain, and secure and defend voice and data communications networks that employ
single and multichannel satellite (space-based), tropospheric scatter, terrestrial microwave, switching, messaging, video-
teleconferencing, visual information, and other related systems.
   (5) Integrate tactical, strategic and sustaining base communications, information processing and management sys-
tems into a seamless global information grid that provides mission command systems integration for Army, joint and
coalition operations.
212                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (6) Provide a myriad of state-of-the-art, real-time voice, and data tactical information systems to provide information
services to all elements on the battlefield and reach-back to the sustaining military base.
   (7) Be responsible for the Army’s portion of the Defense Information System Network and its interface with tactical
signal elements at theater and corps.
   (8) Together with its Air Force and Navy counterparts, the Signal Corps manages and directs the Joint operation of
the global information grid serving the DOD and the National Command Authority. At all levels, the Signal Corps
provides communications and information systems and networks to support the nation’s forces across the entire
operational spectrum.
20–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army Values
and the Warrior Ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the spectrum of
conflict. They must be able to operate in JIIM environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving
their objectives. Our officers must be culturally astute and able to use their awareness and understanding to conduct
operations innovatively and courageously to exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the operational
environment. Further explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this
publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of a Signal officer. The BR 25 Signal officer orchestrates the operations of the
warrant officers, enlisted Soldiers, and FA officers to accomplish the core competencies of the Signal Regiment. Those
core competencies are network operations (NetOps), network transport and information services, spectrum management
operations, and visual information (VI) operations. These competencies support the Chief Information Officer/G–6
(CIO/G–6) focus areas of knowledge management, cyberspace operations and enable mission command. BR 25 officers
must also know and understand the DOD cyberspace operations construct to include DOD information networks,
defensive cyberspace operations, and offensive cyberspace operations (OCO) BR 25 officers must also possess expert
knowledge of Army, joint, combined, and coalition signal support and coordination principles. This knowledge
includes practical experience in tactics, combined arms operations, and the employment of direct and indirect fire
weapon systems. Signal officers require technical proficiency with branch and mission-unique equipment, tools and
systems. Proper balance between these technical skills and the ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactical
skills to include military decision-making skills, troop to task assignments and TACSOP development is critical for
mission success. Signal officers are grounded in troop-leading skills as well as managerial and technical skills. Signal
officers must aggressively pursue knowledge about existing and future information systems and technology. Addition-
ally, all Signal officers should strive both on and off-duty to learn as much as possible about technology management,
telecommunications, automation, and the global information infrastructure. Signal officers are encouraged to obtain
additional degrees in an IT related discipline.
20–3. Signal Branch officer development
   a. Officer development model. The officer developmental model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a Warrior Ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Officers can compete in the VTIP once first lieutenant (P) or captain and may be selected for designation in a
FA. Non-Signal officers may apply for transfer to Signal through the VTIP as well.
   (4) Senior captain and field grade officers should strive for training and assignments that will broaden and develop
the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. Broadening opportunities are often outside normal branch or FA
assignments, and are often JIIM in nature.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force—regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (6) Flexible timelines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   b. Lieutenant development.
   (1) Education. All Signal lieutenants must complete the BOLC B which provides the tactical and technical signal
training.
   (2) Assignments for lieutenants are normally at company level to gain troop-leading experience and to enhance

20–5. Signal Corps Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. The ARNG and USAR Signal Corps officers serve the same role and mission as
their AA counterparts. The unique nature of the RC Soldier’s role as a “citizen Soldier” poses a significant challenge
for professional development. To fulfill its wartime mission of planning, installing, administering, managing, maintain-
ing, operating, integrating and securing the Army’s strategic, operational and tactical communications infrastructure
and voice and data information systems, services and resources, the Signal Corps is dependent upon extensive
interaction between the AC and the RC, maintaining skills through civilian education, industry organizations and
certifications, and online collaboration tools.
   (1) Geographic dispersion of units may constrain RC career progression within a specific MOS or branch. To meet
professional development objectives, RC Signal officers must possess a willingness to rotate between assignments with
TPUs, ARNG organizations, the IRR, and IMA positions. Often there are insufficient numbers of positions in a
geographic area to continue in Signal assignments. If geographic constraints are such that the assignment to a BR 25
Signal officer position is not possible, officers should seek temporary assignment to branch immaterial position or
pursue assignments in a FA related to Signal such as FA 53 and FA 24, see appropriate chapters for more information.
   (2) Both TOE and TDA organizations host RC Signal officer assignments. Their duties and responsibilities are
fundamentally the same as their AC counterparts except for those personnel management, administrative and opera-
tional requirements unique to the ARNG and USAR. All RC Signal assignments are open to male and female officers.
   (3) USAR officers should seek the advice of the Signal Army Reserve proponent advisor for more information on
current authorizations, schooling, and career development. ARNG officers are advised to contact their respective state
senior signal officer (J–6) and personnel management office. Another source of information is the Reserve Component
Affairs Office (RCAO) Deputy Assistance Commandants for USAR and ARNG affairs located at Fort Gordon.
   b. Officer development. For basic guidance on RC officer development see chapter 7. Unique Signal officer
information is detailed below. All Signal officers are encouraged to actively participate in professional communication
organizations, online sustainment training, collaboration with peers, civilian education and to continue with lifelong
learning to stay relevant in the communications field.
224                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (1) Lieutenant. Newly accessed officers must attend the BOLC B for technical training in the Army’s communica-
tion field prior to promotion to first lieutenant.
   (2) Captain. For consideration for promotion to major, a Signal captain must successfully complete all four phases
of the SCCC–RC. Officers must complete SCCC–RC for competitive career progression (see chap 7). Officers are
encouraged to pursue a branch-related graduate degree or industry certification programs. Captains should serve 24
months in a Signal KD position.
   (3) Major. The primary professional development objective of a Signal Corps major in the RC is to continue to
strengthen IT skills. During this phase, officers must enroll in ILE. Officers must complete ILE Common Core for
consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel. Officers are highly encouraged to complete a branch-related graduate
degree or related industry certifications during these years. Majors should serve a minimum of 24 months in a KD
position.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels can expect assignments to senior staff positions in a variety of both
branch-related and branch/FA generalist positions in units, training centers and headquarters elements. Officers should
seek PME at the SSC level. Lieutenant colonels are eligible for selection to the rank of colonel upon completion of the
requisite service requirements listed in chapter 7 of this pamphlet. Officers remain eligible for promotion as long as
they continue to serve in an active status and meet selection criteria. Lieutenant colonels should strive to complete an
aggregate of 24 months in a KD position.
   (5) Colonel. The primary objective for officers during this phase is maximum use of the officer’s technical and
tactical capabilities, managerial skills, and executive skills in positions of higher responsibility. Colonels should strive
to complete an aggregate of 24 months in a signal operations or operational support position.
   c. Branch transfer. Officers may join the Signal Corps at anytime during their career prior to colonel. For captains
through lieutenant colonel who have completed another CCC they only need to complete phases 1 and 2 of the
SCCC–RC and serve 12–24 months in a KD assignment. All others should contact the BR 25 proponent manager in
the Office, Chief of Signal for more information.

Telecommunications Systems Engineering FA
21–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. Telecommunications Systems Engineering (FA 24) is a FA of the Signal Regiment within the opera-
tional support functional category. Telecommunications networks form the interconnectivity and backbone of the IT
infrastructures that comprise cyberspace and enable cyberspace operations. Telecommunications systems engineering
officers are essential to providing and defending the Army’s portion of cyberspace (LandWarNet) in support of unified
land operations. FA 24 provides the Army with a corps of highly skilled network engineering and defense profes-
sionals, who plan, engineer, test, integrate, and validate the installation, operation, maintenance and protection of Army
cyberspace network infrastructure systems and networks using existing and future military and commercial information
technologies. The FA 24 officer’s efforts result in highly reliable communications supporting the Army, JIIM opera-
tions worldwide. The FA 24 officer has primary responsibility for the following services: network engineering, network
assessment, network validation, network security architecture, network integration, network management, technology
evaluation, project/program/contract management, and technical specifications. Telecommunication systems engineers
operate enterprise-wide together with Signal Operations (BR 25) officers, Information Systems Management (FA 53)
officers, Signal warrant officers, Signal Soldiers, and within the cyberspace operations community (for example,
Intelligence Community, Information Operations, EW, fires and effects, and so forth) to provide the communications
networks and information services necessary for unified land operations in an Army and JIIM environment.

   f. Prerequisites. Officers must possess an undergraduate or graduate degree in one of the following disciplines to be
accessed into AOC 24A: electrical engineering, telecommunications engineering, telecommunications management,
computer science, computer systems engineering, systems engineering, engineering, math, physics, or a related science,
technology, engineering, and math discipline
   g. Special qualifications. All Telecommunications Systems Engineering officers must qualify for and maintain a top
secret clearance with special compartmented information access. FA 24 officers should initiate procedures to obtain the
proper level of clearance immediately upon notification of the FA 24 functional designation.
   h. Regimental affiliation. The Signal Regiment is organized under the “whole branch” regimental concept in
accordance with AR 670–1. All FA 24 officers are strongly encouraged to re-affiliate with the Signal Regiment upon
graduation from the Telecommunication Systems Engineering Course and award of AOC 24A.
21–3. Officer development
   a. Officer development model. The officer development model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a Warrior Ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Lieutenant(P)s, captains, and majors who desire to transfer from another branch into FA 24 can apply through
the VTIP managed by HRC Leadership Development Division. VTIP is a branch-transfer request and is approved
based upon the needs of the Army, officer skills and experience, and preference. Officers may request VTIP prior to
being KD in their basic branch and prior to attending a CCC. Officers that have not yet attended a CCC will be
scheduled for Signal CCC in conjunction with the FA 24 course.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive for training and repetitive
assignments in AOC 24A that will broaden and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force—regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, and so forth.
   (6) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           229

   b. Captain development.
   (1) Education. Selected officers should attend FA qualification (FAQ) training and serve in an FA 24 utilization
assignment as soon as possible after FA 24 designation. FAQ training includes successful completion of the Informa-
tion Systems Operations Leveler (ISOL) course (ATRRS Course Number 7E–F70) and the Telecommunication
Systems Engineering Course (TSEC) (ATRRS Course Number 4C–24A) in sequence.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. FA 24 candidates should normally transfer from their basic branch to begin FA
qualification within 12 months of designation. All FA 24 positions are considered KD assignments. Officers should
strive to complete an aggregate of 24 to 36 months in KD assignments before they will be considered for more senior
captains’ broadening assignments. Typical KD assignments at captain include:
   (a) Network engineer in division/corps/ASCC/CIO/G–6.
   (b) System engineer in signal battalion/brigade or higher commands.
   (c) Communications-electronics staff officer at ACOM/ASCC/DRU/HQDA/DOD/joint activity/multinational staff

   (j) Cyberspace operations planning officer at a Service or Joint Cyberspace Command.
   (k) Systems manager at a Service or Joint Cyberspace Command.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Transferring from a basic branch into FA 24 is in itself a
broadening experience. FA 24 officers’ training, education and development focuses on telecommunications systems
engineering including repetitive and progressive assignments of increasing responsibility. Due to the technical nature
and need for early development in this FA, FA 24 captains normally will not serve in branch immaterial or other
assignments outside of the FA. Upon completion of the first developmental assignment, captains may be selected for
fully funded advanced civilian schooling or Training With Industry in an FA 24 related discipline. Graduates of either
program will incur a follow-on utilization assignment in an Army Educational Requirements System coded position.
The personnel proponent must approve Advanced Civilian Schooling and Training With Industry Programs. Additional
education opportunities include Air Force Institute of Technology Program, Army Cyber Scholarship, Information
Assurance Scholarship Program, and other education/fellowship opportunities.
   (4) Self-development. The FA 24 captains should pursue graduate-level education in an IT-related discipline and/or
obtain industry certifications related to networking, cyberspace policy, cyberspace systems engineering, cyberspace
operations, security systems engineering, information assurance, and other pertinent disciplines as the opportunity
presents itself. It is recommended that graduate degrees and certifications be in telecommunications management,
telecommunications systems engineering, or an IT-related field of study.
   (5) Desired experience. FA 24 captains should demonstrate competency in basic network engineering, assessment,
managing, and planning, as well as experience in conducting current network operations, to include dynamic network
defense and security. Assignments should enable captains to gain knowledge, skills, and abilities to accurately evaluate
technologies and prepare technical specification documents based on those evaluations. Desired experience at the rank
of captain is 12 to 24 months in at least one FA 24 developmental assignment in order to gain the necessary technical
skills and operational background.
   c. Major development.
   (1) Education. All FA 24 majors must successfully complete ILE. ILE for FA officers includes the ILE Common
Core and FA 24 TSEC qualifying course. If not previously qualified at captain, FA 24 majors must complete the FAQ
training requirement outlined in paragraph 21–3b(1).
   (2) Key developmental assignments. All FA 24 positions are considered KD assignments. Officers should strive to
complete an aggregate of 24 to 36 months in KD assignments before they will be considered for more senior major
broadening assignments. Typical KD assignments at major include:
   (a) Operations officer, Theater Network Operations Security Center or U.S. Army Cyber Center.
   (b) Network engineer/systems engineer/electrical engineer in division or corps CIO/G–6.
   (c) Systems engineer in Signal battalion/brigade/command.

   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. FA 24 majors’ training, education, and development should con-
tinue to focus on telecommunications systems engineering. Due to the technical nature of this FA, FA 24 majors
normally will not serve in branch immaterial or other assignments outside of the FA. Generally, FA 24 majors should
seek repetitive assignments as an FA 24, striving for a variety of experiences at different levels of operation. Majors
may be selected for fully funded advanced civilian schooling or Training With Industry in a telecommunication
systems engineering related discipline. Graduates of either program incur a follow-on utilization assignment in an
Army Educational Requirements System coded position. Some highly experienced FA 24 officers may compete for and
be selected to attend the SAMS at the U.S. Army and Combined Arms Center, Fort Leavenworth, KS. Successful
completion of SAMS and a 12 month utilization assignment as division/corps CIO/G–6 network engineer is equivalent
to 24 months KD time. FA 24 officers are encouraged to seek broadening opportunities that enhance the officer’s
understanding of the global network environment associated with JIIM assignments. Successful completion of JPME II
is encouraged.
   (4) Self-development. Majors should pursue continuing education programs to enhance their mastery of telecommu-
nications systems engineering to include JIIM operations. Self-development may include correspondence courses,
civilian education, and institutional training. Officers should devote time to a professional reading program in order to
broaden their tactical and technical knowledge. Due to the rapid changes in technology, majors are encouraged to join
professional organizations and subscribe to journals in order to stay current with industry trends and advancements.
Majors are also encouraged to conduct research and write articles for professional, military publications. FA 24 majors
should continue to pursue graduate-level education in IT-related disciplines and/or obtain industry certifications related
to networking, information assurance, computer network defense, and other pertinent disciplines as the opportunity
presents itself. These opportunities include pursuing the CIO Course or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
Course offered by the National Defense University, Information Resources Management College. For more informa-
tion, see http://www.ndu.edu/IRMC.
   (5) Desired experience. FA 24 majors should demonstrate competency and advanced skills in network engineering,
assessment, managing, and planning, as well as experience in conducting current network operations and defending/
securing networks. Field grade development should enable FA 24s to further hone knowledge, skills, and abilities in
the accurate evaluation of technologies and the preparation of technical specification documents based on these
evaluations. Successful completion of ILE and 24 to 36 months of experience in key development assignments of
increasing responsibility will prepare majors for service at lieutenant colonel.
   d. Lieutenant colonel development.
   (1) Education. There is no educational requirement. Successful completion of JPME II is desired.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. All FA 24 lieutenant colonel positions are considered KD assignments. Officers

   (o) Branch or division chief at a service or joint cyberspace command.
   (p) Action officer at ACOM/ASCC/DRU/HQDA/joint activity/multinational/DOD level.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assign. ments. Generally, FA 24 lieutenant colonels should continue to seek
repetitive assignments in FA 24 striving for a variety of experiences at different levels of operation and concentrating
their professional development in telecommunications systems engineering. At lieutenant colonel, selected FA 24
officers may serve broadening assignments in branch immaterial positions or in related cross-branch/FA positions
within the Network and Space Group. They may also obtain broadening experience through Training With Industry and
Army fellowships. Some FA 24 lieutenant colonels may be selected to participate in an IT-related PhD program. All
FA 24 officers are encouraged to seek broadening opportunities that enhance the officers understanding of the global
network environment associated with JIIM assignments to include achieving Joint Qualified Officer status.
   (4) Self-development. Completion of a master’s degree in an IT discipline and industry related certifications are
desired. Self-development may include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training. Due to the
rapid changes in technology, lieutenant colonels are encouraged to maintain membership in professional organizations
and subscribe to journals in order to stay current with industry trends and advancements. The FA 24 lieutenant colonels
should complete the CIO or CISO course offered by the National Defense University, Information Resources Manage-
ment College either in resident or nonresident attendance.
   (5) Desired experience. FA 24 lieutenant colonels should demonstrate a high degree and mastery of the telecommu-
nications systems engineering profession. FA 24 officers in the grade of lieutenant colonel serve as senior leaders and
managers throughout the Army providing technical engineering guidance, applying network integration experience,
emerging technology vision and overall Soldier mentorship mastered over many years in uniform as a network
engineer. It is expected that assignments of increasing responsibility will continue to enhance their leadership skills and
technical competencies in leading, managing and integrating enterprise-wide communications networks and information
services for the Army and JIIM organizations. Twenty four to 36 months of experience in assignments of increasing
responsibility will prepare lieutenant colonels for selection to colonel.
   e. Colonel development.
   (1) Education. FA 24 colonels should successfully complete SSC either resident or nonresident. Successful comple-
tion of JPME II is desired.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. All FA 24 colonel positions are considered KD assignments. Officers should
strive to complete an aggregate of 24 to 36 months in KD assignments before they will be considered for more senior
colonel broadening assignments. Typical KD assignments at colonel include:
   (a) Director/deputy director/division chief at ACOM/ASCC/DRU/HQDA/joint activity/multinational/DOD level.
   (b) Commander, Joint Spectrum Center.
   (c) Director, experimental division, U.S. Army Signal Center of Excellence (Fort Gordon).
   (d) TRADOC capabilities manager-networks and services.
   (e) Director, Army Global Network Operations and Security Center.
   (f) Executive assistant at ACOM/ASCC/DRU/HQDA/joint activity/multinational/DOD level.
   (g) Senior staff analyst at ACOM/ASCC/DRU/HQDA/joint activity/multinational/DOD level.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. FA 24 colonels should continue to serve primarily in FA 24
assignments striving to achieve a variety of engineering experiences in Army, joint and multinational organizations.
Selected officers may serve broadening assignments in branch immaterial positions or in related cross-branch/FA
positions within the network and space group. FA 24 officers are encouraged to seek joint education and duty
assignments to achieve Joint Qualified Officer status.
   (4) Self-development. All FA 24 colonels should continue to pursue continuing graduate-level education and industry
certifications. Officers also need to stay current on industry trends through trade associations and journals, and through
participation in DOD and industry sponsored forums focused on evolving IT issues and advances. Some candidates
may pursue completion of a PhD in an IT-related discipline.
   (5) Desired experience. As senior practitioners in FA 24, colonels constitute the elite of the telecommunications
systems engineering officer corps. Their years of accumulated training, education and progressive assignments consti-
tute a level of expertise that enables them to serve in executive-level leadership positions on ACOM/ASCC/DRU,
HQDA, joint and DOD staffs. The FA 24 colonels should strive for assignments that balance and round out their field
grade experience with a mix of tactical, operational, and strategic assignments. Selected officers may be assigned to
high performance FA 24 colonel positions as determined by the Chief of Staff of the Army. Successful completion of
SSC plus 24 to 36 months of FA 24 experience will prepare colonels for service at next higher grade. Field grade
assignments should include Army Staff, joint, and operational deployment experiences to be competitive for selection
to general officer.

21–4. Telecommunication Systems Engineering Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. The ARNG and USAR Telecommunication Systems Engineering officers serve the
same role and mission as their AC counterparts. The unique nature of the RC Soldier’s role as a “citizen Soldier” poses
a significant professional development challenge. To fulfill their wartime mission of planning, engineering and
managing the integration of diverse communication, information and visual information equipment and systems into
interoperable enterprise networks, FA 24 officers rely upon extensive interaction between the AC and the RC,
maintaining skills through civilian education, industry organizations and certifications, and online collaboration tools.
   b. FA qualification and development opportunities.
   (1) Geographic dispersion. The geographic dispersion of telecommunication systems engineering positions con-
strains RC career progression in FA 24. Few RC FA 24 officers will be afforded an opportunity to meet minimum
career progression goals of the AA. To meet professional development objectives, RC FA 24 officers should be willing
to rotate between assignments with USAR TPU organizations, ARNG units and IMA positions. Usually there will be
insufficient numbers of positions within a geographic area to continue in telecommunication systems engineering FA
assignments. If geographic constraints are such that assignment to an FA 24 position is not possible, officers should
seek assignment in their basic branch or in a related FA required in the geographic region.
   (2) Assignments. Telecommunication Systems Engineering officer assignments in the RC are split almost evenly
between TOE and TDA organizations. Their duties and responsibilities are fundamentally the same as their AC
counterparts except for those personnel management, administrative and operational requirements unique to the ARNG
and USAR. Officers may be assigned to the IRR when unable to accept a TPU or ARNG unit assignment. Officers in
the IRR may request assignment to a reinforcement training unit, an IMA position, a tour of active duty for special
work, annual training, or active duty for training. Officers in the IRR may meet PME requirements by requesting active
duty for training. All RC officers, major and below with less than 15 years of active Federal service, may request AGR
assignment.
   (3) Guidance. USAR officers should seek the advice of the senior personnel management advisor for more
information on current authorizations, schooling and career development. The ARNG officers are advised to contact
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           233

their respective state senior Signal officer (J–6) and personnel management office. Another source of information is the
Reserve Component Affairs Office (RCAO) Deputy Assistant Commandants for USAR and ARNG affairs located at
Fort Gordon. This office maintains a Web page on the AKO with current information and points of contact.
   c. Professional development. There are four phases of professional development for RC Telecommunication Systems
Engineering officers. The phases relate to military rank and include broadly based goals and career objectives at each
rank so that an officer may expand capabilities and optimize performance. Telecommunication Systems Engineering
life-cycle development objectives, RC requirements and an officer’s own strengths, priorities, civilian experience,
private and service provided education, and performance influence their professional development. Additionally, all FA
24 RC officers must qualify for and maintain a top secret clearance with special compartmented information access. FA
24 officers should initiate procedures to obtain the proper level of clearance immediately upon notification of the FA
24 functional designation.
   (1) Captain. The FA 24 RC officer candidates have the same prerequisites as the AC. They must have completed
their basic branch CCC prior to development in FA 24, preferably the SCCC. Initial FAQ requires successful
completion of the ISOL, (ATRRS Course Number 7E–F70) followed by the TSEC, ATRRS Course Number 4C–24A).
Attendance at the ISOL may be waived based on prior equivalent education/experience. Typical TOE positions include
communications-electronics engineer, systems engineer, and communications-electronics staff officer. Typical TDA
positions include Signal support officer, systems engineer and communications-electronics staff officer. Note: The CCC
is required for promotion to major.
   (2) Major. The primary professional development objective of a FA 24 major in the RC is to continue to strengthen
telecommunication systems engineering skills. During this phase, officers must complete ILE Common Core for
promotion to lieutenant colonel. FA 24 majors are highly encouraged to pursue a specialty-related graduate degree and
obtain a professional engineering license. Telecommunication Systems Engineering majors should serve a minimum of
24 months cumulative service in a Telecommunication Systems Engineering operations or operational support major
position.
   (3) Lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels can expect assignments to senior staff positions employing them in a
variety of diverse and challenging FA related positions. FA 24 officers should seek PME at the SSC level. Telecommu-
nication Systems Engineering RC lieutenant colonels are eligible for selection to the rank of colonel upon completion
of the requisite service requirements listed in chapter 7 of this pamphlet. Lieutenant colonels remain eligible for
promotion as long as they continue to serve in an active status and meet selection criteria. FA 24 lieutenant colonels
should serve a minimum of 48 months cumulative service in a Telecommunication Systems Engineering Support
position.
   (4) Colonel. The primary objective for officers during this phase is maximum use of the officer’s technical and
tactical capabilities, managerial skills and executive skills in positions of higher responsibility. RC Telecommunication
Systems Engineering colonels should serve a minimum 72 months cumulative service in an FA 24 operations or
operational support position.
   d. Constructive credit. RC officers (captain and above) who acquire telecommunications systems engineering skills,
knowledge and abilities through civilian industry or through education and training may apply for ISOL/TSEC
constructive credit and award of the FA 24 functional designation. Officers may apply for constructive credit through
the Office Chief of Signal (Proponent Office) at Fort Gordon, GA. Current information and points of contact are
located on the RCAO AKO Web site.

enable them to develop into agile, adaptive, and critically thinking leaders in the 21st century. Our leaders must be
grounded in Army Values and the Warrior Ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to
operate across the spectrum of conflict. They must be able to operate in and through cyberspace, unified land
operations, and JIIM environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving their objectives. Our
officers must be culturally astute and able to use their awareness and understanding to conduct operations innovatively
and courageously to exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the operational environment. Further
explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills. FA 53 officers are skilled in the principles of information systems management and
how they support the Signal Regiment’s mission domain - Army communications networks and information services.
This requires that they possess a computer and information systems background. FA 53 officers must also fully
comprehend the organization, structure and doctrine of the warfighting Army as well as the joint community. In
addition, they are: able to apply highly technical concepts to more generalized, military-unique issues; well-versed in
IT and capable of clearly and accurately communicating these complex technical concepts to nontechnical decision
makers; extremely adept at organizing workload, assigning tasks and mentoring civilian and military subordinates; able
to conduct a thorough technical assessment of strategic/theater-level and below information systems and services
management, which include host nation infrastructure and associated interoperability standards.
   c. Unique technical knowledge. FA 53 Information Systems Management officers’ knowledge and skills are critical
to the Signal Regiment’s ability to provide communications networks and information services for the Army and DOD.
Inherent with this mission is the technical knowledge and understanding of the Regiment’s core competencies which
are network operations (NetOps), network transport and information services, spectrum management op, and visual
information (VI) Operations. They must also know and understand the DOD cyberspace operations construct to include
DOD information networks, defensive cyberspace operations, and OCO. The FA 53 officers must maintain currency in
the information systems management discipline due to the rapid change of IT and operational concepts and doctrine.
FA 53 officers must maintain proficiency in the computer systems and information systems management discipline.
They must understand the capabilities and limitations of mission command operations at the tactical, operational, and
strategic levels of war. As the Army’s preeminent information systems experts, they must understand information
management responsibilities, policies, procedures, and regulations as detailed in Federal law, DOD, and Army
regulations.
   d. Area of concentration. FA 53 has one AOC Information Systems Management Officer (AOC 53A) supervises
236                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

information systems operations for units, installations, and activities. Advises commanders and staff on computer
information systems policy, technical, and implementation matters. Plans and manages the integration of hardware,
software and data communications at the user interface level into computer networks. Supervises the installation,
operation, maintenance, administration and security of computer systems and local area networks at all organizational

puter science, computer engineering, computer systems engineering, computer information systems, computer resource
and information management, IT, IT management, or a related science, technology, engineering or mathematics
discipline.
   g. Special qualifications. All Information Systems Management officers must qualify for and maintain a top secret
clearance with special compartmented information access. FA 53 officers should initiate procedures to obtain the
proper level of clearance immediately upon notification of the FA 53 functional designation.
   h. Regimental affiliation. The Signal Regiment is organized under the “whole branch” regimental concept in
accordance with AR 670–1. All FA 53 officers who receive functional designation from branches other than Signal are
strongly encouraged to re-affiliate with the Signal Regiment upon graduation from the Information Systems Manage-
ment Course and award of AOC 53A.
22–3. Officer development and assignments
   a. Officer development model. The officer development model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a Warrior Ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Lieutenants(P)s and captains who desire to transfer from another branch into the 53A AOC can apply through
the VTIP managed by HRC Leadership Development Division. VTIP is a branch-transfer request and is approved
based upon the needs of the Army, officer skills and experience, and preference. For FA 53, officers may request VTIP
prior to being KD in their basic branch and prior to attending a CCC. Officers that have not yet attended a CCC will be
scheduled for Signal CCC in conjunction with the FA 53 course.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive for training and assignments
that will broaden and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force—regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (6) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   b. Captain development.
   (1) Education. Selected officers should attend FAQ training and serve in an FA 53 utilization assignment as soon as
possible after FA 53 designation. FAQ training includes successful completion of the Information Systems Manage-
ment Course (ATRRS Course Number 7E–53A).
   (2) Key developmental assignments. The FA 53 candidates should normally transfer from their basic branch to begin
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           237

FA qualification within 12 months of designation. All FA 53 positions are considered key development assignments.

   (j) Systems manager at a service or joint cyberspace command
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Transferring from a basic branch into FA 53 is in itself a
broadening experience. Due to the technical demands that require early development in this FA and the high number of
FA 53 authorizations especially in TOE units, FA 53 captains will not serve in branch immaterial or other assignments
outside of the FA. Upon completion of the first utilization assignment, captains may be selected for fully funded
advanced civilian schooling or Training With Industry in an FA 53 related discipline. Graduates of either program will
incur a follow-on utilization assignment in an Army Educational Requirements System coded position. Advanced
Civilian Schooling and Training With Industry Programs must be approved by the personnel proponent.
   (4) Self-development. FA 53 captains should pursue graduate-level education in an IT-related discipline and/or
obtain industry certifications related to information systems management, information assurance, and other pertinent
disciplines as the opportunity presents itself. It is recommended that the graduate degrees and certifications be
information systems management, computer science, information systems security or other IT management related
fields of study.
   (5) Desired experience. FA 53 captains should demonstrate competency in information systems and services
planning, analyzing and management as well as experience in conducting information systems security. Assignments
should enable captains to acquire knowledge, skills, and abilities in computer network management, information
assurance, and information dissemination management in support of an immediate headquarters. Desired experience at
the rank of captain is 12 to 24 months in at least one FA 53 developmental assignment in order to gain the necessary
technical skills and operational background.
   c. Major development.
   (1) Education. All FA 53 majors must successfully complete ILE. ILE for FA 53 officers consists of the ILE
Common Core and FA 53 course serving as the AOC. If not previously qualified at captain, FA 53 majors must
complete the FAQ training requirement outlined in paragraph 22–3b(1). FAQ training and ILE Common Core can be
completed in any sequence.
   (2) Key development assignments. All FA 53 positions are considered KD assignments. Officers should strive to

   (q) Action officer at ACOM/ASCC/DRU/HQDA/joint activity/multinational/DOD level.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Due to high number of FA 53 authorizations especially in TOE
units and the technical nature of this FA, FA 53 majors will not serve in branch immaterial or other assignments
outside of the FA. Generally, FA 53 majors should seek repetitive assignments in FA 53 striving for a variety of
experiences at different levels of operation. Majors may be selected for fully funded advanced civilian schooling or
Training With Industry in an FA 53 related discipline. Graduates of either program incur a follow-on utilization
assignment in an Army Educational Requirements System coded position. Some highly experienced FA 53s may
compete for and be selected to attend the SAMS at the U.S. Army and Combined Arms Center, Fort Leavenworth, KS.
Successful completion of SAMS and a 12 month utilization assignment as division/corps CIO/G–6 Information
Systems Management officer will be equivalent to 24 months KD time. FA 53 officers are encouraged to seek
broadening opportunities that enhance the officers understanding of the global network environment associated with
JIIM assignments. Successful completion of JPME II is encouraged. Typical broadening assignments include:
   (a) Knowledge management officer in division/corps CIO/G–6/Cyber Command/joint staffs or in organizational
staffs at all JIIM environments.
   (b) Instructor/writer at USMA/U.S. Army Signal Center of Excellence/Command and General Staff Officers Course/

   (c) HR management officer in HRC.
   (d) Career program manager U.S. Army Signal Center of Excellence.
   (e) Observer/controller/trainer at the National Training Center or Joint Readiness Training Center.
   (4) Self-development. The FA 53 majors should pursue self-development programs to fully master all aspects of
information systems management to include JIIM operations. Self-development may include correspondence courses,
civilian education, and institutional training. Officers must devote time to a professional reading program in order to
broaden their tactical and technical knowledge. Due to the rapid changes in technology, majors are encouraged to join
professional organizations and subscribe to journals in order to stay current with industry trends and advancements.
Majors are also encouraged to conduct research and write articles for professional, military publications. The FA 53
majors should continue to pursue graduate-level education in IT-related disciplines and/or obtain industry certifications
related to information systems management, computer science, information systems security or other IT management
related fields of study. This includes pursuing the CIO Course or CISO Course offered by the National Defense
University, Information Resources Management College. For more information see http://www.ndu.edu/irmc.
   (5) Desired experience. FA 53 majors should demonstrate advanced competency in implementing and maintaining
local area networks, developing and planning IT architectures, and implementing information assurance concepts and
principles. Field grade development should enable FA 53s to further hone knowledge, skills, and abilities in performing
system analysis, developing response procedures, performing accreditation processes, and integrating IT systems in all
JIIM environments. Successful completion of ILE and 24 to 36 months of experience in key development assignments
of increasing responsibility will prepare majors for service at lieutenant colonel.
   d. Lieutenant colonel development.
   (1) Education. There is no educational requirement. Successful completion of JPME II is desired.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. All FA 53 positions are considered KD assignments. Officers should strive to
complete an aggregate of 24 to 36 months in KD assignments before they will be considered for more senior lieutenant

22–4. Information Systems Management Reserve Component (FA 53)
   a. General career development. The ARNG and USAR Information Systems Management officers (FA 53) serve
the same role and mission as their AA counterparts. The unique nature of the RC Soldier’s role as a “citizen Soldier”
poses a significant professional development challenge. To fulfill their wartime mission of planning, providing and
managing information systems and services at all levels of command in support of full spectrum operations, FA 53
officers rely upon extensive interaction between the AA and the RC, maintaining skills through civilian education,
industry organizations and certifications, and online collaboration tools.
   b. FA qualification and development opportunities.
   (1) Geographic dispersion. The geographic dispersion of information systems management positions constrains RC
career progression in FA 53. The limited number of FA 53 positions in any one geographical area limits opportunity
for officers to meet minimum career progression goals of the AA. To meet professional development objectives, RC
FA 53 officers should be willing to rotate between assignments with USAR TPU organizations, ARNG units and IMA
positions. If geographic constraints are such that assignment to an FA 53 position is not possible, officers should seek
assignment in their basic branch or in a related FA required in the geographic region.
   (2) Assignments. Information Systems Management officer assignments in the RC exist in both TOE and TDA
organizations. Their duties and responsibilities are fundamentally the same as their AA counterparts except for those
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            241

personnel management, administrative and operational requirements unique to the ARNG and USAR. Officers may be
assigned to the IRR when unable to accept a TPU or ARNG unit assignment. Officers in the IRR may request
assignment to a reinforcement training unit, an IMA position, a tour of active duty for special work, annual training, or
active duty for training. Officers in the IRR may meet PME requirements by requesting active duty for training. All RC
officers, major and below with less than 15 years of active Federal service, may request AGR assignment.
   (3) Guidance. USAR officers should seek the advice of the senior personnel management advisor for more
information on current authorizations, schooling and career development. The ARNG officers are advised to contact
their respective state senior Signal Officer (J6) and personnel management office. Another source of information is the
Reserve Component Affairs Office (RCAO) Deputy Assistant Commandants for USAR and ARNG affairs located at
Fort Gordon. This office maintains a webpage on AKO with current information and points of contact.
   c. Professional development. There are four phases of professional development for RC Information Systems
Management officers. The phases relate to military rank and include broadly based goals and career objectives at each
rank so that an officer may expand capabilities and optimize performance. The Information Systems Management life-
cycle development objectives, RC requirements and an officer’s own strengths, priorities, civilian experience, private
and service provided education, and performance influence their professional development.
   (1) Captain. The FA 53 RC officer candidates have the same perquisites as the AC. They must have an undergradu-
ate or graduate degree in information systems management, computer systems management, information assurance,
computer science, computer systems engineering, IT management or a related discipline. The FA 53 RC Officer must
qualify for a top secret/special compartmented information security eligibility effective 1 October 2012 for all new
accessions into FA 53. Current FA 53 RC officers must obtain top secret/sensitive compartmented information security
eligibility effective 1 October 2017 for all officers classified in FA 53 prior to 1 October 2012. They must have
completed their basic branch CCC prior to development in FA 53, preferably the Signal CCC. Initial FAQ requires
successful completion of the Information Systems Management Course (ATRRS course number 7E–53A). Typical KD
assignments include Information Systems Management officer in tactical organizations at brigade, division, corps and
higher levels, and in strategic and sustainment organizations. Note: The CCC is required for promotion to major.
   (2) Major. The primary professional development objective of a FA 53 major in the RC is to continue to strengthen
information systems management skills, knowledge, and abilities. During this phase, officers must complete ILE
Common Core for promotion to lieutenant colonel. FA 53 majors are highly encouraged to pursue a specialty-related
graduate degree and obtain professional certifications from IT industry. Information Systems Management majors
should serve a minimum of 24 to 36 months cumulative service in one or more FA 53 positions.
   (3) Lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels can expect assignments to senior staff positions employing them in a
variety of diverse and challenging FA related positions. FA 53 officers should seek PME at the SSC level. Information
Systems Management RC lieutenant colonels are eligible for selection to the rank of colonel upon completion of the
requisite service requirements listed in chapter 7 of this pamphlet. Lieutenant colonels remain eligible for promotion as
long as they continue to serve in an active status and meet selection criteria. FA 53 lieutenant colonels should serve a
minimum of 48 to 60 months cumulative service in FA 53 positions.
   (4) Colonel. The primary objective for officers during this phase is maximum use of the officer’s technical and
tactical capabilities, managerial skills, and executive skills in positions of higher responsibility. RC Information
Systems Management colonels should serve a minimum 72 months cumulative service in FA 53 positions.
   d. Constructive credit. RC officers (captain and above) who acquire information systems management skills,
knowledge and abilities through civilian industry or through education and training may apply for Information Systems
Management Course constructive credit and award of the FA 53 functional designation. Officers may apply for
constructive credit through the Office Chief of Signal (Proponent Office) at Fort Gordon, GA. Current information and
points of contact are located on the RCAO AKO Web site.

Space Operations
23–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. The U.S. Army is the largest user of Space-based capabilities in the DOD. Access to these capabilities
is achieved through the Warfighting functions by Soldiers and civilians of the Army Space Cadre. As the core of the
Army Space Cadre, FA 40 Space Operations officers provide in-depth expertise and experience to leverage Space-
related assets which enable the Army across all Warfighting functions down to the lowest echelon. FA 40 has two
distinct career paths: Space Operations officer (FA 40A) and Army Astronaut (FA 40C). FA 40A officers serve in
operating and generating force positions supporting the Army and unified action partners (formerly JIIM) organizations
that focus on delivering Space capabilities to the Warfighter today as well as developing and integrating Space
capabilities for the future. FA 40A officers are integrated into operations and planning positions at all organizational
levels and in positions that influence/shape, research and develop, and acquire Space-related capabilities. FA 40C
provides the opportunity for officers selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to serve
as astronauts for human exploration of Space.
   b. Proponent information. The Commander, U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/U.S. Army Forces
Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) is the Personnel Developer for FA 40 Space Operations officers. The
Director, Army Space Personnel Development Office (ASPDO) is the single point of contact responsible for FA 40
personnel development matters. FA 40 is managed within the Operations Support functional category. Contact with the
ASPDO can be made through email at: usarmy.peterson.smdc.mbx.aspdo@mail.mil or usarmy.peterson.smdc.mbx.

specialize in integrating space operations into the military decision-making process. They advise commanders and their
staffs concerning the availability, use and interface of Space capabilities. In addition, they synchronize, optimize and
deconflict the use of Space resources with the commander‘s staff and across the Warfighting Functions. They provide
commanders the Space Estimate and the Space Annex for Operations Orders. FA 40As serve as the command‘s subject
matter expert on all matters pertaining to Space to include fully understanding the highly technical tools utilized in
operational planning and execution. FA 40A officers are trained to comprehend, enable and improve how the operating
force uses Space capabilities, and to know the Space-based products they require and/or produce. They are also trained
to understand the reliance of military units on space assets and the effects when those capabilities are unavailable,
degraded or denied and know how to prevent, mitigate or work through and continue operations under such conditions
   (2) FA 40A officers serving in generating or capabilities development positions have the unique ability to influence
the future of Army Space operations through doctrine development, research and development, acquisition, policy
development, concepts and capabilities development and training/education. In addition to positions on the Army Staff
or within USASMDC/ARSTRAT, FA 40A officers serve in a variety of unified action partners organizations and
positions.
   (3) Officers selected to serve as Army Astronauts (FA 40C) are detailed to NASA to support the Nation‘s manned
Space programs. Astronaut areas of training and application are determined by the Director of Flight Crew Operations
at NASA‘s Johnson Space Center and include the International Space Station and any future Space vehicle or mission.
For more information on FA 40C, see paragraph 23–4.

23–3. Officer development
   a. Officer development model. The officer development model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a Warrior Ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer‘s career, the model highlights the need to gain unified action partners experience and
exposure.
   (3) All FA transfers are handled by VTIP. This panel standardizes functional transfers, meets dynamic FA/branch
requirements, and empowers officers to make informed career decisions by providing flexible and viable career paths.
   (4) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both Joint and Army competencies.
   (5) Broadening assignments, education or experiences expand a leader’s capabilities by exposing them to different
organizational cultures and environments. The binning concept groups assignments into distinctive broadening opportu-
nities (defined in para 3–4b(2)(f)). Officers should weave through the different bins during their career. This broadens
the officer by providing different experiences and perspectives. It also develops future leaders with valuable and varied
skills while developing a bench of senior strategic leaders with diverse talents and perspectives to the Army. A
balanced mix of assignments offers the best path to development of strategic level thinkers and leaders. The four bins
are:
   (a) Institutional and functional assignments. MTOE unit; brigade and below assignments, Space Support Element,
TDA unit; USASMDC/ARSTRAT, DCS, G–3/5/7.
   (b) Joint and multinational assignment. Joint assignment, North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)
   (c) Interagency and intergovernmental assignments. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, National Reconnais-
sance Office (NRO), OSD, Defense Information Systems Agency.
   (d) Civilian enterprise and academia assignments. Advanced civil schooling, Training With Industry, instructor
positions at the Naval Postgraduate School, USMA, Air War College and Combined Arms Center, and Army
Scholarship/Fellowship/Internship program.
   (6) The Army Career Tracker is the Army’s online professional development application. FA 40s have an online
tool they can use to map their careers, assignments, and training opportunities. Army Career Tracker integrates training,
assignment history, formal and informal education information from 15 databases and systems into one interactive and
easy-to-use interface. Army Career Tracker does not replace current Army training, education, and assignment systems
and programs. Instead, it brings them all together in one place, with the goal of making the current systems and
programs more convenient to access and easier to use. FA 40s can monitor their career development and history, search
education and training resources, and receive personalized career planning and goal setting advice from leaders and
mentors. It was also designed as a tool to aid in mentorship. Used properly, this tool facilitates structured mentorship
and can be utilized and revised by successive mentors as an officer progresses in experience. Login at https://actnow.

   b. Functional area 40 development. FA 40s have certain requirements to ensure they are developed and well-
grounded in Army and unified action partners operations. Success will depend not on the number or type of positions
held, but rather on the quality of duty performance in every assignment.
   (1) Initial selection through Voluntary Transfer Incentive Program. Upon notification of selection, officers should
contact the FA 40 Assignments Officer at HRC to discuss assignment expectations. Officers assessing into FA 40 that
have not completed the CCC will be scheduled to attend a combat arms CCC if available.
   (2) Space Operations Officer Qualification Course. All FA 40 officers must completethe Space Operations Officer
Qualification Course (SOOQC) to be credentialed as an FA 40. Completion of SOOQC is required prior to the initial
FA 40 assignment. Officers that have not completed SOOQC will not be considered for advanced civilian schooling
and Training With Industry. SOOQC is a two part course, taught up to three times per year. The first part of this course
is Space 200 taught at the National Security Space Institute (NSSI); part two is taught by the USASMDC/ARSTRAT
Directorate of Training and Doctrine; both schoolhouses are located in Colorado Springs, CO. Although these two parts
can be taken separately, the goal is to be taken together. Space 200 MUST be completed before the second part of
SOOQC. This course is designed to ensure the new FA 40 understands the five space mission areas: Space Control,
Space Force Enhancement, Space Support, Space Force Application, and Space Situational Awareness. Specifically, the
course covers space organizations, space environment; space systems and architectures; space-based assets and their
capabilities, limitations and vulnerabilities; space asset application and employment; tactics, techniques and procedures,
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           247

space systems acquisition and emerging Army space capabilities, and more importantly how to integrate those systems
into Army operations.
   (3) Initial assignment. All new FA 40s will be assigned to a developmental position supported by a senior FA 40
mentor.
   (4) Follow-on assignments. There are two assignment cycles each year: Summer (April through September) and
Winter (October through March).
   (a) Each cycle, the ASPDO will develop a prioritized list of assignments using the HQDA Manning Guidance. This
list is provided to the FA 40 assignments officer at HRC to begin the assignments process. In accordance with Army
Manning Guidance, organizations with the highest fill priority take precedence in filling. Normally, an officer without a
high priority assignment will be slotted against such a billet before being considered for a lower priority billet. Officers
must serve in geographically different locations. Repetitive assignments in the same location, organization or job types
do not facilitate broadening or professional development.
   (b) Other considerations include Exceptional Family Member Program, Married Army Couples Program (MACP),
past assignments, dwell time, length of deployments, manner of performance, and by-name-requests. While the FA 40
assignments officer attempts to match these factors with the Officer’s personal preferences, a "satisfactory" result is
contingent upon the officer making realistic preference selections. The FA 40 assignments officer attempts to match
talent and performance to the right job.
   (c) Individual officers need to be involved in the process. The binning concepts described in paragraph 23–3a(5),
helps officers realistically manage their career; do not limit your development/broadening by staying in any bin too
long. Look for other opportunities at increasing levels of responsibility. The Army is developing leadership with a
broad range of experience.
   (d) To be considered credentialed, FA 40 officers will have completed the SOOQC and served in a captain-level
developmental assignment and/or a major or higher-level KD assignment.
   (5) Professional military education. Officers should plan on attending required PME TDY enroute to their next
assignment, when eligible.
   (a) Captains Career Course. CCC prepares company grade officers to command at the company, troop or battery
level, and to serve as staff officers at battalion and brigade levels. If not complete prior to accession, officers are sent
to a Combat Arms course.
   (b) Intermediate level education. ILE is the formal education program for Majors. All FA 40s will attend ILE
following selection to major but not later than the start of their 15th year of commissioned service. ILE Common Core
is required to attend JPME Phase II or SSC. An HRC selection board determines the method of attendance. FA 40s can
be selected to attend in one of three ways: (1) 10-month Residence; (2) Satellite course. The 14 week ILE Common
Core Course is taught at various locations. This course plus SOOQC makes the officer ILE complete; or (3) advanced
distributed learning plus SOOQC.
   (c) Senior Service College. SSC provides senior-level PME and leader development training. An HRC board selects
senior O5s or O6s to attend either in residence or distance learning. Refer to associated MILPER message for
eligibility requirements.
   (6) Joint assignments. Space operations are inherently Joint in nature. As such, FA 40 has numerous billets on the
Joint duty assignment list. FA 40 majors and above will be considered for Joint duty assignments worldwide. Officers
assigned to a Joint billet should plan on Joint JPME II TDY enroute. Officers assigned to Joint duty assignment list
positions will meet all JPME requirements. These assignments are controlled, normally 36 months in length. Officers
assigned to those billets will receive the joint officer specialty SI (3A) upon successful joint tour completion. Upon
completion of a joint tour and JPME II, the Joint Policy Branch at HRC will assess the officer’s file and grant the fully
joint qualified ASI (3L).
   (7) Other broadening opportunities.
   (a) Advanced civil schooling/Training With Industry. Experienced FA 40s may be called on to serve in the research
and development field for future space capabilities during assignments at such places as the military related research
labs (Naval Postgraduate School or Air Force Institute of Technology, USASMDC Battle Lab, Technical Center or
Directorate of Capabilities Development (DCD)). The nature of these assignments requires advanced academic training
(graduate or PhD) to ensure Army Space needs are adequately addressed. To be able to support the requirements of
these positions, the FA 40 community leverages both the advanced Civilian Schooling and Training With Industry
Programs. FA 40s, who have completed at least one operational Space assignment, have the opportunity to apply for
advanced civilian schooling or Training With Industry. Officers who participate in these programs will serve in
ASPDO designated utilization tours as well as incur appropriate ADSOs.
   (b) Fellowships/Internships/Scholarships. FA 40s will serve at least one operational assignment prior to competing
for an Army sponsored fellowship. Interested officers undergo a rigorous selection process to ensure the best-qualified
officers are picked. Upon successful completion, the officer incurs a 3-year ADSO. Officers interested in competing
must meet the requirements outlined in AR 621–7. Acceptable programs are listed on Army Space Knowledge
Management System.
   (c) School of Advanced Military Studies. FA 40 Officers may compete to be selected to attend SAMS at the U.S.
248                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

Army and Combined Arms Center, Fort Leavenworth, KS. Upon completion of school, the officer will be assigned to a
utilization assignment by the HRC Plans Branch. Assignment may or may not be to an FA 40 billet. Upon successful
completion, their FA 40 utilization assignment will be in a designated KD position. Officers interested in pursuing
SAMS should coordinate with the FA 40 Assignments Officer.
   (8) Professional development education.
   (a) The NSSI Space 300 course must be completed prior to promotion to colonel. Seats for this course are
nominative. The ASPDO manages all Army seat allocations and an OML for this course. Although lieutenant colonels
have the priority in the course, majors and senior captains may attend based on their assignment.
   (b) The Senior Space Leader Seminar (SSLS) is highly desired for senior lieutenant colonels and colonels going into
key strategic level assignments. This course is nominative. ASPDO manages the FA 40 roster to this course.
   (9) 1st Space Battalion/Brigade Command. Both commander positions are centrally selected by a DA board.
Officers selected to fill these positions should expect to command for 24 months or as needed due to operational
requirements. These are opt-in boards. See the appropriate MILPER message for eligibility requirements.
   (10) Self-development. Officers must commit to a lifetime of professional and personal growth to stay at the cutting
edge of the Space profession. All FA 40s are encouraged to pursue educational opportunities as part of lifelong
learning and to enhance their professional competence and personal development including self structured readings and
study of current and emerging space capabilities. All officers are encouraged to pursue graduate-level degrees in space-
related or technical fields to improve performance and contributions to the area of space-based operations. Officers
should take advantage of the Army’s MSAF or 360 degree assessment tool. This tool is designed to raise self-
awareness and better shape the officers’ self-development efforts
   c. FA 40 career life-cycle.
   (1) Lieutenant and captain development (still in basic branch). There are no lieutenant positions within FA 40 and
officers at this rank cannot transfer into the FA until in a promotable status. Those officers looking to transfer as
captains should focus on job performance and gaining experience during basic branch assignments as they serve as the
foundation for future effectiveness. For those officers looking to transfer, the following training opportunities are open
to all: Army Space Cadre Basic Course, Space Fundamentals Course, NSSI Distant Learning Courses to include the
Introduction to Space Course, and NRO Distance Learning Courses. Contact ASPDO for further information. Addition-
ally, obtaining an advanced degree in a space-related or technical field would be beneficial.
   (2) Captain development (FA 40).

23–4. Army Astronauts (FA 40C)
   a. Purpose. Army Astronauts (FA 40C) are detailed to NASA to support the Nation‘s manned space programs in
accordance with the current Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the DOD, the Army, the Navy, the Air
Force and NASA concerning the detailing of military personnel for service as spacecraft crew members and the MOU
between NASA and the Department of the Army regarding assignment of Army personnel to NASA, dated June 17,
1987. FA 40C officers perform space flight related duties as directed by NASA; International Space Station command-
er, or Flight Engineer; ground support of spacecraft crews - capsule communicator, crew support astronaut, Kennedy
Space Center support astronaut or other technical jobs assigned by the astronaut office.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills. Astronauts are well-versed and trained in all aspects of human space exploration
and development in accordance with requirements specified by NASA. They must:
   (1) Possess detailed knowledge of spacecraft systems, operational characteristics, mission requirements and
objectives.
   (2) Possess detailed knowledge of supporting systems and equipment for each experiment on their assigned
missions.
   (3) Be proficient in on-orbit operations such as extravehicular activity, robotic operations, experiment operations,
and onboard maintenance.
   (4) Have a functional understanding of orbital mechanics, mathematics and physics as well as an aptitude for
engineering and communications.
   (5) Understand, acquire, and apply the complex technical skills specified and required by NASA.
   c. Eligibility. NASA selects Astronaut Candidates on an as needed basis. Officers cannot assess into FA 40C.
Additionally, being a FA 40A is not a prerequisite to being a FA 40C. Eligibility requirements do change from board
to board. For the most up-to-date criteria, refer to the NASA Web site at http://www.nasajobs.nasa.gov/astronauts/
default.htm. Currently, Soldiers who meet the following criteria are eligible for consideration for selection:
   (1) Must have a bachelor’s or higher degree from an accredited institution in engineering, biological science,
physical science or mathematics. Quality of academic preparation is important.
   (2) Flying experience is not a requirement. The Astronaut Candidate Program requires a qualifying degree followed
by at least 3 years of related, progressively responsible, professional experience, or at least 1,000 hours pilot-in-
command time in jet aircraft. An advanced degree is desirable and may be substituted for part or the entire experience
requirement (master’s degree equals 1 year of experience, doctoral degree equals 3 years of experience).
   (3) The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the sciences are not considered qualifying:
   (a) Degrees in technology (engineering technology, Aviation technology, medical technology, and so forth).
   (b) Degrees in psychology (except for clinical psychology, physiological psychology, or experimental psychology
which are qualifying).
   (c) Degrees in nursing

250                                       DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (a) Distant and near visual acuity must be correctable to 20/20, each eye. (note: the refractive surgical procedures of
the eye, PRK and LASIK, are allowed, providing at least 1 year has passed since the date of the procedure with no
permanent adverse after effects).
   (b) Hearing loss not to exceed ISO standards, blood pressure not to exceed 140/90, and be between 62 and 75
inches tall.
   (5) Applicant must be a United States citizen.
   d. Selection. NASA selects Astronaut Candidates on an as needed basis. Boards are normally held every 2–5 years.
NASA selects astronauts from a diverse pool of applicants with a wide variety of backgrounds. From the thousands of
applications received, only a few are chosen for the intensive Astronaut Candidate training program. Including the
“Original Seven”, only 330 astronauts have been selected to date.
   (1) Process begins when NASA notifies ASPDO on the need for a board. ASPDO confirms the selection process,
dates/milestones and eligibility requirements. MILPER and ALARACT messages will be released detailing the applica-
tion procedures. All information will be posted on the NASA Web site (http://www.nasajobs.nasa.gov/astronauts/
default.htm) and the Army Space Knowledge Management System Web site (https://cmdnet.smdc.army.mil/askms/
SitePages/Home.aspx).
   (2) Once the application deadline has passed, the Army Astronaut Candidate Screening Board convenes to review all
Army applicants. Those applicants meeting designed requirements will be forwarded to the NASA Board.
   (3) Following the preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be requested from some
applicants, and individuals listed in the application as supervisors and references may be contacted. Applicants who are
being considered as finalists for interview may be required to obtain a flight physical.
   (4) A week-long process of personal interviews, medical screening, and orientation will be required for both civilian
and military applicants under final consideration. Further interviews and a complete medical evaluation will be
conducted prior to selection. Once final selections have been made, all applicants will be notified of the outcome of the
process. Complete background investigations will be performed on those selected.
   (5) Upon selection by NASA, Army Astronaut candidates are assigned to NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston,
TX per the DOD and Army MOU with NASA. Astronaut candidates complete 18–24 months of technical NASA-
specified training and education. After completion of the Candidate Course of Instruction, they are automatically
functionally designated FA 40C and are eligible for assignment to International Space Station missions. As astronauts,
they will perform duties as assigned by the Chief, Astronaut Office and NASA Johnson Space Center. Duties will
include flight assignments, training and collateral technical assignments. Although most astronaut candidates will enter
the program at the grade of major or lieutenant colonel, NASA’s selection process is irrespective of military rank.
Levels of responsibility in assignments generally increase with space flight experience and demonstrated performance.
   e. Training.
   (1) Astronaut Candidates undergo a training and evaluation period lasting approximately 2 years, during which time
they will participate in the basic Astronaut Candidate training program, which is designated to develop the knowledge
and skills required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Astronaut candidates (with jet flight piloting
backgrounds) will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during their candidate period.
   (2) Applicants should be aware that selection as an Astronaut candidate does not ensure selection as an astronaut.
Final selection as an astronaut will depend upon satisfactory completion of the training and evaluation period.
Graduation from the Astronaut Candidate Program will require successful completion of the following: International
Space Station systems training, extravehicular activity skills training, robotics skills training, Russian language training,
and aircraft flight readiness training.
   (3) Optional training could include attendance at SOOQC or Space 300.
23–5. Warrant officer development
There are currently no warrant officers assigned to FA 40.
23–6. Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. RC Space Operations Officers serve in the same or similar roles as their AC
counterparts. The development objectives, educational requirements and training qualifications for the RC Space
Operations Officer parallel those planned for their AC counterparts. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation
through assignments in their basic branches before specializing in FA 40. They may also establish credentials relevant
to Space Operations in their civilian careers and should keep their career managers apprised of specific competencies
with potential application to their future as Army Space Professionals. The quality and quantity of training and
assignment opportunities that RC FA 40s receive contribute greatly to their operational effectiveness.
   b. FA development opportunities. RC officers should strive for Space Operations assignments that yield the same
developmental opportunities as their AC counterparts even though they may be limited by geographical considerations.
The Citizen-Soldier’s dual status role presents a unique challenge when following the AC development program. To
meet professional development objectives, RC Space Operations Officers are encouraged to seek FA 40 positions
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                               251

among the USAR TPUs, the IRR, the IMA, IRR Augmentee, the Joint Army Reserve Element, AGR programs, and the
ARNG.
   c. Intent. The intent is to provide as many officers as possible the opportunity to serve with troops in FA 40
leadership and staff positions. Limitations imposed by geographical considerations often necessitate frequent unit
transfers. There are many specified requirements to transfer between the USAR and ARNG which must be considered
when this option is pursued. The success of an RC officer is not measured by the length of service in any one
component or control group, but by the officer’s breadth of experience, duty performance and completion of specific
FA 40 requirements. Every attempt will be made to assign RC officers to FA 40 or a space-related branch positions
with the 3Y ASI. Unlike their AC counterparts, geographic constraints may limit the ability of RC officers to remain in
FA 40 positions throughout their career. Each individual officer must make assignment decisions based upon the level
of hardship they can endure due to geographic constraints such as travel expenses, driving distances and training
availability. If a successive assignment to an FA 40 position is not feasible, then the officer should seek challenging
positions in their basic branch or in related FAs. RC officers may attend either the AC or a two-phased SOOQC. The
two-phased SOOQC is the desired course specifically designed for RC Officers and allows an FA 40 to complete the
Space 200 training in year one and the remainder of the SOOQC in year two. RC FA 40 qualification standards are as
follows:
   (1) Lieutenant development. There are no lieutenant positions within RC FA 40.
   (2) Captain development.
   (a) Education. CCC, Space 200, RC SOOQC
   (b) Key developmental assignments: Company command within basic branch prior to transferring, There are no RC
KD positions at the captain level. All captain billets are considered developmental positions.
   (c) Developmental and broadening assignments. Any O3 FA 40 assignment, any basic branch, 01A Branch Immate-
rial or 02A Combat Arms Branch Immaterial assignment to position with 3Y ASI.
   (d) Self-development. NSSI distance learning, NRO distance learning, an advanced degree in space-related field or
technical discipline, DAU online courses.
   (e) Desired experience. An operational Space assignment and demonstrated core competencies defined in paragraph
23–2. Complete an active duty CONUS tour or mobilization and deployment in an FA 40 or a space operations related

   (c) Developmental and broadening assignments. Any O4 FA 40 assignment or any Basic Branch, 01A Branch
Immaterial or 02A Combat Arms Branch Immaterial assignment with 3Y ASI. Officers should build on their
knowledge, experiences and opportunities at increasing levels of responsibility.
   (d) Self-development. Advanced degree in Space-related field or technical discipline, NSSI DL, NRO DL, the
Defense Strategy Course online, DAU online courses.
   (e) Desired experience. Majors should demonstrate the core competencies defined in paragraph 23–2. Complete an
active duty CONUS tour or mobilization and deployment in an FA 40 or a space operations related position.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel development.
   (a) Education. Space 200, RC SOOQC, RC JPME II, Space 300, SSC.
   (b) Key billets. 117th Space Battalion Commander (COARNG), 1st Space Brigade XO (AGR), USASMDC/
ARSTRAT G35 Plans Space Operations Officer (AGR), USASMDC/ARSTRAT Operations Center Chief (TPU), Sr,

   (c) Developmental and broadening assignments. Any O5 FA 40 assignment or any Basic Branch, 01A Branch
Immaterial or 02A Combat Arms Branch Immaterial assignment with 3Y ASI. Officers need to build on their
knowledge and experiences. Look for opportunities at increasing levels of responsibility.
   (d) Self-development. Advanced degree in Space-related field or technical discipline, SSLS, Defense Strategy
Course, DAU online courses, Defense Strategy Course online, Director for Space Forces (DS4) Course, Army Force
Management School.
   (e) Desired experience. Lieutenant colonels should demonstrate the core competencies defined in paragraph 23–2.
Complete an active duty CONUS tour or mobilization and deployment in an FA 40 or a space operations related
position.
   (5) Colonel development. There are currently no colonel positions within RC FA 40, however, colonels should seek
out any Basic Branch, O1A or 3Y coded position. Examples include, but are not limited to the 100th Missile Defense
Brigade Commander, Assistant Chief of Staff, National Guard Advisor position at USASMDC/ARSTRAT.

24–2. Unique features of the Public Affairs functional area
   a. Unique purpose of the Public Affairs functional area. Commanders are responsible for communicating with both
internal and external publics. Public Affairs officers support the commander in this effort and provide trusted advice
and counsel on the public implications of the organization’s operations. Public Affairs officers develop communication
strategies, lead and supervise the execution of engagements and media operations concerning public information,
community engagement, and command information. The Public Affairs officer’s principal role is to advise the
commander and the staff on how to communicate the commander’s key messages concerning the unit’s operations,
provide an assessment on how the unit’s actions will be perceived by the internal and external publics, and recommen-
ding mitigation strategies to reduce communication vulnerabilities. Public Affairs officers provide commanders recom-
mendations and communication strategies in order to enhance the command’s ability to collect, analyze, assess, and act
on information. The Public Affairs officer develops and executes effective Public Affairs operations to inform internal
and external publics about a commander’s priorities in peacetime, conflict, and war.
   b. Public Affairs and the Commander’s Task to Inform. Public Affairs is the primary capability supporting the
commander’s task to inform, focusing on providing public information to domestic and global audiences that accurately
describe operations or providing information pertinent to selected publics in the area of operations. Public Affairs
provides publics with facts so they can increase knowledge or make their own decisions. Providing credible, accurate,
and timely information serves as the best means to counter misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda. Maintain-
ing trust, transparency, and credibility are critical in public information. Public Affairs Soldiers accomplish their
mission through public information, command information, and community engagement functions. Public information
focuses on informing external audiences. It primarily engages the media and key publics to convey Army and
command themes and messages to global and American audiences. Command information focuses on internal audi-
ences-Soldiers, civilians, and family members-who recognize that an informed force is a more ready, reliable, and
resilient force. Community engagement places special emphasis on two-way communication with identified publics and
communities surrounding military installations. It recognizes that a positive rapport between the Army and its host
communities is mutually beneficial, supporting the Army as an institution as well as its individual Soldiers. Public
communication is an activity that provides an accurate and informed portrayal of operations to the public. Public
communications include news releases, public service announcements, and press conferences among others. Key
publics receive these messages best through the actions and words of individual Soldiers. To gather such personal
information, units embed media personnel into the lowest tactical levels, ensuring their safety and security. Public
communications foster a culture of engagement in which Soldiers and leaders confidently and comfortably engage the
media.
   c. Unique functions performed by the Public Affairs FA. The Public Affairs mission includes: planning for and
providing information to the Total Army (Soldiers, government and contract employees, and family members),
explaining to the American public what the Army is doing, maintaining effective relationships with communities and
key centers of influence and other stakeholder groups, anticipating and responding to issues that arise from media
coverage that garner public or special interest.
   d. Unique features of work in the Public Affairs FA. Army Public Affairs a critical element of effective mission
command and an essential part of mission accomplishment. When properly employed, Army Public Affairs assists in
meeting the commander’s communication intent. Army Public Affairs helps the commander establish and maintain the
trust between the Army and the American people which is essential to the reinforcing the legitimacy and support of the
Army as a profession. All stakeholders in Army Public Affairs are affected by the effect of information, whether
negative or positive. Effective Army Public Affairs requires the application of professional and technical skills from the
military and civilian sectors. Public Affairs professionals are responsible for communicating to internal publics the
importance of careful and responsible management of the Army Profession by adhering to the highest standards of
military ethics and morality. To maintain credibility, Public Affairs professionals must understand journalism ethics
and be able to identify when media are not adhering to fair and balanced reporting. Although Public Affairs
professionals cannot control what the media reports, to maintain credibility Public Affairs professionals must provide
accurate information, be accountable for actions, and treat all media with respect, integrity, and equal consideration.
Public Affairs officers are personal staff officers or principals who supervise Public Affairs staffs, advise senior
commanders and leaders, lead Public Affairs units or serve on higher command Public Affairs staffs. They serve on the

24–3. Officer characteristics required
   a. General. Public Affairs officers are tactically proficient because of their basic branch training and assignments.
This grounding in the tactical and operational Army is vital to success and credibility as Public Affairs officers.
Because their roles and duties require them to explain the Army and its operations to a wide range of external and
internal publics, Public Affairs officers participate in ongoing operational PME and maintain a sound grasp of Army
and joint doctrine and warfighting knowledge throughout their careers. Public Affairs key tasks occur across the full
spectrum of operations in JIIM contexts. Public Affairs officers require extensive understanding of these other key
participants in the information domain. Public Affairs units operate extensively in support of joint operations requiring
Public Affairs officers to have a solid understanding of joint operations and planning processes. Public Affairs officers
require maturity of judgment and skill in assessing the operational and tactical situations and advising the commander
and staff and developing courses of action. Public Affairs officers must be experts in the latest social media platforms

24–4. Critical officer developmental assignments
   a. General. All FA 46 officers begin their careers in one of the Army’s accession branches and attend BOLC II in
their accession branch. Between the officer’s 4th and 11th year of commissioned service the officer may apply to the
VTIP to transfer to FA 46 Public Affairs. Review previous chapters of this pamphlet and current VTIP messages for
details of the VTIP. Officers requesting FA 46 must be immediately worldwide deployable without limitation, hold a
Secret security clearance, and complete a basic branch CCC before attending Public Affairs Qualification Course at the
Defense Information School, Fort Meade, MD. Designation is based upon the needs of the Army, officer preference,
military experience, and in some cases, civil schooling. Officers are encouraged to complete the CCC and attend Public
Affairs Qualification Course as soon as possible after FA 46 designation. The Public Affairs officers most competitive
for promotion and schooling and DA-centralized selection boards are those who have served successfully as the Public
Affairs officer in operational units. FA 46 officers should seek positions as the primary Public Affairs officer to a
commander and spokesperson for a command.
   b. Captain. FA 46 captain positions are FA entry positions, and positions as commanders or staff within Public
Affairs units are KD positions. Experience in the Public Affairs FA at the rank of captain is not required for promotion
to major.

ters (PCH) staff officer. FA 46 captains with more than 2 years successful service in FA 46 may apply for one of the
FA 46 Advanced Civil Schooling or Training With Industry positions.
   (3) Self-development. FA 46 captains should seek opportunities to attend the Information Operations Capability
Course. Captains should begin the civilian Public Affairs training and credentialing opportunities with the Public
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             257

Relations Society of America, International Association of Business Communicators, Toastmasters, and similar profes-
sional organizations.
   c. Majors. Public Affairs majors serve primarily in operational assignments and Public Affairs majors should
aggressively seek key assignments in which they are the principal spokesperson for operational units or Mobile Public
Affairs Detachment commanders. Majors who have successfully served in BCTs as the spokesperson for and principal
advisor to the Commander on Public Affairs Operations and Mobile Public Affairs Detachment commanders are highly
sought after for future senior leadership positions including division and corps Public Affairs officer.
   (1) Education.
   (a) VTIP FA 46 majors must attend the 9-week, resident Public Affairs Officer Qualification Course at DINFOS,
Fort Meade, MD, prior to their first Public Affairs assignment.
   (b) FA 46 majors must complete MEL 4. High performing officers will be selected by a DA board to attend the 10-
month resident Command General and Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, KS. The DA board will also identify which
FA 46 officers will complete their MEL 4 education through the 14-week ILE Common Core course by satellite
campus or distributed learning. Public Affairs Qualification Course is the FA 46 ILE Phase II qualification course;
therefore Public Affairs Officers not selected for resident Command and General Staff College do not have to complete
the Phase II DL portion.
   (c) FA 46 majors should complete JPME II.
   (d) FA 46 majors should aggressively seek a graduate degree in a Public Affairs-related discipline to be competitive

primary Public Affairs officer to general and flag officers and senior staff officers. FA 46 officers are considered FA
qualified and eligible to compete in the operations support functional category for promotion to colonel if they have 48
months cumulative Public Affairs experience, prior to consideration for promotion to colonel.
   (1) Education. All FA 46 colonels should complete resident or nonresident SSC. The Joint Senior Public Affairs

   f. Joint assignments. FA 46 officers will serve in joint commands whether they are formally assigned to a Joint duty
assignment list position. Officers assigned to Joint duty assignment list positions will meet all JPME requirements.
Public Affairs units and officers routinely support joint operations. Public Affairs officers should seek to attend all
available joint courses taught by DINFOS and the National Defense University Joint Forces Staff College. Only
officers who first graduate the Joint and Combined Warfighting School prior to a follow-on joint assignment will be
designated as Joint specialty officers (SI 3L). FA 46 officers normally will not be considered for assignment to Joint
duty assignment list positions until they have served an initial Army FA 46 assignment and been selected for
promotion to major. Because not all FA 46 officers will serve in Joint duty assignment list assignments, the absence of
a joint assignment will not preclude their selection to colonel.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            259

   g. Assignment preference and precedence.
   (1) Assignment sequencing. Prior to their first FA 46 assignment, all officers will receive their initial FA training at
DINFOS. All Public Affairs officer assignments require graduation from the Public Affairs Qualification Course. In
addition to the Public Affairs Qualification Course requirement, a DMA assignment requires successful completion of
the DINFOS Broadcast Management Course. It is extremely important that an officer’s first FA 46 assignment be a
position where the officer is personally supervised or mentored by a senior Public Affairs officer and works with
Public Affairs NCOs.
   (2) Precedence. Some FA 46 billets are designated as advanced civilian schooling or Training With Industry
utilization tours for FA 46 officers. Officers who have completed advanced civilian schooling or Training With
Industry will be assigned to those positions immediately following completion of the program. The CG, HRC is the
approval authority to delay utilization tours no later than the second assignment after completing Training With
Industry/advanced civilian schooling. These Army Educational Requirements System positions do not preclude other
officers from being assigned. However, they are a priority fill for program participants and closely monitored for
compliance.
24–5. Assignment preferences
Most Public Affairs assignments are 36 months and will be synchronized with Unit Life-Cycle management to the
maximum extent possible. Tours could be longer in areas with a high concentration of Public Affairs positions. CSL
and KD billet tours are 24 months. OCONUS locations will continue to require tour lengths specific to those regions.
This strategy will allow officers to attend Public Affairs FA training en route to their Public Affairs assignments as
required.
24–6. Duration of critical officer life-cycle assignments
   a. Key Public Affairs functional area positions. Public Affairs detachment commanders should serve for 18 to 24
months. Mobile Public Affairs Detachment commanders should serve for 24 months. Unless assigned to a short tour
area, Public Affairs assignments should be a minimum of 24 months; however the goal is to serve at least 36 months.
CSL positions to include commander, PCH, division Public Affairs officers and corps Public Affairs officers will serve
for 24 months.
   b. Public Affairs functional area life-cycle. Figure 24–1 depicts the AC Public Affairs life-cycle model.
   c. Public Affairs goal. The goal of FA 46 development is to provide the Army a qualified, credentialed Public
Affairs professional and advisor to the commander and provide the individual officer a rewarding, successful career
within the Operational Support Functional Category.

                                 Figure 24–1. AC Public Affairs officer development model
24–7. Public Affairs Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. RC FA 46 officer development objectives and qualifications parallel those of their
AC colleagues. Because the majority of tactical public affairs assets are in the RC, RC Public Affairs officers can
expect active duty deployments in support of Army and joint missions. This mandates an equivalent development
program for RC FA 46 officers. RC officers do not necessarily single track within FA 46 due to the locations of
various Public Affairs units. However, recurring assignments and supporting education and deployments within Public
Affairs are essential for qualified and experienced RC leadership.
   b. Public Affairs Reserve Component functional area qualification and development. Development and qualification
will be equivalent to the AC. Greater use of distance learning approaches will be used to ensure delivery of required
training and education to RC officers. RC Public Affairs officers should seek the same developmental opportunities as
their AC counterparts or equivalent opportunities available in the ARNG or USAR. RC officers will not be awarded
FA 46 until successful completion of the Public Affairs Qualification Course–Advanced Distributed Learning (Phase
II) or the resident Public Affairs Qualification Course. RC officers enrolled in the Public Affairs Qualification
Course–Advanced Distributed Learning may serve in a Public Affairs billet prior to completion. The Public Affairs
Qualification Course–Advanced Distributed Learning must be completed within 3 years of enrollment. Successful
completion of Public Affairs Qualification Course–Advanced Distributed Learning or Public Affairs Qualification
Course is required prior to assumption of Public Affairs TOE unit command. Officers assigned to Broadcast Operations
Detachments should attend the Broadcast Management Course following the Public Affairs Qualification Course–Ad-

Chapter 25
Military Intelligence Branch
25–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. The purpose of intelligence is to support commanders and staffs in gaining situational understanding of
threats, terrain and weather, and civil considerations. Intelligence is the product resulting from the collection, process-
ing, integration, evaluation, analysis, and interpretation of available information concerning foreign nations, hostile or
potentially hostile forces or elements, or areas of actual or potential operations. Intelligence is both a process and a
function that enables the Army to conduct unified land operations. Intelligence is inherently JIIM and leverages the
intelligence enterprise. The Army focuses its intelligence effort through the intelligence warfighting function. The
intelligence warfighting function systematically answers requirements to support unified land operations. This effort
provides information and intelligence to all of the warfighting functions and directly supports the exercise of mission
command throughout the conduct of operations.
   b. Proponent information. The CG, U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (Chief of the Military Intelligence
Corps) is the proponent for Branch 35. The Office of the Chief, Military Intelligence is the personnel proponent office
for Branch 35.
   c. Functions. Military Intelligence officers must ensure that the intelligence warfighting function operates effectively
and efficiently. They must understand how the operational variables of politics, military, economic, social, information,
infrastructure, physical environment and time (PMESII–PT), impact the commander’s operational environment.
   (1) Military Intelligence officers must know, understand, and be able to operate within the Intelligence Enterprise
and complementary intelligence capabilities.
   (a) Intelligence disciplines.
   1. Counterintelligence.
   2. Geospatial Intelligence.
   3. Human Intelligence.
   4. Measurement and Signature Intelligence.
   5. Open-source Intelligence.
   6. SIGINT.
   7. Technical Intelligence (TECHINT).
   (b) Complementary intelligence capabilities are specific to the unit and circumstances at each echelon and can vary
across the Intelligence Enterprise. These capabilities include but are not limited to:
   1. Biometrics-enabled intelligence (BEI).
   2. Cyber-enabled intelligence.
   3. Document and media exploitation (DOMEX).
   4. Forensic-enabled intelligence (FEI).
   (2) Military Intelligence officers integrate intelligence and information from all relevant sources (all-source intelli-
gence) in order to analyze situations or conditions that impact operations. Intelligence work requires the ability to
interpret patterns associated with complex situations, as well as the ability to synthesize and interpret such activities.
Analytical proficiency requires an understanding of the tactical concepts of both friendly and threat operations. These
officers must be able to clearly articulate findings in both written and oral assessments.
25–2. Unique knowledge and skills of a Military Intelligence officer
The intelligence core competencies are the most basic activities and tasks the Army uses to describe and drive the
Intelligence warfighting function and leverage the Intelligence Enterprise. The core competencies are intelligence
synchronization, intelligence operations, and intelligence analysis. These competencies are taught at varying levels
throughout the Military Intelligence educational system and are applicable to all Military Intelligence officers, regard-
less of AOC
   a. Intelligence synchronization is the “art” of integrating information collection and intelligence analysis with
operations to effectively and efficiently support decision-making ADRP 2–0. This core competency ensures the
Intelligence warfighting function supports mission command. Intelligence synchronization balances time with collec-
tion, production, required accuracy, and specificity to meet the commander’s and other requirements.
262                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   b. Intelligence operations are the tasks undertaken by Military Intelligence units and Soldiers to obtain information
to satisfy validated requirements (ADRP 2–0). Intelligence operations are one of the four primary means for informa-
tion collection. The other three are reconnaissance, surveillance, and security operations.
   c. Intelligence analysis is the process by which collected information is evaluated and integrated with existing
information to facilitate intelligence production (ADRP 2–0). The purpose of intelligence analysis is to describe the
current-and attempt to proactively assess-threats, terrain, weather, and civil considerations. Intelligence analysis is
continuous, complements intelligence synchronization, and enables operations. Military Intelligence officers use critical
and creative thinking to conduct intelligence analysis and produce timely, predictive intelligence. Examples of Military
Intelligence officer characteristics needed to conduct successful analysis include:
   (1) Critical thinking: Critical thinking is essential to analysis. Using critical thinking, which is disciplined and self-
reflective, provides more holistic, logical, and unbiased analysis and conclusions. Applying critical thinking ensures
analysts fully account for the elements of thought, the standards of thought, and the traits of a critical thinker.
   (2) Embracing ambiguity: Well trained analysts are critical due to the nature of changing threats and operational
environments. They must embrace ambiguity and recognize and mitigate their own or others’ biases, challenge their
assumptions, and continually learn during analysis.
   (3) Collaboration: Commanders, intelligence and other staffs, and intelligence analysts collaborate. They actively
share and question information, perceptions, and ideas to better understand situations and produce intelligence.
Collaboration is essential to analysis; it ensures analysts work together to effectively and efficiently achieve a common
goal. Often, analytical collaboration is enabled by the Intelligence Enterprise.
25–3. Military Intelligence officer development
   a. Military Intelligence officer development—areas of concentration. All Military Intelligence officers begin their
career as 35D (All-Source Intelligence Officer) and may acquire AOC additional training as needed. Military Intelli-
gence officers that acquire an additional AOC may have the opportunity to leverage these skills in future assignments.
However, Military Intelligence officers must continue to successfully serve in the KD assignments for each grade.
   (1) All-Source intelligence officer (35D). All Military Intelligence officers receive initial and advanced training as a
35D. Duties include directing, supervising, and coordinating the planning, collection, processing, production, and
dissemination of all-source intelligence at all echelons, to include JIIM. They are well-versed in the Army intelligence
process that consists of four steps (plan, direct, collect, produce and disseminate) and two continuing activities (analyze
and assess). 35D officers use the intelligence process to provide intelligence support to mission command and to
enhance the commander’s situational understanding.
   (2) Counterintelligence officer (35E). Duties include planning, directing, managing, coordinating, and participating
in the collection, production, and dissemination of counterintelligence information and conducting counterintelligence
investigations and operations at all echelons. Provide counterintelligence input and assistance to force protection
planning and execution by limiting the effectiveness of foreign multidiscipline collection directed against Army
operations, activities, technology, and personnel at all echelons, to include JIIM.
   (3) Human Intelligence officer (35F). Duties include planning, directing, managing, coordinating, and participating
in the collection, production, and dissemination of human intelligence derived from interrogation and military source
operations (MSO). Duties include source deconfliction and operational management team (OMT) interoperability.
   (4) SIGINT officer (35G). Duties include planning, directing, executing, supervising and coordinating the collection,
analysis, production and dissemination of SIGINT; providing SIGINT support to EW and Cyber operations in support
of commanders at all echelons.
   (5) All-Source Intelligence Aviator (15C35). These officers are branched as Aviation officers but carry 35 as a FA.
As aviators, they command platoons, companies, and battalions employing special electronic mission aircraft in support
of tactical, operational, and strategic intelligence missions. They may perform duties as the Aviation battalion and
brigade S2. They may also perform in Military Intelligence coded positions. As staff officers in Military Intelligence
Aviation units, they plan for, direct, and control special electronic mission aircraft units to accomplish assigned
intelligence missions. These officers also direct and control the training, safety, administration, communication, supply,
maintenance, transportation, and force protection activities of special electronic mission aircraft units.
   b. Lieutenant development.
   (1) Education. Successful completion of the Military Intelligence BOLC at the U.S. Army Intelligence Center of
Excellence at Fort Huachuca, AZ.
   (2) Assignment. After completing the Military Intelligence BOLC, Military Intelligence lieutenants will likely be
assigned to serve with Soldiers in leadership developmental positions such as platoon leader, XO, or in other
assignments such as assistant S2, combat support battalion S2, assistant brigade S2 or staff officer in a Military
Intelligence battalion. Military Intelligence lieutenants most commonly serve as intelligence officers at echelons corps
and below.
   (3) Self-development. Lieutenants should take every opportunity to broaden their knowledge of all aspects of
military intelligence through courses, professional readings, and personal research into intelligence related topics.
   (4) Desired experience. Lieutenants should strive to acquire, reinforce, and hone troop-leading, technical, tactical,
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              263

logistics, and administrative skills. Inculcation of the Warrior Ethos and Army Values is essential in the development
of young Military Intelligence lieutenants. Prior to promotion for captain, the officer must possess an in-depth
knowledge of combined arms and intelligence operations gained through on-the-job-training experience.
   (5) The Military Intelligence Branch Detail Program is an important part of the Military Intelligence officer
accession process. This critical program assigns newly commissioned officers to branches with large lieutenant
requirements. It exposes a large number of operations support officers to operations branches. Upon selection to
promotion to captain, these officers become Military Intelligence officers and are scheduled for the Military Intelli-
gence Officer Transition Course prior to attending the Military Intelligence CCC. After completing both courses,
detailed officers are developed in the same manner as their non-detailed Military Intelligence counterparts.
   c. Captain development.
   (1) Education. Successful completion of the Military Intelligence CCC.
   (2) KD assignments. The following are considered KD assignments for Military Intelligence captains:
   (a) Battalion S2.
   (b) Company or detachment commander.
   (c) Division G2 targeting officer.
   (d) BCT A/S2, S2X.
   (e) National support team lead.
   (f) Combat support team lead.
   (3) Self-development. Military Intelligence captains should take every opportunity to broaden their knowledge of all
aspects of military intelligence and the Army through courses, professional readings and personal research into
intelligence related topics.
   (4) Desired experience. Branch-specific assignments will provide captains with exposure to the Army and in some
cases, to JIIM organizations. Following company command and battalion S2 assignments, Military Intelligence officers
should attempt to gain maximum experience by serving in multiple Military Intelligence duty positions. Branch
immaterial and/or nominative assignments, particularly at echelons above corps or in the generating force, will also
assist senior Military Intelligence captains by exposing them to new echelons, responsibilities and missions.
   (5) Broadening opportunities. Broadening opportunities for Branch 35 captains are quite diverse, ranging from
positions such as U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence instructor to nominative positions in the joint arena.
Fellowships in non-DOD agencies as well as scholarships to institutions of higher learning are also available. Officers
are encouraged to seek out broadening experience after having served in their KD positions.

   (e) Division G2 planner, G2X.
   (f) National mission team lead.
   (g) Combat mission team lead.
   (h) SMU troop command.
   (3) Developmental assignments. Military Intelligence majors should strive to have a broad base of intelligence
experience at various echelons. Following their successful KD assignment, Military Intelligence majors should serve in
a balance of division, echelon at or above corps and joint assignments. Experience at multiple echelons will assist
Military Intelligence majors at the next rank, as most Military Intelligence lieutenant colonel positions are within
echelons above corps units. Military Intelligence majors should consider publication in academic and professional
journals, as it will encourage Military Intelligence majors to critically develop their thoughts for a wide and discrimi-
nating audience.
   (4) Self-development. Majors should actively pursue self-development opportunities to fully master all aspects of
operations including JIIM operations. Self-development includes correspondence courses, civilian education, and
institutional training.
   (5) Broadening opportunities. Branch 35 majors are encouraged to seek post-KD broadening experiences both
internal and external to the Army. Internal opportunities are ample and include U.S. Army Intelligence Center of
Excellence course manager or doctrine writer, external may include any JIIM experience or fellowships in non-DOD
agencies. All of these experiences enhance the adaptability and intellectual scope of the officers.
   e. Lieutenant colonel development.
   (1) Education. Military Intelligence lieutenant colonels are encouraged to complete JPME II.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. The following are considered KD assignments for Military Intelligence lieuten-
ant colonels:

25–6. Military Intelligence Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. The ARNG and the USAR military intelligence officers serve in the same roles and
missions as their AA counterparts. The unique nature of the RC Soldier’s roles as a “citizen soldier” poses a significant
challenge for professional development. To fulfill its wartime intelligence mission the Military Intelligence Corps is
dependent upon extensive interaction between the AC and the RC. Geographic dispersion of units may constrain RC
career progression within the Military Intelligence Corps. To meet professional development objectives, RC military
intelligence officers must possess a willingness to rotate between assignments with TPUs, ARNG organizations, the
IRR and IMA positions.

Foreign Area Officer Functional Area (FA 48)
27–1. Introduction
   a. Vision and core competencies. Army FAOs are Soldiers grounded in the profession of Arms; deliberately
accessed, trained, educated and developed to provide leadership and expertise in diverse organizations in joint,
interagency, intergovernmental and multinational environments; who advise senior leaders as regional experts; and who
offer unique warfighting competencies—cross-cultural capabilities, interpersonal communications, and foreign-language
skills—that are critical to mission readiness of the Army in today’s dynamic strategic environment.
276                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   b. Proponent information. FA 48 is managed within the Operations Support functional category. In the DCS, G–3/5/
7, the Director of Strategic Plans and Policy (G–3/5) serves as the proponent for FA 48. The Strategic Leadership
Division within DCS, G–3/5/7, DAMO–SSF (from this point forward called FAO proponent in this document.),
executes FAO policy. The FAO proponent Web site is: http://www.fao.army.mil.
   c. Functions. FAOs are Security Cooperation professionals, central to the Shape component of the Army’s “Prevent,
Shape, and Win” strategy. FAOs provide unequaled time-sensitive situational awareness to senior decision makers.
FAO are experts on regional military capabilities and work with foreign military leaders and government officials to
build partner capacity in support of U.S. goals and objectives. FAOs are routinely forward deployed acting in an
“economy of force” capacity on behalf of the Army and Joint Force. Additionally, they are often the only Army and/or
DOD representative in foreign countries, executing national security policies and objectives or serving as key advisors
to senior-level commanders, Chiefs of Mission, and other senior civilians. Their duties include:
   (1) Advise senior military and civilian leaders with regional expertise as political-military officers, Security Assist-
ance Officers, and Defense or Army Attachés.
   (2) Engage foreign military leaders and government officials to help build partnership capacity and facilitate foreign
military training, cooperation, and exercises.
   (3) Train future leaders by serving as instructors at U.S. service academies, regional centers, and other institutions of
PME.
27–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to operate in JIIM environments and leverage
capabilities beyond the Army in achieving their organizational objectives. Further explanation of these characteristics is
referenced in chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique skills and knowledge of a FA 48 officer. FA 48 officers are expected to remain well-grounded in the
profession of arms while operating for extended periods of time serving in JIIM positions. In addition to the attributes

   (d) Expertise in political-military, economic, and social issues relevant to their regional AOC
   (e) Sound understanding of interagency and nongovernment organization capabilities and unique professional
cultures.
   c. Unique features of work in the Foreign Area Officer functional area.
   (1) FAOs serve worldwide in critical and sensitive positions requiring extensive regional expertise and experience.
They are Defense and Army Attachés and security cooperation officers in U.S. embassies and host nation ministries of
defense, political-military advisors to deployed military commanders, and liaison officers to foreign militaries.
   (2) FAOs are trained as regional experts in one of the following nine AOCs. In some cases, officers trained in one
AOC may be assigned to work in another, based on their language, experience, and/or the needs of the Army. FAOs
assigned as Army Attachés attend the Joint Military Attaché School at Bolling Air Force Base. FAOs assigned to
Security Cooperation Organizations (offices of defense cooperation, offices of security cooperation, military groups,
and so forth) as security assistance/cooperation officers or defense cooperation in armaments officers, attend the
Defense Institute of Security Assistance Management, Security Cooperation Management-Overseas (SCM–O) course at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. FAOs selected to be Senior Defense Officials/Defense Attachés attend both.

competencies required of FAOs. DODI 5160.70 defines regional proficiency skill levels. The FAO core qualifications
produce an officer with a regional proficiency skill level three (Regional Professional) and most of the academic
background for level four (Regional Senior Professional). The first FAO assignment provides practical application of
these skills necessary for level four qualifications. The FAO life-cycle is based on the three domains of leader
development—institutional training, operational assignments, and structured self-development. These three leader
development concepts focus and shape FAO management in terms of accessions, training, utilization, and professional
development. Only senior FAOs have both the duration and depth of regional experience and academic credentials to
provide level four (Senior Professional) and level five (Expert) regional competencies to the U.S. Army and DOD.
FAOs attain these advanced regional proficiency skill levels through a series of repetitive FAO assignments in diverse
FAO functions and structured self-development designed and managed by each FAO.
   b. Lieutenant and captain development prior to functional designation. Experience gained by lieutenants and
captains during basic branch assignments serve as the foundation for future effectiveness for FA 48 officers. Central to
this experience is an officer’s successful completion of a KD position while serving in their basic branch. KD positions
are essential to a FAO’s credibility as Army officers grounded in the Profession of Arms.
   (1) Accession. Officers are now selected to become FAOs through the VTIP. VTIP selections are held quarterly at
HRC and interested officers should refer to the most recent MILPER message for the specifics of each VTIP iteration.
Officers selecting FA 48 as a preference must meet all minimum requirements for FA 48 (See paragraph 27–5b) and
complete a specialized questionnaire (located on the HRC and FAO proponent Web page). FAO Proponent is the
waiver granting authority for all accessions requirements.
   (a) The FAO FA seeks officers with demonstrated language skills, graduate study experience, and regional/
international professional experience as a civilian, student, or Soldier. Officers who have previously received master’s
degrees in a regional or international discipline and have shown, through a Defense Language Proficiency Test or
Defense Language Aptitude Battery an ability to learn a foreign language will be given special consideration during the
accessions process.
   (b) Neither FAO assignment branch nor FAO proponent actually approves VTIP transfers; this is done by the VTIP
panel in HRC and the DCS, G–1.
   c. Captain and major initial Foreign Area officer education and training requirements. The FAO career begins with
a comprehensive, five-phased education and training period that includes the Joint FAO Course (Phase I), basic
language training, in-region training, advanced civilian schooling, and ILE Common Core Course. These phases may
occur in any order, although the FAO proponent prefers that language training be completed prior to in-region training
and advanced civilian schooling. Once trained, the officer gains experience through a variety of FAO assignments, both
in region and in CONUS. Officers selected for FAO that do not satisfactorily complete or receive constructive credit
278                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

for the five phases of education and training may be returned to their basic branch or re-designated into another FA.
The specifics regarding initial training are as follows:
   (1) Joint Foreign Area officer Course (Phase I). The Joint FAO Course, Phase I is a mandatory, 1-week course to
provide new FAOs an introduction to the FAO FA. Topics include FAO roles and responsibilities, cross-cultural
competence, national security policy, security cooperation/assistance, strategic political-military planning, introduction
to the country team, attaché roles and responsibilities, and cross-cultural negotiations. Additionally, the course includes
the FAO life-cycle, family issues, the JIIM environment, personal security, and an orientation to each regional AOC.
This course affords an opportunity for FAOs to develop their personal training plan, establish working relationships
with their proponent managers, training officers and fellow newly accessed FAOs, and understand the varied roles
played by FAOs around the world. The course is conducted semiannually at the Defense Language Institute Foreign
Language Center. Because FAOs often serve in remote locations and families are placed in challenging cultural
situations, spouses (or same sex domestic partners as declared by the officer) are encouraged to attend the course to
better understand the lifestyle and career choice into which the FAO is entering.
   (2) Language training. FAOs are provided with basic language training in at least one of the predominant languages
in their assigned AOC in accordance with the needs of the Army. The language assigned in training and subsequent in-
region training site will be designated by the FAO proponent in conjunction with HRC based on the accessed FAO’s
abilities and the needs and priorities of the Army. Language training will be conducted at the Defense Language
Institute-Washington. The duration of these courses range from 6 to 18 months, depending upon the level of
complexity of the targeted language. The FAO must achieve minimum language proficiency (2/2/2) during this entry-
level training in order to continue in the program. FAOs must maintain proficiency in their Control Language.
   (3) In-region training.
   (a) The purpose of in-region training is to build cross-cultural competence by immersing the officer, accompanied
by their family where appropriate, in the local language and culture of their assigned,AOC to learn to work effectively
within that context, and be able to provide sound advice to senior leaders as to the best course of action or potential
pitfalls.
   (b) The seven objectives of in-region training are an in-depth understanding of: region of specialization; U.S. policy
goals and formulation; language; military-to-military experience; U.S. military involvement (security assistance activi-
ties, Defense Attaché activities, Combatant Command priorities, combined operations and exercises); embassy offices
and administration; the JIIM environment.
   (c) While each FAO in-region training site is unique in its program, FAOs are expected to conduct extensive
familiarization through internship-like experiences, advanced language studies, research/self-study and travel through-
out the region and attain first-hand knowledge of national and regional cultures, geography, political-military environ-
ments, economies, and societal differences in accomplishing the six in-region training objectives. These series of
internship-like experiences through the Defense Attaché Office (DAO) and Security Cooperation Office in the embassy
may also include attendance at a host nation educational institution. Relationships developed during in-region training
with host nation military personnel are frequently maintained for years and enhance capability and effectiveness in
future assignments. The duration of in-region training is generally no longer than 1 year, and during this period FAOs
must continue to improve their language capability with the goal of attaining general professional level (level 3)
proficiency in all modalities.
   (d) Eurasian FAOs (48E) will complete a traditional 1-year in-region training in region (as described above) or
attend a 12-month course of instruction at the George C. Marshall Center for Security Studies in Garmisch, Germany,
focusing on advanced language skills, in-depth military representative assignments and representing the U.S. in the
international security studies courses held at the Center. The FAO internships in the Eurasian region are key elements
of the curriculum of the Marshall Center. During these internships, officers will have the opportunity to work and
travel throughout Eurasia while serving in operational military representative positions.
   (4) Advanced civilian schooling. FAOs must complete a regionally focused graduate degree. The Army’s fully
funded Advanced Civilian Schooling Program is a privilege available to officers with demonstrated potential for
continued service. Officers must meet the requirements outlined in AR 621–1 to be eligible for advanced civilian
schooling.
   (a) FAOs attend graduate schools approved by the FAO proponent. A list of recommended schools is published in
the list of recommended graduate degree programs through the FAO proponent Web site. Requests to attend graduate
programs not on the recommended list must be submitted to the FAO proponent and HRC with appropriate supporting
documentation well in advance of the advanced civilian schooling application process. It is the prospective FAO’s
responsibility to demonstrate the program is accredited and will provide at least 60 percent of its required credits in the
appropriate regional focus. Exceptions to this standard must be approved by the Chief of FAO proponent.
   (b) When applying to graduate schools, FAOs must apply to at least one tax-supported school which will offer in-
state tuition and is generally considered a low-cost school (<$20,000 per annum for FY12). The two other choices may
be a medium cost (<$ 32,000per annum for FY 12) or high cost if the institution agrees to provide tuition assistance or
otherwise remain below the medium cost cap. The standard length of advanced civilian schooling is 12 months.
Waivers for more than 12 months will be requested through HRC and granted by FAO proponent.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              279

   (c) Officers entering the FAO program who possess a graduate degree in a FAO-related discipline will normally be
given constructive credit from the Chief of FAO proponent. In these cases, the officers will not be afforded further
graduate schooling at Army expense as part of the formal FAO training process. Officers who possess a graduate
degree in a non-FAO-related discipline will either be provided an opportunity to attend graduate school to obtain an
approved degree (advanced civilian schooling slots dependent) or will attend a focused regional study internship at one
of the FAO proponent approved locations.
   (d) FAOs attending graduate schooling via the Army’s Advanced Civilian Schooling Program will obtain a master’s
degree in an appropriate FAO-related discipline including: international relations/affairs, area studies, international
economics, international security studies, geography, geopolitics, government, regional history, Master of Military Arts
and Science (with a FAO-related concentration), national security studies, political science, and social science and
strategic intelligence (from the National Intelligence University). Any exceptions to this list of disciplines must be
approved by FAO proponent prior to declaration of the graduate degree program.
   (e) FAOs in advanced civilian schooling are required to maintain or improve their language skills. Officers must
meet the language requirement for degree completion for their institution. If there is no language requirement for
degree completion, the officer must maintain language proficiency through elective coursework or independent study.
This language training will be conducted at no cost to the Army. If the FAO’s control language (determined in
accordance with AR 11–6), is not offered at the university he or she is attending, the FAO is encouraged to conduct
study in another language spoken within his or her AOC.
   (f) FAOs in advanced civilian schooling are required to maintain contact with their respective regional managers in
FAO proponent throughout their attendance at the institution. Regional managers will review curricula prior to every
quarter or semester to ensure the aforementioned instructions are followed. FAOs will provide copies of all grade
reports, receipts, and other requirements per established procedures.
   (5) Intermediate level education.
   (a) The Army’s ILE program consists of two phases, both of which are required for an officer to be designated
MEL 4 (Command and Staff College graduate): Phase I "ILE Common Core" and Phase II “Branch/FA Specific
Training.” For FAOs, Phase II is successful completion of required FAO training, as outline in paragraph 27–3d (Joint
FAO Course, language, in-region training, advanced civilian schooling, and the ILE Common Core).
   (b) With the traditional ILE Common Core being a TDY course, FAOs typically attend on the front or back-end of a
new assignment to attend the 14-week course. The Army does send some FAOs to complete the Common Core Course
at a foreign military service school as part of their in-region training. FAOs who do not attend the course in residence
are required to complete the course through Distance Learning.
   (c) The DL ILE Common Core is self-paced and web-based, and FAOs not afforded the opportunity to attend the
course in residence must complete this course via DL. Officers are given a maximum of 18 months to complete all
three phases of the course. The Command and General Staff College faculty at Fort Leavenworth monitors each
officer’s progress in ILE Phase I DL. No distinctions are made between a FAO who attends ILE Phase I at one of the
four satellite courses, a foreign staff college, or one who completes it via DL. The end state of achieving MEL 4
(Command and Staff College graduate) is the same for all FAOs.
   (d) Some FAOs may be selected to attend foreign staff and war colleges for MEL 4 credit at locations based on
Army Chief of Staff guidance. Some FAOs may attend foreign PME that does not result in MEL 4 credit.
   d. Major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel advanced Foreign Area Officer development and skill sustainment. Fully
trained FAOs (majors, lieutenant colonels, and colonels) are required to conduct a structured self-development program
to continue to refine and further develop the FAO core competencies and skills. FAO proponent is developing
structured self-development program guidance that will assist fully qualified FAOs in development of their own
program. This program should be a combination of self-study, resident and virtual (online) training, as well as a variety
of assignments that will add breadth and depth to their FAO experience within their assigned region.
   (1) Self-study and online support. A wide variety of resources and training, including online course work, are
available on Joint FAO Web. FAOs are required to obtain a FAO Web account by accessing the FAO Web site at
http://fao.nps.edu/web/fao/welcome. The burden of maintaining language proficiency falls to the individual officer.
Skill sustainment and development is the hallmark of a professional and all FAOs are encouraged to use their language
daily in order to maintain proficiency. In accordance with AR 11–6, FAOs should work with their commands to be
included in Command Language Programs.
   (2) Resident study. Currently, the Army FAO program enjoys opportunities such as the Joint FAO Course Phase II,
a resident course for fully qualified FAOs run by the U.S. Navy. The Security Cooperation Planners Course is currently
conducted at Carlisle Barracks, Public Affairs. Some ASCCs also conduct Security Cooperation Courses. Other
examples include low-density language training, Joint Warfighter Course, Defense Institute of Security Assistance
Management, Joint Military Attaché School, Individual Terrorism Awareness Course, Resident immersion language
programs and locally procured language instruction are also available. FAOs should provide information on training
opportunities successfully leveraged at duty locations for future FAO use.
   (3) Utilization. FAO majors and lieutenant colonels principally develop their core competencies and skills through
breadth and depth of FAO assignments. These skills are refined as the officer moves into the senior leader level at the
280                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

rank of colonel. Sequencing of the type and location of assignments is not critical. The FAOs should avoid “homes-
teading,” and alternate between overseas and CONUS tours as much as possible. Confining oneself to any one type of
work or in any one location typically reduces an officer’s utility as a FAO. A prime example is the Senior Defense
Official position: most Combatant Commands require the Senior Defense Officials FAO officer to have a broad range
of experiences including attaché, security cooperation officer, and other experiences. Therefore, FAOs should success-
fully complete at least one assignment from three of the following five categories before promotion to colonel:
   (a) Overseas U.S. country team. Assignments include Senior Defense Officials/Defense Attachés, Army Attaché,
Assistant Army Attaché, and security cooperation/assistance positions in a Security Cooperation Organizations.
   (b) Army operational. Assignments include positions at the 162nd Infantry Brigade, ASCC, Corps headquarters, and
Army Staff.
   (c) Political-military. Assignments include OSD Staff, Joint Staff, National Security Staff, Department of State,
Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, Defense Security Cooperation Agency, and combat-
ant commands.
   (d) Institutional. Assignments include HRC, Defense Language Institute, USMA, TRADOC, Combined Armed
Center Fort Leavenworth, Army War College Carlisle Barracks, and Western Hemisphere Institute for Security
Cooperation.
   (e) Contingency support. FAOs deploy in support of overseas contingency operations. Deployed FAOs provide
unique skill sets for senior Army and JIIM leaders at the tactical, operational and strategic levels.
27–4. Duration of critical officer life-cycle assignments
Most assignments for FAOs are 24 to 36 months in length. OCONUS locations will continue to require specific tour
lengths. Officers desiring to become FAOs must recognize that a large portion of FA 48 positions are located
OCONUS.
   a. Key Foreign Area Officer functional area qualification positions. Completion of training as listed in paragraph
27–3, current language proficiency, and successful completion of, or assignment in, a FA 48 tour for at least 12 months
are the prerequisites for FA qualification at each grade.
   b. The Foreign Area Officer functional area life-cycle. Figure 27–1, below, depicts a FA 48 life-cycle. Additionally,
it identifies development assignments within the FA.
                                 Figure 27–1. AC Foreign Area Officer developmental model
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           281

27–5. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for the Foreign Area Officer
   a. Structure. FAOs serve at multiple echelons worldwide. FAO positions exist on the Army Staff, in ASCCs,
Combatant Commands, Joint Commands, Defense Agencies, National Agencies, and the institutional Army. The AA
life-cycle development model for FAOs is shown at figure 27–1, above. It depicts FA qualification requirements and
KD assignments.
   b. Acquire. Officers are accessed into the FAO Program as part of their cohort year group’s VTIP. The Army no
longer recognizes the legacy “Dual-Track” FAO Program in which an officer could serve in and compete in both their
basic branch and the FAO FA 48. Under the current OPMS, the Army only “Single-Tracks” officers into the FAO
Program. Officers who may have been designated or considered “Dual-Track” no longer carry that distinction and are
members of their basic branch or career field only. The FAO proponent establishes the minimum accessions criteria the
VTIP process will use in selecting officers for FA 48. Minimum criteria for FA 48 are:
   (1) Complete the FAO corps selection questionnaire. This questionnaire must be submitted to the FAO proponent
office for their detailed review no later than 1 week prior to the final submission date of VTIP packets to HRC (see
most recent MILPER message for specific dates and contact information). Officers who do not submit this question-
naire will not be considered for selection to FA 48 and designation as a FAO.
   (2) Complete the Defense Language Aptitude Battery. The score must be updated on their DA Form 4037 prior to
the VTIP board convening. The minimum acceptable Defense Language Aptitude Battery score is 95. Officers that
already possess a foreign language are still required to meet minimum Defense Language Aptitude Battery require-
ments, as FAO branch may require the officer to learn another language.
   (3) Officers must have a time in service of less than 17 years active Federal service by the start of advanced civilian
schooling in accordance with AR 621–1.
   (4) All officers must be eligible for a top secret security clearance in accordance with AR 380–67.
   (5) If the officer’s spouse (or same sex domestic partners as declared by the officer) and other dependent Family
members are not U.S. citizens, they must begin the naturalization process when the officer begins the FAO accessions
process. If this is not completed in a timely manner, it may limit an officer’s assignment potential.
   (6) Complete their respective CCC. Additionally, officers must have successfully completed company grade-level
KD positions in their basic branch, or must currently be serving in their KD position. Officers at risk for promotion
will not be considered.
   (7) In accordance with AR 621–1, an officer must have a baccalaureate degree with a GPA of 2.5 on a 4.0 scale, or
have completed a FAO-related graduate degree. Officers are required to submit graduate record examination results
with their FAO accession application packet.
   (8) Officers must be willing to accept designation into any AOC. While officers may submit up to four preferences,
AOC designations are designed to meet Army requirements. The largest requirements are in challenging and austere
regions where security needs are also greatest. Officers may not receive a designation into of their stated preferences.
Officers who are offered accession into FAO branch through the VTIP and subsequently decline the transfer may not
have the opportunity to apply again in future VTIPs. An officer that is not willing to accept designation into any FA 48
AOC should not apply.
   (9) Officers who are competing for other specialized programs (that is, fellowships, Training With Industry, USMA,
and so forth) may not be eligible to compete. FAO training is extensive and an officer’s commitment to another
program may conflict with vital FAO training. Officers must be able to meet the availability timelines specified in the
latest MILPER message.
   (10) FAOs must be able to serve in remote assignments where services and concurrent spouse (or same sex
domestic partner as declared by the officer) assignments may not be available. This is essential as most FAO positions
are OCONUS. Officers who have Family members enrolled in the Exceptional Family Member Program or who are
dual-military, should give serious consideration to whether a career as a FAO is the right choice for them and their
family. All officers with families should have their family screened for Exceptional Family Member Program prior to
VTIP packet submission. This will provide the officer and the branch the opportunity to make an informed selection
decision.
   c. Distribute. The HRC manages FAO assignments. Distribution of FAO-coded billets throughout the Army, the
Joint Force, and the Interagency is the responsibility of FAO proponent. See paragraph 27–3d(3) for utilization
guidance.
   d. Deploy. FAOs are Soldiers who must remain prepared to deploy worldwide at any time to support operational
commanders and in support of other requirements. All FAOs must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full
spectrum of operations. FAOs may deploy with their units or as individuals as the mission demands. FAOs must
prepare themselves and their families for this reality.
282                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   e. Sustain. Officers designated into the operations support functional category will compete within their functional
category for PME and promotion to major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel.
   f. Develop. Throughout their FAO career, officers will have the opportunity for training and further professional
development. This starts with a FAO’s initial training, followed by continued development through assignments,
required courses, and lastly by the officer’s self-development efforts in a structured self-development program.
   (1) Initial training. All FAOs will generally conduct the five phases of training previously discussed.
   (2) Continued development. Officers may receive further education through training required for certain positions.
Future initiatives include language sustainment programs to maintain and enhance language proficiency.
   (3) Structure self-development. See paragraph 27–3d.
   g. Separate. The FAOs will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
27–6. Foreign Area Officer Reserve Component officers
   a. Introduction. Paragraphs 27–1 and 27–2 apply.
   b. FA qualification and development. RC FAOs are required to attain the same qualifications as their AC counter-
parts but do so in a self-directed fashion. Some RC FAOs qualify while on active duty through the active duty program
previously described. Others qualify through their own efforts. They may use educational benefits available during
service to earn an appropriate graduate degree (para 27–3c(4) above) or do so at their own expense. They may acquire
a language through RC language training programs, through self-development (with or without available DOD
language resources), or study in formal programs at their own expense. Once trained, the officer gains experience
through a variety of FAO assignments, both in region and in CONUS
   (1) Lieutenant and captain development prior to functional designation. See paragraph 27–3b.
   (2) Education and training requirements. All initial education and training requirements are the same as described
above for active duty officers (paragraph 27–3) and include all previously described five phases of training: (1) Joint
FAO Course Phase I; (2) Language Proficiency; (3) Regional Experience: it is important to note that an officer
applying to become a reserve FAO must demonstrate a regional familiarization through personal and/or job experiences
to receive credit for this phase of training; (4) Graduate Degree in a appropriate FAO-related discipline as identified in
paragraph 27–3d; (5) ILE - Common Core Course: it is important to note that ILE enrollment is a prerequisite for RC
FAO designation for majors and with completion required for late accessions (lieutenant colonel and colonel); Officers
must complete ILE Common Core prior to promotion to lieutenant colonel to retain the FAO designation.
   (3) Sustainment training. RC FAOs, until mobilized, maintain proficiency through training with defense and Army
agencies as drilling IMAs, assigned to Army Reserve Elements at combatant commands or Army component com-
mands, or while in the IRR through annual training or other short-term training opportunities. All officers will
participate in FAO sustainment training through the FAO Web and the RC FAO Milbook group.
   c. Mobilization. Officers mobilized from IMA or Army Reserve Element positions should immediately assume their
assigned duties. Officers mobilized from the IRR will participate in individual training at a CONUS replacement center
(CRC) en route to their assignments.
   d. Critical officer life-cycle assignments. RC FAOs assigned to DIMA or Army Reserve Element positions should
expect to travel to their training locations at various times in their careers. The experience goals of paragraph 27–4
apply equally to RC FAOs.
   e. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for the Reserve Foreign Area Officer.
   (1) Structure. FAOs serve at all echelons worldwide. FAO positions exist on the Army Staff, in ASCCs, Combatant
Commands, Joint Commands, Defense Agencies, National Agencies, and the institutional Army. The RC life-cycle
development model for FAOs is shown at figure 27–2, below. It depicts FA qualification requirements and KD
assignments.
   (2) Acquire. The prerequisites for a RC FAO are the same as the AC. However, RC officers request application as a
field grade officer and applicants must already meet military and branch qualification requirements, possess a graduate
degree in an appropriate field of study, possess regional experience, and have a minimum current language qualifica-
tion of 3/3 for reading and listening competencies (waiverable to 2/2 for reading and listening). Proponent regional
managers are the sole determiners of the language competency waivers.
   (3) Distribute. Distribution of RC FAO-coded billets throughout the Army, the Joint Force, and the Interagency is
the responsibility of FAO proponent. All FAOs must attain qualification prior to assignment to a FAO position.
Agencies, organizations or units may, on a case-by-case basis and with FAO proponent’s concurrence, accept an officer
pending FAO qualification but may only retain the officer so as long as the officer is making satisfactory progress
toward qualification.
   (4) Deploy. See paragraph 27–5d.
   (5) Sustain. Officers designated into the FAO FA will compete with RC line officers for promotion to lieutenant
colonel and colonel.
   (6) Develop. See paragraph 27–5f.
   (a) Initial training. All RC FAOs will manage their self-qualification as previously discussed and will have met all
requirements prior to application as a FAO.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            283

   (b) Continued development. See paragraph 27–5f.
   (c) Self-development. See paragraph 27–5f.
   (7) Separation from the Army Reserve. RC FAOs will separate from the Army RC in the same manner as all other
officers.

Chapter 28
Strategist functional area
28–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. AC and RC Strategists (FA 59) lead multidisciplinary groups and facilitate senior leader decision-
making by assessing, developing, and articulating policy, strategy, and plans at the national and theater levels. Through
specialized education, training, and experience, Strategists integrate U.S. instruments of power across the Army, DOD,
and throughout the JIIM environment. An FA 59 is the “go to” leader to organize, design, guide, and direct
multidisciplinary, Joint, and coalition teams dealing with complex, unstructured (“blank sheet of paper”) problems.
Additionally, FA 59s provide extensive experience and understanding of operations and national security processes,
leverage strong networks across the Army, Joint Force, and Interagency, and provide clear, simple products to translate
the Commander’s vision into action by leading planning efforts or allow senior leaders to make a fully informed
decision.
   b. Proponent information. FA 59 is managed within the Operations Support functional category. The DCS, G–3/5/7
284                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

serves as the FA 59 proponent. The Director, G–35 (Strategy, Plans, and Policy) is the staff lead and G–35/F, Strategic
Leadership Division (DAMO–SSF), is the Office of Primary Responsibility. Additional information can be found at
https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/strategist.
   c. Functional competencies. Through education and iterative assignments at senior-level headquarters, FA 59
officers gain proficiency in five functional competencies in preparation for promotion to colonel:
   (1) Assess Strategic Environment, Options, and Risk: Operationally and Institutionally.
   (2) Translate National Priorities into Military Strategy and Plans.
   (3) Lead Multidisciplinary Groups to Develop Policy, Strategy and Plans.
   (4) Integrate JIIM Capabilities.
   (5) Facilitate Strategic Education and Perspective across the Force. (Clarification: This does not mean only when
assigned as instructors, but rather FA 59s elevate the knowledge and perspectives of those around them to the strategic
implications of organizational activities and external impacts on their unit, regardless of echelon.)
   d. Functional area assignments. FA 59 officers gain proficiency in the functional competencies through a diverse
assignment path. FA 59 officers are expected to complete assignments in at least two of the four assignment categories
(explained below) prior to promotion consideration for colonel. This experiential broadening, based on assignment
sequencing, ensures that FA 59 officers are adequately prepared to serve as senior Army leaders. Although specific
duty titles and descriptions vary by assignment, all FA 59 duty positions fall into one of the following categories:
   (1) Policy. FA 59s understand issues related to foreign policy and the changing geopolitical environment as well as
their implications for developing national security policy and national military strategy. FA 59 officers practice and
apply strategic art: the skillful formulation, coordination, and application of ends, ways, and means to promote and
defend national interests. Assignments include, but are not limited to, Combatant Command strategist and policy
officer, policy advisor, OSD strategist, speechwriter/Commander’s Initiatives Group member, interagency liaison
officer, joint strategist, and multinational planner.
   (2) Operational force strategy. FA 59 officers lead the toughest planning efforts of their organizations (Army, Joint,
and Coalition), translating strategic guidance and direction into campaign plans and operation orders. FA 59 officers
understand how to integrate campaigns and plans, theater strategies, national military strategy, and national security
policy. Additionally, they integrate strategy with operational planning, execution, and assessment. Assignments include,
but are not limited to, Combatant Command strategic planner, ASCC strategy and plans officer, Corps strategic plans
officer, and division strategic plans officer.
   (3) Generating force strategy. FA 59s understand the organization of the Army, its Title 10 responsibilities, and the
missions, roles, and functions of its subordinate elements. FA 59 officers also codify best practices in Joint and Army
organizations through development of concepts and doctrine. Assignments include, but are not limited to, Army
doctrine/concept writer, policy analyst, Joint doctrine developer, Wargamer, and HQDA strategist.
   (4) Strategic education. FA 59s teach and develop curriculum to support education in strategic art, military theory,
and national security strategies and policies. Assignments include, but are not limited to, Army War College faculty,
National Defense University faculty, and USMA faculty.
28–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to be agile and adaptive leaders for the 21st
century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army Values and the Warrior Ethos, competent in their core proficiencies,
and broadly experienced to operate across the spectrum of conflict. They must be culturally astute, able to operate in
JIIM environments, and leverage capabilities beyond those provided by the Army. Further explanation of these
characteristics can be referenced in ADP 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this publication. RC FA 59 officer development
objectives and desired experiences will generally parallel AA FA 59 officers.
   b. Unique knowledge, skills, and attributes. Strategists require the following knowledge, skills, and attributes:
   (1) A graduate degree in a strategy-related field, including but not limited to history, political science, international
relations, national security, geography, public administration, public policy, foreign policy, linguistics, anthropology,
economics, finance, and regional studies.
   (2) The ability to express ideas and recommendations accurately, clearly, and concisely in both oral and written
communication.
   (3) Critical thinking skills and the ability to develop creative solutions to complex problems. Employ interdiscipli-
nary assessment, problem solving, and planning techniques that complement senior leader decision-making and
appraisal.
   (4) Be experts at building multidisciplinary, joint, and coalition planning teams and leading through influence and
persuasion.
   (5) Understand how to integrate the Army’s capabilities with other services, U.S. government agencies, and foreign
government partners. Recognizes the organizational dynamics, structure, doctrine, and the operating environment of the
Operational Army and Generating Force, the Services, the combatant commands, and allied partners.
   (6) A broad understanding of the formal and informal procedures and processes for resourcing DOD and for
developing national security and military strategy.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              285

   (7) The ability to operate routinely in high-level staff assignments where guidance may be minimal but close
interaction with senior-level decision makers is frequent.
   (8) The ability to organize and lead multidisciplinary, joint, and/or coalition planning teams. Maintain skills in
interdisciplinary problem solving and assessment techniques that complement senior leader decision-making and
appraisal.
   (9) An inquisitive and open-minded approach to complex problems.
   (10) FA 59 officers are required to possess or obtain upon accession a top secret security clearance.
28–3. Strategist development
   a. Officer development model. The officer development model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than any specific assignments required to progress. Officers in FA 59 gain experiential broadening
through a variety of assignments. Figure 28–1 illustrates a potential AC FA 59 career.
   (1) Officers will initially serve in one of the Army’s basic branches to develop the technical and tactical skills that
form the foundation of the Warrior Ethos and cultivate the required leadership foundation necessary to excel as a Field
Grade Officer.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure to
understand the elements of national power.
   (3) A designated FA 59 officer should strive for training and assignments that broaden and develop the skills
necessary to lead the Army of the future. These broadening opportunities are outside one’s normal branch or FA career
development and are usually JIIM in nature.
   (4) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are regional knowledge, cultural awareness,
foreign language, diplomacy, and statesmanship.
   (5) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments, ensuring Strategists have
adequate time to gain the necessary skills and experience.
                                       Figure 28–1. AC FA 59 officer career development
286                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (6) FA 59 officers will move up and down echelons through a career, rather than only going to progressively higher
echelons. For example, experience at service or combatant command staffs can provide foundational knowledge for
service at divisions, corps, or Joint Task Forces.
   b. Lieutenant and captain development prior to functional designation. Experience gained by lieutenants and
captains during basic branch assignments serves as the foundation for future effectiveness as FA 59 officers. All
officers must attend a basic branch CCC and complete the KD job for captain in their respective branches. In addition,
officers should seek a broadening and KD experience in their basic branch prior to entering the career field. Officers
are also encouraged to write about the profession, strategy, operations and other military matters. Officers with
demonstrable planning experience or who possess advanced degrees will be given special consideration during the
VTIP process. (See para 3–4b(5)(b) for additional information on the VTIP process.)
   c. Accession.
   (1) Officers are primarily selected to become Strategists through the VTIP in the AC. (See para 3–4b(5)(b) for
additional information.) (See para 28–5 for RC accessions.) VTIP selections are held at least three times per year at
HRC and interested officers should refer to the most recent MILPER message for specifics. Interested officers must
opt-in if they wish to be considered for branch transfer. Once an officer submits a request to HRC for transfer, both the
losing and gaining branches can concur/non-concur, but the final decision is made by a panel that will take a number of
factors into consideration. These include the health by year group of both branches, the skills/desires of the officer, and
the comments of the losing/gaining branches. Division Chief, Strategic Leadership Division (DAMO–SSF), is the
waiver granting authority for all accessions requirements. To qualify for voluntary transfer into FA 59, candidates
should meet, at a minimum, the following criteria:
   (a) Must have graduate record examination scores, within the past 5 years, which meet the minimum standard for
the Army Advanced Civilian Schooling Program.
   (b) Must have or be able to obtain a top secret clearance.
   (c) Must not be at risk for promotion to the next grade.
   (d) Demonstrate characteristics and attributes listed in paragraph 28–2b.
   (e) Successful company command or basic branch equivalent KD assignment.
   (2) Additional sources of accession into FA 59 include:
   (a) Harvard Strategist Program. Officers who apply for the HQDA DCS, G–3/5/7 Army Harvard Strategist Program
will be selected by an HRC panel. Upon graduation from Harvard, officers will be career field designated into FA 59
and serve a two-year utilization tour on the Army Staff within HQDA DCS, G–3/5/7.
   (b) U.S. Military Academy instructors. USMA instructors are eligible to become FA 59s. Any instructors who wish
to become Army FA 59s should coordinate through the FA 59 career manager. Officers who are assigned to USMA
and VTIP into FA 59 are strongly encouraged to attain all-but-dissertation complete towards a PhD during their 24 or
36 month USMA advanced civilian schooling experience and complete nonresident ILE and Defense Strategy Course
while at USMA. If an officer achieves all-but-dissertation while at USMA, the HRC career manager will coordinate
with the officer to enter the U.S. Army Student Detachment (USASD) to complete a PhD dissertation, as soon as
possible after completing their first FA 59 assignment.
   d. Development for Post-VTIP captains and majors.
   (1) Initial FA 59 training and education requirements. There is a single, Federal standard for FA 59 education. The
Strategist career begins with a four-phased education and training period consisting of the Defense Strategy Course,
master’s degree, ILE Common Core, and the Basic Strategic Art Program (BSAP). The Defense Strategy Course is a
non-waiverable prerequisite to attending BSAP, but the other phases may occur in any order. Once trained, the officer
gains experience through a variety of FA 59 assignments that build on a foundation of military and civilian education.
Officers selected for FA 59 who do not satisfactorily complete or receive constructive credit for the four phases of
education and training may be returned to their basic branch or re-designated into another FA. All officers must attain
MEL 4 to be considered fully qualified for selection to lieutenant colonel. MEL–4 consists of:
   (a) Defense Strategy Course. Upon accession into FA 59, HRC career manager will automatically enroll officers
into Defense Strategy Course, a 4-month distance education program provided by the U.S. Army War College. The
Defense Strategy Course is a non-waiverable prerequisite to attending the BSAP. The Defense Strategy Course
addresses the national security policymaking process and the relationship of the national elements of power to defense
strategy. The course improves student understanding of the role of the DOD in the development of national security
strategy. Completion of Defense Strategy Course confers ASI 6Z (Strategic Studies).
   (b) Master’s degree. Effective 1 October 2012, Strategists in cohort YG2004 and younger must complete a master’s
degree from a regionally accredited university in a strategy-related field. This includes, but is not limited to, history,
international relations, national security, geography, public administration, public policy, foreign policy, linguistics,
anthropology, economics, finance, and regional studies. Degrees from a non-accredited university will not count toward
MEL 4 qualification. Many FA 59s will meet the master’s degree requirement through the Army’s Advanced Civilian
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              287

Schooling Program. Advanced civilian schooling is a privilege available to officers with demonstrated potential for
continued service. Officers must meet the requirements outlined in AR 621–1 to be eligible for advanced civilian
schooling. Advanced civilian schooling will not exceed 18 months unless the officer is able to obtain all-but-
dissertation status in 24 months. The HRC career manager will guide officers during the application process. Officers
should strive to attend the most rigorous program they can. Officers who achieve an MA through AMSP will typically
not be sent to advanced civilian schooling to earn a second degree.
   1. Officers will provide a list of five graduate school choices to the career manager. As part of the application
process, officers will apply to one of the National Intelligence University’s master’s degree programs. Additionally, one
choice must be a tax-supported school which will offer in-state tuition and is considered a low-cost school by HRC
standards. Officers will attend graduate schools and select degree programs that are approved by the FA 59 Proponent.
   2. Officers entering FA 59 who already possess a graduate degree from a resident program will normally be given
constructive credit from the Proponent. In these cases, the officers will not normally be afforded further graduate
schooling at the Army expense. The Division Chief, Strategic Leadership Division (DAMO–SSF), is the waiver
granting authority for exceptions.
   (c) ILE. All majors must attend ILE. This course educates and trains field grade officers to be agile and adaptive
leaders, capable of critical thinking, and prepared to lead forces in a JIIM environment. ILE credit is obtained in one of
four ways: attend the ILE Common Core at a Command and General Staff College satellite campus; attend the resident
program at Fort Leavenworth, KS; attend another Service command and staff equivalent; or complete the DL ILE
Course. Currently, no distinction is made between officers based on their source of ILE Common Core. The end state
of attaining MEL 4 is the same for all officers. Effective 1 October 2012, FA 59 officers in YG2004 and younger must
complete the ILE Common Core as part of MEL 4 certification prior to consideration for promotion to lieutenant
colonel.
   1. ILE Common Core. The 14 week ILE Common Core focuses on preparing field grade officers for leadership
positions in Army and Joint organizations. Officers normally complete Common Core prior to attending BSAP. This
instruction is conducted in residence at Fort Leavenworth, in a TDY status at one of several satellite locations, or by
distance learning. The requirement for ILE Common Core is waived for officers attending a sister Service or allied
command and staff college.
   2. Advanced Operations Course. The 10 month resident ILE program at Fort Leavenworth begins with the Common
Core and includes the Advanced Operations Course and electives. The Advanced Operations Course professionally
develops graduates to serve as staff officers and commanders with the ability to build and lead formations, and
integrate unified land partners within the efforts of Joint, Interagency, and Multinational partners. Advanced Operations
Course is not a substitute for BSAP.
   a. FA 59 officers who attend the Advanced Operations Course must take the 3H (Joint operations planner) electives
and the six-week, University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies “Red Team Member” courses that may be
offered in the elective phase of study.
   b. Officers who attend Advanced Operations Course are expected to attain a master’s degree: either the Military
Arts and Science offered through Command and General Staff College or one of the existing cooperative master’s
degree programs.
   c. Officers attending resident ILE at Fort Leavenworth are also expected to apply to the SAMS program.
   (d) BSAP. Effective 1 October 2012, FA 59 officers YG2004 and younger must complete BSAP to achieve MEL 4
prior to their lieutenant colonel board. BSAP is a 14-week resident program conducted at the graduate level at the U.S.
Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. The course educates newly designated FA 59s in the fundamen-
tals of national strategy, and it fills a critical educational requirement which provides the tools for junior majors to
bridge the gap between their tactical/operational background and the challenges of operating at the grand-strategic and
theater-strategic levels of war and policy. It also introduces the officers to the unique skills, knowledge, and attributes
needed as a foundation for their progressive development as Army FA 59 officers.
   (2) Post MEL 4 training and education. Based on an officer’s future assignment, the Career Manager may schedule
attendance at one of the following programs.
   (a) Advanced Military Studies Programs. Following ILE, or later in their careers, some FA 59s may attend AMSP
for the Army or its Service equivalents (the U.S. Marine Corps School of Advanced Warfighting (SAW), U.S. Air
Force School of Advanced Air and Space Studies (SAASS), and the Naval War College’s Maritime Advanced
Warfighting School (MAWS).) AMSP is a graduate-level program emphasizing the military art and science of
planning, preparing, and executing operations in JIIM contexts. The curriculum combines the integrated study of
military history, military theory, and execution-based practical exercises. It also enhances officers’ cognitive problem
solving skills regarding operational challenges at the tactical and operational levels of war. The course emphasizes both
command and staff perspectives on military decision-making, doctrine, and force employment. Graduates earn a Master
of Military Art and Science in Theater Operations from the Command and General Staff College. Based on the
officer’s timeline, this Military Arts and Science may serve as the officer’s graduate degree for MEL 4 qualification.
AMSP attendance is highly encouraged for all FA 59s and selection is competitive. Interested officers should contact
the FA 59 Career Manager for application requirements.
288                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (b) University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies Red Teaming is a structured process that provides command-
ers an independent capability to fully explore alternatives from a partner or adversary perspective. Officers who wish to
attend University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies TDY en route should contact the FA 59 career manager and
request attendance to the 6 week Red Team Member course. Graduation confers the 7J (Red Team Member) ASI.
Some graduates will be utilized as Red Team members at the Division/Corps/ASCC level. Some FA 59s may attend
the 18-week Red Team Leader course or the 9-week Red Team Leader Course (Stopgap), both of which confer the ASI
7G (Red Team Leader). Both the Red Team Member and Red Team Leader courses are generally available as electives
during the Advanced Operations Course. These courses provide skills that are valuable to FA 59s en route to Divisions,
Corps, and ASCCs.
   (c) Army Force Management School. Army Force Management School courses are based upon processes established
for the conduct of Army operations worldwide. The Army Force Management Course is a 4-week course taught at Fort
Belvoir, VA. The Army Force Management Course provides the processes that translates National Security Strategy
into future Army force structure. It covers Strategy, Capabilities Development/Material Development, Force Structure,
and Force Development. FA 59s often work closely with FA 50 (Force Management) officers; completion of one of
these courses can help prepare FA 59s for assignments where they must understand Title 10 requirements and how the
Army functions as an enterprise. This course would benefit FA 59s en route to Generating Force assignments and
ASCCs.
   (d) Joint professional military education level II. Currently, over a third of FA 59 billets are Joint duty assignment
list positions that provide Joint credit upon reaching 36 points (one point per month for non-deployed joint positions, 3
points per month for deployed joint positions). FA 59s going into joint billets can expect to attend the Joint Combined
Warfighting School (JCWS) en route to their assignment. Officers currently in joint positions who did not attend JCWS
should coordinate with the Career Manager to complete JCWS. RC officers can attend advanced JPME in lieu of
JCWS. Both JCWS and advanced JPME confer ASI 3H (Joint Planner).
   (3) FA 59 PhD Program. The FA 59 Proponent may pay for resident, U.S.-based coursework towards a PhD.
Officers will continue to perform their assigned duties. The Proponent will not fund distance education PhD programs,
nor will it fund programs from a non-U.S. institution. Officers must obtain Proponent approval before beginning
coursework funded by the Proponent. Once an officer has achieved all-but-dissertation status and PhD candidacy at an
accredited civilian university, they will apply to the FA 59 proponent for an assignment to the U.S. Army Student
Detachment (USASD) to complete their dissertation. Assignment to USASD incurs a 3:1 ADSO. The HRC career
manager may direct a utilization assignment related to the PhD coursework.
   (4) Key developmental assignments. A KD position is one that is deemed fundamental to the development of an
officer in his or her FA competencies or deemed critical by the senior Army leadership to provide experience across
the Army’s strategic mission. All FA 59 billets are coded as KD equivalents based on the variety of potential duties
within an FA 59 assignment. Officers should complete assignments in at least two of the four assignment categories
listed in 28–1d. prior to promotion consideration for colonel.
   (5) Developmental and broadening assignments. All FA 59-coded positions are considered developmental assign-
ments for FA 59 majors. Broadening assignments are defined as any non-FA 59 coded position in which the officer
gains experience in one or more of the functional competencies. FA 59-specific and Armywide fellowship programs
are also considered broadening. FA 59 officers should strive to get JIIM experience in any broadening opportunity.
   (6) Self-development. The complex and changing nature of strategy formulation and policy development requires
continual self-development by FA 59 officers. Officers are encouraged to complete nonresident education opportunities
offered through the other Services (such as nonresident Service Command and Staff or War Colleges). FA 59s are also
strongly encouraged to seek opportunities to broaden their experience base and to improve their skills in multidiscipli-
nary problem solving. A continuous program of professional reading ensures that FA 59 officers remain sufficiently
engaged in the discourse of ideas and concepts relevant to their work as Army Strategists. FA 59s are encouraged to
publish articles in professional journals, develop cultural awareness, and improve public speaking skills.
   (7) Desired experience. FA 59 officers gain experience and competency through iterative assignments in a broad
array of assignments across different categories.
   (a) Exposure to all five functional competencies and experience in three of the competencies by the time they
become a senior major.
   (b) Completed at least one FA 59 assignment (minimum 24 months, preferably 36 months) throughout the force
prior to their PZ consideration for lieutenant colonel.
   (c) Proficiency in one category of FA assignments and familiarity with at least one other category.
   e. Lieutenant colonel development. Development as an FA 59 lieutenant colonel focuses upon gaining exposure to
and an understanding of all FA 59 functional competencies.
   (1) Education. No education is currently mandated beyond that listed within the captain/major development path.
Successful completion of JPME II is desirable. In addition, FA 59 provides non-MEL fellowships, broadening
programs, and SSC opportunities to improve educational depth.
   (a) Broadening opportunities/non-MEL Fellowships. Upon completion of one FA 59 assignment, high performing
officers can pursue several unique broadening/fellowship opportunities designed to enhance previous educational
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            289

experiences. In addition to the centrally selected Army fellowships, FA 59s may request assignment to fellowships
designed exclusively for FA 59. These non-MEL assignments (1 year) are located within the National Capital Region
and are designed to provide broadening opportunities and expose FA 59s to policy development at the national
strategic level. Senior FA 59 majors and lieutenant colonels are encouraged to apply and will be selected by a panel of
HQDA DCS, G–3/5/7 FA 59s at the beginning of each academic year. Officers interested in applying should contact
the FA 59 career manager. In accordance with appropriate regulations, an ADSO may be incurred.
   (b) Seminar XXI. Strategists may also compete for seven fully funded educational opportunities hosted by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Seminar XXI (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) is a fully funded
educational program for senior military officers, Government and nongovernmental organizations officials, and execu-
tives in the national security policy community. The program provides leaders with enhanced analytic skills for
understanding foreign countries and the relations among them. Seminar XXI explores key policy issues by examining
countries and problems critical to American interests. Senior FA 59 majors through colonels are invited to contact the
FA 59 proponent manager for further information.
   (c) Senior Service College. FA 59s compete for SSC in the same manner as other Army officers. The Proponent
emphasizes that the Joint Advanced Warfighting School is the preeminent SSC opportunity for which FA 59s should
strive because the school’s curriculum directly builds upon FA 59 competencies. The other course that also builds upon
FA 59 competencies is the SAMS Advanced Strategic Leader Studies Program. For those officers attending the Army
War College, the Proponent recommends that they compete for acceptance into the Advanced Strategic Art Program
(ASAP) or National Strategy and Policy Program (NSPP). These programs strengthen officers’ abilities to develop
theater campaign plans, conduct strategic appraisals, foster joint/interagency integration, and participate in the policy
formulation process.
   (d) U.S. Army War College Fellowship Program. The Proponent also recommends that SSC-selects compete for
SSC fellowships. Officers should compete for these fellowships to round out niche areas of specialization within the
five functional competencies or should select fellowship opportunities that will prepare them for follow-on
assignments.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. All FA 59 lieutenant colonel positions are coded as KD based on the variety of
potential duties within an FA 59 assignment. A FA 59 officer must have a minimum of 48 months in FA 59-coded
billets throughout a career before being fully qualified for promotion to colonel. Officers should have completed
assignments in at least three of the four assignment categories listed in 28–1d. prior to promotion consideration for
colonel.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. In addition to FA 59-coded developmental positions, FA 59
lieutenant colonels should actively seek one broadening assignment to gain a diverse experience in one or more of the
functional competencies. FA 59-specific and Armywide fellowship programs are considered broadening. FA 59
lieutenant colonels should strive to get JIIM experience in any broadening opportunity.
   (4) Self-development. Officers are encouraged to complete nonresident education opportunities offered through the
other Services. FA 59s are also strongly encouraged to seek opportunities to improve their skills in multidisciplinary
problem solving. A continuous program of professional reading ensures that FA 59 officers remain sufficiently engaged
in the discourse of ideas and concepts relevant to their work as Army Strategists. FA 59s are encouraged to publish
articles in professional journals, develop cultural awareness, improve public speaking skills, and develop other skills
which will improve their skills as a strategist.
   (5) Desired experience.
   (a) Proficient in three of the five functional competencies and mastery of one by the time they become a senior
lieutenant colonel.
   (b) Completed at least 2 years of joint or interagency planning
   (c) Completed at least two FA 59 assignments (minimum 48 months, preferably 72 months) throughout the force
prior to their PZ consideration for colonel.
   f. Colonel development.
   (1) Education. There are limited, though widely varied, numbers of educational opportunities for FA 59 colonels.
   (a) Senior Service College. Some FA 59 colonels will be selected for resident or nonresident SSC. Officers selected
for resident attendance will apply to attend the Army War College, sister Service war college, or a fellowship.
   (b) Joint professional military education level II. Some FA 59 colonels in joint assignments may be selected for
attendance at JPME II if they have not attended previously.
   (c) National Security Management Course. The National Security Management Course is a 2-week resident course
of instruction held at Syracuse University. The course explores the wide range of emerging management challenges
facing domestic and international security professionals. National security management involves interrelated responsi-
bilities of allocating scarce resources and dealing with complex institutional relationships, both internal and external to
an organization. These responsibilities have profound implications in determining national security strategy and are the
primary focus in the National Security Management Course. Colonels are invited to contact the FA 59 proponent
manager for further information.
   (d) Seminar XXI. Colonels may also compete for Seminar XXI held at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
290                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

Seminar XXI explores key policy issues by examining countries and problems critical to American interests. Colonels
are invited to contact the FA 59 proponent manager for further information.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. At the rank of colonel, an FA 59 is expected to have a broad array of
experience that allows him or her to be assignable to any FA 59-coded position across the force and effectively mentor
and develop junior strategists in their assignments. There are no KD assignments at colonel.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments for colonels are defined as any non-FA 59 coded positions in which
the officer participates in national security policy or planning.
   (4) Desired experience. The FA 59 colonel is expected to master a minimum of one competency and be proficient in
two others. At the rank of colonel, assignments will enhance the officer’s competencies while ensuring that plans,
policies, and strategies fully nest with national policy goals.
28–4. Warrant officer development
There are no warrant officers in FA 59.
28–5. Reserve Component officers
   a. Career development. RC FA 59 officer development objectives and desired experiences will generally parallel
AA FA 59 officers. Officers in the RCs (Army Reserve and National Guard) and officers within the AA will be
developed to one standard. The challenge for the Army is to match the unique skills and expertise of civilian
professionals with mission needs and requirements. RC FA 59 officers must be afforded military education and
assignment opportunities so that senior military and civilian leaders can leverage the unique capabilities that exist
among RC FA 59 officers. The goal is to build a talented and fully integrated FA 59 community within the Total
Army, the Joint force, and the U.S. Government.
   b. Life-cycle development model. The RC life-cycle development model for FA 59 officers mirrors that for AA
officers, except that assignments are not limited to one reserve status or control group. Figure 28–2 illustrates a
potential RC FA 59 career.
                                     Figure 28–2. RC FA 59 officer career development
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                         291

   c. Transfer to FA 59 in the U.S. Army Reserve. Selection for FA transfer will be approved by the Army Reserve
program advisor for AGR FA 59s. Accessions criteria for an Army Reserve FA 59 are the same as those for the AC
(see para 28–3c). While most Army Reserve FA 59 officers serve as AGR officers in their PMOS before becoming FA
59s, occasionally a strong candidate newly accessed to the AGR program will be selected for FA 59 in an initial
assignment.
   d. Transfer to FA 59 in the National Guard. Selection and accession into the ARNG FA 59 program is approved by
the ARNG G5 Chief in coordination with the Title 10 AGR accessions process governed by ARNG Human Capital
Management protocol. ARNG officers typically self-nominate for FA 59 with the consent of their chain of command.
Accession criteria for ARNG FA 59 are the same as those for the AC. However, unlike the AC, the ARNG FA 59
program dually-tracks officers in both FA as well as basic branch; affording ARNG officers career development
opportunities as fully branch-qualified strategic advisors to senior Army leaders (see fig 28–3). Accessions into the
ARNG FA 59 are program typically derived from the existing Title 10 and Title 32 AGR populations which best
supports our role in operational and strategic venues.
                                           Figure 28–3. ARNG Dual-Track System
   e. Assignment opportunities. RC officers can expect assignment opportunities similar to those of AA officers. In
addition, there are positions exclusive to the Army Reserve and National Guard that exist in response to the changing
geo-strategic environment. RC Strategists work on the Joint Staff, OSD, the Army Staff, the NGB Joint or ARNG
Directorate staffs (ARNG) or at the OCAR or USARC (USAR), geographic combatant command staffs, ASCC staffs,
and various federal and state executive agency staffs where they support the formulation and implementation of RC
equities in national security strategy and national military strategy.
   f. FA 59 development opportunities.
   (1) A diverse and fluid career. The competing demands of civilian and military life pose a challenge for the
professional development of the RC FA 59. The officers should follow AA officer development patterns as closely as
292                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

possible. However, a FA 59 RC officer’s development and assignment progression can be characterized by its ability to
adapt to changes. Civilian professional development can benefit the Total Army, and should be leveraged.
   (a) National Guard careers. To meet military career development objectives, National Guard officers can expect to
rotate between M–DAY and AGR programs as needed or desired. While the majority of FA 59 positions are reserved
for AGR personnel, transfers between duty status programs are occasionally necessary when considering individual
career paths, military requirements, geographical considerations, and the ARNG’s need to provide as many officers as
possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions. ARNG FA 59s should seek broadening
TDY assignments and/or mobilizations to gain additional experience in FA 59 competencies.
   (b) Army Reserve careers. All FA 59 assignments in the Army Reserve reside in the AGR program. Many Army
Reserve FA 59s transition to the FA after serving as AGR officers in their PMOS. Interested Army Reserve officers
currently serving in the IRR or TPU and IMA status should contact their career manager and the FA 59 Army Reserve
proponent advisor to discuss the process for applying to the Army Reserve AGR Program.
   (2) Education and training. Due to the complexity and diversity of assignments in the FA 59 field, RC officers must
continually develop their knowledge and analytical skills. They will be offered opportunities to pursue continuing
education and training (civilian and military) and government internship programs to improve skills. All Army Reserve
FA 59 majors must complete Defense Strategy Course and attend BSAP. Title 32 National Guard officers should
complete Defense Strategy Course and attend BSAP. However, RC officers will have increased time windows to
complete these requirements. Refer to paragraph 28–3c for FA qualification.
Chapter 29
Nuclear and Counterproliferation functional area
29–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. Nuclear Operations and Counterproliferation officers are warfighters who provide the Army with a
technically educated, operationally experienced and highly trained cadre specializing in all aspects of nuclear and
combating WMD strategic and operational-level planning and execution. This includes expertise across the spectrum of
nuclear and combating WMD operations from weapon design and effects, surety, protection, detection, and conse-
quence management. In addition to the common leader attributes described in ADP 3–0, FA 52 officers possess five
functional competencies: strategy, plans, policy and operations; research, development and capabilities; doctrine,
education and training; modeling and simulation (M&S); and combating WMD.
   b. Proponent information. FA 52 is managed within the Plans Development Group of the Operations Support
Functional Category. The DCS, G–3/5/7 serves as the proponent for FA 52, with the Director, U.S. Army Nuclear and
Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction Agency (USANCA) as the designated personnel developer. FA 52 and
personnel developer-related information may be found in the USANCA Knowledge Center (controlled access) on
AKO: https://www.us.army.mil/suite/kc/10740602.
   c. Functions. FA 52 officers primarily lead the nuclear and combating WMD planning, training, requirement
development, and operations efforts of their supported organizations. FA 52 officers often lead joint, combined and
interagency planning and action groups and teams for general combating WMD activities and specific nuclear weapons
issues. FA 52 officers are frequently the DOD’s single point of entry to coordinate WMD activities with nonmilitary or
interagency partners. In addition to these functions, FA 52 officers provide technical advice and support in developing
national and military strategy, plans and policy recommendations to Army, Combatant Command, DOD, and Inter-
agency leadership in nuclear and combating WMD mission areas.
29–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army Values
and the Warrior Ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the spectrum of
conflict. They must be able to operate in Joint, Interagency, International, and Multinational environments and leverage
capabilities beyond the Army in achieving their objectives. Our officers must be culturally astute and able to use their
awareness and understanding to conduct operations innovatively and courageously to exploit opportunities in the
challenges and complexities of the operational environment. Further explanation of these characteristics can be
referenced in ADP 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Functional competencies. Over the course of their careers, FA 52 officers develop five functional competencies:
strategy, plans, policy and operations; research, development and capabilities; M&S; and combating WMD. In addition
to these functional competencies, officers are encouraged and are provided opportunities to develop national security,
scientific, technical and mission oriented competencies in accordance with their personal interests:
   (1) Strategy, plans, policy and operations. Officers assist in forming and providing advice on national and military
nuclear weapons and combating WMD strategy, plans, policy and operations. Officers must have a unique understand-
ing of nuclear weapons, including the international issues pertaining to use and deterrence value of all strategic
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            293

weapons and threats posed by state and non-state nuclear and radiological threats to the United States. Officers
participate at all levels from tactical to strategic, in operations and operations support to the warfighter. In this capacity,
FA 52 officers provide professional technical advice on nuclear matters that include strategic targeting, weapons
effects, limitations posed by radioactive contamination, and consequence management during post-blast crisis
operations.
   (2) Research, development, and capabilities. Officers conduct research and analysis as scientists and engineers on
nuclear weapons and related nuclear weapons effects. FA 52 officers lead the Army’s analysis on the effect of nuclear
weapons on the warfighter and combat equipment. Officers lead and manage development programs that create a wide
range of radiation/nuclear equipment including detectors and protective equipment that once it moves out of the
conceptual phase often move into the Army and Joint acquisition. Furthermore officers provide senior leaders with
detailed assessments of the Army’s vulnerability to nuclear effect, and create inputs to force development models
ensuring that technical and tactical solutions are considered in long-range planning. Key to our national security is the
FA 52 led nuclear surety program, ensuring stockpile weapons are secure, functional, and will perform as designed.
   (3) Doctrine, education, and training. FA 52 officers provide advice to commanders and staffs at all levels regarding
doctrine, education and training. Officers formulate doctrine for the DCS, G–3/5/7 as new radiological and nuclear
threats emerge. Officers use the network of highly skilled FA 52 officers to analyze threats and develop doctrinal
responses to protect the warfighter and allow for continued operations in nuclear environments. Additionally FA 52
officers plan and execute training for military and nonmilitary response forces to combat WMD. FA 52 officers
specifically train USMA cadets and other government personnel in nuclear weapons, weapons effects, and other
nuclear sciences. This cultivates deeper expertise within the U.S. government collectively through establishing appro-
priate divisions of labor within joint and interagency planning and operation organizations. FA 52 officers codify best
practices in joint and Army organizations through development of doctrine at all levels.
   (4) Modeling and simulation. FA 52 officers lead the Army’s efforts for nuclear, combating WMD and consequence
management M&S. Officers serve on staffs at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels providing support to senior
leaders in crisis management and effects mitigation operations. Detailed knowledge of current and developmental
modeling tools assists FA 52 officers in providing commanders and battle staffs an understanding potential future
scenarios involving WMD, which is critical to the development of plans, orders and mission requirements. Additionally
FA 52 officers have the unique technical skills that enable them to work with highly sophisticated programs that
simulate the effects of nuclear weapons which allows them to provide target analysis and employment planning for
nuclear and advanced conventional weapons. FA 52 officers also conduct technical analysis to support nuclear weapons
stockpile surety, a critical element in the USG nuclear stockpile stewardship program. Through these efforts FA 52
officers ensure that the current nuclear stockpile meets the nation’s strategic nuclear posture requirements.
   (5) Combating weapons of mass destruction. The 2002 National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction
and the 2006 National Military Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction frames the mission into three
principal pillars; nonproliferation, counterproliferation, and consequence management. FA 52 officers are integral to the
execution of all parts of the national and military strategies. FA 52 officers at all experience levels and ranks function
in critical billets in all combating WMD categories.
   (a) Nonproliferation. Nonproliferation activities focus on efforts to keep nuclear materials and weapons at the source
of origin. This includes various arms control, monitoring, and treaty/agreement protocols. FA 52 officers participate in
all aspects of nonproliferation from international treaty negotiations and formulation through inspections and verifica-
tion missions. Additionally, FA 52 officers provide technical expertise to the intelligence community and interagency
bodies that monitor specific threat areas that provide a WMD proliferation risk. Advice, technical expertise, and
experience are essential for framing political policy positions, and metered governmental responses to the full spectrum
of nonproliferation issues.
   (b) Counterproliferation. Counterproliferation activities are those conducted once WMD materials have illegally left
their point of origin or control of a legitimate authority. These activities focus on deterrence, defense and mitigation
efforts. FA 52 officer are engaged at all levels from the national policy level to the tactical execution level to track,
identify, interdict and dispose of illicit WMD shipments.
   (c) Consequence management: Consequence Management activities are conducted in response to a WMD release or
a non-weaponized release of toxic CMs/materials/pathogens though deliberate, accidental, or natural catastrophic
means. During a crisis well informed and educated operations officers are essential to ensure leadership at all levels
tactical, operational, and strategic are provided with accurate, timely information with appropriate context for rapid,
effective and informed decision-making. FA 52 officers provide professional, technically accurate analysis during the
initial stages of a WMD crisis and in the weeks and months following. FA 52 officers are key to ensuring military and
civilian leaders are provided with technically and operationally sound courses of action, so that the Army provides an
appropriately metered response considering the crisis at hand and other Army strategic mission requirements.
   c. Unique knowledge/skills. FA 52 officers must fully comprehend the organization, structure and doctrine of the
warfighting Army as it evolves into the 21st century. Work within the Nuclear and Counterproliferation FA requires the
application of technical skills in their military applications. As such, they must:
294                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (1) Possess an undergraduate degree in any mathematics, science or engineering discipline and/or operational
experience with WMD at the company grade level.
   (2) Possess the ability to obtain a master’s degree in a nuclear or combating WMD related field.
   (3) Expect to routinely serve in staff positions where guidance is minimal and close interaction with senior-level
decision makers is common. Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers are frequently the sole subject matter experts
within their command or organization.
   (4) Apply highly technical scientific concepts to more military-specific issues and applications.
   (5) Be capable of communicating this technical expertise in either written or oral communications.
   (6) Be extremely adept at organizing workload, assigning tasks, and mentoring civilian and military subordinates.
   d. Special qualification required of FA 52 officers. FA 52 officers must qualify for a top secret security clearance in
accordance with AR 380–67. Officers must also possess the ability to maintain the top secret/sensitive compartmented
information access throughout their careers.
29–3. Officer development
   a. Officer development model. The officer development model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a Warrior Ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments. FA 52 officers may come from any basic branch.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation, beginning at the 5th year, under the VTIP for FA 52 develops both specific and broad
functional competencies. FA 52 officers are designated beginning at the 5th year after completion of a branch KD
assignment because it seeks officers who are well-grounded in tactical-level planning and who understand the
capabilities and limitations of the Army Operating Force.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive for training, education and
assignments that will broaden and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These broadening
opportunities may be outside one’s normal branch or FA career development, and are JIIM in nature. Because of the
organizations supported by FA 52 officers, many of these JIIM opportunities will occur as part of their normal FA
career development.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force (regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth).
   (6) Flexible timelines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   b. Lieutenants and captain development prior to functional designation. Experience gained by lieutenants and
captains during basic branch assignments, and to a lesser degree, company grade branch immaterial assignments, serves
as the foundation for future effectiveness for FA 52 officers. All officers will attend a branch CCC and are required to
be serving in a KD experience prior to being eligible to apply for functional designation under the VTIP process
beginning at the 5th year of commissioned service. When considering electing FA 52 as their preferences for a VTIP
panel, an officer’s desire to serve in the FA and the aptitude for advanced civil schooling in a nuclear or combating
WMD related field provide the most important indicators for long-term success in the field. The FA actively recruits
officers with mathematics, science or engineering (MSE) academic backgrounds because those fields best prepare
officers to serve in technical FA 52 assignments. While any MSE degree is acceptable for minimum entry-level
qualification, historically, officers with academic backgrounds in physics, nuclear engineering, CM engineering, and
mechanical engineering have found their undergraduate backgrounds best prepare an individual for FA 52 assignments
and advanced civil schooling. The FA also seeks officers who have company grade experience in areas related to
WMD. There are some direct applications of company grade WMD operational skills from officers from the basic
branches of CM (BR 74), EOD (AOC 89E), Special Operations (BR18), Medical Service Corps (AOC 72A), and
Military Intelligence (BR 35). Officers from any basic branch who have prior service in WMD Civil Support Teams
(CST) will find many CST skills directly applicable to FA 52. Officers who are attending or have attended advanced
education programs in support of the Rotating Faculty program, particularly in support of the Department of Physics
and Nuclear Engineering or the Department of Chemistry and Life Sciences, could be given special emphasis during
the VTIP process. Individuals who have, through any other program, received an advanced degree in any of the
academic disciplines listed above could also be given special emphasis during the VTIP processes.
   c. Post functional designation captains and majors development. In accordance with the CSA’s vision for OPMS,
there are no prescriptive developmental paths for the future Army officer corps. FA 52 officers should complete the
ILE Common Core curriculum and the FA 52 qualification course, the Nuclear and Counterproliferation Officer Course
(NCP52) to become initially qualified as an FA 52 officer. The FA 52 career manager will work with individual
officers to enhance their professional development and meet Army requirements. Most FA 52 officers will initially
serve in entry-level positions in Defense Agencies, either the Defense Threat Reduction Agency or the Defense
Intelligence Agency, or in an ACOM, primarily in the 20th Support Command (CBRNE), where they will work in staff
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            295

positions across all of the mission areas of combating WMD. FA 52 majors who have not completed ILE will not be
considered for additional developmental opportunities until this requirement is met.
   (1) Education and training.
   (a) Graduate degree. All FA 52 officers who meet the academic prerequisites and have an acceptable military
manner of performance will have the opportunity to receive some form of fully funded advanced civilian schooling.
These programs include the Air Force Institute of Technology, the National IntelligenceUniversity, the Naval Postgrad-
uate School and other public andprivate institutions which provide masters level degrees in nuclear, nuclearrelated and
Combating WMD related disciplines. FA 52 officers wishing to attend other institutions should contact the FA 52
career manager at HRC or the FA 52 proponent manager at USANCA for guidance on school selection. The FA 52
career manager will guide officers during the application process.
   1. Air Force Institute of Technology. The Department of Engineering Physics, Graduate School of Engineering and
Management at the Air Force Institute of Technology, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH., provides the opportunity
for a number of FA 52 officers to begin advanced civil schooling each academic year. While the majority of FA 52
officers attending Air Force Institute of Technology will enroll in the Graduate Nuclear Engineering (GNE) program,
some officers, based upon academic background and desire, may enroll in the Combating WMD Technology program
(nuclear, biological or CM tracks) or the Applied Physics program. Air Force Institute of Technology programs for FA
52 officers may be found at: http://www.afit.edu/en/enp/Degrees.htm.
   2. The National Intelligence University. The National Intelligence University, located in the Defense Intelligence
Agency Center, Bolling, Air Force Base provides the opportunity for a number of FA 52 officers to enroll in either the
Master of Science in Technical Intelligence or the Master of Science Strategic Intelligence program each academic
year. FA 52 officers enrolled in Master of Science in Strategic Intelligence or Master of Science in Technical
Intelligence will, based upon course availability, enroll in the “Transnational Threats: Intelligence Challenges” area of
study with the focus being available WMD related and Science and Technology electives. FA 52 officers enrolled in
Master of Science in Strategic Intelligence or Master of Science in Technical Intelligence should coordinate directly
with the FA 52 Chair at National Intelligence University for thesis selection. National Intelligence University programs
for FA 52 officers may be found at: http://www.ndic.edu/mssi/mssi.htm.
   3. Naval Postgraduate School. The Department of National Security Affairs, and its affiliated Institutes and Centers,
at the Naval Postgraduate School, located in Monterrey, CA, provides the opportunity for a limited number of FA 52
officers to begin advanced civil schooling each year. FA 52 officers enrolled in the Master of Arts in National Security
Affairs may enroll in any of the WMD related programs at Naval Postgraduate School that include “Defense Decision-
Making and Planning”, “Homeland Security and Defense”, or “Combating Terrorism - Plans and Strategy”. FA 52
officers enrolled at Naval Postgraduate School will enroll in, as available, specific WMD and proliferation related
electives. Naval Postgraduate School programs for FA 52 officers may be found at:http://www.nps.edu/Academics/
GeneralCatalog/Home.htm.
   4. Other academic institutions. A limited number of FA 52 officers may, based upon availability of resources, be
allowed to attend FA 52 sponsored advanced civilian schooling at academic institutions not listed in i. to iii. above.
Direct coordination with the FA 52 Proponent Manager is required to determine the availability of funding and
approval of institution and program of study. Officers attending advanced civilian schooling in support of one of the
academic departments at USMA who desire input on selection of an academic program that would also support later
service as an FA 52 officer may contact the FA 52 Proponent Manager at USANCA for input, if desired.
   (b) Intermediate Level Education. ILE Common Core Course curriculum is a 16-week course taught by the
Command and General Staff Officer College at selected remote campus locations. ILE Common Core inculcates all
field grade officers with a Warrior Ethos and warfighting focus and prepares them for positions in the Army and JIIM
environments executing full spectrum operations. Currently, all FA 52 officers attend the 16 week ILE Common Core
in residence, or in the ILE Common Core Distant Education course based upon their selection by the annual ILE
Board. All FA 52 should attend the Nuclear and Counterproliferation Officer Course (NCP52) at their earliest
opportunity, normally enroute to their first FA 52 assignment. NCP52 is currently a 4 week course taught at the
Defense Nuclear Weapons School (DNWS), Kirtland Air Force Base, NM. Successful completion of ILE CCC and
NCP52 will provide FA 52 officers with their MEL–4 qualification.
   (c) Other Service command and staff colleges. On an exception basis, FA 52 officers may attend MEL–4 producing
programs of the other services. Due to its unique content, the preferred course for FA 52 officers is the Naval
Command and Staff College. Officers attending this program will receive a master’s degree in strategy and policy, a
program very similar to the national security master’s program at the Naval Postgraduate School.
   (d) USMA instructors. Prior to becoming eligible for the VTIP process, some officers will be selected to serve as
instructors at USMA and will attend Advanced Civilian Schooling Programs at the purview of USMA. The proponent
for this process is USMA and any instructors who wish to later become an FA 52 officer should coordinate through the
FA 52 career manager at HRC. While the vast majority of USMA instructors who become FA 52 officers are found in
either the Department of Physics and Nuclear Engineering and the Department of Chemistry and Life Sciences,
instructors in any academic departments may request to functional designation into FA 52.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. A KD position is one that is deemed fundamental to the development of an
296                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

Officer in his or her FA competencies or deemed critical by the senior Army leadership to provide experience across
the Army’s strategic mission. All FA 52 billets are coded as KD equivalents so that officer management focuses upon
ensuring continuity to supported commands and ensuring that promotions and selection within the FA 52 community
are based solely upon manner of performance and competency development.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. All officer positions are developmental. They enhance some aspect
of warfighting skills, increase officers’ levels of responsibility, develop their understanding of interoperability among
Army branches, or expose them to branch-related generating force/JIIM opportunities that directly contribute to success
as an agile and adaptive leader. Broadening assignments develop a wider range of knowledge and skills, augment
understanding of the full spectrum of Army missions, promote practical application of language training or increase
cross-cultural exposure, and expand officer awareness of other governmental agencies, units or environments. Since all
FA 52 billets are KD, FA 52 treats developmental positions as those external to the FA or filled prior to functional
designation. By the nature of the five FA 52 functional competencies and authorized billets, many FA 52-coded
positions fall within the “Broadening” assignments subfield of Army developmental positions.
   (4) Self-development. The complex and changing nature of the nuclear and combating WMD areas require continu-
ous self-development by FA 52 officers. Officers are encouraged to enroll in available resident and distant education
training opportunities to remain current in WMD related issues. Functional training courses are abundant and available,
and, in most cases, have no tuition expenses. FA 52 officers should register for and utilize the resources available in
the FA 52 Community folder of the USANCA Knowledge Center on AKO. Among the available resources are listings
of available functional training courses. Finally, FA 52 officers are strongly encouraged to embark on a continuous
program of professional readings. General information regarding a FA 52 professional reading list and training
opportunities is found in Appendix E of the Nuclear and Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction Handbook.
   (5) Desired experience. FA 52 officers can have expected to serve in at least two of the five functional com-
petencies by the time they become senior majors. Foremost, mid-grade FA 52 officers must continue to develop their
skills across the spectrum of these functional competencies through repetitive assignments within the FA 52 force
structure. Further, FA 52 officers are expected to have completed the educational and training requirements listed
above before entering their primary zone consideration for lieutenant colonel.
   d. Lieutenant colonel development. Development as a FA 52 lieutenant colonel focuses upon gaining additional
exposure and a broader understanding of all five functional competencies. As a minimum, FA 52 lieutenant colonels
are expected to apply the functional competencies developed as a captain/major to senior-level national security and
interagency staffs.
   (1) Education. No education is mandated beyond that listed within the captain/major development path. However,
FA 52 provides the opportunity for some of its officers to pursue higher-level academic programs to support
requirements for that expertise in FA 52 supported organizations. FA 52 officers who participate in these academic
programs must realize that they will be foregoing, at a minimum, 3 years of FA 52 development and experience.
   (a) Joint and Defense PhD requirements. A limited number of requirements exist in JIIM organizations for FA 52
officers with PhDs in nuclear and combating WMD related disciplines. Similar to FA 52 sponsored masters programs,
limited opportunities exist for FA 52 officers with the appropriate academic background and FA 52 manner of
performance to attend full-funded advanced civil schooling at the PhD level. As with other FA 52 sponsored academic
programs, the school options under this program are limited, both in number and in cost. Individuals desiring to pursue
an FA 52 sponsored PhD program should coordinate directly with the FA 52 Proponent Manager for both availability
and desired program of study. In most cases, participation in an FA 52 sponsored PhD program has a directed initial
utilization tour immediately following completion of the program of study.
   (b) USMA Rotating PhD Faculty Program. A limited number of requirements exist for FA 52 officers with PhDs to
serve on the rotating faculty at USMA. While the majority of these positions are in the Department of Physics and
Nuclear Engineering and the Department of Chemistry and Life Sciences, FA 52 officer may serve in other academic
departments on a limited basis. Officers attending USMA sponsored educational programs will coordinate directly with
the department sponsoring the education for advice on academic discipline, school of choice and desired academic
focus. Though not required, most FA 52 officers participating in this program will have served on the USMA rotating
faculty at the MS level earlier in their career.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Same as above. All FA 52 billets are coded as KD equivalents.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Same as above.
   (4) Self-development. Same as above.
   (5) Desired experience. FA 52 lieutenant colonels are expected to master the five functional competencies by the
time they become senior lieutenant colonels, even if they have not had the opportunity to serve in each individual
competency. FA 52 lieutenant colonels should have, as a minimum, served in three of the five functional competencies.
As a function of ensuring a broad development across the FA 52 functional competencies, all FA 52 lieutenant colonels
should have completed at least one joint or interagency tour and at least two complete FA 52 assignments (approxi-
mately 6 years of experience) throughout the force prior to their PZ consideration for colonel.
   e. Colonel development. With the exception of select transfers, FA 52 colonels normally will have successfully
completed at least two previous Nuclear and Counterproliferation assignments before being assigned into a FA 52
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            297

position. Because of the relatively small number of FA 52 colonel positions, FA 52 colonels can expect to serve in a
variety of national-level positions based upon their previously developed FA 52 skills and experience. Though limited,
some FA 52 colonels can expect to serve outside of FA 52 to meet Army branch immaterial requirements.
29–4. Warrant officer development
There are no warrant officers in FA 52.
                                    Figure 29–1. FA 52 life-cycle development model (AA)
29–5. Reserve Component officers
   a. Career development. RC FA 52, Nuclear and Counterproliferation officer development objectives and desired
experiences will generally parallel AA FA 52 officers. Officers in the USAR AGR program and officers within the RA
will be developed to one Federal standard. The challenge for the Army is to match the unique skills and expertise of
civilian professionals with mission needs and requirements. RC FA 52 officers must be afforded military education and
assignment opportunities so that senior military and civilian leaders can leverage the unique capabilities that exist
among RC FA 52 officers. The goal is to build a talented and fully integrated FA 52 community within the Total
Army, the Joint force, and the U.S. Government.
   b. Assignment opportunities. RC FA 52 officers can expect assignment opportunities similar to those of AA officers.
In addition, there are positions exclusive to the Reserves and National Guard that exist in organizations that support the
mission areas of combating WMD. Whether through mobilization of TPUs, mobilization tours for IMAs, extended
active duty assignments, or the limited call to active duty program (see below), or traditional RC service, RC FA 52
officers may serve at all levels within the Army, Joint community, and DOD. The success of a RC FA 52 officer is not
measured by length of service in any one component or control group, but by the officer’s experience, abilities, and
performance. FA 52 assignments are made based upon the availability and qualifications of individual USAR, AGR,
and IMA officers coupled with military necessity and requirements. Civilian-acquired skills, advanced military and
civilian education, and demonstrated abilities to function in the nuclear and combating WMD community exist among
a diverse pool of RC FA 52 officers.
   c. Call to active duty. Interested RC officers are encouraged to pursue the call to active duty program. This enables
RC officers to re-enter the AA while maintaining continuity of service. Once accessed into the AA, call to active duty
298                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

officers are assigned, promoted, and educated in the AA. Those officers who are interested should contact the active
duty FA 52 career manager.
   d. RC FA 52 developmental opportunities.
   (1) A diverse and fluid career. The competing demands of civilian and military life pose a challenge for the
professional development of the FA 59 RC strategist. RC strategists should follow AA officer development patterns as
closely as possible. However, a FA 52 RC officer’s development and assignment progression can be characterized by
its ability to adapt to changes. Civilian professional development can benefit the Total Army, and should be leveraged.
To meet military career development objectives, RC officers must be willing to rotate between ARNG and USAR
TPU, IRR, IMA program, and the AGR programs. These transfers are necessitated by individual career paths, military
requirements, geographical considerations, and the need to provide as many officers as possible the opportunity to
serve with troops in leadership and staff positions. The RC strategist should expect numerous and rewarding transitions
from civilian to military life. It is important to be flexible and weigh various options as assignments and schools come
available. FA 52s should seek TDY assignments and/or mobilization as an IMA. Mobilized TPUs will present
opportunities. Transferring to the IRR may be necessary while completing mandatory military educational requirements
necessary to build a career and advance as a FA 52 RC officer. RC strategists should contact the FA 52 RC career
manager to review options and opportunities.
   (2) Education and training. Due to the complexity and diversity of assignments in the FA 52 field, RC officers must
continually develop their knowledge and analytical skills. RC FA 52 officers will be offered opportunities to pursue
training opportunities to improve their functional skills. RC FA 52 officers should attend the Nuclear and Coun-
terproliferation Officer Course (NCP52) at their earliest opportunity and complete RC ILE in accordance to current RC
policy. RC officers will have increased time windows to complete requirements.
   e. Life-cycle development model. The life-cycle development model for FA 52 RC officers mirrors that for AA
officers, except that assignments may not be limited to one component or control group. Figure 29–2 illustrates a
typical RC FA 52 career.

Chapter 30
Force Management functional area
30–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. Force Management is a critical operating function for the Army. It encompasses the many processes that
generate future requirements and ensure the Army is efficiently and effectively organized, manned, equipped, trained,
and sustained Force Management provides trained and ready forces to Combatant Commands, now and in the future.
FA 50 officers—Army Force Managers—understand the art and science of “how the Army runs.” The Force Manage-
ment FA provides critically skilled officers who integrate and implement changes to the force. FA 50 officers translate
strategy into structure while advising Army leaders on the second- and third order effects of their Force Management
decisions. They are self-disciplined, strategic thinkers. Most of all, FA 50s are problem solvers for Army and Joint
senior leaders.
   b. Proponency. FA 50 (Force Management) is managed within the Operations Support functional category. The
DCS, G–8 is the proponent for FA 50. The Director of Force Development is appointed as executive agent. For more
information, contact the FA 50 Personnel Development Office (PDO), Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G–8,
Directorate of Force Development, 700 Army Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310–0700, The Web site is http://www.
fa50.army.mil. FA 50 is also on Facebook at www.facebook.com/army.fa50 and AKO at https://www.us.army.mil/
suite/page/194547.
   (1) Officers are encouraged to contact the PDO for general professional development advice and information as well
as for education, training, and other opportunities. Officers should also maintain a close dialogue with the FA 50 HRC
assignment officer/career manager.
   (2) HRC directly manages AC and USAR Title 10 AGR officers (lieutenant colonel and below). USAR manages
USAR officers’ assignments and professional development opportunities. ARNG manages all ARNG FA 50 officers,
including AGRs.
   c. Functions. Force Management officers lead and execute the organizational and materiel changes that are funda-
mental to Army Modernization. These officers are critical to accomplishing the Army’s Title 10 responsibilities for
organizing, manning, training, equipping, and supporting land combat forces. FA 50s are highly educated and trusted
advisors who serve as the Army’s subject matter experts on the technical processes of requirement management,
documentation, and budgeting. They are experts at Force Development, the process of defining the force by determin-
ing warfighting requirements, designing operational and institutional force structure, identifying and allocating author-
ized resources, and analyzing second and third order effects of changes to requirements, structure and resources; Force
Integration, building the force through the synchronization of resources required to support ARFORGEN and ensure
the Current Force is properly organized, manned, equipped, trained, and sustained; and Force Generation, the proce-
dures and processes at Joint and operational Army levels to plan for, request, mobilize, deploy and redeploy forces. FA
50 officers serve primarily at the Joint Staff; Joint Command headquarters; DCS, G–3/5/7 and DCS, G–8; ACOMs and
ASCCs; theater Army headquarters, and the corps and division headquarters.
30–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the basic characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for the 21st century. Characteristics such as a successful basic
branch record and an advanced degree in management and policy best serve as force managers. Our leaders must be
grounded in Army Values and the Warrior Ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to
operate across the spectrum of conflict. They must be able to operate in JIIM environments, and leverage capabilities
beyond the Army to achieve Army objectives. Further explanation of these characteristics can be found in FM 3–0 and
in chapter 2 of this publication.
   b. Functional competencies. Force Management is a demanding and rewarding career field that provides officers an
opportunity to directly assist and influence the development of the Army for the future as well as its current operations.
A Force Management officer:
   (1) Designs organizations to support Army and Joint warfighting concepts, doctrine, and requirements.
   (2) Supports the development of TOE, Basis-of-Issue Plans (BOIP), and Manpower Requirements Criteria.
   (3) Determines the structure and composition of Army operating and generating forces through the Total Army
Analysis process.
   (4) Determines Army and unit manpower and equipment allocations within the Planning, Programming, Budgeting,
and Execution (PPBE) system.
   (5) Develops, synchronizes and executes organizational authorizations (TDAs and modification TOEs). Conducts
affordability, supportability, and ongoing operational assessments; and adjusts execution of programs through the
Concept Plan and Command Plan processes.
300                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (6) Coordinates unit activations, inactivations, reorganizations and redesignations.
   (7) Develops, processes and analyzes Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statements (JUONS) and Operational Needs
Statements (ONS); operates within the Rapid Acquisition Process.
   (8) Analyzes cost effectiveness of personnel and materiel changes.
   (9) Develops requirements for new training programs, training devices and simulations.
   (10) Determines cost effectiveness and risk mitigation factors.
   (11) Develops and synchronizes new equipment fielding plans and new equipment training.
   (12) Assists operational planners in the identification, requesting and tracking the movement of Army Forces into
and out of a combatant commander’s area of responsibility.
   (13) Develops and synchronizes Army Stationing plans for units.
   c. Required skills. The Force Management FA requires officers to be strategic problem solvers who are skilled in
leadership at all levels; who understand military operations; who possess strong Army Values, leader attributes and
skills; and who fully understand the key leadership actions that must be taken to adapt the Army as change occurs.
Force Management officers also have the technical aptitude necessary to grasp complex, abstract ideas. Force Manage-
ment officers at all levels must be able to:
   (1) Operate routinely in high-level staff assignments where guidance may be minimal and close interaction with
senior-level decision makers is frequent.
   (2) Express their ideas clearly, concisely, and accurately in both oral and written communication.
   (3) Thoroughly develop and clearly articulate recommendations, and potential second and third order effects, to
senior-level decision makers.
   (4) Reduce raw data for effective use by senior-level decision makers.
   (5) Organize, integrate, and lead work groups of military and civilian specialists to solve specific force management
problems.
   (6) Conduct innovative research on evolving force management processes or developmental Army systems or
capabilities.
   (7) Operate independently when on broadening assignments and present a positive representation of the FA and the
Army.
   d. Unique knowledge and skills. As the Army’s subject matter experts on organizational and materiel change, Force
Management officers require detailed knowledge of Army organization, structure, and doctrine. FA 50 officers must
possess a thorough understanding of—
   (1) Army Force Management processes, gained through specialized education and training and through varied Force
Management assignments at operational and strategic levels of the Army.
   (2) The organization of the Army, ARNG, and USAR, their Title 10 and Title 32 USC responsibilities, and the
missions, roles and functions of their major commands.
   (3) The Defense Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.
   (4) The organization of the DOD; the principal strategic planning documents (National Military Strategy, National
Defense Strategy, National Security Strategy, and Defense Planning Guidance). joint warfighting concepts; the Joint
Strategic Planning System; and the formal and informal procedures and processes for resourcing DOD and the
Services.
   (5) How national issues, including political, military, economic, social, intergovernmental, and international/multina-
tional challenges influence Army and Joint Force Management.
   e. Accession into FA 50. FA 50 seeks field grade and senior company grade officers of all branches who are well-
grounded in tactical-level planning and who understand the capabilities and limitations of the Army Operating Force. It
is highly desired that officers have exhibited, through performance and job selection, the skills or aptitude to develop
the skills described in this section. Functional designation is currently accomplished via the VTIP for officers at their
seventh year of service or later. Details of VTIP are explained in chapter 3 of this publication. Officers desiring to join
FA 50 should monitor the quarterly VTIP announcements from HRC. Prior to accession into a FA, officers should gain
branch technical and tactical skills and gain important leadership experience in key and developmental (KD) company
grade assignments. Officers must be considered basic branch qualified before accession into FA 50. Officers with a
masters degree in business management or administration area are highly desirable.
30–3. Officer development and assignments
   a. Officer development model. The officer development model focuses on encouraging a wide range and variety of
experience, rather than on specific gates or assignments required to progress. Flexible assignment timelines enable
officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring adequate time to gain skills and experience and also
support unit readiness and cohesion.
   b. FA development. The AA, Title10 ARNG AGR, or 10 USAR AGR Force Management officer typically begins
his or her FA career by attending the 14-week FA 50 Qualification Course followed by an initial assignment at HQDA
or a three- or four-star level headquarters to develop a deep understanding of force management processes and to
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             301

enhance future utility in subsequent assignments at operational Army level. Following this initial assignment, the Force
Management Officer should seek to broaden and hone skills, knowledge, and experiences at every grade. For FA 50
majors, for example, the “1-of-1” positions at the divisional level are considered to be particularly important and
challenging developmental assignments. Success depends not on the number or type of positions held, but rather the
quality of duty performance in every assignment. Force Management Officers can increase their expertise and broaden
their skill sets by seeking subsequent assignments that alternate between operating and generating forces and across
echelons between Army Staff, ACOM, Operational Units (ASCC, Corps, Division), and Joint levels as they progress
through their careers.
   (1) The FA 50 Qualification Course. All officers designated into FA 50 since 2005 must complete the FA 50
Qualification Course within 12 months of designation. This course is the functional qualification phase of ILE, and is
required for an officer to be considered functionally qualified for promotion. Completion of the Qualification Course is
highly desired prior to the initial FA 50 assignment. It must be completed prior to consideration for advanced civil
schooling, Training With Industry or any Intern/fellowships. Officers assigned to the National Capital Region will sign
in to their organizations prior to attendance. Others will likely attend in a TDY-and-return or TDY enroute status.
   (a) The FA 50 Qualification Course is 14 weeks of Force Management study taught by the Army Force Manage-
ment School at Fort Belvoir, VA. The first 4 weeks of the FA 50 Qualification Course coincide with the Army Force
Management Course, and provide a basic understanding of the logical flow from strategic guidance to operational
concepts, requirements determination, capabilities-based assessments, organizational design and documentation, equip-
ment and manpower resourcing, and materiel acquisition and fielding. The following 10 weeks incorporate an intense
focus on the principles of Army force development and force integration, practical exercises, and the Joint Capabilities
Requirements Managers course.
   (b) Because DOD and DA-level policies and force management processes are constantly changing, officers who
transfer to FA 50 and have attended the 4-week Army Force Management Course within 1 year may request to attend
weeks 5–14 only. Officers who transferred into the FA prior to 2005 and have completed the 4-week Army Force
Management Course, are strongly encouraged though not required to attend the full 14 week course. Officers who have
not attended Army Force Management Course, or who did so more than a year previous, must attend the full 14 week
Qualification Course.
   (2) Broadening opportunities are offered for all FA 50 officers. All FA 50 broadening opportunities are internally
board selected. FA 50 views their officers selected for limited graduate and fellow programs as above their peers in
performance and potential. Officers are encouraged to pursue such opportunities. These experiences should enhance the
adaptability and intellectual scope of officers for the diverse and evolving needs of the present and future Army. This
publication, describes broadening experiences in four categories. Officers can read the descriptions in chapter 3 of this
publication. The FA 50 PDO and HRC assignment officer continues to identify options in all four categories and will
support officers who identify and desire to pursue an experience in any category. FA 50 officers specific options in the
Academia and Civilian Enterprise category as explained here.
   (a) Advanced Civil Schooling. FA 50 majors may compete for a fully funded master’s degree once they are FA
qualified. Any MA or MS program in a field that supports the work of an Army force manager (for example, Business
Administration, Systems Management Administration, Industrial Engineering, Organizational Management, Project
Management, Public Policy Administration, Procurement and Contract Management, and so forth) should be consid-
ered. Officers assessed into the Advanced Civilian Schooling Program incur an ADSO upon completion of their
studies, in accordance with AR 350–100. The officer must meet the minimum standards outlined in AR 621–1.
   (b) Fellowships. After becoming functionally qualified, FA 50 majors may compete for any Army sponsored
Fellowship open to the FA. For example, FA 50 regularly sends officers to serve a 12-month tour with MITRE
Corporation and the RAND Arroyo Center. A post MEL 1 fellowship for colonels is at Northwestern University
Kellogg School of Management. Upon successful completion of the 1-year tour, the officer incurs an ADSO in
accordance with AR 621–7. Qualified officers may also apply for the Joint Chiefs of Staff/OSD/Army Staff Internship
Program, Army Congressional Fellowships and other opportunities. Interested officers undergo a rigorous selection
process to ensure that the best-qualified officers represent the force management community. Officers interested in
competing for a Fellowship must meet the requirements outlined in AR 621–7 and the specific requirements of each
program.
   (c) Training With Industry. FA 50 also has a Training With Industry arrangement with the FEDEX Corporation and
is developing additional opportunities. Participants (currently 1 officer per year) spend a year at the corporate
headquarters in Memphis, TN and various places within the organization, to observe and learn state-of-the-art
organizational and management skills useful to the Army, and to represent the Army to industry.
   (d) Broadening assignments. Broadening Opportunity Programs are governed by AR 621–7 and AR 621–1.
Broadening Opportunity Programs are defined as: The purposeful expansion of a Leader’s capabilities and understand-
ing provided through opportunities internal and external to the Army throughout their career, gained through experi-
ences and/or education in different organizational cultures and environments resulting in a leader who can operate up to
and including the strategic level in multiple environments. Officers are encouraged to seek Broadening Opportunity
Programs that vary both in type and echelon of major headquarters, achieve a balance between strategic, generating and
operational force levels. There are also Broadening Opportunity Programs in the academic world, civilian industry,
302                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

Joint/Multinational commands, various levels of government and other federal agencies. Short and long-term assign-
ments are available and all FA 50 officers are encouraged to compete for these opportunities. Broadening opportunities
may vary in scope, responsibility, and developmental outcomes and typically fall in four major categories listed as
follows: 1. Functional/Institutional. 2. Academia and Civilian Enterprise. 3. Joint/Multinational. 4. Interagency/Inter-
governmental. ARNG Title 10 AGR FA 50s are limited to participate in Functional/Institutional and Joint/Multinational
broadening assignments.
   (3) Self-development. Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportu-
nities to develop both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers
in an expeditionary force—regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and all
other elements of the governmental cooperative structure. The ever changing nature of the Army requires extensive
self-development by Force Managers. FA 50 officers are strongly encouraged to seek out nonresident educational
opportunities offered by the Army and other Services. Officers are also encouraged to embark on a continuous personal
program of study and professional readings. The Army Career Tracker (www.actnow.army.mil) has been developed
and implemented to aid with mentorship and career development. Officers are encouraged to utilize this tool to the
fullest extent possible. As senior leader guidance changes so will FA 50 education and qualification requirements.
Therefore, it is recommended that all YG2000 and later majors and lieutenant colonels complete the Defense Strategy
Course. MEL 1/SSC graduates are not authorized enrollment. This is a 6-month online distance education course that is
offered twice each year. Fifty active duty, 25 U.S. Army Reserve, and 25 ARNG officers may participate in each
course. The course focuses on improving student understanding of the National Security Strategy of the United States
in a complex and changing environment. Interested officers may contact the FA 50 PDO or the HRC career manager,
or apply through command channels. Completion of Defense Strategy Course will confer ASI 6Z (Strategic Studies
Graduate). Go to http://dde.carlisle.army.mil/dsc.htm for more information.
   c. Lieutenant and captain development prior to functional designation. FA 50 does not currently have Lieutenant
positions and there are very few captain positions, but the tactical, operational and leadership experience gained during
basic branch, company grade assignments provide the foundation for future effectiveness as FA 50 officers. Officers
must be considered basic branch qualified before accession into FA 50.
   d. Captain development. FA 50 officers are typically completing their last basic branch assignment, and then attend
the FA 50 Qualification Course before their initial force management assignment. However, ACC captains desiring to
serve in a force management assignment prior to or upon functional designation should work directly with the HRC FA
50 career manager concerning options for the last company grade assignment prior to consideration for promotion to
major. All FA 50 captain positions are considered developmental assignments, that is, fundamental to the development
of the officer’s FA competencies. Positions are normally located at the Army Staff, ACOM, and Operational (ASCC)
levels, which allows the FA 50 captain to be directly mentored by a larger population of more senior and experienced
force managers. Additional short-term broadening assignments are being developed, and FA 50 captains are encour-
aged to compete for these opportunities.
   e. Major development. Majors serve as force management specialists or as individual action officers with specific
focus in force management areas of responsibility. Officers should seek force management assignments that provide
additional breadth to their experiences and skill sets, and should strive to serve in positions that exercise force
development or force integration processes at several levels. To be considered functionally qualified at the rank of
major an officer must complete the following requirements:
   (1) Education.
   (a) Intermediate Level Education Common Core. All FA officers are required to complete ILE prior to the 15th year
of commissioned service. ILE provides a quality education for all field grade officers and prepares them for their next
10 years of service. The ILE Common Core Course is taught at Fort Leavenworth and at selected satellite locations by
the Command and General Staff College. Officers selected for resident attendance will complete ILE either at
Leavenworth or at a resident 14 week satellite campus. Officers not selected for resident attendance will complete ILE
by ADL.
   (b) FA 50 Qualification Course. Most officers complete the FA 50 Qualification Course as a major. The ILE
Common Core and the FA 50 Qualification Course provide the officer the required training and education for
intermediate career education requirements and JPME 1 qualification.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. All FA 50 major positions are considered KD. KD positions are specified
positions that are considered fundamental to the development of the officer’s FA competencies or deemed critical by
the senior Army leadership. FA 50 majors, as a minimum, should complete at least 24 months in one or more of the
following KD positions:
   (a) Force Modernization officer/Force Management officer at division.
   (b) Requirements synchronization officer at DCS, G–3/5/7.
   (c) Force Management officer at ACOM/ASCC, DCS, G–3/5/7 or DCS, G–8, or ARNG Force Management (FM)
Division.
   (d) System synchronization officer at DCS, G–8.
   (e) Joint Force Manager at a Joint Command, Joint Staff J8 or at DCS, G–8.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            303

   (3) Broadening opportunities. Officers are encouraged to broaden their expertise through opportunities described in
preceding information in paragraph 30–3b(2). Related broadening assignments might be:
   (a) Nominative assignments. Opportunities to compete for nominative assignments outside of the FA are available to
the Force Management officers to the extent that the FA can support. However, the Army’s intent is to utilize its Force
Managers in positions that make the best use of their force management experience.
   (b) Joint duty. FA 50 positions also exist on the Joint duty assignment list for major and above. Officers seeking
assignments at the Joint commands, Joint Chiefs of Staff, or OSD should first successfully complete at least one Army
Force Management assignment, preferably at the HQDA or ACOM staff level.
   (c) Operational Force Management. FA 50 officers should be aware that, because of their training and experience
and their unique skills as “problem solvers,” many officers, particularly majors, find themselves performing duties
related to operational-level planning, readiness reporting and other areas outside the typical scope of Army Force
Management duties and responsibilities. As with all assignments, successful performance is the benchmark.
   f. Lieutenant colonel development. Lieutenant colonels serve as force management supervisors and senior action
officers at major headquarters and HQDA. They are expected to have a broad understanding of the Army Force
Management Model, including the programmatic underpinnings of requirements determination, capabilities develop-
ment, force design, authorization and documentation, and resource programming and funding. They guide and review
the force management work of subordinates and apply analytical assessment techniques to a wide range of military
force management and managerial issues. Officers should seek force management assignments that provide additional
breadth to their experiences and skill sets, and should strive to serve in positions that exercise force development or
force integration processes at several levels. A masters degree in a force management related area, as described in
30–3b(2)(a), is significantly beneficial for an officer’s career.
   (1) Lieutenant colonel billets. To be considered functionally qualified at the rank of lieutenant colonel, an officer
should have completed the FA qualifications for major, including the FA 50 Qualification Course, and successfully
complete at least 24 months in a KD assignment or a CSL billet. A CSL billet is a duty assignment at the lieutenant
colonel-level requiring specific, highly developed skills and experience that is deemed so critical to the organization’s
mission that an officer is centrally selected. lieutenant colonels eligible for CSL selection will be contacted by the HRC
FA 50 manager. The following are examples of lieutenant colonel CSL billets: Chief, Force Management at Corps;
Chief, Force Integration Branch at ASCC; Chief, Structure Branch at ASCC. KD assignments are FA 50 coded
positions that are considered fundamental to the development of the officer’s FA competencies.
   (2) Broadening opportunities. Professional development and broadening assignments outside of the FA exist, as
discussed above under major development and, in paragraph 30–3b(2). Opportunities to compete for nominative
assignments are available to the extent that the FA can support. Joint experience is highly encouraged, though not
required for an FA 50 officer to be promoted to colonel. Officers seeking assignment opportunities within the Joint
Commands, Joint Chiefs of Staff, or OSD should first successfully complete at least one Army force management
assignment, preferably at the HQDA or ACOM/ASCC staff level.
   g. Colonel development. Colonels are considered members of the Army Strategic Leadership. The Chief of Staff’s
colonel assignment framework considers recent operational experience, Joint experience, enterprise management expo-
sure and experience, and input from the Army Senior Leadership. Army Staff experience is highly desirable. Experi-
ence in multiple geographic venues is encouraged. Officers should work with the colonels HR manager to assist them
in their career assignments and development.
   (1) Qualifications. FA 50 colonels should have broad Army and FA expertise. As senior force managers, colonels
serve in assignments requiring leadership, technical force management knowledge and managerial skills. They oversee
and direct complex force management efforts and analytical studies to determine the most feasible solutions to Army,
Joint, and DOD organizational, developmental and modernization issues. Colonels should have a broad background in
analytical processes, and are encouraged to possess the following qualifications:
   (a) Joint qualified (3A or 3L, and JPME 2).
   (b) SSC graduate.
   (c) Serve successfully in an FA 50 colonel FA authorized position.
   (2) Colonel billets. To be considered functionally qualified at the rank of colonel, an officer should have completed
the FA qualifications for lieutenant colonel and completed at least 24 months in a KD assignment or a CSL billet. A
CSL billet is a duty assignment at the colonel-level requiring specific, highly developed skills and experience that is
deemed so critical to the organization’s mission that an officer is centrally selected. Colonels eligible for CSL selection
will be contacted by the Senior Leader Development Office. The following are examples of colonel CSL billets: Chief,
Force Management Division at ASCC; and, Chief, Force Integration Division at ACOM. KD assignments are FA 50
coded positions that are considered fundamental to the development of the officer’s FA competencies.
   (3) Education. FA 50 colonels are also encouraged to attend one of the SSCs, resident or nonresident, or one of the
many available fellowships to obtain MEL SSC education status. An officer attending a fellowship should work with
the colonels’ HR manager in the Senior Leader Development Division to arrange attendance at JPME–II instruction
either prior to, or after, fellowship attendance.
   (a) Force managers who are eligible for SSC selection should consider the Dwight D. Eisenhower School for
304                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

National Security and Resource Strategy (formerly known as the Industrial College of the Armed Forces) at National
Defense University. The Eisenhower School’s focus on defense acquisition and strategic resourcing strongly supports
the skills and attributes of a successful force manager.
   (b) FA 50 colonels and promotable lieutenant colonels are strongly encouraged to participate in the annual Senior
Force Managers Seminar, hosted by the DCS, G–8. This seminar brings together senior FA 50 officers to discuss
current force management issues, meet with Army and industry leadership, and hone and expand their current
knowledge base in preparation for assignments as force management leaders on the Joint and Army Staffs, at the
ACOMs and ASCCs, DRUs or joint warfighting headquarters.
   (4) Broadening opportunities. Broadening opportunities described in paragraph 30–3b(2) are available to all FA 50
officers. Colonels are encouraged in their career plans to consider the post MEL FA 50 Fellowship at Northwestern
University Kellogg School of Management. More information can be found in the list of post MEL 1 fellowships, AR
621–7.
   (5) Self-development. There is a wide variety of schools and professional development opportunities available to an
officer serving at the grade of Colonel. The available list can be accessed at the senior leader Web site at http://www.
srleaders.army.mil or by contacting the HR manager.
   (6) Desired experiences. The CSA’s guidance for colonel assignments is discussed above. Younger officers, to
prepare themselves to serve at the rank of colonel, should pursue FA assignments that provide operational, Joint, and
Army Staff/Enterprise level experience.
   (7) Mentorship. Armywide, colonels are expected to help develop future leaders. Every effort should be made to
participate in the future FA 50 formalized mentorship program. The Army Career Tracker (www.actnow.army.mil) has
been developed and implemented for FA 50 officers to aid with mentorship and career development on an individual
basis.
                                   Figure 30–1. AA FA 50 life-cycle development model

   h. Life-cycle development model. Figure 30–1 shows typical sequences of assignments and training/education for an
AC FA 50 Force Management officer.
30–4. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
   a. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for the Force Management officer. FA 50’s goal is to sustain a cadre of highly-
qualified Force Management officers while providing a viable career path to colonel for high potential FA 50 officers.
The FA 50 officer inventory must be optimized and prioritized to fulfill Force Management’s current and future force
requirements while providing sufficient time for FA qualification, education and broadening prior to consideration for
promotion. The number of FA 50 authorizations, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions are made and actions
to implement them are taken.
   b. Assignment preferences and precedence. The assignment sequencing in a FA is not as rigid as that of a branch.
FA assignments should professionally develop FA 50 officers in a variety of environments. After receiving their initial
training, FA 50 officers should seek different types of responsibilities within the FA 50 force structure to provide
breadth to their experiences and professional development. Officers desiring more information on current authorizations
or inventory should contact the HRC FA 50 career manager/assignments officer.
   (1) Preferences. The FA 50 career development path provides for many diverse opportunities. The objective of these
opportunities is to develop FA 50 officers with the ability to help commanders and staffs achieve the full organizational
potential at increasing levels of responsibility in both Army and Joint assignments. Normally, officers will attend the
FA 50 Qualification Course prior to their initial assignment to an FA 50 position.
   (2) Precedence. Assignments to FA 50 positions in support of operational units will have precedence during this era
of persistent conflict. FA 50 officers will complete an Army FA 50 assignment before a Joint assignment. KD
assignments and key billets are discussed above for FA 50 majors, lieutenant colonels, and colonels.
   c. The Eight Personnel Life-Cycle Management Functions.
   (1) Structure. FA 50s serve at all higher echelons worldwide. Positions exist on the Army Staff, at ACOM and
ASCC headquarters, Combatant Commands, Joint Commands, and in the institutional Army. FA 50 is constantly
seeking new assignment opportunities for Force Management officers.
   (2) Acquisition. The criteria for selecting an officer into FA 50 include the needs of the Army, prior duty
performance, and personal preference. HRC, via MILPER messages, advises eligible year groups to submit their
preferences. Eligible officers are in their 4th or 7th year of commissioned service. FA 50 currently acquires most
officers at their 7th year.
   (3) Distribute. The FA 50 career manager at HRC manages ACC and USAR AGR FA 50 officers from functional
designation through the rank of lieutenant colonel. Once selected for colonel, the Senior Leadership Division gains
control over the FA 50 officer’s career path and assignments. Assignments will depend upon the needs of the Army,
professional development considerations, officer qualifications, and officer preference.
   (4) Develop. Throughout their Force Management career, officers will have the opportunity for training and further
professional development. This starts with the qualification course followed by continued development through
assignments, required courses, and lastly by the officer’s self-development efforts.
   (5) Deploy. FA 50s are Soldiers, and as such are deployable worldwide at any time to support operational
commanders and in support of other requirements. FA 50s may deploy with their units or as individuals as the mission
demands. FA 50s must prepare themselves and their Families for deployment.
   (6) Compensate. This function is not accomplished by the PDO, G–1 or HRC. The Defense Finance and Accounting
Service (DFAS) is responsible for compensation.
   (7) Sustain. Officers designated into the operations support functional category compete within their functional
category for promotion up to colonel.
   (8) Transition. FA 50s separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
30–5. Warrant officer development
There are no AA warrant officers managed under FA 50 at this time.
30–6. Reserve Component Force Management officers
   a. General. RC Force Management officers in the Title 10 AGR program in an active status perform the same roles
and missions as their AA counterparts. Officers in a Title 32 AGR program for the ARNG or in Reserve status, Title
32 M-day for ARNG or in Title 10 TPUs for USAR, perform similar but not identical roles as AA FA 50s. The roles
and missions Title 32 AGRs, Title 32 M-day and Title 10 TPU FA 50s perform are dependent upon the type and level
of the organizations they support. The unique nature of the reserve status RC officers’ roles as “citizen Soldiers” poses
challenges for professional development. Despite these challenges, RC officers are expected to follow AA officer
development patterns as closely as possible, with the exception that RC officers have increased windows to complete
306                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

mandatory educational requirements. To meet professional development objectives, RC officers in a reserve status
(ARNG and USAR Title 32 AGR, Title 32 M-day, or Title 10 TPU) must be willing to, whenever feasible, rotate
among ARNG units, USAR units, IRR, and IMA programs both within and outside of their respective components.
The AGR professional development assignments are managed separately by each component’s force programs director-
ate. However, Title 32 AGR professional development assignments are managed by the individual States and Territo-
ries. Geographical considerations and time on station, as well as the need to provide as many officers as possible the
opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions necessitate these transfers. Every attempt will be made
to assign RC Force Management officers in developmental positions. Unlike their AA counterparts, RC Force
Management officers may have to revert to basic branch assignments to continue their reserve participation and career
development. For guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7.
   b. Assignment opportunities. Title 10 AGR Force Management officers can expect assignment opportunities that
mirror those of AA officers, as well as positions applicable exclusively to the RC. Title 10 AGR FA 50 officers serve
at all levels within DOD, and must fully understand and be conversant with the roles, missions, and composition of the
RC as an integral component of the Total Army. The success of a Title 10 AGR Force Management officer is not
measured by length of service in any one component or control group, but by the officer’s breadth of experience, duty
performance, and adherence to FA requirements. Assignments in FA 50 are available throughout the RC (AGR, M-day,
TPU, and IMA).
   c. Assignment opportunities for RC FA 50s not in Title 10 AGR status. ARNG Title 32 AGR, Title 32 M-day, and
USAR TPU FA 50s’ assignment opportunities are not as broad as their Title 10 AGR and AA FA 50 counterparts. FA
50s are documented in the Divisions and Sustainment Commands for ARNG and throughout the USAR. In the USAR,
FA 50s are primarily found in the Major Subordinate Commands (major general level), USARC, OCAR, HQDA Staff
and Joint Staff. The majority of ARNG Title 32 officers can be found at individual State Joint Force Headquarters,
performing duties as Assistant Force Integration and Readiness Officer (AFIRO). Title 32 AGR officers are required to
belong to a federally recognized ARNG unit where they may serve in a force management capacity, per the
authorization document or as a basic branch assignment.
   d. Qualification and professional development. The RC Force Management officers satisfy FA qualification require-
ments and become competitive for promotion when they attend military schools and then seek assignments in positions
of increased responsibility.
   (1) Qualification. Requirements for qualification depend upon component and status. For RC officers of the USAR
and ARNG in the Title 10 AGR program, functional qualification and professional development requirements are the
same as for AA FA 50 officers as outlined in paragraph 30–3. For ARNG officers in Title 32 AGR or M-day status,
constructive credit may be used in accordance with AR 310–1 and submitted to the State or Territory of membership to
award the FA 50 AOC. Constructive credit consideration requirements are:
   (a) Have completed the 4-week AF Army Force Management Course.
   (b) Have completed the ARNG Force Management Course (2 weeks).
   (c) Have accumulated 2 years of force development/force integration experience in the past 5 years.
   (d) Receive endorsement from the Division Chief, Force Management (ARNG FM). Requests for constructive credit
award of FA 50 AOC will be made through ARNG FM and forwarded to the officer’s state headquarters to publish an
AOC order.
   (e) State award of constructive credit for functional qualification purposes may not meet AA/Title 10 AGR
requirements for a Soldier who subsequently changes status.
   (2) Professional development. The following standards listed below must be met for Title 32 AGR, Title 32 M-day,
and Title 10 TPU officers to be considered a qualified FA 50 for promotion to the next higher rank unless otherwise
noted. Length of service in a given position should not be narrowly construed; key is assignment diversity, level of
participation, diverse experiences and skill set and sufficient time within each assignment to develop competence:
   (a) Warrant officer through captain ranks. ARNG Title 32 warrant officers through captains are designated to fill FA
50 coded positions must attend the 2-week ARNG Force Management Course. Attendance to the 4-week Army Force
Management Course will enhance their professional development. Title 32 AGR, Title 32 M-day, and Title 10 TPU FA
50s warrant officers through captains have the opportunity to attend force management training at the Army Force
Management School and serve in FA 50A-coded positions, once they have completed any basic branch requirements
and schooling. The USAR does not have a FA 50 warrant officer program.
   (b) Major.
   1. Education.
   a. Majors must successfully complete the CCC and ILE Common Core. AGR Title 10 officers must complete the
FA 50 Qualification Course as part of their ILE requirement.
   b. Complete the 4-week Army Force Management Course. Further professional development opportunities include
the FA 50 Qualification Course and advanced civilian schooling/Training With Industry/RAND fellowships.
   2. Key developmental assignments. Title 32 AGR, Title 32 M-day, and Title 10 TPU majors as a minimum should
successfully serve in a 50A-coded position for 24 or more months in one or more of the following KD positions:
   a. Force Integration Readiness officer (ARNG).
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              307

   i. Force Management officer at operational, functional, and support commands (USAR).
   3. ARNG and USAR Title 10 AGR KD assignments at the O4 level, the following positions are deemed fundamen-
tal to the development of an officer in his or her FA competencies:
   a. System integrator (ARNG–RMQ/USARC/HQDA).
   b. Organization integrator (ARNG–FMC/FMS/FML/USARC).
   c. Force integrator (DAMO–FMF).
   d. Executive officer (FM division).
   e. Force Management officer (USAR operational, functional, training and support commands).
   f. Manpower requirements officer (USAR).
   (c) Lieutenant colonel.
   1. Successfully complete ILE Common Core and the Army Force Management Course.
   2. Serve successfully in a lieutenant colonel grade level, force management position. Optimally qualified officers
will have 24–36 months in a 50A position of which 12 months should be in an O5 position. KD positions are those at
HQDA, ARNG Readiness Center, OCAR, TRADOC, Joint Staff, or USARC Staff. Civilian Force Management service
such as time spent as a Career Program 26 Series (Manpower and Force Management) employee will be taken into
consideration. Civilian force management service must be annotated on the biography submitted to promotion boards.
   3. Officers are also encouraged to pursue additional non-MEL producing educational opportunities. Such as:
   a. AJPME (USAR).
   b. RC National Security Course (USAR).
   c. Defense Strategy Course (USAR).
   4. U.S. Army Reserve. At the O5 level, Division Chief, Branch Chief, at the two-star or higher-level operational/
functional, training and support commands and the Army Force Management School’s Deputy Commandant, are all
considered battalion command equivalent positions.
   a. Developmental assignments:
—    Force Integrator (OCAR).
—    Command Manager (HQDA).
—    Force Development Officer (ARCIC).
—    Org Integrator (HQDA), (USARC).
—    System Integrator (HQDA).
—    Equipment Portfolio Manager (OCAR).
   b. Key developmental positions:
— Division Chief (USARC/OCAR).
— Branch Chief (HQDA/USARC/OCAR).
— Deputy Commandant, Army Force Management (HQDA).
   5. Army National Guard. ARNG Title 10 AGR lieutenant colonel: As senior force managers, O5s are required to
serve successfully in a lieutenant colonel grade level, force management position. Qualified officers will have 24–36
months in a 50A-coded position. Opportunities to compete for nominative assignments at State level are available;
however the intent of the ARNG FM Division is to utilize its senior force managers in positions that make the best use
of their skills and experience. To be considered qualified at the rank of lieutenant colonel, an officer should complete
the FA qualifications for major, and successfully complete at least 24–36 months in one or more of the following key
billet positions or other leadership position that requires specific, highly developed skills and experiences, is critical to
the unit’s mission, exercises judgment and recommends actions to the commander, advises command regarding
potential impacts on resources utilization, and oversees processes that operate in a leadership environment.

   c. Chief, Maneuver Sustainment Branch (formerly known as Combat Service Support Branch).
   d. Chief, Future Force Integration Branch.
   e. Chief, Systems Integration Branch.
   (d) Colonel.
   1. Successfully complete ILE and the Army Force Management Course.
   2. Serve successfully in at least one 50A coded position. Preferably, qualified officers will have served 48 months in
50A positions of which they should serve 12 months in an O5 50A position as an lieutenant colonel and 12 months in
an O6 50A position as a colonel. As senior force managers, colonels serve in assignments that require leadership,
technical force management and managerial skills. They should be able to oversee and direct diverse force management
efforts. They should pursue an advanced civilian degree, completion of resident SSC, and potential senior-level
fellowships.
   3. Key developmental positions. Certain jobs for Army Reserve and ARNG AGR officers are critical for career
progression. At the O6 level, the Director of Force Management for the USAR and Chief, Force Management Division
for the ARNG are considered a brigade command equivalent position.
   (e) Life-cycle development model. The RC (USAR & ARNG) life-cycle development models for FA 50 officers are
shown at figures 30–2 and 30–3.
                                   Figure 30–2. USAR FA 50 life-cycle development model
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            309

                                   Figure 30–3. ARNG FA 50 life-cycle development model
   (f) Civilian-acquired skills. Many RC officers are qualified Force Management officers in their civilian profession,
but do not possess FA 50 qualifications. These officers are strongly encouraged to apply for FA 50. The FA 50 PDO,
through HRC is the approval authority for all USAR requests, while NGB–ARF, in coordination with the States and
Territories will be approval authority for all ARNG officer requests. Civilian force management assignments will be
considered as developmental equivalents when qualifying these officers for positions of increased responsibility.
Chapter 31
Operations Research/Systems Analysis Functional Area
31–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. The Operations Research/Systems Analysis FA provides uniquely skilled officers that assist decision
makers in solving complex problems by producing the analysis and logical reasoning necessary to inform and underpin
critical decisions. The Operations Research/Systems Analysis is an integral part of the Army and Joint leaders’
decision-making processes to organize, man, train, equip, sustain, and resource transformation from the current to the
future force and conduct analysis in support of Overseas Contingency Operations and other warfighting operations.
   b. Proponent information. The FA 49 is managed within the Operations Support functional category. The FA 49
proponent office resides in the Program Analysis and Evaluation Directorate, Office of the DCS, G–8,
   c. Functions. The FA 49 officer uses analytic methods and mathematically based procedures to enable leadership
decisions in a constantly changing global environment. The Operations Research/Systems Analysis introduces quantita-
tive and qualitative analysis to the military’s decision-making processes by developing and applying probability
models, statistical inference, simulations, optimization and economic models. The Operations Research/Systems Analy-
sis FA encompasses diverse disciplines that include personnel management, doctrine and force development, training
management, system testing, system acquisition, decision analysis, and resource management, as well as tactical,
operational and strategic planning from division through combatant command, and from ACOM through the highest
levels of the DOD.

31–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army Values
and the Warrior Ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the spectrum of
conflict. They must be able to operate in JIIM environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving
their objectives. Our officers must be culturally astute and able to use their awareness and understanding to conduct
operations innovatively and courageously to exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the operational
environment. Further explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in ADP 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this
publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of an operations research/systems analysis officer. The FA 49 officer integrates
military knowledge and experience with the scientific and managerial fields. They serve as subject matter experts in
designing forces, allocating resources, analyzing effects, performing course of action and trade-off analysis, and they
effectively communicate potential solutions to complex problems to decision makers. The Operations Research/Systems
Analysis officer will typically serve in one of several general assignments as:
   (1) A combat analyst on a division, corps, ASCCs (or equivalent joint headquarters staff), or Combatant Command
headquarters staff.
   (2) An analyst on an Army, joint or defense agency staff or a direct reporting unit (for example, Center for Army
Analysis, HRC, or the Army Test and Evaluation Command).
   (3) An analyst in an ACOM (that is, TRADOC, FORSCOM, AMC), either in the command headquarters or in an
organization whose principal mission is to provide analysis that supports the organizing, equipping, manning, training
and operations of military forces. Such organizations include Army Capabilities Integration Center, TRADOC Analysis
Center (TRAC, and Centers of Excellence).
   (4) An instructor teaching Operations Research/Systems Analysis and/or mathematics courses at the USMA, Naval
Postgraduate School, Air Force Institute of Technology or TRADOC school.
   c. Training/qualification of a FA 49 officer. FA 49 officers are expected to maintain a level of technical expertise in
the area of Operations Research and Systems Analysis. This expertise is gained through both education and experience.
   (1) Qualification for entry into FA 49. Due to the technical nature of FA 49, not all Army officers are qualified to
move into the FA. Officers moving into FA 49 are expected to have a strong background in math, science, economics,
finance or engineering in order to be eligible for FA 49.
   (2) Initial training/education. All Operations Research/Systems Analysis officers are required to learn the basic tools
for their trade. This education comes in one of two forms, completion of Operations Research/Systems Analysis-
Military Applications Course or completion of a graduate degree in an operations research related field approved by the
proponent. Even if an officer completes Operations Research/Systems Analysis - Military Applications Course, he or
she is expected to continue their education with a goal of gaining a master’s degree.
   (3) Mid-grade military education. All officers junior to YDCS, G–1993 are required to complete the ILE Common
Core Course and the FA 49 Qualification Course. These two courses combine to grant FA 49 officers full ILE
qualification.
   (4) Advanced education. Select FA 49 officers will be afforded the opportunity to obtain additional training or
education. These opportunities include graduate education, Training With Industry, various fellowships, and military
courses.
   (a) Officers selected to attend graduate school for a MS or PhD will serve a utilization tour in a validated billet, per
the Army Education Requirements System.
   (b) Officers may compete for most fellowships, to include the RAND Arroyo Fellowship. Officers can expect
utilization in DCS, G–8 after the RAND fellowship.
   (c) Officers may compete for attendance at the SAMS. Officers will be utilized per the SAMS distribution.
   (5) Senior Service College. A centralized Army selection board will afford a select number of lieutenant colonels
and colonels the opportunity to attend SSC.
31–3. Officer development
   a. Officer development model. The officer development model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress. Army leaders expect senior FA 49
officers to have a broad set of experiences that enable them to provide strategic flexibility to the Army. FA 49 will
develop this breadth of experience by assigning officers to a variety of organizations in multiple analytic realms.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a Warrior Ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation develops both specific and broad functional competencies.
   (4) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force - regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so on.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             311

   (5) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   b. Lieutenant development. The FA 49 does not have any lieutenants.
   c. Captain/junior major development. Officers are selected for FA 49 as captains around their 7th year of service.
Before making the transition to FA 49, officers will be fully qualified as a captain in their basic branch, having
completed the CCC and an appropriate key development assignment.
   (1) Education. Prior to an officer’s first Operations Research/Systems Analysis assignment he or she is required to
either complete initial Operations Research/Systems Analysis training via Operations Research/Systems Analysis-
Military Applications Course or complete a graduate degree in a field approved by the proponent through the advanced
civil schooling program. Officers completing Operations Research/Systems Analysis-Military Applications Course are
still eligible to earn a masters degree through advanced civilian schooling.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. All FA 49 assignments are considered KD. Upon completion of Operations
Research/Systems Analysis training FA 49 officers will enter into their first assignment with the goal of mastering their
analytic skills. These assignments are typically in organizations that have senior FA 49 officers able to coach, teach
and mentor the new FA 49 officers.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Since FA 49 officers are selected as senior captains, the combina-
tion of their basic branch assignments with their initial Operations Research/Systems Analysis assignment (defined
above) provides a sufficiently broad experience.
   (4) Self-development. Officers without a graduate degree in an operations research related field are encouraged to
pursue one through other means. Officers should pursue venues to keep current though programs like the Continuing
Education Program sponsored by the FA49 proponent, courses such as the force management course, and involvement
in professional organizations such as the Military Operations Research Society (MORS), and the Institute for Opera-
tions Research and Management Sciences (INFORMS) Military Application Society (MAS) or others.
   (5) Desired experience. Upon completion of an officer’s FA 49 assignment, they should have mastered their analytic
skills, be capable of applying those skills in support of operational, generating, or Headquarters/Department analytic
efforts.
   d. Major development.
   (1) Education. Majors should continue to pursue a master’s degree in an operations research related field. Senior
Majors that have displayed high performance and potential that have completed a masters degree are encouraged to
pursue an advanced degree in a doctorate program approved by the proponent. Majors are required to complete ILE
qualification, which consists of successful completion of ILE Common Core and the FA49 Qualification Course. FA 49
officers will attend ILE Common Core at a TRADOC campus or via distance learning.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. All FA 49 assignments are considered KD.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments.
   (a) After an officer’s initial FA 49 assignment, select officers will be assigned or tasked to support the operating
force. These officers can expect an assignment to a Division or Corps headquarters, ASCC, Combatant Command or a
tasking as an individual augmentee. They will provide analytic support to the deploying forces.
   (b) In subsequent assignments, officers can also expect to serve on high-level headquarters staffs, on the Army Staff,
and in units with a lower density of FA 49 officers. Officers should also seek opportunities in specialized areas, such as
cyber security, special operations, and legislative fellowships.
   (4) Self-development. Majors not selected for participation in an Army Education Program should continue to pursue
a master’s degree in an operations research related field. In addition, officers should pursue professional development
through programs like the Continuing Education Program sponsored by the FA49 proponent office. Officers are
encouraged to be involved in professional organizations such as the MORS, and INFORMS.
   (5) Desired experience. The FA 49 officers should have mastered Operations Research/Systems Analysis skills, be
operationally relevant, and be prepared to serve as an Operations Research/Systems Analysis leader.
   e. Lieutenant colonel development.
   (1) Education. lieutenant colonels that have displayed high performance and potential that have completed a
master’s degree are encouraged to pursue an advanced degree in a doctorate program approved by the proponent. A
select number of lieutenant colonels will have the opportunity to attend SSC.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. All FA 49 lieutenant colonel billets are considered KD positions.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. The FA 49 lieutenant colonels are expected to serve in positions of
increased responsibility and leadership in the Operations Research/Systems Analysis community, particularly on the
Army Staff, Joint billets, and ACOMs. Officers should also seek assignments that broaden their Operations Research/
Systems Analysis skill and experience set.
   (4) Self-development. Lieutenant colonels should continue to pursue a master’s degree in a program approved by the
proponent. Many Operations Research/Systems Analysis officers will attend the Deployed Analyst Course prior to
serving in a deploying force unit. In addition, officers should pursue professional development through programs like
312                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

the Continuing Education Program sponsored by the FA49 proponent office and are encouraged to be involved in
professional organizations such as MORS, and INFORMS.
   (5) Desired experience. The Operations Research/Systems Analysis lieutenant colonels should serve as leaders in the
Operations Research/Systems Analysis community and on high-level staffs such as the Army Staff, Joint Chiefs of
Staff, OSD, and Combatant Commands. A lieutenant colonel will have had an operational assignment as an Operations
Research/Systems Analysis to be best qualified for future potential.
   f. Colonel development.
   (1) Education. All FA 49 colonels are required to have completed a masters degree in a field approved by the
proponent before being selected for colonel. A select number of colonels will have the opportunity to attend a resident
SSC. All other colonels are encouraged to complete the Army War College Distance Education Program.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. All other assignments are considered KD.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. FA 49 colonels serve in a variety of positions across the Army and
DOD to include positions not specifically coded for FA 49 but for which an officer is well suited.
   (4) Self-development. Officers should pursue professional development through programs like the Continuing Edu-
cation Program sponsored by the FA49 proponent office and are encouraged to be involved in professional organiza-
tions such as MORS, and INFORMS–MAS.
   (5) Desired experience. The FA 49 colonel should be a strategic thinker capable of leading analysis in all JIIM
environments.
                                    Figure 31–1. AA FA 49 officer career development
                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           313

31–4. Warrant officer development
The FA 49 does not have warrant officers.
31–5. Reserve Component officers
   a. General. Only USAR AGR officers can be designated into FA 49 (Operations Research/Systems Analysis) as
their career management branch. All other RC officers (TPU, IMA, and NGB) may fill a 49A billet if appropriately
trained, but are still managed in their basic branch. RC Operations Research/Systems Analysis officers fulfill similar
roles and missions as their AA counterparts; however, the range and scope of possible RC assignments is somewhat
more limited than those found within the AA, For additional guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7.
   b. Assignment opportunities. RC Operations Research/Systems Analysis assignments exist in various levels of
command throughout the reserve forces. Generally, Army Reserve (USAR) entry-level positions are in the accessions
system area. The USAR AGR Operations Research/Systems Analysis serve primarily at the OCAR and the USAREC.
They also on the Army Staff, at the USAREC, and in various other agencies. USAR AGR officers have the opportunity
to deploy in support of Overseas Contingency Operations. The ARNG analysts are primarily assigned to organizations
in the National Capital Region and to ARNG staffs.
   (1) Captains. The USAR entry-level positions include several captain billets, most managed under the AGR
Program. Almost all USAR captains serve as analysts at USAREC headquarters. They are supervised and mentored by
senior civilian analysts and work alongside their AA peers.
   (2) Majors/lieutenant colonels. Most RC Operations Research/Systems Analysis positions are field grade and are
governed by the IMA and AGR programs, and most authorizations for senior majors and above are in the National
Capital Region. Two ARNG Operations Research/Systems Analysis majors are authorized for the Division, Corps and
Army Headquarters staff.
   (3) Colonels. There are few colonel positions and senior analysts should seek branch/FA generalist positions.
Colonels should maintain broad perspectives and should seek experience throughout the analytical community.
   c. Mobilization. Significant numbers of mobilization requirements exist for FA 49 qualified officers. HRC manages
pre-trained individual manpower to fill shortfalls in Regular Army, Army Reserve and ARNG units using officers
assigned to the IRR.
   d. Qualification and professional development. Any RC officer who attends Operations Research/Systems Analysis-
Military Applications Course is considered a qualified Operations Research/Systems Analysis. Additionally, USAR
AGR officers who successfully complete the Operations Analysis program at the Naval Postgraduate School are also
considered a qualified Operations Research/Systems Analysis. USAR AGR offices are accessed into FA 49 at various
points in time during their professional career; some will access as a captain, others as a major, and others as a
lieutenant colonel. The below criteria apply to those USAR AGR officers who are managed as a FA 49 while in that
rank.
   (1) Captain development.
   (a) Successfully complete basic branch captains Officer Education System courses (either AA or RC curriculum).
   (b) Serve in at least one basic branch position for a minimum of 24 months to gain the requisite skills and
experiences required by their basic branch
   (c) Serve in at least one entry-level Operations Research/Systems Analysis position for at least 24 months.
   (2) Major development.
   (a) All officers in the primary zone for the lieutenant colonel Selection Board in September 2010 or later are
required to complete the FA 49 Qualification Course and the ILE Common Core Course to successfully complete ILE
requirements. The FA 49 Qualification Course is designed to prepare field grade officers to serve successfully in FA 49
positions on Army and Joint Staffs. All USAR AGR majors must attend ILE Common Core Course through any one of
the various modes. Majors must also attend the FA 49 Qualification Course to complete ILE qualification.
   (b) All FA 49 positions are considered KD. Serve a minimum of 24 months in at least one Operations Research/
Systems Analysis position.
   (c) Continue development through continuing education program or various civilian education venues with the
ultimate goal of obtaining a master’s degree in an operations research related field (see table 31–1).
   (3) Lieutenant colonel development.
   (a) All FA 49 positions are considered KD. FA 49 lieutenant colonels should serve in positions of greater
responsibility and leadership.
   (b) Continue development through continuing education program or various civilian education venues with the
ultimate goal of obtaining a master’s degree in an operations research related field (see table 31–1)
   (c) Lieutenant colonels are encouraged to complete for lieutenant colonel command and for SSC.
   (4) Colonel development.

  (a) All FA 49 Colonel positions are considered KD.
  (b) As senior analysts, colonels serve in assignments that require both technical and managerial skills. They should
be able to oversee and direct diverse studies and analytical efforts. Colonels should have a broad background in
analysis throughout the Army, having served in a variety of different FA 49 authorizations in previous field grade
assignments.
  e. Life-cycle development model. The RC life-cycle development model for FA 49 officers is shown at figure 31–2.
  f. Civilian-acquired skills. Many RC officers possess education and/or work experience through their civilian
profession comparable to that of Operations Research/Systems Analysis officers but are not designated FA 49. Civilian
Operations Research/Systems Analysis-related work experience will be considered for developmental equivalency when
qualifying these officers for positions of increased responsibility.
  g. Reserve Component training participation and credit. See chapter 7.
  (1) CCC required for promotion to major.
  (2) ILE: must complete ILE Common Core for promotion to lieutenant colonel.

32–3. Officer development
   a. Officer development model. The goal of the FA 47 developmental process is to maintain a diverse faculty
sensitive to both Army needs and academic standards, who support the USMA mission to provide the Army with
commissioned leaders of character. The USMA Professor life-cycle developmental model recognizes the vital roles
USMA Professors play in the education, training, and inspiration of cadets, and it preserves and enhances the pursuit of
excellence in leader development and academics at USMA. USMA Professors normally remain on the USMA faculty
until retirement and follow a career pattern that is directed toward, teaching, research, service, cadet development, and
junior faculty development. These activities are necessary to ensure that USMA Professors continue to develop mastery
within their academic disciplines and both understand and employ emerging pedagogical techniques and information.
   (1) Captain development. FA 47 has no authorized/assigned captains.
   (2) Major development. There are no authorized FA 47 positions at the grade of major. Officers selected for USMA
Professor positions while in the grade of major must have completed all required developmental training to include
MEL 4 qualification and have served successfully in a KD position in their previously assigned AOC. Upon selection,
the officer will focus on earning a Ph.D. in their designated academic discipline and continue to serve in positions of
increasing responsibility as a member of the USMA faculty.
   (3) Lieutenant colonel development. Lieutenant colonels are generally assigned within their respective organizations
to significant academic, administrative, and leadership positions. They serve as program directors, division chiefs, and
directors of centers. In order to maintain relevancy in their field of studies, currency in the operational environment,
and ability to promote the development of future leaders, lieutenant colonels participate in short-term, high impact
experiences within the Army, DOD, and/or other Government agencies.
                                              DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                                    317

   (4) Colonel development. Colonels are generally assigned within their respective organizations to significant aca-
demic, administrative, and leadership positions. In addition to serving as program directors, division chiefs, and
directors of centers, colonels serve as institutional-level committee leaders, deputy heads of department, and heads of
department. In order to maintain relevancy in their field of studies, currency in the operational environment, and ability
to promote the development of future leaders, colonels participate in short-term, high impact experiences within the
Army, DOD, and/or other Government agencies.
   b. Academic advancement. The central focus of orderly progression and academic promotion is development in the
five domains of teaching, scholarship, service, cadet development, and junior faculty development, where high-quality
teaching is the cornerstone of the USMA Professor. Conducting research and participating in scholarly activities
provide continued growth and development opportunities within the officer’s selected academic discipline and increases
the ability to teach and develop other faculty’s ability to teach. Outreach activities in support of the Army provide
continued military growth and professional development opportunities within the officer’s selected academic discipline
and support cadet development.
   c. Operational assignments. Service beyond USMA is a valuable component of a USMA Professor’s life-cycle
model. FA 47’s maintain military and academic currency by participating in short-term, high impact experiences
nominally for 90 days every 3 years, up to 12 month operational assignments every seventh year. FA 47s will conduct
operational assignments to maintain currency of the operational environment that USMA graduates are entering upon
graduation. In addition to operational assignments, FA 47s may also conduct scholarly experiences in positions where
their unique academic skills will best serve the needs of the Army, DOD, and/or other Government agencies.
   d. Senior Staff College. FA 47 officers are not considered for selection by Army competitive boards for attendance
at SSC. The Dean of the Academic Board has developed a military schooling program that provides SSC opportunities
for USMA detailed faculty through a Fellowship Memorandum of Agreement with the Army War College, Naval War
College, and the National Defense University.
   e. Sabbatical. A sabbatical is a period of time dedicated to disciplinary updating and scholarly concentration that
will advance professional standing and enrich teaching at USMA. USMA Professors are eligible to request a sabbatical
after 6 years of continuous service.
   f. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. FA 47 officers do not serve in branch/FA generalist assignments
unless approved by the Superintendent for the purpose of providing specialized skills to the Army.
   g. Joint assignments. FA 47 officers do not serve in Joint assignments unless temporarily released from detail by the
Superintendent to fulfill a specialized need of the Army. Because FA 47 officers typically do not serve in Joint duty
assignment list assignments, the absence of a joint assignment will not preclude their selection to colonel.p

32–4. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for U.S. Military Academy Professor
   a. Structure. FA 47 positions exist only at the USMA.
   b. Acquire. USMA detailed faculty positions are normally filled through a USMA faculty search committee process.
FA 47 vacancies are advertised on various Web sites to include the USMA DCS, G–1 homepage; http://www.usma.
edu/g1/SitePages/Home.aspx. The advertisement will include specific criteria that an officer must meet to be consid-
ered for appointment. Applications are forwarded to a selection committee composed of detailed military faculty
members, civilian faculty and, in some cases, representatives appointed by HQDA. The committee considers all
applicants, evaluating the breadth of the applicant’s military experience, depth achieved in military specialties, evidence
of leadership, and ability to complete the Ph.D. The selection committee will forward a list of the top qualified
applicants through the Dean to the Academic Board. The Academic Board will make a final recommendation.
Professor, USMA (AOC 47A) appointments require presidential nomination and congressional approval. Director of
Military Personnel Management, DCS, G–1 has approval authority for Academy Professors (AOC 47*).
   c. Distribute. After designation into FA 47, officers are managed by the Operation Support Division, Officer
Personnel Management Directorate, at HRC with direct coordination with the USMA DCS, G–1 in support of the core
academic mission.
   d. Deploy. FA 47 officers are detailed and normally not considered for worldwide assignment, unless temporarily
released by the Superintendent to provide specialized skills to the Army.
   e. Sustain. FA 47 officers will compete within operations support functional category for promotion to lieutenant
colonel and colonel.
   f. Develop. See paragraph 32–3.
   g. Separate. Duration of detailed faculty assignment is through mandatory retirement for Academy Professors (28
years for lieutenant colonel and 30 years for colonel and for Professors, USMA (age 64) (10 USC 1252). Upon
retirement, any Professor, USMA (47A) whose grade is below brigadier general, and whose Service has been long and

Simulation Operations Functional Area
33–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. Simulation Operations (FA 57) officers provide the Total Army with a technically educated and
tactically grounded cadre of officers specializing in the core areas of M&S, mission command systems integration and
operational knowledge management. FA 57 officers possess the unique skill set required to carry out the Army training
strategy directives, incorporate the integrated training environment and U.S. Army Learning Concept. FA57 officers
integrate Army mission command systems to invigorate home station training and optimize resources to confront the
increasingly complex environment and uncertain future. FA 57 officers assist commanders to accomplish diverse
training objectives by leveraging virtual and constructive capabilities to produce operationally ready and adaptable
leaders and forces.
   (1) Modeling and Simulation Operations. FA 57s provide commanders and staffs with a capability to translate
tactical/operational requirements into technical solutions by integrating live, virtual, constructive and gaming capabili-
ties into a seamless environment to support the full range of military operations including training, testing, experimen-
tation, analysis, acquisition, logistics, intelligence, operations and medical support.
   (2) Mission command system integration. FA 57s work with commanders and staffs to integrate and mass Army
battle command systems as a weapon system to achieve informational dominance and situational understanding for the
commander and staff.
   (3) Operational knowledge management. FA 57s integrate knowledge management principles with mission com-
mand systems and staff standard operating procedures to provide the commander with the right information in the right
format at the right time to drive decision-making. Understanding the People-Process-Tools-Organization paradigm of
operational knowledge management, coupled with operational experience and technical training, allows FA 57s to
develop and refine unit’s collective knowledge-sharing environment.

management issues across all DOD domains including training, testing, experimentation, analysis, acquisition, logistics,
intelligence, operations, and medical support.
33–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. General. The Simulation Operations FA requires officers who embody the Warrior Ethos that understand how to
integrate the latest models and simulations, mission command systems and knowledge management principles to
support the full spectrum of military operations.
   b. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the basic characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for the 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army
Values and the Warrior Ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the
spectrum of conflict. They must be able to operate in Army headquarters, JIIM environments, and leverage capabilities
beyond the Army to achieve their objectives. Further explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0
and in chapter 3 of this publication.
   c. Unique knowledge, skills, and abilities to FA 57 officers. FA 57s are operationally seasoned officers who possess
technical proficiency with M&S tools, mission command systems, and knowledge management principles. They
translate commander’s tactical requirements into technical solutions. FA 57s provide the Army with a unique blend of
skills that include:
   (1) Understand how best to leverage new and emerging M&S, mission command systems and knowledge manage-
ment principles, techniques and technologies in support of organizational training and operations.
   (2) Develop complex environments using live, virtual, constructive, and gaming tools and concepts to support
training, testing, experimentation, analysis, acquisition, logistics, intelligence, operations and medical activities.
   (3) Assist in the refinement of current simulations and development of the Army’s future simulation needs including
integration of software, hardware, networks, and communications that support training and operations.

ing people, process, technologies, and organizations for commanders and chiefs of staff.
   (11) Maintain and sustain a level of expertise on the capabilities and limitations of new and existing information and
simulation technologies.
   (12) Translate complex technical material and situations into operational language and concepts easily understood by
the commander and his staff.
   (13) Are familiar with organization, structure, and doctrine of the Army, DOD, Joint, interagency, multinational and
commercial simulation activities.
   (14) Design and develop the environments that support experiments to test battle command configurations, mission
command architecture design concepts, doctrinal and techniques.
33–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
   a. General. FA qualification and development.
   (1) Basic accession. FA 57 officers are selected based on demonstrated operational proficiency in company grade
leadership KD positions to include commander or other basic branch qualifying staff officer billet during the VTIP
board process. Officers will achieve the grade of captain and complete a captain-level KD job before serving in an FA
57 billet.
   (2) Early accession. Select officers who have not completed company grade basic branch KD positions may be
considered for accession into FA 57, and by exception, HRC will work with these officers to provide an appropriate
company grade command opportunity.
   (3) Other accession considerations. Professional history with computer science, modeling, or simulation technical
experience is highly regarded, but not essential to the selection process for FA 57 officers. Officers selected for the
Simulation Operations FA will be designated into the functional category of Operations Support.
   (4) Joint, interagency, intergovernmental and multinational experience. Officers serving in FA 57 will have numer-
ous opportunities for JIIM experience throughout their careers and can expect to be considered for nominative JIIM
assignments worldwide. Even though this experience is important to the Army and to individual officers for advance-
ment into senior leadership positions, not all FA 57 officers will have the opportunity to serve in JIIM assignments.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             321

This will not preclude their selection to the rank of colonel. Joint assignments may include; Joint Staff, Combatant
Commands, multinational organizations (NATO), and Allied service schools or on security assistance teams. In
addition, officers may be assigned to specific Interagency/Intergovernmental fellowships with other U.S. government
agencies, to include Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and National Security Council.
   (5) Functional competencies. FA 57s have extensive knowledge of simulation, mission command, and knowledge
management systems and assists Army, Joint and multinational organizations in the integration of those systems into
both training and operations.
   (6) Lifelong learning, civilian and military education. FA 57s have numerous opportunities for both military and
civilian education. Entry-level military education is focused on the fundamentals of modeling, simulations, mission
command systems integration, and knowledge management. Senior-level education is focused on the management of
programs and organizations for M&S enabled Army communities of interest.
   (7) Advanced civilian schooling. Additional education opportunities include fully funded masters and PhD degree
Advanced Civilian Schooling Programs and online certification courses. Officers selected must have a demonstrated
potential for promotion and meet requirements outlined in AR 621–108 for acceptance into the Advanced Civilian
Schooling Program. The FA 57 Proponent and the HRC assignment officer conduct an Advanced Civilian Schooling
School Selection Board to align qualified applicants to approved institutions prior to assessing Students into the
Advanced Civilian Schooling Program. Currently, there are four principal universities FA 57s can attend for a masters
degree or a PhD in M&S: Naval Postgraduate School (Monterey, CA), University of Central Florida (Orlando, FL),
Old Dominion University (Norfolk, VA), and Columbus State University (Columbus, GA). The Advanced Civilian
Schooling School Selection Board review criteria include officer preference, balance of candidates across the four
universities, previous academic profile and future potential. Officers must plan to apply to all four universities as
directed by the HRC assignment officer. The Advanced Civilian Schooling School Selection Board serves as an
essential tool to ensure the FA maintains a balance of graduates from all four unique programs. UCF advanced civilian
schooling masters students will complete a written thesis or directed-study project. Thesis topics must address an Army
M&S problem area and students will present progress updates to the FA 57 proponent officer semi-annually. Other
universities not listed here may be considered and approved by exception by the FA 57 proponent office. The
Advanced Civilian Schooling Program is eligible for AC officers only.
   b. Captain.
   (1) Education. FA 57 officers will attend the 8-week Simulation Operations Course prior to their first assignment.
   (2) Assignments. Upon completion of initial education, FA 57 Captains will serve primarily as Battle Command
Officers in BCTs, Sustainment brigades, Mission Training Complexes or at the National Simulation Center. Captains
are encouraged to apply to the fully funded Advanced Civilian Schooling Program to earn an M&S master’s degree.
   (3) Self-development. FA 57s should pursue professional and personal development opportunities in both general
military and FA 57 related fields. This may include attendance at FA 57 courses, general military schools/courses,
continuing civilian education, distant learning programs, professional forums/conferences, and professional reading/
research.
   (4) Desired experience. The professional development objective for this phase of an FA 57’s career is to develop a
BCT or brigade-level proficiency in the three core competencies of simulations in support of training, mission
command systems integration, and knowledge management in support of military operations. This is the essential
foundation of knowledge which subsequent assignments will build upon.
   (5) Additional factors. FA 57 experience as a captain is not required for promotion to major.
   c. Major.
   (1) Education. DCS, G–3/5/7 has approved FA 57 officers to compete in the Command and General Staff College
selection board. FA 57s will complete MEL 4 training (including ILE Common Core Course and Advanced Operations
Warfighting Course). FA 57s selected for resident Command and General Staff College will attend the 10-month
course at Fort Leavenworth. Officers attending resident Command and General Staff College are required to take the
Military M&S Advanced Application Program electives offered by the Digital Leadership Development Center. FA 57s
selected to attend the 14-week ILE Common Core Course satellite course will attend this course and will be required to
take the Advanced Operations Course portion via Army Distance Learning. Officers non-selected for either resident
Command and General Staff College or the ILE satellite course will be required to complete ILE and Advanced
Operations Course via Army Distance Learning. FA 57s who have not completed the 8-week Simulation Operations
Course will do so prior to their first FA 57 assignment. FA 57 majors are eligible to compete for and attend sister
Service and Foreign Command and General Staff Colleges. FA 57s are not eligible to attend or compete for the SAMS.
Majors are encouraged to apply to the fully funded Advanced Civilian Schooling Program to earn an M&S master’s
degree.
   (2) Assignments. Most officers will serve in at least one operational MTOE assignment as a major. Typical
assignments may include the following: division/corps-level knowledge management officer, DCS, G–3/5/7 simula-
tions/mission command systems integration officer, Fires or Aviation brigade battle command officers, ASCC exercises
officer, HQDA staff officer, battle lab simulation officer, mission command training center operations officer and
322                                       DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

Simulation Operations analyst at the National Simulation Center. FA 57 billets are authorized within Joint commands
and officers will be assigned within the Joint community based on performance and experience.
   (3) Self-development. Major level self-development opportunities may include proponent/institutional training, civil-
ian education, distant learning programs, and attendance at professional forums/conferences. Officers should devote
time to professional reading and research to broaden their technical and warfighting skills and knowledge. Majors
should continue their professional development to become an expert in all aspects of Simulation Operations, mission
command systems integration and knowledge management. In addition, officers may compete for JIIM internships and
fellowships.
   (4) Desired experience. The FA 57 officers should have served in at least one operational tour as a major. In
addition to basic simulation, mission command systems integration, and knowledge management expertise, officers
shall begin to gain an understanding of force management, acquisition, combat development, and contracting.
   (5) Additional factors. FA KD qualification for FA 57 majors requires the following: completion of the Simulation
Operations Course, MEL 4, and one or more of the following FA 57 assignments: 2 years as a brigade, regiment,
division, corps or Army level Simulation Operations officer/battle command officer/knowledge management officer,
tour completion in a Joint duty FA 57 position, completion of advanced civilian schooling plus 1 year in any FA 57
position or 3 years in any other FA 57 position.
   d. Lieutenant colonel.
   (1) Education. FA 57s who have not completed the Simulation Operations Course will be immediately scheduled to
attend. Attendance to the Advanced Simulation Course will be at the earliest opportunity.
   (2) Assignments. FA 57 lieutenant colonels are assigned to senior-level positions in Army and JIIM organizations
where they can fully utilize their knowledge of the Army and FA in support of mission requirements. FA 57 FA KD
assignments for lieutenant colonels consist of 2 years in a FA 57 coded lieutenant colonel billet. Typical assignments
may include: Chief of Simulations/Exercises Mission Training Complex; Deputy Director of Simulation, Chief Mission
Training Complex/Mission Command Training Center/Mission Support and Training Facility; Joint/Combatant Com-
mand exercise planners; National Simulation Center Branch Chiefs; Director of Operations, Joint Multinational
Command Training Center; Chief, Simulations Branch, ASCC; FA 57 Proponent Officer; DCS, G–3/5/7 Training
Program Officer; PEO–STRI Project Manager, Deputy brigade commander (75th Training Command) (AC), and
division/corps knowledge management chief.
   (3) Self-development. FA 57 officers should focus on institutional training, civilian education, and distant learning
programs relevant to senior FA 57 jobs. In addition, as Army senior leaders, officers should attend professional forums
and conferences in order to represent FA 57 and provide guidance, leadership and mentoring to the FA 57 community.
Additionally, FA 57 lieutenant colonels should maximize use of online education resources such as the Army Learning
Network, the Army Training Network, and DAU to gain understanding of the Army acquisition, M&S requirements
development, Army budgeting/funding cycles and the Joint Capabilities Integration And Development System process.
More information can be found on the DAU Web site (http://www.dau.mil/default.aspx).
   (4) Desired experience. FA 57 lieutenant colonels should be knowledgeable on the basic tenets of the FA to include
modeling & simulations, mission command systems integration, and knowledge management. Most assignments
provide officers with the responsibility to direct and operate major simulation facilities and programs across Army,
Joint and multinational agencies. Many of these assignments require that FA 57 lieutenant colonels have an understand-
ing of force management, acquisition and contracting.
   (5) Additional factors. The objective of lieutenant colonel professional development is greater contribution to the FA
and the Army.
   e. Colonels.
   (1) Education. Colonels who have not previously attended either the Simulation Operations or Advanced Simulation
Course will attend the course at the earliest opportunity. Officers selected to attend SSC must complete the Simulation
Operations Course prior to SSC attendance.
   (2) Assignments. FA 57 qualification assignments for colonels consist of 2 years in a FA 57-coded colonel billet.
Typical assignments may include: Chief of Training/Exercises, ASCC; Director, National Simulation Center; Director,
Joint Multinational Command Training Center; Director of Simulations, Army War College; Chief Modeling/Simula-
tions, NATO; Senior Military Fellow, National Defense University; Director of Simulations, Aviation Center and
School; HQDA, division chief or technical advisor.
   (3) Self-development. FA 57 officers should focus on institutional training, civilian education, and distant learning
programs relevant to senior FA 57 jobs. Related topics may include: acquisition, force management, contracting, and
combat developments. In addition, as Army senior leaders, officers should attend professional forums and conferences
in order to develop and mentor junior leaders in the branch.
   (4) Desired experience. FA 57 colonels should have broad Army and FA 57 expertise. Officers should be knowl-
edgeable about a variety of topics to include: modeling & simulations; battle command; knowledge management;
acquisition; force management; and contracting. Officers can be expected to represent the FA 57 community at the
most senior levels of the Army and DOD.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             323

   (5) Additional factors. The professional development objective for colonels is greater contribution to the FA and the
Army.
33–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
   a. Preferences. The Simulation Operations FA provides opportunities for a diverse career development path. The
goal of the professional development of FA 57 is to produce a talented group of officers who have developed
operationally as simulation, mission command system integration and knowledge management specialists. Additionally,
FA assignments will provide continual development of an FA 57 officer’s skills and abilities in order to prepare them
for positions of greater leadership and responsibility within the FA and the Army. Requests from FA 57 officers for
assignments that do not contribute directly to this goal must be fully justified and approved by the proponent and HRC.
   b. Precedence. All positions will be filled in accordance with Department of the Army manning guidance and
operational priorities. Priority fill for assignments will go to 57A coded billets before any non-FA 57 assignments will
be considered. All officers will attend the Simulation Operations Course prior to their initial FA 57 assignments.
Several FA 57 assignments required an advanced civilian schooling in models and simulation. Because of this, the
proponent encourages FA 57 officers to apply for the fully funded master’s degree program in order to establish an
available pool of officers to fill advanced civilian schooling coded positions.
33–5. Duration of critical officer life-cycle assignments
   a. Key Simulation Operations FA qualification positions. FA qualification for FA 57 officers is defined by grade, as
stated above. Unlike basic branches, all FA 57 billets are considered KD. Because of the relatively small size and
diversity of FA 57 force structure across the Army, it is not feasible to prescribe a single specific billet or type of
billets required for FA qualification.
   b. Simulation Operations FA life-cycle model. Figures 33–1 and 33–2, below, display a FA 57 FA time line with
qualifying developmental and utilization assignments.
                                       Figure 33–1. AA FA 57 officer developmental model

                                       Figure 33–2. RC FA 57 officer developmental model
33–6. Requirements authorizations and inventory
   a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for FA 57 FA officers. To do this, the field grade
inventory must be optimized in order to meet FA authorizations.
   b. Officer Personnel Management System implementation. The numbers of authorized FA 57 billets, by grade, will
vary as force structure decisions are made and implemented. Officers desiring more information on FA 57 authoriza-
tions and inventory are encouraged to contact the DCS, G–8 Simulation Proponent Division or HRC, FA 57 career
manager/assignments officer.
33–7. Key life-cycle initiatives for simulation operations
   a. Structure. The FA 57 force structure has developed significantly in the last several years, and will see continued
growth through FY 15, primarily in the operational Army.
   b. Acquire. During the VTIP board process, captains and major applicants are selected based on demonstrated
operational proficiency in KD positions to include company/battery/troop command or other basic branch qualifying
staff officer billets. Officers will achieve the grade of captain and complete a captain-level KD job before serving in an
FA 57 billet. ARNG and USAR Captains and Majors may opt to become FA 57 officers through the Call to Active
Duty program in accordance with HRC procedures and guidelines (see HRC Web site). AC lieutenant colonels are not
eligible to apply to FA 57 during the VTIP process. Exceptions to policy should be addressed to the FA 57 Proponent
office and HRC.
   c. Distribute. The HRC FA 57 assignments officer manages captains, majors and lieutenant colonels. Senior leader
division manages FA 57 colonels. Both HRC and the senior leader division manage FA 57 assignments, Advanced
Civilian Schooling, Training With Industry, fellowships and other positions based upon Army requirements/priorities,
officer skills, experience, and officer preferences at the time of assignment.
   d. Deploy. Simulation Operations officers are Soldiers who remain prepared to deploy worldwide at all times.
Whether assigned to deploying operating force units with high levels of readiness or in generating force organizations,
all FA 57 officers must maintain both operational and branch-specific skills to accomplish missions across the full
                                              DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           325

spectrum of military operations. FA 57 officers will deploy with assigned units in the course of normal operations, or
as individuals to support joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping
missions.
   e. Sustain. FA 57 FA officers compete for promotion within the Operations Support functional category. Promotion
numbers and percentages reflect Army and FA requirements that select the best qualified, agile, and adaptive leaders
able to meet future Army requirements.
   f. Develop. FA 57 offers diversity for both assignment opportunities and professional development. The increasing
complexity of the technical skills required mandates that some officers attend advanced civilian schooling or Training
With Industry. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments
as listed in paragraph 33–3. Self-development continues to be an essential component of officer development.
   g. Separate. FA 57 officers separate from the Army in accordance with applicable regulatory guidance.
33–8. Simulation Operations Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. RC describes both the ARNG and USAR and, unless otherwise indicated, references
to the RC are applicable to both. The RC Simulation Operations officer development objectives follow the AC officer
development pattern as closely as possible. However, the unique nature of the RC Soldier’s role as a "citizen Soldier"
poses a significant challenge for professional development. Due to the complexity and detailed understanding of Army
systems and functions required to serve effectively in this FA, junior officers must develop a strong foundation through
assignments in their basic branch before FA specialization begins (see chapter 7 for more guidance on RC officer
development).
   b. Assignment opportunities. The RC Simulation Operations officers can expect assignment opportunities that mirror
those of AC officers as well as those positions applicable exclusively to the RC. The success of an RC Simulation
Operations officer is not measured by length of service in any one component or control group, but by the officer’s
breadth and depth of experience, duty performance, and adherence to FA requirements. FA 57 assignments for the
ARNG are normally in the operating force at BCT or Division. FA 57 USAR billets are primarily TDA or TPUs within
Battle Command Training Divisions. There are positions for AGR in both ARNG and USAR. Civilian-acquired skills,
advanced military and civilian education, and demonstrated abilities to function in a simulation environment are highly
desirable for assignment to any RC FA 57 position.
   c. FA qualification and development opportunities.
   (1) FA 57 offers unique and rewarding assignment opportunities for the RC. To meet professional development
objectives, RC officers must be willing to rotate between ARNG and USAR TPU, IRR, and AGR programs to
complete a career as an FA 57. These moves are necessitated by geographical considerations, as well as the need to
provide as many officers as possible the opportunity to serve in an FA 57 billet. Additionally, there may be occasions
when RC officers will be transferred to the IRR while they complete mandatory education requirements. Such transfers
will be temporary and should not be seen as impacting negatively on the officer’s career. RC FA 57 officers assigned
to these positions must continually develop their knowledge and analytical skills. RC officers awarded FA 57 will be
offered the opportunity to pursue continuing education opportunities (civilian and military), and government internship
programs.
   (2) Captain.
   (a) Education. FA 57 officers will attend the Simulation Operations Course prior to their first branch assignment.
   (b) Assignments. Upon completion of initial education, FA 57 captains will serve primarily as battle command
officers in BCTs or as simulation officers in select State-level mission command training centers.
   (c) Self-development. Officers selected for FA 57 should pursue professional and personal development opportuni-
ties in both general military and FA 57 related fields. This may include attendance at FA 57 courses, general military
schools/courses, continuing civilian education, distant learning programs, professional forums/conferences, and profes-
sional reading/research. There are numerous M&S certificate programs available through the e-Learning section of the
Army Learning Management System (ALMS) on AKO that offer free or reduced cost programs for military personnel.
ALMS can be found under the “My Education” tab on the AKO homepage.
   (d) Desired experience. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop
proficiency as a company/battery commander and staff officer prior to selection as a FA 57. Upon selection to FA 57,
officers should develop a basic knowledge of simulations, battle command, and knowledge management.
   (e) Additional factors. FA 57 experience as a captain is not required for promotion to major.
   (3) Major.
   (a) Education. FA 57 officers will attend the Simulation Operations Course prior to their first branch assignment.
   (b) Assignments. FA 57 assignments include battle command officer at Aviation and FA brigades, Division M&S
officer (plans & exercises), simulation training and operations officer positions within battle projection groups. Upon
assignment to a FA 57 position, the Simulation Operations Course must be completed, if not previously completed, and
serve in a FA 57 position for 12 months.
   (c) Self-development. In addition, officers should strive to obtain advanced civilian schooling compatible with FA
57 position requirements.
326                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (d) Desired experience. Successful completion of branch, FA or broadening assignments prior to consideration for
promotion to lieutenant colonel.
   (e) Additional factors. The objective of major professional development is through key RC developmental assign-
ments; continuous professional study and self-development, distance learning and attendance at professional forums/
conferences. There are numerous M&S certificate programs available through the e-Learning section of ALMS on
AKO that offer free or reduced cost programs for military personnel. ALMS can be found under the “My Education”
tab on the AKO homepage.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel:
   (a) Education. Successfully complete Command and General Staff College ILE Common Core Course. Must
complete the Simulation Operations Course and/or Advanced Operations Course, if not previously completed, and
serve in a FA 57 position for 24 months.
   (b) Assignments. Typical assignments could include Simulation Operations Officer, Assistant for DCS, G–3/5/7,
Deputy Director - Battle Projection Group Chief and Scenario Chief, Division Knowledge Management Chief.
   (c) Self-development. Should strive to complete the Senior Staff College and obtain Advanced Civilian Schooling
compatible with FA 57 position requirements. There are numerous M&S certificate programs available through the e-
Learning section of ALMS on AKO that offer free or reduced cost programs for military personnel. ALMS can be
found under the “My Education” tab on the AKO homepage.
   (d) Desired experience. Broad branch, FA and skill proficiency at the senior levels through assignments and
schooling.
   (e) Additional factors. The objective of lieutenant colonel professional development is greater contribution to the FA
and the RC.
   (5) Colonel:
   (a) Education. All FA 57 officers selected for colonel should be enrolled or apply for the SSC nonresident course if
not selected for the resident course. Colonels should attend the Simulation Operations Course and Advanced Simula-
tion Course.
   (b) Assignments. FA 57 billets for colonel include Chief, Contemporary Operational Environment within the 75th
Training Command.
   (c) Self-development. Continue to enhance branch or FA skill proficiency through additional senior-level assign-
ments and schooling.
   (d) Desired experience. The professional development objective for colonels is greater contribution to the FA and
the Army.
   (e) Additional factors. The objective of colonel professional development is greater contribution to the FA and the
RC.
Chapter 34
Electronic Warfare
34–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. The purpose of EW is to deny adversaries an actual or perceived advantage in and through the EMS and
ensure friendly unimpeded access to the same. EW Soldiers provide the land force commander with capabilities
required to plan and coordinate the conduct of electronic attack, electronic protection and EW support activities in
support of unified land operations. EW supports the mission command warfighting function staff task to conduct cyber
electromagnetic activities, which are leveraged to seize, retain, and exploit an advantage in both cyberspace and the
electromagnetic spectrum, while simultaneously denying and degrading threat use of the same, and protecting the
mission command system. Cyber electromagnetic activities consists of cyberspace operations, EW, and spectrum
management operations. Cyberspace operations are offensive and defensive in nature and EW is composed of
electronic attack, electronic protection and EW support. EW officers understand and articulate the electromagnetic
environment and its impacts on operations while integrating and synchronizing cyber electromagnetic activities in
support of the land force commander’s objectives.
   b. Proponent information. The proponent for Army EW is the CG, Cyber Center of Excellence, Fort Gordon, GA.
Further information can be obtained through http://www.gordon.army.mil. CG, Combined Arms Center’s action agency
is the Electronic Warfare proponent office, located at 950 Bluntville Lane, Building 391, Fort Leavenworth, KS
66027–2100. Telephone contact information is DSN 552–9463 or commercial (913) 684–9463.
   c. Functions. EW is predominately joint in nature and is a developing, dynamic career field in the Army. It is
essential for denying or degrading (offensive electronic attach) enemy operations while ensuring the protection and
survivability of friendly systems and units operating within the electromagnetic environment. The Army Electronic
Warfare officer (EWO) is the commander’s subject matter expert for all operations in and through the EMS. EW is a
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             327

technical capability that resides within the mission command warfighting function and must effectively coordinate
across all of the other warfighting to successfully support unified land operations.
34–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders. These leaders must be grounded in Army Values and the
Warrior Ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the spectrum of
conflict. They must be able to operate with unified action partners and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in
achieving their objectives. Officers must be culturally astute and able to use their awareness and understanding to
conduct operations innovatively and courageously to exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the
operational environment. Further explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in ADP 1–0, ADP 3–0, ADRP
1–0, ADRP 3–0, and in chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of an Electronic Warfare officer. The EWOs—
   (1) Possess a firm understanding of intelligence preparation of the battlespace and the military decision-making
process (MDMP), and provide valuable, relevant feedback affecting mission accomplishment and unit survivability.
   (2) Be skilled in building teamwork within an organization.
   (3) Capable of operating without direct oversight or guidance—self-motivated.
   (4) Possess the ability to express oneself clearly, concisely and accurately, both orally and in writing, and be able to
make presentations to the commander and staff for decision-making purposes.
   (5) Represent EW equities to commanders and staffs that may not understand the importance and relevance of this
critical capability.
   (6) Apply doctrinal knowledge and translate technical data into useable information to solve the tactical problems,
and formulate and defend solutions to problems using current Army and joint doctrine.
   (7) Understand the principles of the EMS and frequency management.
   (8) Understand and integrate area of responsibility lessons learned in a tactical environment.
   (9) Possess a baccalaureate degree.
   (10) Possess top secret/sensitive compartmented information access prior to attending the EW Qualification Course.
   c. Functional competencies. FA 29 officers plan, coordinate, synchronize, and deconflict cyber electromagnetic
activities operations at all levels. Additionally FA 29 officers perform a wide range of tasks, but are not limited to:
management and coordination of friendly EW systems, EW effects assessment, integration of EW capabilities into the
staff processes, integration of non-organic EW support, and integration of cyberspace operations in support of unified
land operations. These capabilities-when applied across warfighting functions-enable EWOs to leverage the spectrum to
achieve effects that support the commander’s endstate. An Army EWO primarily serves on staffs at BCT through
ASCC. The EWO—
   (1) Advises commander and staff on the cyber electromagnetic activities capabilities, limitations, legal considera-
tions and employment.
   (2) Advises the commander and staff on the targeting requirements for cyber electromagnetic activities.
   (3) Plans, coordinates, integrates, and assesses cyber electromagnetic activities to support the ground force
commander.
   (4) Leads the organic cyber electromagnetic activities element and forms the cyber electromagnetic activities
working group.
   (5) Assists the G–2/S–2 in developing the threat (cyber/EW) characteristics during the intelligence preparation of the
battlefield process.
   (6) Deconflicts EW operations with spectrum manager(s).
   (7) Develops and maintains a current assessment of available EW resources.
   (8) When designated, serves as the jamming control authority.
   (9) Prepares, submits for approval, and supervises the issuing and implementation of orders/fragmentary orders for
cyber electromagnetic activities operations.
34–3. Officer development
   a. Officer development model. FA 29 has numerous opportunities for career development. The goal of the profes-
sional development of EW officers is to produce and sustain highly-qualified and experienced officers who will be able
to integrate the use of cyber electromagnetic activities capabilities for commanders at progressively higher levels of
command. The officer development model is focused more on the quality and range of experience, rather than the
specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain experience during basic branch assignments and gain a foundation for future success as
an FA 29 officer. All officers should have attended a branch CCC and had successful company command prior to entry
into FA 29.
   (2) All FA transfers are handled by VTIP. This panel standardizes functional transfers, meets dynamic FA/branch
328                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

requirements, and empowers officers to make informed career decisions by providing flexible and viable career paths.
The VTIP panel convenes quarterly.
   (3) Officers are encouraged to seek out both civilian and military educational opportunities. Military-orientated
training for all EW officers include Army Cyberspace Operations Planners Course, Special Technical Operations
Planners Coursent Network Attack Course, EW Coordination Course, and Joint EW Theater Operations Course.
   (4) Flexible time lines allow officers to take personal responsibility for the design of their careers by making
informed and logical decisions and acting on them. The Army Career Tracker is a career management tool allowing
officers to work with a chosen mentor, map out a career timeline, and view career opportunities. The Army Career
Tracker integrates training, assignment history, formal and informal education information from 15 databases and
systems into one interactive and easy-to-use interface. Used properly, this tool facilitates structured mentorship and can
be utilized and revised by successive mentors as an officer progresses in experience. Login at https://actnow.army.mil.
   b. Lieutenant development. EW branch is a volunteer non-accession branch that draws its officers from other
branches of the Army at the entry rank of captain. FA 29 has no authorized/assigned lieutenants.
   c. Captain development. The professional development objective for this phase is to serve as a staff officer in the
operating force developing tactical skills and expanding capabilities through developmental assignments.
   (1) Education. Completion of CCC and FAQ.
   (2) Assignments.
   (a) Key developmental. All captain billets are considered developmental positions. Officers assessed into FA 29
should expect to rotate between KD positions at BCTs, and multifunctional brigades in order to gain a cyber
electromagnetic activities operational perspective in order to prepare for future joint assignments.
   (b) Broadening assignments. Officers should view the concept of broadening as a purposeful expansion of a leader’s
capabilities and understanding provided through opportunities internal and external to the Army. Broadening is
accomplished across an officer’s full career through experiences and/or education in different organizational cultures
and environments. The intent for broadening is to develop an officer’s capability to see, work, learn and contribute
outside each one’s own perspective or individual level of understanding for the betterment of both the individual
officer and the institution. Broadening opportunities may vary in scope, responsibility, and developmental outcomes.
These positions are typically self or branch nominative in nature and typically fall in four major categories listed
below.
   1. Functional/institutional. Captains should view these assignments as directly related to EW, but provide the
opportunity to develop a wider range of knowledge and skills useful in an Army specific environment or a broader
joint context. Examples of these assignments include those to special operations units, Asymmetric Warfare Group,
CTC, and the Centers of Excellence.
   2. Academia and civilian enterprise. Opportunities not available for EW captains.
   3. Joint/multinational. Limited opportunities available for EW captains.
   4. Interagency/intergovernmental. Opportunities not available for EW captains.
   (3) Self-development. Captains should continue to gain an in-depth understanding of MDMP and concentrate on
those critical EW tasks required to accomplish their wartime mission while winning on the battlefield. These provide
the foundation of knowledge required to effectively serve as a staff officer at the brigade or division level. Emphasis
should be maintained on historical and current lessons learned as they apply to tactical and leadership challenges.
   d. Major development. The professional development objective for this phase is to expand the officer’s tactical and
technical experience. As a result, the officer will develop as an EW warrior and leader with a comprehensive
understanding of operations in a joint and expeditionary environment. FA 29 majors continue to develop their
knowledge and understanding of the operational force by serving as a staff officer at brigade through corps level. These
assignments ensure FA 29 officers are prepared for increasingly complex, developmental assignments.
   (1) Education. All FA 29 majors must successfully complete the FA 29 qualification training and the U.S.
Command and General Staff College officer resident or nonresident course or a sister Service ILE course to be JPME I
qualified. Majors will also be able to compete for attendance at the SAMS, Training With Industry, and advanced civil
schooling.
   (2) Assignments.
   (a) Key developmental. All FA 29 billets are considered KD positions.
   (b) Broadening assignments. Broadening opportunities may vary in scope, responsibility and developmental out-
comes and typically fall in four major categories listed below:
   1. Functional/institutional. Majors should view these assignments as directly or indirectly related to EW, but provide
the opportunity to develop a wider range of knowledge and skills useful in an Army specific environment or a broader
joint context. Examples of these assignments include those to special operations units, Asymmetric Warfare Group,
CTCs, HRC, Centers of Excellence, HQDA, and the EW program manager office.
   2. Academia and civilian enterprise. These assignments focus on civilian industry and knowledge, skills, and
abilities not generally obtained from organic experiences, training or education. Examples include Training With
Industry and fellowships.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              329

   3. Joint/multinational. These assignments are joint opportunities related or unrelated to EW that require routine
interaction with JIIM organizations and personnel. Examples include assignments at FORSCOM, Army Central
Command, U.S. Army Europe, U.S. Army Africa, U.S. Army Pacific, NATO headquarters, and Joint Electronic
Warfare Center. While not every officer will receive an assignment in a qualifying joint assignment or serve a
fellowship in a JIIM agency, the goal is to provide the maximum opportunity for FA 29 majors to receive JIIM
experience. The JIIM assignments for FA 29 majors are dependent on Army demands and position/fellowship
availability.
   4. Interagency/intergovernmental. These opportunities are more politically and policy oriented. Examples include
NSA and other agencies outside DOD.
   (3) Self-development. FA 29 majors are expected to continue self-development efforts to build organizational
leadership, strategic perspective and hone operational skills. Continued learning, supported by both civilian and military
education, provides critical opportunities to develop both joint and expeditionary competencies. Officers should stay
abreast of technical developments through formal and informal study including EW trade and professional journals.
Majors should begin or continue work on a graduate degree related to EW. Examples include engineering disciplines
related to electronics, computers, telecommunications, and data communications systems. IT, systems engineering and
operations research also provide excellent educational background.
   e. Lieutenant colonel development. The professional development objective for this phase is demonstrated excellence
in tactical skills, technical proficiency, and a greater contribution to the FA and the Army.
   (1) Education. There is no educational requirement. Successful completion of JPME II is desired.
   (2) Assignments.
   (a) Key developmental. All FA 29 billets are considered KD positions. These EW positions are primarily within
Army division, corps, ASCC, Army headquarters, or joint staff.
   (b) Broadening assignments. Broadening opportunities may vary in scope, responsibility, and developmental out-
comes and typically fall in four major categories listed below:
   1. Functional/institutional. Lieutenant colonels should view these assignments as directly or indirectly related to EW,
but provide the opportunity to develop a wider range of knowledge and skills useful in an Army specific environment
or a broader joint context. Examples of these assignments include TCM EW, EW course director, select Center of
Excellence, and at HQDA.
   2. Academia and civilian enterprise. These assignments focus on civilian industry and knowledge, skills and abilities
not generally obtained from organic experiences, training or education. Examples of these assignments include Training
With Industry and fellowships.
   3. Joint/multinational. These assignments are joint opportunities related or unrelated to EW that require routine
interaction with JIIM organizations and personnel. Examples of these assignments are those at FORSCOM, Army
Central Command, U.S. Army Europe, U.S. Army Africa, NATO headquarters, and Joint Electronic Warfare Center.
   4. Interagency/intergovernmental. These opportunities are more politically and policy oriented. Examples include
NSA and other agencies outside DOD.
   (3) Self-development. During this phase, self-assessment, continuous learning, and perfecting mentoring and mana-
gerial skills are essential to officer development. The officer should continue to hone his or her combined arms
warfighting skills and understanding of the joint operational environment. In addition, officers should continue to read
books from the CSA’s professional reading list to improve critical thinking and understanding of the profession of
arms.
   f. Colonel development. The professional development objective for this phase is sustainment of warfighting,
training, technical and staff skills, along with utilization of leadership, organizational and executive talents. The
objective of FA 29 colonel professional development is greater contribution to the FA and the Army. FA 29 colonels
will integrate the full spectrum of EW and cyberspace capabilities at operational levels by serving on joint, combatant
command, corps, ACOM, or ASCC staffs.
   (1) Education. FA 29 colonels should successfully complete SSC either resident or nonresident. Successful comple-
tion of JPME II is desired.
   (2) Assignments.
   (a) Key developmental. All FA 29 billets are considered KD positions. These EW positions are primarily within
Army corps, ASCC, Army headquarters, or joint staff.
   (b) Broadening assignments. Broadening opportunities may vary in scope, responsibility, and developmental out-
comes and typically fall in four major categories listed below:
   1. Functional/institutional. Colonels should view these assignments as directly or indirectly related to EW, but
provide the opportunity to develop a wider range of knowledge and skills useful in an Army specific environment or a
broader joint context. Examples of these assignments include TCM EW, and HQDA.
   2. Academia and civilian enterprise. These assignments focus on civilian industry and knowledge, skills, and
abilities not generally obtained from organic experiences, training, or education. Examples of these assignments include
Training With Industry and fellowships.
   3. Joint/multinational. These assignments are joint opportunities related or unrelated to EW that require routine
330                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

interaction with JIIM organizations and personnel. FA 29 officers are encouraged to seek joint education and duty
assignments to achieve joint status.
   4. Interagency/intergovernmental. These opportunities are more politically and policy oriented. Examples include
NSA and other agencies outside DOD.
   (3) Self-development. FA 29 colonels must maintain their core skills and remain current on all changes that affect
the Soldiers they manage. Officers also need to stay current on industry trends through trade associations and journals,
and by participating in DOD and industry sponsored forums.
                                      Figure 34–1. FA 29 officer career development
34–4. Warrant officer development
   a. Characteristics required of Electronic Warfare technicians. The Electronic Warfare technician (EWT), 290A, is
an intelligent and adaptive problem-solver, capable of providing workable solutions to complex problems, with limited
resources. The 290A serves as a resident technical and tactical EW expert prepared to organize, manage, and lead EW
elements. The EWT must understand relationships, teamwork, and interpersonal dynamics and have the ability to
integrate these concepts to achieve effects. They must be the consummate professional; self-motivated and self-
disciplined, and live the Army Values. The EWT must possess the ability to build concise products. The EWT must
have a secret clearance with the ability to obtain and maintain a top secret/sensitive compartmented information
clearance; they must immediately initiate procedures to obtain the proper level of clearance upon notification of
accession/selection as a 290A.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of an Electronic Warfare technician. The EWT is an EW technical expert, leader,
trainer and advisor to commanders at all levels. The 290A must maintain a high degree of technical and tactical
knowledge in regards to the effects of friendly and adversary EW systems on the electromagnetic spectrum and cyber
                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            331

electromagnetic activities concepts useful to commanders. Through progressive levels of training, education, and
assignments the EW warrant officer develops the ability to integrate cyber electromagnetic activities support from the
BCT to the joint force headquarters level. EW warrant officers enhance a commander’s ability to gain and maintain a
tactical advantage in the electromagnetic spectrum. EWTs are mainly accessed from EW specialists (29E) who possess
a high degree of success spanning multiple echelons and demonstrate technical expertise in all facets of EW.
   c. Functions. The EWT analyzes, plans, organizes, implements, monitors, integrates, and assesses EW operations,
threat environment, and technical requirements. The EWT will assist the intelligence staff in creating the enemy
electronic order of battle and assist in updating the running estimate as far as EW is concerned. The EWT will work in
concert with the fires cell/section to disrupt or destroy EW targets, whether by lethal or nonlethal means. The EWT,
with a thorough understanding of equipment operational capabilities and limitations, and the EMS, provides advice on
the technical and tactical employment of both organic and non-organic EW systems. The EWT focuses the efforts of
these EW systems, both air and ground, against adversary personnel, facilities, or equipment with the intent of
preventing adversarial employment, while protecting the use of all friendly EW operations through active coordination,
integration and deconfliction. The EWT will integrate cyber electromagnetic activities into the targeting and planning
process as well as assist in the development of the enemy/adversary threat (cyber/EW) characteristics, EW target
information and products, intelligence, and target selection standards. Based on situational and battle analysis the EWT
will make critical EW reprogramming recommendations. The EWT should have a general understanding and compre-
hension in general aspects of cyber operations. The EWT facilitates and manages unit maintenance oversight and
training programs as it pertains to EW. The EWT will evaluate the technical and tactical operations of EW sections
with regards to training, composure, and effectiveness. EWTs perform the following functions/tasks:
   (1) Advise commanders on capabilities and employment of cyber electromagnetic activities assets and capabilities.
   (2) Maintain and assist in development of the EW staff estimate.
   (3) Monitor electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) for indications and warnings enabling immediate threat recognition
and targeting
   (4) Determine intelligence requirements, priorities, target selection standards (TSS), attack guidance, and targeting
objectives for cyber electromagnetic activities.
   (5) Assist and coordinate with S–2/G2 on intelligence preparation of the battlefield and electronic order of battle as
it pertains to EW.
   (6) Deconflict electronic attack/EW support with ACE/CM&D in the collection process.
   (7) Assist the EWO and staff in the analysis of the relevant/current situation and predict EW needs.
   (8) Implement electronic attack spectrum interference resolution and manage EW reprogramming, as required.
   (9) Coordinate external support for EW mission requirements and integrate EW into planning/targeting processes.
   (10) Conduct EW combat assessment in support of the targeting process.
   (11) Perform quality assurance, quality control, and prioritize EW requests from subordinate units.
   (12) Manage cyber electromagnetic activities training programs and all assets assigned.
   (13) Support 29A functions with cyber electromagnetic activities technical and tactical expertise and data
   (14) Develop and mentor all EW Soldiers.
   d. Warrant officer one/chief warrant officer two development.
   (1) Entry level. Upon warrant officer selection, all NCO (warrant officer candidates upon arrival) will complete
WOCS. WOCS provides the basic skills necessary to prepare the warrant officer candidate to become an effective
Army warrant officer. WOCS consists of two phases: Phase 1 is available as both distributed learning and resident.
Attendance at the resident phase is mandatory for all in the grade of E1 through E4 prior to entry into the program,
non-Primary Leadership Development Course/Warrior Leader Course (or equivalent) graduates in the grade of E5, and
all prior service Air Force, Navy, or Coast Guard personnel who have not completed Army or Marine Corps basic
training. All others will complete phase 1 through DL. Phase 2, 5-week resident course at Fort Rucker, Alabama, for
AA candidates or at one of the RC-regional training institutes for USAR or ARNG candidates is attended as resident
training by all candidates After graduation from WOCS and appointment to WO1, each officer will attend the 16 week
WOBC at Fort Sill.
   (2) Education. The 290A EW Technician Basic Course provides EW technicians the education, training, and core
skills necessary to successfully perform EW in support of the Army EW program. Emphasis is on Army tactics,
techniques, and procedures to prepare warrant officers to execute EW tactically at the brigade level encompassing a
base line understanding of how it fits into joint operations. Junior grade warrant officers need to attend assignment
oriented training to increase knowledge in joint EW operations, develop a basic understanding of cyber electromagnetic
activities, increase joint targeting knowledge and increase knowledge in a related special skill area to increase
competitiveness. Completion of the ST7000 Action Officer’s Course is required once promoted to CW2 and before
attendance to the WOAC. Completion of an associate’s degree is a recommended goal prior to becoming eligible for
promotion to CW3. Army Reserve warrant officers must complete WOAC prior to selection for CW3.
   (3) Assignments. After WOBC, EWTs are primarily assigned to the cyber electromagnetic activities element of
brigade and regimental size units.

   (4) Self-development. Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportu-
nities to develop both joint and expeditionary competencies throughout the warrant officer’s career. Self-development
during this phase should focus on critical reasoning and creative thinking skills for effective problem solving and
decision-making centered on becoming experts in planning and integrating EW into operations. Access to joint and
specialized education courses is highly recommended for EW technicians based on the needs of the specific unit.
   (5) Desired experience. A thorough understanding and technical competence in EW systems, operations, intelli-
gence, and the targeting and planning processes are desired. Continuous education, training, experience and self-
development in the execution of joint EW prepare the warrant officer for future assignments and selection to CW3.
   e. Chief warrant officer three development.
   (1) Education. The WOAC focuses on advanced technical training and common leader development subjects
designed to prepare officers for assignment in senior-level EW positions. The resident course consists of 8 weeks of
advanced technical and tactical training in EW at the division, corps, Joint Task Force, or ASCC. WOAC should be
completed no later than 1 year time in grade as a CW3. Army Reserve warrant officers must complete WOSC prior to
selection to CW4.
   (2) Assignments. CW3s will primarily be assigned to multifunctional brigades such as CAB, CA, MISO, or fires.
Select warrant officers in the grade of W3 can also expect to receive assignments consistent with the needs of the
Army, such as the following:
   (a) Special Forces groups.
   (b) Ranger regiment.
   (c) Service school (WOCS/WOBC).
   (d) Training/doctrine developer.
   (e) Special Operations Aviation Regiment.
   (f) Information operations field support teams.
   (3) Self-development. Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportu-
nities to develop both joint and expeditionary competencies throughout the warrant officer’s career. Assignment
oriented and joint training courses are needed to develop characteristics required of a senior technician based on current
and projected duty assignments. Completion of a baccalaureate degree is a recommended goal prior to becoming
eligible for promotion to CW4.
   (4) Desired experience. CW3s need a minimum of 3–4 years BCT level EW technician experience prior to serving
at the division level. This may include knowledge and skills developed and demonstrated abilities at a multifunctional
brigade, an SF group, or some other special assignment to increase proficiency necessary for successful coordination
and deconfliction between various types of units. Technical comprehension and competence in EW systems, operations,
intelligence, and the targeting and planning processes at the brigade level need to be mastered prior to becoming a
senior warrant officer (CW4).
   f. Chief warrant officer four development.
   (1) Education. WOSC is a 5-week professional development course with a DL component taught at the WOCC, Fort
Rucker, AL. WOSC provides intermediate level PME and leader development training that prepares senior-level
warrant officers (CW3/CW4) to function as staff officers, trainers, managers, systems integrators, and leaders at various
levels of Army, joint organizations executing unified land operations thru decisive action. Army Reserve warrant
officers must complete WOSSC prior to promotion to CW5.
   (2) Assignments. CW4s will serve as EW technicians in positions at division, corps or in generating force organiza-
tions, such as the following:
   (a) Course manager (WOBC/WOAC).
   (b) Materiel developer.
   (c) HRC branch manager.
   (d) Joint Special Operations Command.
   (e) CTC.
   (3) Self-development. CW4s should continue self-development efforts to enhance expertise in all aspects of EW,
asset employment, and the targeting and planning processes to include joint and combined operations utilizing
assignment oriented training. CW4s should devote time to beginning a graduate-level degree in an associated field of
study. CW4s should attend WOSC by the 1 year time in grade point as a CW4. CW4s must attend WOSC for
promotion to CW5.
   (4) Desired experience. CW4s should have experience at the brigade and division level coupled with quality
performance in a generating force position prior to being assigned to a corps, Joint Task Force, or ASCC EW element.
   g. Chief warrant officer five development.
   (1) Education. The WOSSC is a 2 phase course consisting of Phase 1 (DL) and a 4-week Phase 2 (resident) course
attended by the Army’s most senior warrant officers at Fort Rucker, AL. The educational goal is to provide senior
CW4s or new CW5s with the master-level education, knowledge, and influential leadership skills necessary to apply
their technical expertise in support of leaders on strategic level joint staffs during unified land operations. The WOSSC
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             333

can be attended after 1 year time in grade to CW4 and should be completed by 1 year time in grade CW5. CW5s
should continue work in an associated graduate-level field of study.
   (2) Assignments. CW5s will serve as EW technicians in positions at corps, ASCC, JFHQ or as the service school/
branch lead. The senior designated CW5 generally serves as the chief warrant officer of the branch at the proponent.
   (3) Self-development. CW5s should continue self-development efforts to enhance expertise in all aspects of EW to
include joint and combined operations.
   (4) Desired experience. CW5s should have EW experience at all levels and have attained proficiency of all critical
tasks through combined experiences and career self-development in every facet of EW and associated career paths.
   (5) Assignment oriented training. All EW technicians need to continue to seek assignment oriented training to
maintain expertise in all aspects of joint targeting and special skill areas. Assignment oriented training includes, but is
not limited to the following courses:
   (a) Joint Firepower Course; Nellis Air Force Base, NV.
   (b) Joint Targeting Staff Course, Norfolk NS, VA.

34–5. Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. RC officers are afforded the same qualification course training as AC EW officers.
RC officers typically do not have a centralized functional category designation, but choose to transition into FA 29,
normally at the senior company grade/junior field grade level, based on the needs of the officer and the unit.
   b. Functional area qualification and development opportunities. RC officers may seek assignments requiring EW
expertise that yield opportunities similar to their AC counterparts. Senior RC officers, who are well-grounded in their
branch/FA, could increase their professional breadth by seeking assignments outside their basic branch/FAs in develop-
mental positions that require leadership and managerial skills common to all officers.
   (1) The qualification standards at each rank as well as PME requirements are the same as for AC officers.
   (2) RC EW officers can expect to serve as EW planners at the brigade through division level. Duty assignments are
based on force structure, available officers, unit readiness requirements and geographic considerations.
   (3) RC officers with civilian-acquired skills in electronics, signals intelligence, computer network operations,
communications or other EW-related fields are valuable to the Army. Officers with these skills areas through
employment or civilian education will be competitive for promotion and selection to EW positions of increased
responsibility.
   (4) RC officers should attend the same residence education courses as their AC counterparts.
   c. Life-cycle development model. The life-cycle development model for EW officers and warrant officers are the
same for RC officers as for AC officers and warrant officers, respectively. Consideration must be used for the unique
circumstances of the RC officer or warrant officer when applying the applicable model’s template.
Part Four
Force Sustainment
The Force Sustainment functional category encompasses diverse career fields and branches that operate across the
entire sustainment community. These include and are not limited to the Logistics branch (and subordinate branches of
Transportation, Ordnance and Quartermaster), the AG branch, Financial Management branch, JAGC, Chaplain Corps,
AMEDD and the Army Acquisition Corps. Of these branches there are several Centers of Excellence and respective
proponents that make up the force sustainment community. These include and not limited to the Acquisition Center of
Excellence, the Sustainment Center of Excellence and the Soldier Support Institute and the AMEDD. The U.S. Army
Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM) at Fort Lee, VA operates as the Sustainment Center of Excellence and
is the major conduit for all force sustainment activities and hosts forums and working groups in order to achieve unity
of effort across the collective force sustainment community. The global responsive sustainment (GRS) forum is an
enduring sustainment strategy that unifies and optimizes the tactical through strategic sustainment warfighting function;
synchronizes the institutional and operational force; and integrates capabilities to support unified land operations. In
addition to the GRS, CASCOM also regulates access to the multifunctional logistical branch (or 90A) of non-logistical
branches within the force sustainment community. There now exists several opportunities for officers of specified
branches within the force sustainment community to operate in and compete for 90A KD positions and central
selection to battalion and brigade command. Access to 90A AOC is outlined in chapter 34.
Chapter 35
Logistics Corps Officer Branches
35–1. Introduction to the Logistics Officer Corps
The Logistics Officer Corps consists of officers in the historical Ordnance, Quartermaster, and Transportation regi-
ments as well as the multifunctional Logistics branch. This chapter explains how logistics officers are accessed,
assigned, and professionally developed, as well as describes the skills, knowledge, and attributes needed for officers to
succeed in today’s Army and the Army of 2020.
   a. Purpose. Logistics warriors are tactical experts and have a detailed knowledge of the entire sustainment opera-
tional environment which includes tactical, operational, and strategic formations in both conventional forces and SOF.
Logistics branch officers plan, integrate, and direct all types of sustainment activities in order to operate effectively to
Army 2020 and beyond in unified land operations. The global logistics concept addresses strategic level requirements
that logistics officers must be educated, trained, and have experiences in to provide the expertise to operate. They
coordinate unity of effort to optimize support for forces from home station through contingency operations. They learn
to better integrate ARSOF and joint logistics capabilities and vice versa. Rapid integration of RC formation dictates a
continued focus on their education, development, and broadening. With over 78 percent of sustainment structure in the
RC, leadership development and mentoring of officers are vital to the future success of the Army. To meet these
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              335

challenges, the Logistics branch merges Transportation, Ordnance, and Quartermaster basic branch officers into one
unified branch at the rank of captain.
   b. Chapter organization. This chapter is organized into an introductory section and four branch sections. The CG,
CASCOM is the proponent for this chapter. The Ordnance, Quartermaster, and Transportation branch proponents are
responsible for their particular sections within this chapter covering officers and warrant officers of all three compo-
nents: AA, ARNG, and USAR.
35–2. Logistics Branch
   a. Proponent information. The CG, CASCOM is the proponent for the Logistics branch and the contact office is the
Logistics Branch Proponency Office at the CASCOM, Fort Lee, VA 23801, 804–734–0315 or 804–765–7011 or email:
usarmy.lee.tradoc.mbx.leee-logistics-branch-proponency-office@mail.mil.
   b. Functions. Logistics branch officers serve at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels and require extensive
knowledge and experience in planning, preparing, executing, and assessing all warfighting functions while maintaining
an AOC in the sustainment warfighting function subcomponent, logistics (see ADP 4–0 for discussions on the
sustainment warfighting functions). Logistics tasks include ammunition management, supply, field services, transporta-
tion, maintenance, distribution, operational contract support, explosive and ordnance disposal and general engineering.
Logistics officers must be competent in these tasks across all warfighting functions in support of both conventional
force /SOF. Logistics officers must be adaptive and trained to support conventional force /SOF by nontraditional means
across dispersed logistically undeveloped non-permissive areas for enduring operations. Logistics branch officers must
be familiar with the other sustainment warfighting function subcomponents, including personnel services (HR support,
financial management operations, legal support, religious support, and band support) and health services support.
Logistics officers will develop their expertise through the four logistical learning areas of supply chain management,
defense industry base management, life-cycle management, and logistical planning.
   c. History and background. Army logistics dates back to the early days of the American Revolution with the
establishment of the Quartermaster Department in June 1775. The Ordnance Department followed during the War of
1812. World War II saw the creation of the Transportation Corps in July 1942. These three branches and their
supporting civilians have long, distinguished records of superior service and are vital components of the total Army
force structure. In 1993, FA 90 was created within the operations career field in order to support the development of
multifunctional logisticians. Since then, the FA 90 designation has been used to signify officers skilled across the
functional logistics branches. In 2005, as part of an OPMS review, an effort was undertaken to examine how to further
advance the notion of multifunctional logistics leaders. The result was the creation of a Logistics branch for officers in
the grade of captain through colonel and the formal recognition of a Logistics Officer Corps as approved by the Army
Chief of Staff in May 2006. The Logistics branch official establishment date was 1 January 2008.
   d. Logistics branch description. The Logistics officer branch describes all commissioned officers holding a primary
AOC as a multifunctional logistician. Commissioned officers assess as lieutenants into one of the three functional
branches (Ordnance, Quartermaster, or Transportation) to develop their functional branch skills for the first 4 years of
their careers. Upon promotion to captain and successful completion of the CLC3, officers are inducted into the
Logistics branch. Their original functional branch, Ordnance, Quartermaster, or Transportation, becomes their second-
ary AOC, regimental affiliation, and qualifies them for functional assignments. Officers cannot enter the Logistics
branch without a bachelor’s degree. Note. EOD officers are logistics officers, and may serve in multifunctional
logistics positions throughout their career, but especially 90A91 positions requiring ammunitions expertise. However,
EOD officers maintain AOC 89E91 and are primarily assigned to EOD officer positions unless they choose to revoke
their EOD volunteer statement. If revoked, these officers become 90A multifunctional logistical officers.
35–3. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers.
   (1) Logistics officers are multifunctionally developed and re experts in a basic core function; they possess specified
skill sets to support unified land operations of the future force. The goal for our officers is to ensure mission success
through quality logistics support. Critical thinking skills are paramount. Success requires balance between technical
skills and the ability to understand and apply those skills at the right moment. Success requires honed conceptual skills,
enabling officers to adapt to changing situations while integrating various aspects of sustainment within the mission
command environment. They are broadly experienced and adaptable across the levels of war, tactical, operational, and
strategic. Understanding industrial base capability and capacity is critical. Officers must operate in support of unified
action partners in special operations, joint, governmental, nongovernmental, and multinational organizations leveraging
capabilities and achieving objectives.
   (2) Logistics leaders place the welfare of all Soldiers above their own. They are grounded in the Army profession,
Army Values, and Warrior Ethos. These officers are innovative, proactive leaders who work in asymmetric and
unpredictable environments where time available for mission analysis is constrained, and sound, timely decisions are
required. They are physically conditioned and adaptable to rapidly evolving environments, improvising ways and
means to accomplish the mission when doctrinal approaches do not apply. From the basic course forward, tactics are an
336                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

essential skill set; tactics are incorporated into the training and education from inception to the end of their careers.
Detailed explanations of these characteristics are referenced in ADP 3–0 and chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique skills of a Logistics branch officer. The Logistics branch incorporates AOCs and numerous skill identifi-
ers (SI). All AOCs and SIs are open to male and female Logistics branch officers. Officers share a common, primary
AOC of 90A00. Logistics branch officers hold a secondary AOC indicating their functional specialty (90A88, 90A91,
90A92).
   (1) Multifunctional Logistics (AOC90A00) is the primary AOC for the Logistics branch. Officers command logistics
units as well as serve in various multifunctional logistics staff positions. All officers receive this designation as their
primary AOC once they graduate from the CLC3. Either the Support Operations Course or the TLog Planners Program
is an acceptable training substitute if an officer attends an alternate CCC.
   (2) Transportation (AOC 90A88) is the secondary designation for officers integrating from the 88. See Transporta-
tion branch paragraph 35–7.
   (3) Explosive Ordnance Disposal (AOC 89E). EOD officers are logistics officers, and may serve in multifunctional
logistics positions throughout their career, especially 90A91 positions requiring ammunitions expertise. However, EOD
officers maintain AOC 89E91 and are primarily assigned to EOD officer positions unless they choose to revoke their
EOD Volunteer Statement. If revoked these officers become 90A multifunctional logistical officers. For further EOD
officer professional development guidance see paragraph 35–13.
   (4) Maintenance and Ammunition (AOC 90A91) is the secondary designation for officers integrating from the 91.
See Ordnance Branch, paragraph 35–13.
   (5) Supply and services (AOC 90A92) is the secondary designation for officers integrating from the 92 AOC. See
Quartermaster Branch paragraph 35–19.
   c. Skill identifiers and coded positions for logistics officers. The below listing are SI that are critical and available to
all AOC 90A logisticians. The SI appears on the officer’s record upon completion of training or specific utilization
assignments. Officers may serve in coded positions if they hold the identifier or are scheduled for training.
   (1) AMSP (SI 6S).
   (2) Aerial Delivery and Materiel (SI R9).
   (3) Capabilities Development (SI 7Y).
   (4) Civil Supply Officer (SI 6E).
   (5) Green Belt in Lean Six Sigma (LSS) (SI 1X).
   (6) Instructor (SI 5K).
   (7) Joint Duty Assignment Qualified (SI 3A) for majors and above.
   (8) Joint Qualified Officer (SI 3L) for majors and above.
   (9) Joint Planner (SI 3H) for majors and above.
   (10) Parachutist (SI 5P).
   (11) Petroleum and Water (SI R8).
   (12) Advanced Civil Schooling Program (utilization position coded 96).
   (13) Mobilization and Demobilization Operations (SI 6M).
   (14) Mortuary affairs (SI 4V).
   (15) Operational Contract Support (SI 3C).
   (16) Red Team Member (SI 7J).
   (17) Red Team Leader (SI 7G).
   (18) TLog Planners Program (SI P1).
   (19) Training Development (SI 7Q).
   (20) Training With Industry or Internship utilization position coded 97.
   (21) Unit Air Movements Officer (SI 3S).
   (22) Equal Opportunity Officers Course (SI 5T).
   (23) HR Planners Course (SI not yet available).
   (24) Special Operations Experience (SI K9).
   d. Medical Service Corps (AOC 67), Finance Management Corps (AOC 36), and Adjutant General (AOC 42)
officers. The Medical Service Corps (MSC) officer, Finance Management Corps officer and AG officer are an integral
part of our support battalion structure and as such, they are offered the chance to hold KD positions at the captain and
major level. The more common positions being 90A company commands and later as a major with the support
operations officer and executive officer positions. Ideally, MSC, Financial Management, and AG officers will attend
CLC3 in order to obtain the requisite training for them to be successful at those jobs. The Support Operations Course
and TLog Planners Program are acceptable training substitutes if an officer did not have the opportunity to attend
CLC3 as a captain. This applies to both the AA and RC. It is this combination of training in conjunction with captain
or major level KD experiences that allow MSC, Financial Management, and AG officers to be competitive for
command of multifunctional logistic battalions and brigades. Those officers who do not have the requisite training and
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                                 337

KD experiences at either the captain or major level will not be allowed to compete in those lieutenant colonel/colonel
command categories. MSC, Financial Management, and AG officers that serve in 90A positions and meet the
requirements to compete for lieutenant colonel/colonel commands will retain their primary MSC 67, Financial Manage-
ment 36, and AG 42 AOCs. The 90A will become a secondary (and/or tertiary) AOC.
   e. Special operations experience. All logistics officers willing to attend Airborne school can serve in SOF forma-
tions. Opportunities are available for lieutenants and captains to serve in functional assignments and develop into 90A
positions and company/detachment command for KD experience. SOF provides opportunities for majors to serve in
90A positions including support operations/XO/S3/S4 positions to achieve KD requirements. SOF provides lieutenant
colonel/colonel command positions as well as other KD positions. Logisticians gain SOF experience at the lieutenant,
captain, and major level as they move between SOF and conventional force assignments performing KD and broaden-
ing assignments throughout. These logisticians must be managed with reassignments to SOF to provide continuity of
experience that enables a solid foundation for success at the lieutenant colonel and colonel-level positions within SOF.
Joint SOF assignments are best filled with logisticians who have previously served successful tours in SOF and these
assignments should be managed accordingly when the available assignment pool allows. This talent management will
provide SOF commanders with the best continuity of support by logisticians who have progressively invested and built
on their SOF experience.
35–4. Officer development
   a. The Logistical officer professional development model. The goal of the officer PDM is to produce a professional
warfighter who simultaneously provides expert sustainment in any operational environment, is adaptive to fluid
situations, and operates adeptly within the structure of mission command. The Logistics officer PDM is nested with the
army leader development strategy and develops an officer through three lines of effort: training, education, and
experience. these lines of effort are further divided into the three domains of leader development: institutional,
operational, and self-development. The Logistics PDM focuses on multifunctional, functional developmental, and
broadening experiences across the tactical, academic, unified action partner and strategic enabling levels. It provides
lifelong opportunities to gain new skill sets, expand understanding of mission command, sustainment functions, and
broadens capabilities. The model ensures an officer is developed, rather than aligned to a specific set of fixed gates or
assignments required for progression; see figure 35–1.
   (1) The PDM builds knowledge through lifelong learning, supported by PME, training, and civilian education. In
addition, it provides varied opportunities to build an officer’s competencies over a career. Meeting suggested timelines
enables officers to serve in broadening assignments. This process ensures officers have adequate time to gain skills and
experience required for future assignments.
   (2) The PDM is based on a simple guiding principle. Officers from lieutenant to lieutenant colonel experience the
majority of their KD time in tactical formations as platoon leaders, company commanders, and battalion commanders.
When not in KD positions in tactical formations, officers are broadened at the academic, unified action partner, and
strategic enabling levels. Over an officer’s career, they will have at least one assignment at the academic, unified action
partner, and strategic enabling levels. The PDM encourages officers to compete for nominative or competitively
selective broadening assignments.
   b. Profession/Career management and mentorship. Actively participating in career management decisions improves
the likelihood of a rewarding and successful career. Officer assignments are based on Army requirements, professional
development, and the officer’s preference. Each officer is responsible for shaping their own 5-year career plan. The
Army Career Tracker is designed in part to facilitate planning out one’s career with the advice of a mentor. The Army
Career Tracker provides a PDM that helps an officer lay out their goals. Officers invite seniors to be their mentor
through the Army Career Tracker. Mentors do not have to be in the officer’s rating chain or career field. Mentors must
be officers that the Soldier is comfortable with and have fair and frank discussions about family, career, life goals, and
the Army. Working with their mentor, officers build a career path that meets their desires, aligns with realistic
timelines, and meets the officer’s expectations of a successful career. Working with your assignments officer at HRC is
critical to an officer’s career management. Remember, an officer guided by an active mentor is the best way to manage
a career.
   c. Talent management. As we meet the requirements of Army 2020 and beyond, a greater breath of experiences and
skills are required to meet the challenges. Talent management of our officers provides greater adaptability and a
broader pallet of skill sets to draw upon. Broadening, KD, and functional/multifunctional assignments are the trajectory
for success for both the officer and the Army. For logisticians, talent management is how an individual officer’s unique
talents are recognized, developed, and managed. Identifying, fostering, and expanding an officer’s unique talents does
not begin at colonel, it starts at the lieutenant level. There are several people responsible for talent management. These
people include, and are not limited to, the officer’s raters, mentors, senior logistician at the respective installation, our
PME educators, the HRC managers and the branch proponent officer. All leaders are expected to identify unique
talents and encourage broadening opportunities in the appropriate area. Leaders are expected to encourage officers to
compete for appropriate nominative programs that broaden the officer’s innate talents. Leaders must review the three
focus areas of broadening and work with the officers to pair broadening opportunities with the officer’s skills for future
assignments. Leaders do this through the OER system and engagement with the officer’s HRC manager. As with many
338                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

installations, the senior logistician should conduct routine officer professional development forums informing the
logistical officer population in areas of talent management. These forums can include informative conferences with our
HRC branch managers.
   d. Experience line of effort. Key developmental, developmental, and broadening assignments. The PDM broadens
knowledge, skills, and abilities at each grade and develops logistical expertise across an officer’s career.
   (1) KD assignments are positions at each rank deemed fundamental to the development of an officer’s key
competences at that rank and may be achieved in either conventional force or SOF formations.
   (2) Developmental assignments support the growth of an officer’s multifunctional and/or functional knowledge,
skills, and attributes throughout their career. Logistics operations at the TSC level and below are our core competency.
Functional and multifunctional assignments are vital to developing an officer’s logistics expertise at each level of war:
tactical, operational, and strategic. These assignments increase an officer’s core functional skill set and multifunctional
capability. Opportunities and goals for developmental assignments are listed at each officer grade.
   (3) Broadening is the purposeful expansion of an individual’s capabilities and understanding provided through
opportunities internal and external to the Army throughout their career that are gained through experiences in different
organizational cultures and environments, resulting in a leader skilled in sustainment from the tactical through strategic
levels in multiple environments. There are four experience-based assignment categories that specifically broaden
logistics officers: functional/institutional, academic and civilian enterprise, unified action partner assignments, and
strategic enablers. The essence of broadening is to challenge the officer mentally in situations well outside their
comfort zone and force them to apply critical thinking to complex problems. Additionally, CASCOM further catego-
rizes broadening into three competitive areas: nominative, competitive, and general. In accordance with HRC requisi-
tion cycles, the Logistical Leader Development Board (LLDB) will prioritize available broadening assignments into
these three categories. Additionally, the LLDB will provide guidance on follow-on utilization as applicable. HRC will
use this assignment prioritization list to juxtapose an officer’s performance and unique skills in order to appropriately
assign broadening billets.
   (a) Institutional/functional broadening assignments for logisticians incorporate assignments that focus on the devel-
opment of an officer’s understanding of defense industry base management, supply chain management, and life-cycle
management. This includes all aspects of force management at the strategic level. Quite often institutional/functional
assignments are identical to strategic enabler assignments due to the level they operate.
   (b) Academic and civilian enterprise broadening is essential in developing an officer’s critical thinking capability
and exposure to alterative perspectives in problem solving. These opportunities include fellowships, internships,
advanced civil schooling, Training With Industry, and other educational opportunities.
   (c) Unified action partners refers to an expansion of the term formerly known as JIIM. These opportunities broaden
an officer in joint, governmental, nongovernmental, and private sector organizations with whom Army forces interact.
These environments provide an understanding of diverse service and/or business cultures and unique understanding of
the national level of policy, capability, procedures, strategy, and planning.
   (d) Strategic enablers describe organizations and stakeholders involved in providing materiel solutions for our
Soldiers. It incorporates all the materiel life-cycle functions to include research, development, acquisition, testing,
distribution, supply, maintenance, industrial base operations, and material disposal. It also encompasses the institutional
Army providing trained and ready Soldiers, education, leadership development, doctrine, and capabilities.
   (4) Unique academic broadening experiences include selection and attendance at advanced civil schooling, intern-
ships, Training With Industry, scholarship, or fellowship programs. These programs are very desirable and highly
competitive for our most talented officers. These selective experiences broaden an officer external to the Army PME,
evolve critical thinking, expand engagement skills, and provide exposure to other organizational cultures. Broadening
in these areas proliferates the officer’s understanding and adaptability to organizations, new methods, and corporate
cultures well outside traditional competencies. Suggested broadening opportunities are listed at each officer grade.
   (5) Officers are provided the opportunity to complete a master’s degree through a number of venues. Logistics
officers are highly encouraged to complete a master’s degree prior to competing for colonel. Online degrees at
accredited institutions meet this requirement.
   (6) Degrees listed in the national logistics curriculum and institutions partnered with the U.S. Army Logistics
University (ALU) are preferred over all others. Officers engaged in fully funded academic programs must use the
national logistics curriculum listing when choosing their course of study. Specially focused fellowships, internships, or
scholarships are the only exceptions. The CASCOM commander is the approving authority for all exceptions to policy.
National logistics curriculum listing is located at http://www.alu.army.mil/alu_about/aluaboutnlc.htm.
   (7) Joint, governmental, and multinational—be unified action partner or strategic enabler broadening opportunities.
Some are short-term, 90 to 180 days, or long term, 2- to 3-year assignments. Joint duty assignments in Joint and
Government agencies are primer broadening experiences that provide cross service or governmental cultural awareness.
Officers broaden their understanding of unique business practices, thought processes, and operations of the organiza-
tions. Multinational assignments develop military-to-military understanding, cultural awareness, regional expertise, and
national policy adaptability in the officer. Joint credit is awarded to majors and above assigned to specific Joint duty
assignment positions, meet tour requirements and have completed JPME II.
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            339

   e. Education line of effort. The education line of effort is divided into civilian education and PME. The civilian
education requirements only demand an undergraduate degree of all officers prior to attending CLC3. Actively
pursuing graduate degrees are highly encouraged and should have a concentration listed from the national logistics
curriculum or ALU partners. PME is required education meeting the needs of officer development. PME opportunities
for each rank are listed by rank.
   (1) Required PME is the BOLC, CLC3, Command and General Staff Officer Course, and SSC or accredited
equivalent-level schooling or fellowships. Officers must complete these courses on time at each grade.
   (2) Officers shall not be assigned to KD positions unless they have completed the PME requirement for that rank.
Exceptional circumstances must occur for an officer to be assigned to a KD position before completion of that rank’s
PME requirement.
   (3) Some PME opportunities enable an officer to gain a master’s degree. Officers are strongly encouraged to take
advantage of these opportunities. Most advanced degree and/or masters degree programs require submission of
graduate record examination or graduate management admission test for admission consideration.
   f. Training line of effort. The training an officer receives and administers throughout a career profession is an
essential element of leader development. There are several milestone training events that are essential building blocks
in our leader development. The training line of effort is divided into the following three milestone events: Home
Station Training (individual/collective training), CTC-like exercises (JRTC, NTC, JMRC, FAOl Eagle, JRSOI, and so
forth) and training management.
   (1) CTC-like training event. An officer should actively seek out opportunities to experience a CTC-like training
event that stresses a unit collectively, with integrated external observer controllers providing professional after action
reviews. Additionally, field grade officers should actively pursue unified endeavor-like staff exercises (division
warfighter, UFL) that the test units at echelon above brigade with integrate observer controllers sourced from the
mission command training program. Although no specific number of CTC rotations are prescribed, it is recommended
and certainly an important factor in the determination of future assignments.
   (2) Home station training. Home station training provides a multifunctional logistician experience in training and
certifying individual and collective skills across all the sustainment occupational skills. Senior logisticians of all units
and installations must ensure that all logisticians remain proficient in their sustainment individual skill level through
home station low-density MOS certification training. Known as “sustainment gunnery,” annual low-density certification
of individual MOS proficiency provides a multifunctional logistician a key training management opportunity. Home
station training also includes section/squad, platoon and company-level certification training exercises. It is this home
station training experience that provides our officers the opportunity to gain expertise in training management.
   (3) Training management. Finally, it is expected that all logistics officers are proficient in the training model (in
accordance with ADRP 7–0), synchronizing training in company training meetings and master the ability to plan, prep,
execute, and assess training.
   g. Self-development. Officers learn what they do not know and fill the gaps through self-development. Self-
development is as important as the institutional and operational domains. Self-development is a personal responsibility
to seek out opportunities to sustain individual strength and address gaps in skills and knowledge. Effective self-
development is, at minimum, divided into the two categories: lifelong learning and self-assessment.
   (1) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force—regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (2) A critical component of the self-development domain is MSAF. The MSAF program-also referred to as 360-
degree assessment-helps officers raise self-awareness and better shape their self-development efforts. The MSAF
provides input from peers, superiors, and subordinates which help the rated officer develop as a self-aware and
adaptable leader.
   h. Performance. At all grades and any duty position, manner of performance is paramount. It does not matter what
assignments or positions officers perform, they are expected to be professional and do their best. Promotion derives
from an officer’s entire file over a career and is performance-based. It does not hinge on a few perceived noteworthy
positions. Understanding that performance in all assignments (not just KD) is vital and results in nominations and
selection for competitive opportunities.
   i. Lieutenant. The professional development objective for this phase is to develop functional expertise in the
officer’s basic branch. Logistics officers are accessed into one of the three functional branches, Ordnance, Quartermas-
ter, or Transportation. Although an officer is branched in one of these three areas, positions exist in the operational
domain that provide a lieutenant multifunctional experience - particularly in the second and third year of the officer’s
timeline. Senior logisticians must manage their lieutenants to so that junior officers experience these positions with
multifunctional requirements later in their initial three-year first assignment period. An example of this type of officer
slating would consist of assigning officers arriving from BOLC into functional platoon assignments, such as mainte-
nance control officer, supply warehouse platoon leader, transportation platoon leader and fuel and water platoon leader.
Later, after successfully completing a functional platoon billet; but, moreover showing the competencies of a senior
platoon leader, an officer can then be assigned the multifunctional mission. Multifunctional lieutenant positions that
340                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

demand this type of scrutiny and rigor are the FSC distribution platoon, and FSC or distribution company executive
officer positions. The key distinguishing characteristic is the requirement to operate independently away from senior
logistical commands and without the functional expertise provided by a subordinate warrant officer. Officers are
inducted into the Logistics branch after promotion to captain and successful completion of CLC3. Refer to branch
sections for details regarding professional development during the pre-CLC3 years of a Logistics officer’s career.
   j. Captain. The developmental objective for this phase is to develop an officer’s multifunctional expertise across the
spectrum of sustainment while continuing to sharpen their functional expertise. Officers who have demonstrated
leadership capabilities and future potential are provided the privilege of competing for company or detachment
command; some officer may not have the opportunity to command. The majority of captain-level commands are in the
tactical force. After command, top-level captains compete for competitive academic, unified action partner or strategic
enabling broadening assignments.
   (1) Education. The PME requirement for captains is completion of the CLC3 before the end of an officer’s fifth year
of service. Officers receive advanced instruction in their basic branch and basic instruction in multifunctional logistics.
They gain knowledge and techniques in commanding at the company or detachment level and tools for performing as a
staff officer. The Support Operations Course or TLog Planners Program are acceptable substitutes if an officer attended
an alternate CCC.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. The only KD assignment for a captain is company or detachment command.
   (a) Captains shall not be assigned to KD positions unless they have completed CLC3. After graduation from CLC3,
captains are generally assigned to battalion- or brigade-level staff positions.
   (b) Command for 18 months is the standard. Minimum requirement is 12 months for KD and 18 months for
standard.
   (c) There is no difference between “forward” and “rear” commands. Both are competitive command selected
positions and count as a KD assignment.
   (d) There are many types of company and detachment commands; some are multifunctional or branch immaterial,
such as a forward support company, distribution, headquarters, or recruiting command. Some are functional commands,
such as ammunition, EOD, field maintenance, movement control, aerial delivery, supply, training, or transportation
companies. It does not matter what type of company or detachment an officer commands. All 90A00, 90A91, or 90A88
commands are available to any officer holding the 90A AOC.
   (3) Broadening assignments. Officers are expected to continuously develop their mastery of their basic branch while
developing multifunctional expertise. Junior captains hone their skills in the tactical force. After company command,
broadening occurs in academic, unified action partner and strategic enabler assignments. Below are noteworthy
opportunities that broaden an officer’s skills and abilities at the captain’s level (in no particular order).
   (a) Broadening assignments include the following in table 35–1:

   (b) Competitive academic, unified action partner and strategic enabling broadening opportunities include the
following:
   1. Advanced civil schooling. These are competitively selective, fully funded advanced degree programs at the
graduate or doctoral level. Many programs are in a sustainment-related or business-focused discipline. Upon comple-
tion of the program, the officer serves in an appropriate utilization assignment and generally incurs a 3-year ADSO.
Officers cannot have more than 17 years of active Federal service upon entry to the program, have an undergraduate
GPA of 2.5 or better, and meet both the prospective universities and the advanced education programs branch
requirements. Academic broadening.
   2. National Logistics Curriculum program provides comprehensive integrated knowledge of sustainment as an
enabler to the Army’s 2020 strategy. The national logistics curriculum defines competencies in the core academic skill
sets for graduate-level multifunctional logisticians. These skill sets are the catalysts for broadening officers from the
operational to strategic levels of sustainment. These master degree producing programs are a partnership between ALU
and the university or institution. Please visit the ALU Web site (http://www.alu.army.mil/ALU_ABOUT/
ALUABOUTNLCCORE.HTM) for current details. Academic broadening.
   3. Master in Supply Chain Management at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). The program is a partnership
with ALU commencing fall semester of 2014. This 12-month, 30-semester-hour resident program offers participants a
rigorous logistics-focused curriculum enhancing critical thinking and innovation skills. The program provides cross-
cultural exposure between civilian and military professionals and an opportunity to experience a world-class education,
technology and infrastructure at VCU’s School of Business, Department of Supply Chain Management. Participants
who are graduates of ALU’s TLog Planners Program transfer nine semester hours towards VCU’s program require-
ments. Participants may also receive a SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (SAP ERP) certification. This program
produces a master’s degree in Supply Chain Management. Senior captains, majors and senior DA civilians who have
completed or are enrolled in TLog are eligible to compete for this program. Academic broadening.
   4. North Dakota State University Master of Managerial Logistics. The North Dakota State University program was
the first national logistics curriculum accredited program and provides an interdisciplinary logistics curriculum de-
signed around a specific course for each of the skill sets identified in the national logistics curriculum. Selected

   (c) Institutional training opportunities that academically broaden officers are listed below. Utilization assignments at
all broadening levels are available for these opportunities: tactical, academic, unified action partner and/or strategic
enablers.
   1. TLog Planners Program is a resident course producing SI P1. The course specializes in logistics planning at the
theater operational level. Planning positions from the sustainment brigade level to ASCC are coded as P1 and
designated as utilization assignments. This experience broadens the officer’s critical thinking skills in deliberate and
adaptive planning. A select number of officers may elect to couple this training with the VCU cooperative master’s
degree program at VCU’s School of Business, Department of Supply Chain Management. Graduates of ALU’s TLog
Planners Program transfer nine semester hours towards VCU’s program requirements. Participants may also receive a
SAP ERP certification. This program produces a Master in Supply Chain Management.
   2. Contracting Officer Representative Course. This course provides an overall understanding of the contracting
process to include administration, laws, and regulations governing the process. The course focuses on contracting
means in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation
(DFAR). This is a resident course producing a certificate of completion.
   3. Operational contract support. The majority of sustainment operations require knowledge of contracting and
operational contract support. This course prepares officers for managing, forecasting, and administration of contract
support in a contingency environment and how to integrate contract support requirements into the military decision-
making process. This course is highly recommended for captains and majors on TSC level staffs and below. This is a
resident course. SI 3C is awarded for completion of this course.
   4. Support Operations Course. Officers are encouraged to enhance their knowledge of multifunctional sustainment at
the tactical level of division and below though the Support Operations Course. This course broadens an officer’s
multifunctional logistics skills and provides tactics, techniques, and procedures in association with an assignment to a
support operations section at any level. The course has a distance learning phase and a resident phase producing a
certificate of completion.
   (4) Self-development. Self-development actions fall into three categories: immediate, near-term, and long-range
goals. Immediate goals focus on correcting weakness and reinforcing strengths associated with your current assign-
ment. Near-term goals focus on developing those skills, knowledge, and attributes needed for your next operational
assignment. Long-term goals focus on preparing for more complex duties beyond your next operation assignment.
Captains must continue to develop their expertise in their basic branch, while expanding their general sustainment base
of knowledge. It is highly recommended for captains to seek out a mentor or mentors that can provide them guidance,
perspective, and act as sounding boards for ideas and career development.
   (5) Desired experience. The only KD assignment for a captain is successful completion of company or detachment
command. There is no substitute for command. The goal is to provide captains with command in a multifunctional or
functional company or detachment. When not in command assignments, captains are optimally at battalion or brigade
level before moving to a broadening assignment. As officers progress from company grade to field grade, assignments
grow increasingly multifunctional. The goal is for officers to develop a diverse set of skills between functional and
multifunctional assignments.
   k. Majors. The developmental objective for this phase is to build on multifunctional experiences at the theater level
and below while broadening their knowledge through academic, unified action partner and strategic enabler assign-
ments. Blending KD and broadening experiences provides the skill sets required for future senior leadership. Majors
are primarily staff officers, serving in positions across the tactical and operational forces. They plan and organize
sustainment missions, demonstrate the ability to manage organizations, and build competence in sustainment. An
officer’s performance is critical to demonstrating a mastery of mission command, sustainment, and leadership skills.
   (1) Education. Officers are expected to complete PME requirements prior to assignment to KD positions. The
requirement is completion of the Command and General Staff Officers Course. The Command and General Staff
Officers Course is a merit-based selective board process that provides Joint JPME 1 and MEL 4).

team venues. Training is also available at ALU and resident Command and General Staff Officers Course as electives.
   (4) Self-development. During this phase, the officer’s primary goal is the completion of a graduate-level degree.
Expanding educational knowledge is the key. Degrees in logistics, automation, business, accounting, contracting, and
management are of the greatest value. Officers are expected to establish a professional reading program, participate in
their regimental association and civilian professional logistics organizations, or become a certified professional logis-
tician. Completing logistics and joint correspondence courses and conducting research and writing articles for profes-
sional publications are basic self-developmental tools.
   (5) Desired experience. Majors should become experts in mission command systems. A variety of assignments
across the civilian, private sector, governmental, joint, planning, functional, and multifunctional assignments achieve
this end. Expanding the officer’s range of adaptability and broadening their critical thinking skills for future assign-
ments at the strategic level is the goal.
   l. Lieutenant colonel. The developmental objective for this phase is to demonstrate excellence in tactical and
technical sustainment skills and the ability to lead, train, motivate, and care for Soldiers and civilians in both command
and staff environments. As rank increases, officers serve in a great number of assignments in the realm of unified
action partners and strategic enablers. These roles expand the officer’s adaptability and prepare them for senior
positions of great responsibility at the strategic level. Additionally, lieutenant colonels must have successful SOF
experience prior to being assigned to SOF positions in order to provide SOF commanders with the best continuity of
support.
   (1) Education. In order to compete for command-select positions, lieutenant colonels must be JPME 1/MEL 4
qualified. Officers are also strongly encouraged to complete graduate-level education in an appropriate discipline prior
to their first colonel’s board. Officers should review the educational opportunities outlined in the colonel’s education
section concerning Senior Staff College.
   (a) Lieutenant colonels selected for CSL positions must complete PCCs depending on the type of organization.
Examples are the PCC at Fort Leavenworth and the Sustainment or Logistics PCC at ALU.
   (b) SSC is the apex of field grade officer PME and awards JPME 2/MEL 1 credit and the SSC graduate code.
Officers are considered for Senior Staff Service College annually after their 16th year of service to their 23d year. The
SSCs and fellowship programs prepare officers for senior command and staff positions. It provides thorough knowl-
edge of strategy at the national level and use of the elements of national power. There are three paths to complete SSC
PME: attendance at the U.S. Army War College or other accredited sister Service or international senior military
service college, a Senior Service Fellowship, or completion of the Army War College Distance Education Course. A
selection to one of these programs identifies those officers with exceptional promotion potential for service in positions
of increased responsibility at the next higher grade. SSC equivalency is required prior to the officer assuming an O6-
level command. SSC opportunities include, but are not limited to, the following.
   1. Air, Marine Corps, and Naval War Colleges.
   2. Joint Advanced Warfighting School, Eisenhower School for National Security, and National War College gener-
ally has joint duty utilization assignments on completion.
   3. Advanced Operational Arts Studies Fellowship is a SSC equivalent focused on theater strategic-level unified land
action and planning. The utilization tour as a SAMS instructor with follow-on to theater or Army component-level
headquarters.
   4. Logistics and Supply Chain Management Fellowship is a resident program at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. The program is a SSC equivalent focusing on the study of large-scale supply chain management
operations. The utilization tour is an assignment to the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command.
   5. Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellows Program places officers with civilian corporations at the highest manage-
ment levels to determine how changes in business affect DOD in the future. Utilization tour is with the OSD.
   6. The U.S. Army War College Distance Education Program provides an alternate means of attaining MEL 1
education. Eligible officers who apply are compared against the most current promotion list to colonel and most current
SSC Selection Board Order of Merit List to determine the final slate. AR 350–1 provides details of the selection and
346                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

application processes. Once officers have enrolled in the correspondence course, they are no longer eligible for resident
SSC attendance. Officers enrolling in the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Program incur a 2-year ADSO.
The ADSO starts at course completion or termination.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. The only KD assignment for a lieutenant colonel is a CSL position. These are
generally battalion command or centrally selected key billet; there is no other KD assignment. KD assignments are
generally 18–24 months.
   (3) Former battalion commanders are managed and assigned to specific jobs based on the needs of the Army.
   (4) Broadening assignments. All other assignments that are not a centrally selected command billet or key billet are
considered to be broadening. Experience gained as a lieutenant colonel provides the Army with officers who have
mastery of tactical and operational levels and are adapting to strategic levels. Operationally, lieutenant colonels serve
primarily in senior staff and/or joint positions in ESCs, TSCs, division, corps, and higher staffs.

   (b) Academic, unified action partner and strategic competitive broadening opportunities include fellowship and
scholarship programs. They are highly competitive and selective programs that generally have an associated 1- or 2-
year utilization tour at some of the most diverse organizations across the civilian-military spectrum. The majority of
programs are graduate degree producing.
   1. Asia-Pacific Fellowship for Security Studies program explores the unique military, economic, and political issues
relevant to that region. The officer attends a 12-week study program and then becomes a research fellow at the institute
for 1 year. This is not a degree producing program and is open to lieutenant colonels. This is an academic broadening
assignment.
   2. Department of State Policy Planning Fellowship is a 1-year resident program in the Military District of Washing-
ton on the staff of the Department of State Office of Plans, Policy and Analysis, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs as
an Ambassador to the Chief of Staff of the Army. The officer conducts research and liaison between the CSA and
Department of State. This is not a degree producing program and is open to lieutenant colonels. This is a unified action
partner broadening assignment.
   3. George Marshall European Center for Security Studies Fellowship is a 15-week resident program at the center on
European security and free market economic issues. On completion, the officer becomes a faculty member conducting
                                                 DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                      347

research and teaching international students at the center. This program does not produce a degree and is open to
lieutenant colonels as an academic broadening assignment.
   4. Advanced Civil Schooling.
   5. Advanced Program in Logistics and Technology.
   6. Defense Distribution Management Course.
   7. Defense Support of Civil Authorities Course.
   8. Information Assurance Scholarship program.
   9. Installation Management Course.
   10. Interagency Logistics Course.
   11. Joint Chief of Staff, OSD and Army Staff Internship.
   12. Joint Humanitarian Operations Course.
   13. Joint Logistics Course.
   14. National Logistics Curriculum partnership program.
   15. North Dakota State University Masters of Managerial Logistics program.
   16. RAND Arroyo Fellowship.
   17. Red Team Leader Course.
   18. White House Fellowship.
   (5) Self-development. Officers expand their professional reading program to include other services, logistics periodi-
cals, participate in civilian professional logistics organizations, become a certified professional logistician, and conduct
research and write articles for professional logistics publications. The officer should have completed a graduate degree
in a logistics discipline. Additionally, lieutenant colonels should continue their self-development in all facets of
logistics, particularly in joint and multinational operations.
   (6) Mentorship and talent management. Mentorship and identification of an officer’s unique talents is one of the
primary responsibilities of lieutenant colonels. Lieutenant colonels are expected to focus on this important legacy and
grow officers for the future success of the Army. Mentoring officers through teaching and coaching truly builds our
pool of leaders for tomorrow. The Army Career Tracker is one tool to help officers plan and develop their career maps.
Officers are invited to be mentors via the Army Career Tracker and the tools within it are helpful to the mentor and
mentee. Senior officers are expected to assist in talent management through the identification of officer’s unique skill
sets and desires. Helping officers find the broadening venues that expand an officer’s talents is best done by their raters
and mentors. Raters and mentors help officers through discussion or correspondence with the officer’s HRC branch
manager concerning the unique talents and interests of individual officers.
   (7) Desired experience. Promotion to lieutenant colonel is the mark of a successful career. Select officers have the
opportunity to command. Command selection is a very small population of officers. Those not selected for command
make significant contributions at all levels of the Army and can expect to serve in a wide variety of professionally
challenging and personally rewarding assignments.
   m. Colonel development. The professional development objective for this phase is excellence in functional and
multifunctional skills. The ability to lead, train, motivate, care for Soldiers and civilians in both command and staff
environments requires the experience acquired over a career of leadership, management, and executive talents. The
strategic level leaders in the Army are colonels. Colonels are expected to be leaders and strategic-creative thinkers;
builders of leaders and teams; competent warfighters; skilled in governance, statesmanship, and diplomacy.
   (1) Education. SSC equivalency is required prior to the officer assuming an O6-level command. SSC opportunities
are listed under the lieutenant colonel portion of this section.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. The only KD assignment is selection for a CSL command or key billet.
Officers serve in the same four CSL command categories as lieutenant colonels; garrison command tour lengths are 24
months but can be extended to 36 months. Colonels selected for SOF brigade commands must have prior successful
SOF experience, preferably SOF battalion command experience.
   (3) Former battalion commanders are managed and assigned to specific jobs based on the needs of the Army.
   (4) Broadening assignments. Colonels’ assignments are nominative based on the officer’s skills and positions
available.
   (a) Assignments include the following:
   1. AMC primary staff officer.
   2. ASCC primary staff officer.
   3. Combatant Command staff officer.
   4. Corps G4.
   5. DCO.
   6. Deputy commandant of ordnance, quartermaster, and transportation.
   7. ESC, or TSC chief of staff or support operation (colonel authorized).
   8. DCS, G–4 logistics staff officer.
348                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   9. DCS, G–3/5/7 staff officer.
   10. Joint staff - staff officer.
   11. Life-cycle materiel management officer.
   12. Multinational, or coalition primary staff officer.
   13. Support operations officer (colonel authorized).
   (b) Academic broadening opportunities include fellowship and scholarship programs. They are highly competitive
and selective educational programs that generally have an associated 1- or 2-year utilization tour at some of the most
diverse organizations across the civil - military spectrum. The majority of programs are graduate degree producing.
Opportunities for colonels are listed below.
   1. Army Senior Fellowship Program provides opportunities for senior leaders who have completed SSC to study
issues of national importance along with individuals and agencies, in and out of government, who are actively involved
in influencing the formulation and execution of U.S. foreign and domestic policies. The programs are hosted by the
Council on Foreign Relations, Harvard Center for International Affairs, and the Brookings Institution.
   2. Advanced Program in Logistics and Technology.
   3. Defense Distribution Management Course.
   4. Defense Support of Civil Authorities Course.
   5. Information Assurance Scholarship program.
   6. Installation Management Course.
   7. Interagency Logistics Course.
   8. Joint Chief of Staff, OSD and Army Staff Internship.
   9. Joint Humanitarian Operations Course.
   10. Joint Logistics Course.
   11. RAND Arroyo Fellowship.
   12. Red Team Leader Course.
   13. White House Fellowship.
   (5) Self-development. Colonels must maintain their skills and keep current on all changes that affect the Soldiers
they command and/or lead. Colonels continue to expand their professional reading program, participate in civilian
professional logistics organizations, become a certified professional logistician, write articles for professional publica-
tions, and obtain a postgraduate degree in a logistics discipline.
   (6) Mentorship and talent management. Colonels are expected to foster and develop talent in our mid-grade officers.
This is an essential task of our senior leaders. Colonels should have a group of officers that they are actively involved
in mentoring through their careers. Mentoring of officers through teaching and coaching truly builds our leaders of
tomorrow. Officers are highly encouraged to provide this mentorship and build trust, respect, and provide guidance
within our ranks. The Army Career Tracker is one tool to help officers plan and develop their career maps. Officers are
invited to be mentors via the Army Career Tracker and the tools within it are helpful to the mentor and mentee. Senior
officers are expected to assist in talent management through the identification of officer’s unique skill sets and desires.
Helping officers find the broadening venues that expand the officer’s talents is best done through their raters and
mentors. As senior raters and mentors, colonels help officers through discussion or correspondence with their officer’s
HRC branch manager concerning unique talents.
   (7) Desired experience. The critical assignment for colonels is brigade-level command. Successful completion of a
CSL command or key billet provides an opportunity to compete for brigadier general provided the officer is joint
qualified. Only a limited number of officers have the opportunity to command. Colonels, when not in command, serve
primarily in staff and/or joint positions. The primary goal is to use the officer’s experience and knowledge to provide
significant contributions in expeditionary/TSCs, corps, joint commands and at strategic level. Officers not selected for
command provide exceptional service in assignments of increasing responsibility.
   n. Branch transfer. Active officers may branch transfer into the Logistics branch at the rank of captain if they have
less than 9 years of active Federal commissioned service. Transfer authorizations are based on the needs of the Army
and may not be available year-to-year. The following rules apply for request for transfer:
   (1) The officer prepares a DA Form 4187 through HRC’s sustainment captain’s career field manager to the Logistics
branch proponency office requesting transfer to the Logistics branch. The packet must include the reason for the
request and the officer’s choice for basic branch affiliation in Transportation, Ordnance, or Quartermaster. Based on
manning requirements, the Logistics branch proponency office determines if there is a valid requirement and if the
officer’s skill sets support transfer. The Logistics branch proponency office forwards its decision to HRC. If the losing
branch releases the officer to Logistics Branch, HRC assigns regimental affiliation and reviews the officer’s future
assignment and professional education requirements. If the losing branch disapproves the branch transfer, then the
transfer packet is reviewed by the CG, HRC for final adjudication and determination.
   (2) Upon acceptance into the Logistics Branch, officers must complete the prerequisite training before transition is
complete. Captains who have not yet attended a CCC must attend the CLC3.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             349

   (3) Officers who did not complete a logistics CCC must complete CLC3 or phase I and III of a logistics RC CCC
(Transportation, Ordnance, or Quartermaster).
   (4) Upon completion of PME, HRC awards the officer their regimental affiliation in Transportation, Ordnance, or
Quartermaster and then assigns the officer to the Logistics branch.
   (5) ARNG and USAR officers are eligible for transfer to the Logistics branch from the rank of captain to lieutenant
colonel. See paragraph 35–6 for details. ARNG and USAR officers are eligible to branch transfer at the rank of captain
to major with less 18 years service or a major that has completed a KD assignment (that is, battelion XO, battelion S3).
   o. Voluntary Transfer Incentive Program. This program is primarily designed to allow officers to branch transfer or
choose a FA. The program supports the officer’s interests and balances the branches and FAs personnel requirement.
   (1) All FAs and branches are open to logisticians through the VTIP program except the following: JAGC, Chaplains
Corps, AMEDD, or Academy Professor (FA 47). Logistics officers are eligible to transfer into the aforementioned
fields through other processes; consult the relevant branch chapter for further information on transferring into these
branches and FA.
   (2) This is available to AA officers only upon achieving first lieutenant(P) status through an officer’s 14th year of
Federal commissioned service. The officer must meet height, weight, and Army Physical Fitness Test standards.
Officers cannot have UCMJ violations or pending adverse actions, such as a general letter of reprimand or a referred
OER.
   (3) Officers incur a 3-year ADSO if selected for a FA or branch redesignation. Officers with an existing ADSO are
eligible to transfer, but have their additional obligation added to their existing ADSO.
   (4) Officers accepted into the program attend qualification courses associated with their new branch or FA. Each FA
has specific developmental paths for assignments. Once an officer is accepted into a FA, they do not return to the
Logistics branch nor are they eligible for command of logistics units. The exception to this is EOD 89E officers
operating in 89E assignments.
                            Figure 35–1. AC Logistics Branch professional developmental chart
350                                       DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

35–5. Warrant officer development
While warrant officers are a critical part of the Logistics Corps, they are managed by their individual functional branch.
Moreover, our warrant officers functional depth enables our officers to operate as multifunctional logisticians. Warrant
officers should be offered the opportunity to continue service within SOF to help SOF continuity of support. Refer to
the branch sections of this chapter for a detailed description of warrant officers’ professional development and career
management information.
35–6. Logistics Branch Reserve Component officers
   a. General.
   (1) RC Logistics branch officer qualifications and development closely parallel those of their AA counterparts as
described in paragraphs 35–3 and 35–4. There are key differences in RC time in service and time in grade.
   (2) Life-cycle development and utilization also parallel the AA as shown in figure 35–2. Increased mobilization and
deployments require the RC officer to train at the appropriate level. This is necessary in order to acquire skills required
for commanding, training, and managing organizations in peacetime, civil response operations as well as mobilization.
   (3) A large portion of PME and training is accomplished on their own time. A variety of correspondence courses
and resident PME courses are available. It is preferred that junior officers have a strong foundation in tactical and
technical expertise through assignments in their functional branch before induction into the Logistics branch at the rank
of captain.
   (4) The RC officers serve the same role and missions as their AA counterparts. The unique nature of their role as
“citizen Soldiers” poses challenges and opportunities to their professional development. Professional development and
qualifications parallel those of their AA counterparts as closely as possible.
   (5) The career path for RC officers, including AGR officers, seeks a balance of assignments preparing them as
competent leaders for senior ranks. Officers should not serve in the exact same duty position for more than 3 years
before moving on to a new duty position. The needs of the RC and force structure may hinder this objective, but
homesteading in the same duty position is highly discouraged since it impedes development.
   b. Reserve Component. It is recognized that force structure in regions and localities limit the number of traditional
developmental positions available for all RC officers. To compensate for this, officers can develop management and
leadership skills through branch immaterial and broadening assignments. Officers are encouraged to seek command
whenever possible; command opportunities above company level are limited for RC officers. However, RC lieutenant
colonels and colonels should compete for battalion and brigade command whenever possible. To develop leadership
experience, RC officers should continue to seek KD positions when available and primary staff positions of large TPUs
or mobilization day (M–Day) organizations at the appropriate rank level.
   c. Army National Guard. The ARNG has some specific guidance in reference to the Logistics branch. Title 32
requirements detailing the federal recognition of branches authorize the ARNG to consider all captain-coded 90A
positions as Logistics branch positions for officers who have not yet completed transfer into the Logistics branch.
Officers may not transfer into the Logistics branch without a valid position reflecting the authorized paragraph and line
number. Additionally, lieutenants are authorized promotion to captain at the appropriate time if they are filling a 90A
captain’s position. This does not authorize early promotion, but does allow promotion prior to completion of RC CCC
and allows RC officers adequate time to complete the course.
   d. Active Guard Reserve. In accordance with Title 10 USC, section 101(16), the term “Active Guard and Reserve” is
a member of a RC who is on active duty pursuant to 10 USC sections 12310, or 32 USC, sections 502(f) and 709(a).
AGR Logistics branch officers serve in full-time, active duty positions in worldwide locations. They provide day-to-
day operational support needed to ensure RC units are ready to mobilize when needed. AGR officers perform
administrative and training duties in direct support of the ARNG, USAR, and AA. The primary objective of the AGR
officer is to enable a greater level of readiness, agility, and responsiveness of the total force. To meet this mission, they
must be experts in logistics and in the RC’s administrative, training, and managements systems. To meet both
requirements, AGR officers need a balance of tactical, operational, and strategic experience throughout their careers.
   e. Officer professional development model. The PDM, figure 35–2, is the foundation for assignments. Officers, in
many cases, will not have the opportunity to follow the model in figure 35–2.
   f. Reserve Component qualification and development. RC officers are inducted or appointed into the Logistics
branch upon completion of a logistics Ordnance, Quartermaster, or Transportation RC CCC or CLC3. Officers hold
90A as their primary AOC and a secondary AOC in their basic branch. This applies to the following officers: AGR,
TPU, M–Day, IMA, and IRR. There are no lieutenants (nor non-CCC graduates) in the Logistics branch. Even though
RC officer development is challenged by geographical considerations and time constraints, each officer should strive
for Logistics branch developmental assignments and educational opportunities that yield the same opportunities as their
AC counterparts.
   g. Education. RCofficers must meet PME standards and assignments to be proficient in the Logistics branch at each
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                               351

grade. Due to geographical, time available, and civilian employment constraints, officers may find it challenging.
Officers are expected to complete requirements for each grade.
   h. Broadening. RC officers are broadened in many measures more diversely than AC officers over a career.
Broadening is the expansion of an individual’s capabilities and understanding provided through opportunities internal
and external to the Army throughout their careers gained through experiences in different organizational cultures and
environments resulting in a leader who can operate at the strategic level in multiple environments.
   (1) The RC PDM recognizes that broadening opportunities are limited to the units that surround the RC officer’s
geographic area of travel. Officers in the RC are the backbone of the tactical sustainment force structure from the TSC/
ESC level and below. Over 78 percent of the total force’s sustainment structure is in the RC. The majority of
functional units at the company level are in the RC. Therefore, officers are expected to be functionally sound at each
rank, expand multifunctionally as they increase in rank, and broadened as opportunities are available.
   (2) There are three experience-based assignments that specifically broaden logistics officers: academic, unified
action partner, and strategic enablers assignments/competitive opportunities. The essence of these opportunities is to
challenge the officer mentally in situations well outside their comfort zone and force them to apply critical thinking to
complex problems. See paragraph 35–4b(3) for more on this topic.
   (3) RC officers bring military and civilian skills to the fight. Their experiences in industrial, business, law,
governmental, marketing, IT and academic skills from their daily civilian occupations are extremely valuable. These
skill sets are unique to the civilian/governmental community and critical to our sustainment of unified action partners.
   (4) Businesses and government employers provide employees opportunities to train and educate themselves occupa-
tionally and educationally. Officers should ensure that these skills are documented in their personnel records and in the
case of education, documented on their next OER after completion.
   (5) Opportunities such as PME, institutional training, scholarships, internships, advanced civil schooling, and foreign
military education are important broadening experiences; see chapter 35–4. The RC plays a primary and crucial role in
Homeland Security and specifically, response to incidents or disasters in the homeland. Listed below are resident and
distance learning courses, offered by ALU and FEMA’s Emergency Management Institute (EMI). These are appropri-
ate at any rank. Yearly schedules and course information are available at ALU’s website or http://training.fema.gov/
EMICourses/EMICatalog.asp.
   (6) Defense Distribution Management Course.
   (7) Defense Support of Civil Authorities Course.
   (8) Joint Humanitarian Operations Course.
   (9) Interagency Logistics Course.
   (10) Incident Command System Course.
   (11) Interagency Logistics Course.
   i. Mentorship. Mentorship of RC officers is very important due to regulations, assignment availability, timelines and
differing state requirements. Mentors do not have to be in the officer’s rating chain or career field, but it is
recommended that they are of the same component career path. Mentors are officers that the Soldier is comfortable
with and can have fair and frank discussions about family, career, life goals, and the Army. Working with their mentor,
an officer builds a career path that meets the officer’s desires, aligns with realistic timelines, and meets the officer’s
expectations of a successful career and rewarding career.
   j. Lieutenants. The professional development objective for this phase is to develop functional expertise in the
officer’s basic branch. Logistics officers are accessed into one of the three functional branches, Ordnance, Quartermas-
ter, or Transportation. The first 4 years of an officer’s career focuses on developing an officer’s basic branch technical
and tactical skills, as well as, vital leadership skills. The goal is to sharpen their understanding of the Army profession,
gain leadership experience in company grade assignments, and building expertise in their basic branch. Officers are
inducted into the Logistics branch after selection for promotion to captain and successful completion of RC CCC or
CLC3. Refer to your specific basic branch section for more details.
   k. Captain development.
   (1) Education. For promotion to the rank of captain, a bachelor’s degree is required. Mandatory PME during this
phase is the completion of the RC CCC or CLC3, which is a prerequisite for promotion to the rank of major.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Assignments in a company, battalion, or brigade organization should follow a
progressive order. The only KD assignment for captains is company or detachment command. Company command is a
maximum of 24 months (AGR) to 36 months (non-AGR), with the tour length set by the higher commander. A
minimum of 12 months is required in command to receive KD credit. Branch immaterial commands are also available.
Captains who are unable to command should pursue primary staff leadership positions, such as S3, S4, and deputy
support operations to develop their leadership skills, see figure 35–2.
   (3) Broadening assignments. The PDM focuses on the need to broaden an officer’s knowledge, skills, and abilities at
each grade in logistical expertise across the entirety of an officer’s career. Developing a captain’s knowledge base in
the functional and multifunctional force is the intent at junior captain. After command, there are numerous venues to
broaden officers. These are vital to developing an officer’s abilities for field grade level. The goal is a series of
352                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

assignments that challenge the officer in tactical and technical sustainment and expose them to operating and
generating forces.
   (a) Opportunities for broadening are listed below.
   1. Career division staff/CMO.
   2. CTC trainer or staff officer.
   3. Doctrine or training developer.
   4. Joint, multinational staff officer or coalition trainer or staff officer.
   5. One TASS instructor of course or manager.
   6. USAREC.
   (b) Broadening also includes scholarship, fellowship, and internship programs allowing higher education and oppor-
tunities to serve in strategic level positions, see paragraph 35–4j(3).
   (4) Self-development. Captains must take the initiative to gain knowledge and experience for assignments of greater
responsibility at the field grade level. Self-development and improvement of officer skills can be obtained through the
use of Battle Command Knowledge System-LOGNet and the Sustainment Knowledge Net (SKN) to keep skills
current. Officers are encouraged to take additional training courses when resources permit.
   (a) Support Operations Course. This course further develops multifunctional skills normally associated with an
assignment to a support operations section. The course generally focuses on training captains, majors, and senior NCOs
in multifunctional support operations at the tactical level.
   (b) Reserve Component Theater Sustainment Course (RC–TSC), formerly RC Multifunctional Combat Service
Support Course (RCMCSS). The course provides multifunctional logistics education to officers, warrant officers, and
senior NOCs that are currently or pending an assignment to operational level or higher sustainment organizations.
   (c) Officers should be well-versed in all Standard Army Management Information Systems and command and
control systems, such as the Battle Command Sustainment and Support System, Movement Tracking System (MTS),
and especially the Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS–A).
   (5) Desired experience. The key for a captain is successful completion of company or detachment command. There
is no substitute for command. The goal is to provide RC captains with 24–36 months command time in a company or
detachment. When not in command, assignments should be optimally split between the operating force and generating
forces with a mix of multifunctional and functional positions. As officers progress from company grade to field grade,
assignments grow increasingly multifunctional.
   l. Major development. Selection for major is based on performance and demonstrated potential for further service in
positions of greater responsibility. These qualities are measured by the officer’s performance, assignment history, and
level of development.
   (1) Education. The PME requirement is completion of the Command and General Staff Officers Course. This is a
merit-based selective board process that provides JPME 1 and MEL 4. Officers who meet the criteria in AR 350–1
regardless of component may be selected for 10-month residency at the Command and General Staff College or 14-
week satellite campus opportunities on a best-qualified basis. The Director, ARNG exercises staff supervision over the
selection system for ARNG officers and the CAR exercises for USAR officers. Resident course seats are offered to
officers selected by a central selection board conducted annually. Officers not selected, complete via distance learning.
Completion of the Command and General Staff Officers Course through the methods listed meet the officer’s MEL 4
and JPME 1 requirements. Officers must complete the Common Core to be promoted to lieutenant colonel. Completion
of both the Common Core and Advanced Operations Course are required for eligibility for promotion to colonel.
   (a) ILE schools and colleges are listed below:
   1. U.S. Army Command and General Staff College.
   2. U.S. Air Command and Staff College.
   3. U.S Marine Corps Command and Staff College.
   4. U.S. Navy College of Command and Staff.
   5. Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation.
   6. Foreign equivalent schools approved by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   7. One Army School System Battalion - active duty for training/inactive duty training format phases.
   8. Distance learning programs.
   (b) School of Advanced Military Studies Program. TPU officers who compete and are selected to the SAMS course
serve a 2-year utilization tour upon completion of the course. Their assignment is based upon guidance from the Chief,
USAR. AGR graduates are assigned by the assignment officer with input from the HRC SAMS manager.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. RC majors should serve in KD assignments for a maximum of 24 mouths
(AGR) to 48 (non-AGR) months to further develop leadership skills and prepare for battalion command. The following
assignments are considered to be KD assignments at the major level. Key development equivalents for RC are listed in
paragraph 35–2.
   (a) Logistics planner.
   (b) ARNG brigade logistics support team chief.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           353

   (c) Division transportation officer.
   (d) Executive officer.
   (e) Major level command.
   (f) S3 or operations officer (major or lieutenant colonel authorized).
   (g) S4 (major or lieutenant colonel authorized).
   (h) Support operations officer.
   (3) Broadening assignments. Once officers have completed their KD assignment, it is preferred that those officers
seek broadening assignments in academic, unified action partner, and strategic enablers or sustainment staff positions at
brigade level or higher. Officers may consider Army scholarship, fellowship, and internship programs as well. See
section 35–4k(3). The following assignments are broadening:
   (a) Army sustainment command staff officer.
   (b) ASCC, SDDC, or Defense Logistics Agency staff positions.
   (c) Assistant Professor of Military Science or service school instructor.
   (d) Army sponsored fellowship, internship, or scholarship with follow-on assignment.
   (e) Capabilities, doctrine, or training developer.
   (f) CTC trainer or staff officer.
   (g) Detailed Inspector General.
   (h) HQDA, USARC, NGB, OCAR, or combatant command staff officer.
   (i) Governmental, ARNG or National Guard joint staff officer.
   (j) Joint, multinational, or coalition trainer or staff officer.
   (k) USMA or ROTC instructor or tactical officer.
   (4) Self-development. Self-development is the responsibility of every officer and ranges from professional reading to
aggressively seeking out positions of increased responsibility. Officers are encouraged to continue to broaden their
experience by doing the following: establish a professional reading program, participate in their regimental association,
participate in civilian professional logistics organizations, become a certified professional logistician, obtain a civilian
degree in logistics-related fields, complete logistics-related correspondence courses, complete courses in joint logistics
at ALU, and conduct research and write articles for professional logistics publications. Majors may also apply for
additional professional development education (APDE) courses, such as the RC National Security Course and Defense
Strategy Course. These are available by application through an annual central selection boards.
   (5) Desired experience. A variety of assignments across the logistics spectrum, as well as a combination between
operating and generating forces, enhance an officer’s developmental experiences.
   m. Lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels are in the refinement stages of their career. Lieutenant colonels are
strongly encouraged to seek command whenever possible through command selection boards. Positions as primary staff
officers also met the criteria for development of required skill sets.
   (1) Education. The RC lieutenant colonel must complete Command and General Staff Officers Course Common
Core and the Advanced Operations Course prior to promotion to colonel. Selectees for command attend the prescribed
PCC(s). Resident and distance learning education for Command and General Staff Officers Course and SSCs are
centrally selected through an annual board. Officers are also encouraged to complete graduate-level education in an
appropriate discipline.
   (2) Key developmental ssignments. KD assignments for lieutenant colonels are a CSL KD position or a key
leadership billet in a MTOE or TDA unit for 24 to 36 months. Not every officer commands at the battalion level.
When possible, lieutenant colonels should also seek primary staff leadership assignments. The following assignments
are considered to be KD assignments at the lieutenant colonel level or equivalents:
   (a) Battalion commander or CSL key billet.
   (b) ARNG or NGB branch or division chief (lieutenant colonel authorized).
   (c) Chief of staff (lieutenant colonel authorized).
   (d) Command Inspector General.
   (e) DCO or XO (lieutenant colonel authorized).
   (f) Division or corps G4 (lieutenant colonel authorized).
   (g) ESC,TSC, ASCC or AMC primary staff officer.
   (h) Joint or multinational primary staff officer.
   (i) Support operations officer (lieutenant colonel authorized).
   (3) Broadening assignments. When command is not available, officers should seek broadening assignments as
outlined in paragraph 35–4l(4). The following assignments are broadening:
   (a) Army sustainment command staff officer.
   (b) ARNG or NGB staff officer.
   (c) Capabilities, doctrine or training branch chief.
   (d) Chief of plans for sustainment.

   (n) ROTC Professor of Military Science, Command and General Staff Officers Course or service school instructor.
   (o) USARC staff officer.
   (4) Self-development. Lieutenant colonels should continue to expand their professional reading program, participate
in civilian professional organizations, become a certified professional logistician, conduct research and write articles for
professional logistics publications, and obtain a postgraduate degree in a logistics discipline. Lieutenant colonels may
also apply for APDE courses, such as the RC National Security Course, Defense Strategy Course, and Canadian
Security Studies Program. These are available by application through an annual central selection board.
   (5) Desired experience. The desired experience for lieutenant colonels is battalion commander of a MTOE or TDA
unit for 24 a maximum of months (AGR) to 36 months (non-AGR). Every lieutenant colonel will not command at the
battalion level, but the goal is to provide the officer professional development, institutional training, and assignments
that develop an officer for leadership roles at the next level.
   n. Colonel. Lieutenant colonels are in the refinement stages of their career. Officers will be expected to mentor
junior officers on the importance of maintaining Logistics branch proficiency through multiple experiences and
encourage officers to obtain additional multifunctional training when appropriate.
   (1) Education. Although no specific mandatory educational requirements exist for colonels, officers are encouraged
to complete SSC, resident, distance learning, sister Service resident, or Foreign Command Staff College. Selectees for
command at colonel attend the prescribed PCC(s).
   (2) Key developmental assignments. The KD assignment for RC colonels is centrally selected brigade/group
command or key billet assignments for 24 months (AGR) to 36 months (non-AGR). Key assignments for colonels
include the following:
   (a) Brigade, group, or immaterial command or key CSL billet.
   (b) ARNG or NGB primary staff officer (colonel authorized).

   (l) USARC primary staff officer.
   (4) Self-development. Colonels continue to expand their professional reading program, participate in civilian profes-
sional logistics organizations, become a certified professional logistician, conduct research and write articles for
professional logistics publications, and obtain a postgraduate degree in a logistics discipline. Officers strive to complete
SSC, resident or distance learning.
   (5) Desired experience. The desired experience for colonels is command of a MTOE or TDA unit for 24 months
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                               355

(AGR) to 36 months (non-AGR). Every colonel will not command, but the goal is to provide the officer professional
development, institutional training, and assignments that will develop RC colonels across the full spectrum of the levels
of war.
   o. Branch transfer. USAR and ARNG officers may branch transfer into the Logistics branch up to the rank of major
with time of grade remaining that facilitates the ability to serve in a 90A KD billet prior to lieutenant colonel
promotion. It is this combination of education in conjunction with captain or major level KD experiences that allow
officers to be effective senior multifunctional logisticians. All requests for branch transfer are reviewed on a case-by-
case basis. Branch transfer or predetermination applications for officers entering the ARNG or USAR from other
services should be submitted through their State AG, NGB, HRC or USAR Command, to the Logistics Branch
Proponency Office for review and approval. Officers who have had documented logistics training and experience will
be vetted for equivalency. Applications must include certificates of completion for logistics courses, unit validation of
position for assignment, and the officer must highlight KD multifunctional logistics experience if not explicit on the
candidate’s ORB/DA Form 2–1 (Personnel Qualification Record).
   (1) PME requirements are listed below.
   (a) Complete a MDMP inclusive course.
   (b) Complete a functional branch qualification course, Quartermaster, Ordnance, or Transportation.
   (c) Complete a multifunctional logistics qualification inclusive course
   (2) Positional requirements are listed below.
   (a) USAR/ARNG organizations submitting an officer’s branch transfer requests must provide a paragraph and line
number with a valid 90A coded position in a MTOE or TDA organization.
   (b) The officer is currently serving in or is billeted to serve at least 18 months in a valid 90A coded position.
   (c) Positions coded as 01A or 02A are branch immaterial and do not constitute an authorization to change the
officer’s branch to Logistics.
   (d) Officers may not transfer into the Logistics branch for the purpose of competing for command-select list
positions.
   (3) Officers who transfer into the Logistics branch prior to attending a RC CCC, must attend the Logistics
Quartermaster, Ordnance, or Transportation RC CCC. RC captains, may also attend the resident CLC3 at ALU. Both
courses, upon completion, provide the requisite MDMP, functional and multifunctional training required of an officer
to branch transfer into the Logistics Branch.
   (4) Captains and above who have completed non-logistics CCC or Officer Advanced Course must fulfill the
following requirements.
   (a) Provide certificate of graduation from their previous CCC, Command and General Staff College or sister Service
O3 equivalent courses to meet MDMP requirement.
   (b) Complete a functional branch qualification course, Quartermaster, Ordnance, or Transportation.
   (c) Complete a multifunctional logistics qualification inclusive course.
   (5) All requests for transfer are routed through the officer’s chain of command, USAR or ARNG to the Logistics
branch proponency office at USCASCOM. The Logistics proponency office reviews all requests for transfer and
quarterly produces a consolidated approval memorandum.
   (6) ARNG and USAR officers forward applications in accordance with published command guidance to their State
AG, HRC, or the USARC, as appropriate. ARNG officers apply through their State AG; RC TPU officers apply
through USARC chain of command; IRR, IMA, and AGR officers apply through HRC Officer Personnel Management
Directorate. Application must include certificates of completion for PME requirements, unit validation of positional
assignment and an approved request for transfer memorandum from the Logistics proponency office.
   (7) Officers are not branch transferred into a basic branch of Quartermaster, Transportation, or Ordnance. Officers
are awarded the regimental affiliation of their appropriate transition course, 90A88, 90A91, or 90A92.
   (8) Approved officers are designated as 90A logisticians in the Logistics branch. The officer’s primary AOC is 90A.
The officer’s secondary AOC and regimental affiliation is the functional basic branch PME completed; Quartermaster,
Ordnance, or Transportation. The 90A primary AOC positions are coded as 90A00 and the secondary AOC positions
are coded as 90A88, 90A91, or 90A92. The officer holds the aforementioned primary and secondary AOCs throughout
the remainder of their career. The Logistics branch AOC 90A is not awarded as a secondary AOC. Officers are
prohibited from transferring again. The officer’s previous branch then moves to Section 1 of the officer’s ORB as
previous branch/MOS. Officers may request transfer out of the Logistics branch at anytime. When an officer transfers
out of the Logistics branch they may not transfer back into the Logistics branch again above the rank of lieutenant
colonel.

35–7. Introduction to the Transportation Branch
   a. Purpose. The Transportation Branch enables and integrates movement, deployment and distribution in support of
combatant commanders and other Army requirements. Our focus is to deliver a full range of transportation capabilities
in order to move critical resources rapidly through an integrated transportation-based global distribution system from
the source to the end user. The Transportation Branch operates under conditions of uncertainty and complexity
leveraging military, industrial, host nation capabilities, and emerging technologies. We provide movement control, in-
transit-visibility and guide delivery to deployed forces across the spectrum of conflict in support of unified land
operations. Our officers, warrant officers, enlisted, and civilian personnel are key to movement distribution. The
Transportation Branch is the “Spearhead of Logistics" because “Nothing Happens until Something Moves.”
   b. Proponent information. The chief of Transportation is the branch proponent for the Transportation Branch. The
Office of the Chief of Transportation personnel development team is responsible for the eight personnel development
system life-cycle management functions for all Transportation officers, warrant officers, Soldiers, and related civilian
occupational series, to include structure, acquisition, distribution, development, deployment, compensation, sustain-
ment, and transition. Contact the Office of the Chief of Transportation at Fort Lee, VA, 23801, (804) -765–7675/7447/
7275/7901. The official Web site is http://www.transportation.army.mil/.
   c. Functions. The Transportation Branch is responsible for the worldwide movement of units, personnel, equipment,
and supplies in peace and war. The Transportation Branch provides the transportation capabilities that are essential for
a CONUS-based power projection Army in support of the national military strategy and the physical capabilities
necessary to affect agile maneuver and movement of forces and materiel at tactical, operational, and strategic levels.
The Transportation Branch also provides FA expertise to support combat developments, materiel systems development,
force development, and training development. The Transportation Branch’s core competencies are:
   (1) Strategic deployment and distribution.
   (2) Movement control.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                          357

   (3) Expeditionary intermodal operations in air and sea ports of embarkation and debarkation.
   (4) Motor transportation operations.
   (5) Watercraft and marine terminal operations.
   (6) Rail transportation operations.
   d. History and background. The function of military transportation has been a part of the U.S. Army since it was
formed and evolved through two branches, the Quartermaster Corps (wagon and boat transportation) and Engineer
Corps (rail and harbor craft). In 1899, the Army first identified the need for a permanent organization to manage ports
of embarkation and debarkations, as well as the Army deep draft fleet with the creation of the Army Transportation
Service. Up until World War I military transportation had been managed by mode, but during this war the Army
identified the need for centralized management of all modes of transportation with the creation of the Transportation
Corps on 12 November 1918. The post war reductions reduced the short-lived Transportation Corps to a division of the
Quartermaster Corps until it was permanently re-established on 31 July 1942. In 1946, the Quartermaster Corps turned
over all modes of transportation to the Transportation Corps; and in 1954, the Engineer Corps turned over assault
landing craft, making the Transportation Corps responsible for all modes of Army transportation. The Army Transpor-
tation Corps gave up its deep draft fleet to the newly created Maritime Sea Transportation Service in 1948. Today the
Transportation Corps is responsible for all modes of Army transportation.
35–8. Transportation officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. Transportation officers are our Army’s deployment and distribution
experts, effectively supporting expeditionary forces. They are trained, innovative, and adaptive transportation and
logistics leaders who are grounded in the Army Values and can operate throughout the JIIM environment. Transporta-
tion officers enable unified land operations through the application of functional expertise in deployment and distribu-
tion. Our commissioned officer corps’ ability to also serve as multifunctional logisticians is enabled by the functional
depth and expertise of our Transportation warrant officer corps. All officers are expected to possess the base
characteristics that will enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for the 21st century. These leaders must
be able to connect, integrate, and deliver the transportation capabilities and capacity for movement and distribution
excellence on all fronts. At all levels, leaders must be functional experts and savvy supply chain integrators, agile and
adaptive warriors who can operate any platform, perform in any environment, and do so with broad, functionally
relevant competencies. Additional traits required include: ability to improvise, develop new ideas, and be innovative,
creative, and inquisitive while encouraging others to do the same. Transportation officers must also embrace and
promote diversity, and create environments where individuals are accepted, understood, and valued. Leaders must
demonstrate the imagination to challenge subordinates to work outside their comfort zones, possessing empathy and
compassion for others. Additionally, leaders must be adept enough to know how one connects to the big picture,
versatile enough to leverage, learn and develop individual skills and talents. Transportation officers must be competent
in their core proficiencies, able to lead change, broad enough to operate across the spectrum of conflict, able to operate
in JIIM environments, culturally astute, courageous enough to see and exploit opportunities, and grounded in Army
Values and Warrior Ethos.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of a transportation officer.
   (1) Lieutenants assessed into the Transportation Branch will develop functional branch skills defined by their AOC
for the first 3–4 years of their career. Transportation officer skills are found in one AOC (88A) and are open to male
and female officers. Upon graduation of the CLC3, Transportation officers will hold a primary AOC 90A with a
secondary AOC of 88A (90A88). (See paragraph 35–4 for an explanation of Logistics branch officers). Notwithstand-
ing this, these officers will maintain their Transportation regimental affiliation, and may continue to serve in Transpor-
tation functional assignments throughout their career. Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to
develop a Warrior Ethos and gain important leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Mobilization and Demobilization Operations (ASI 6M) addresses the mobilization and deployment processes at
various levels of command within the Army. The focus of the course is on legal authorities, mobilization concepts,
plans, policies, procedures, and the responsibilities for mobilization and deployment at DOD, HQDA, ACOM, ASCC,
JFHQ USARC, and installation levels. Mobilization and deployment planning interfaces at various ACOM levels and
the dependency of mobilization and deployment activities on automated systems is emphasized. To receive the ASI,
transportation officers must successfully complete the resident Mobilization and Deployment Planning Course (MDPC)
at ALU, Fort Lee, VA.
   (3) Transportation (AOC 88A). The core competencies of the Transportation Corps are deployment and distribution
operations, movement control operations, intermodal/terminal operations at air and sea ports, motor transport opera-
tions, watercraft transport operations, and rail transport operations. Transportation officers must be technically profi-
cient with employment of transportation and mission-unique equipment, personnel, and systems. Transportation officers
must understand transportation, supply, and maintenance automated systems. In addition to working independently,
Transportation officers often work in an environment where there is little time available, but sound and timely
decisions are crucial. Mission success requires the proper balance between technical know-how and the ability to
understand and apply the appropriate tactical expertise at the right moment. Hence, the ability to operate under stress,
make critical decisions, and act under all environmental conditions are all critical to success. Officers exercise mission
358                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

command, plan, procure, direct, control, coordinate, or manage transportation organizations and related equipment, as
well as organizations engaged in transportation related services. This requires general knowledge of transportation
organizations and doctrine concerning movement control, intermodal, terminal/port, distribution, and mode operations
and units. Officers also serve in positions requiring specialized transportation knowledge as well as functional
experience at higher levels of operations and organizations engaged in transportation related services with the unique
capability to plan, coordinate and synchronize the rapid deployment, sustainment/distribution management and
redeployment of forces in any area of operations to include planning, procuring, coordinating, and controlling the
movement of personnel and military cargo worldwide by military or commercial transport.
   (a) Army Transportation units play a key role in facilitating operational endurance and reach. Transportation units
move sustainment from ports to points of need and retrograde sustainment as required. Transportation operations
encompass the wide range of capabilities needed to allow joint and Army commanders to conduct decisive action
   (b) Officers serving in movement control operations plan, route, schedule, command, control, coordinate, and
conduct in-transit visibility of personnel, units, equipment, and materiel moving over line(s) of communication (LOC).
Movement control operations allocate resources based on the commander’s priorities and balance requirements against
capabilities.
   (c) Officers serving in intermodal operations plan, route, schedule, command, control, coordinate, and conduct in-
transit visibility of personnel, units, equipment, and materiel in support of the distribution system by combining the
functions of terminal and mode operations. Intermodal operations consist of facilities and transportation assets required
to support the distribution system. Intermodal operations are the movement of sustainment to a designated transship-
ment point, (facility, node, hub, Space Situational Awareness, terminal, centralized receiving and shipping point) where
the transfer of sustainment is from one conveyance to another while moving within the distribution system.
   (d) Officers serving in port/terminal operate a component of intermodal operations and are a key element in support
of operational reach and endurance. Port/terminal operations provide loading, unloading, and handling of materiel,
cargo, and personnel between various transportation modes. Port/terminal operations are essential in supporting
deployment, reception, staging, and onward movement and sustainment of the force. There are two types of port/
terminal/nodal operations: marine and inland. Duties encompass the command, control, or management of fixed ports,
unimproved ports, and bare-beach facilities; air, rail, motor, and inland waterway terminal operations; joint-logistics-
over-the-shore operations; and marine maintenance and salvage operations.
   (e) Officers serving in mode operations plan, command, direct, control, coordinate, and manage in order to match up
the correct transportation asset with the cargo characteristics and required delivery time in support of expeditionary
operations, port clearance, intermodal operations, motor transport/distribution services and operational mobility. Mode
operations are a component of intermodal operations. Movement control sections coordinate transportation assets.
When allocated, Army Aviation assets for sustainment support direct coordination between the movement control
battalion and the Aviation brigade is vital in providing responsive support.
   (f) Transportation officers serve in joint assignments, manage transportation personnel life-cycle functions, develop
doctrine, organizations and equipment, and instruct transportation skills at service schools, service colleges, pre-
commissioning and commissioning programs, and CTC. Transportation officers assist USAR and ARNG transportation
organizations.
35–9. Transportation officer development
   a. Officer professional development model. The goal of the Transportation officer PDM is to produce a professional
Warfighter who simultaneously provides expert sustainment in any operational environment and is adaptive to fluid
situations and operates adeptly within the structure of mission command. The Transportation officer focuses on both
multifunctional and functional developmental experiences across the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. The
model ensures an officer is broadened and developed, rather than aligned to a specific set of fixed gates or assignments
required for progression., Transportation professionals will grow through experience to understand mission command
sustainment systems, distribution management, and become effective logisticians and be savvy supply chain integrators,
in support of unified actions essential to retaining and exploiting the initiative and achieving decisive and sustainable
land operations.
   (1) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure. A diverse
portfolio of experiences is critical.
   (2) Leader development is a continuous and progressive process, spanning an officer’s entire career, consisting of
institutional training, operational assignments, and self-development. Officer training begins in the generating force in
schools and training centers where they are introduced to fundamental skills and tasks that will prepare them to
integrate and contribute effectively to a unit’s collective capabilities on the first day they arrive into a unit. However,
most leader development occurs during operational assignments where the officer gains baseline knowledge of mission
capability at the individual, crew, unit, staff, and leader level. Operational assignments build on the fundamental skills,
knowledge and behaviors developed in institutional training. Officers develop through challenging, unfamiliar experi-
ences that require them to adapt theory to reality. They learn from mistakes, learn to take risks and experiment with
non-textbook solutions to problems. Officers will return to schools from operational assignments at certain points to
gain additional skills, knowledge, and behaviors needed for their current assignment, as well as prepare them for the
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            359

next duty assignment and for higher levels of responsibility. Officers identify what they do not know and fill the gaps
through self-development. Self-development is as important as institutional training and operational assignments.
Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop both
joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expeditionary
force such as regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, or statesmanship.
   (3) Transportation officers are inducted into the Logistics branch (90A) after completion of the CLC3. Subsequently,
they will be assigned to both multifunctional logistics assignments and Transportation functional assignments.
   (4) Transportation Corps officers serve in every BCT and separate brigade in the Army with duties all over the
world. Transportation Corps officers are selected to serve in Joint assignments, Advanced Civilian Schooling and
Training With Industry Programs.
   (5) Once inducted into the Logistics Branch, an officer should continue to strive for training and assignments that
will broaden and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future.
   b. Key developmental, developmental and broadening. The PDM focuses on the need to both broaden an officer’s
knowledge, skills, and abilities at each grade and develop their logistical expertise across the entirety of an officer’s
career.
   (1) Key developmental. KD assignments are positions at each rank deemed fundamental to the development of an
officer in functional, multifunctional, and/or key competences at that rank.
   (2) Developmental. Developmental assignments support the growth of an officer’s functional and/or multifunctional
knowledge, skills, and attributes throughout their career. Functional and multifunctional assignments are vital to
developing an officer’s leadership abilities at each level of war; tactical, operational and strategic. These assignments
increase an officer’s expertise in their core functional skill set and multifunctional capability. Opportunities and goals
for developmental assignments are listed at each officer grade.
   (3) Broadening. Broadening as outlined in paragraph 3–4b(2)(f), is the purposeful expansion of an individual’s
capabilities and understanding provided through opportunities internal and external to the Army throughout their career
that are gained through experiences in different organizational cultures and environments, resulting in a leader who can
operate from the tactical level through the strategic level in multiple environments. There are four primary experience-
based assignments that specifically broaden logistical officers: functional/institutional, academia and civilian enterprise,
joint/multinational, and interagency/intergovernmental organizations. The essence of broadening is to challenge the
officer mentally in situations well outside their comfort zone and force them to apply critical thinking to complex
problems. Academic opportunities are essential for the broadening of an officer’s critical thinking capability and
exposure to alterative perspectives in problem solving. Generating force and industrial enterprise positions are crucial
to understanding force development, national-level sustainment, and force generation. A unified action partner opportu-
nity broadens an officer in strategic environments, diverse service/business cultures, and provides an understanding of
the national level of policy, procedures, strategy, and planning. Functional/institutional, academia and civilian enter-
prise, joint/multinational, and interagency/intergovernmental experiences are specifically designed to broaden an officer
beyond a logistician’s core competency and expand their critical thinking capabilities.
   c. Education.
   (1) PME programs are institutional developmental opportunities. From the BOLC, CLC3, Command and General
Staff College to SSC or accredited equivalent-level schooling or fellowships, officers must complete these courses on
time. Officers should not be assigned to KD positions unless they have completed the PME requirement for that rank.
Some PME opportunities enable an officer to gain a master’s degree. Officers are strongly encouraged to take
advantage of these opportunities. Institutional developmental opportunities are listed at each officer grade.
   (2) Competitive selection and attendance in an Advanced Civilian Schooling Program, selected internships, Training
With Industry program, scholarship programs, or certain fellowship programs are desirable and highly competitive
environments that provide unique broadening experiences for our most talented officers. These selective experiences
broaden an officer, evolve critical thinking, expand engagement skills and provide exposure to other organizational
cultures. Broadening in these areas increases the officer’s knowledge and understanding of organizations, new methods
and corporate cultures well outside traditional military logistics core competencies. Suggested broadening opportunities
are listed at each officer grade.
   (3) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force—regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   d. Transportation lieutenant development. Transportation lieutenants lead Soldiers in platoons and teams in semi-
autonomous activities in the fight or in support of the fight. Transportation lieutenants work in an extremely fluid and
dynamic environment with a wide variety of personnel and equipment. Since they often work independently with
minimum guidance, supervision or support, creative thinking, and problem solving are critical skills. Transportation
lieutenants will encounter information that varies in completeness and ambiguity. Therefore, it is imperative that
Transportation lieutenants can communicate effectively in both written and verbal forms. Transportation lieutenants
should also develop excellent supervisory skills to ensure proper execution of all assigned tasks and missions.
360                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

Transportation lieutenants must be tactically proficient and must attain a mastery of troop-leading procedures, unit
defense operations, and tactical convoy operations.
   (1) Education. During the second lieutenant years, Transportation lieutenants are required to complete Transporta-
tion BOLC. Special training necessary to support an officer’s follow-on assignment may be scheduled after BOLC.
Transportation BOLC trains lieutenants to be proficient in unit movement and deployment requirements (unit move-
ment officer).
   (2) Assignment. Upon graduation from Transportation BOLC, officers are normally assigned at the company level
to gain leadership experience and to enhance technical and tactical competence. Lieutenants should expect to serve as a
platoon leader, movement control officer, or as a company XO for a period of time that allows the officer to gain depth
of skills and experience. Lieutenants should expect to serve in progressive positions to develop leadership, technical
skills and, when appropriate, to complement this with staff experience at the battalion and brigade level. Because all
initial assignments are important, all officers should be primarily concerned with manner of performance, development
of professional attributes, enthusiasm for the job, and demonstration of potential.
   (3) Self-development. Lieutenants must focus on acquiring and refining troop-leading skills, transportation com-
petencies, communication, management, training, technical and tactical skills. Every leader is responsible for his or her
professional development. Lieutenants should seek additional training and an advanced degree. Recommendations for
lieutenants include:
   (a) Continue to assess, modify and develop immediate, near-term and long-range goals.
   (b) Complete an MSAF.
   (c) Use the Army Career Tracker to review your PDM, communicate with mentors, and review useful links to career
development information.
   (d) Take initiative to take online or attend resident courses that support your developmental needs.
   (e) Affiliate and participate in professional organizations.
   (f) Read and write for professional publications.
   (g) Study history, doctrine, and professional manuals and publications.
   (h) Analyze current events.
   (i) Seek leadership roles in the military and civilian community or other public service activities.
   (j) Throughout the process, continue to self evaluate all performance and seek assistance and guidance from
supervisors and more experienced leaders and peers.
   (4) Desired experience. The primary concern of all officers should be their manner of performance. Lieutenants
should exude enthusiasm and initiative, seek to develop their core competencies and professional attributes, and
demonstrate potential for increased responsibility and advancement. In all assignments, lieutenants should concentrate
on learning the basics of how the Army works, how to lead Soldiers, and how to maintain a motivated and positive
outlook. Lieutenants should strive to become technical and tactical experts by training with the warrant officers and
senior enlisted Soldiers in their units. Lieutenants must learn the intricacies of how to best lead and take care of
Soldiers, to support their commands and manage the distribution process (such as convoy operations), manage the
maintenance process of assigned equipment, and the use of automated logistics and sustainment systems. Before
promotion to captain, lieutenants should possess an excellent knowledge of the Transportation Branch’s purpose,
mission, and core competencies and have basic knowledge of other logistics competencies achieved through practical
experience in Transportation operations, activities, and missions.
   e. Captain (90A88) development.
   (1) Education. Upon graduation of the CLC3, Transportation officers will be inducted into the Logistics branch.
(See para 35–4 for an explanation of logistics branch.)
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Captains should aggressively prepare for and seek company-level command.
Company/detachment command is the only KD experience recognized at the captain level.
   (3) Broadening assignments. Along with command, captains continue to gain an in-depth understanding of the
multiple aspects of logistical operations and are more involved with battalion and brigade-level staff operations. 90A88
captain positions include transportation staff officer, movement control officer, branch or service school instructor, or
CTC observer controller/trainer. KD complete captains should discuss broadening opportunities with their assignment
officer and to apply for and compete for fully funded or cooperative degree advanced civilian schooling, fellowship
programs, or Training With Industry. See paragraph 35–4b or www.hrc.army.mil for a list of 90A broadening
opportunities.
   (a) Training With Industry. The Training With Industry Program is a work experience program to provide an
extensive exposure to managerial techniques and industrial procedures within corporate America to competitively
selected officers. Training received is normally not available either through the military school system or civilian
university system. Following the participants’ tenure at the industry, they are placed in a validated utilization
assignment for 2 years. Participants also incur an ADSO of 3 for one computed in days. Officers who desire to
compete for a Training With Industry opportunity should contact their HRC assignment officer and must be RA; have a
minimum of 3 and no more than 19 Federal commissioned service years (other than RA officers must have enough
service time left after completing Training With Industry to fulfill ADSO), must be able to fulfill obligations incurred
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           361

by this program; must have a secret security clearance (minimum); must have potential for future long-term service;
KD at current rank; meet height/weight requirements; and meet any additional requirements set by HRC. Examples are:
FedEx, LANDSTAR, and Logistics Management Institute. For additional information about Training With Industry
please review AR 621–1.
   (4) Self-development. All 90A88 officers should:
   (a) Seek opportunities available to them within all 90A and 90A88 competencies. For example, officers who have
worked motor transportation should seek opportunities in movement control positions or company grade positions with
an AOC of 90A00.
   (b) Captains should seek additional training and an advanced degree.
   (c) Continue to assess, modify and develop immediate, near-term and long-range goals.
   (d) Complete an MSAF.
   (e) Use the Army Career Tracker to review your PDM, communicate with mentors, and review useful links to career
development information.
   (f) Take initiative to attend courses that support your developmental needs.
   (g) Affiliate and participate in professional organizations.
   (h) Read and write for professional publications such as the Sustainment Magazine and Army Magazine.
   (i) Take relevant online courses such as learning a foreign language.
   (j) Study history, doctrine, and professional manuals and publications.
   (k) Analyze current events.
   (l) Seek leadership roles in the military and civilian community or other public service activities.
   (m) Throughout the process, continue to self evaluate all performances and seek assistance and guidance from
supervisors and more experienced leaders and peers.
   (n) Captains should take the opportunity to study and complete a graduate record examination or graduate manage-
ment admission test. Self-development programs should be tailored to meet changes in the environment, organizational
missions, and the individual’s developmental needs and professional interests. The concept of self-development places
responsibility squarely on the leader to do his share to attain and maintain competency. Every leader is responsible for
his or her own professional development. Commanders and supervisors have a responsibility to provide the time and
opportunity for a subordinate’s self-development to be effective.
   (5) Desired experience throughout this period. The officer should continue to develop leadership, tactical, technical,
and management skills. Captains must be proficient in all transportation core competencies in order to be an effective
leader at the company level and gain a working knowledge of command principles, battalion-level staff operations, and
multifunctional logistical operations at the battalion to brigade levels.
   f. Logistics major (90A88) development. The majority of major positions are designated multifunctional (90A).
However, 90A88 majors may be assigned to functional Transportation command, KD, and staff positions. KD
assignments encompass all aspects of multifunctional logistics as well as functional Transportation areas. 90A88 majors
should also seek assignments in unified action partner organizations toward joint service qualification.
   (1) Education. 90A88 majors continue PME through completion of ILE via the 10-month Resident (Command and
General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; sister Service schools and foreign schools), the 14-week satellite
campuses or distributed learning.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. There is no one particular KD job in a specific logistics unit that is considered
“most important” or a “must have” for promotion selection. Each officer should have sufficient experience in these KD
assignments in order to continue their understanding of transportation and multifunctional operations. 90A88 majors are
competitive to serve in 90A KD assignments listed at paragraph 35–4d(2). Functional KD assignments are:
   (a) Division transportation officer.
   (b) Movement control battalion executive officer and movement control battalion S2/3 (major authorized).
   (c) Movement control battalion operations officer (major authorized).
   (d) Transportation battalion executive officer and S2/3.
   (e) Major company command and commander, rapid port opening element.
   (3) Broadening assignments. Majors should aggressively seek the skills and experience that will best prepare them
for the duties at the lieutenant colonel level and should seek assignments to gain experience at the division level or
higher and in unified action partner organizations. Positions include:
   (a) Assignment to the White House Transportation Agency. The White House Transportation Agency provides a
fleet of motor vehicles, master drivers, and transportation services to the First Family, White House staff, and official
visitors of the First Family in the Washington, DC area. The White House Transportation Agency also provides
transportation support for presidential motorcades and travel as directed by the White House Military Office. KD
complete 90A88 majors who are interested in this assignment should contact their branch manager at HRC.
   (b) Senior observer/controller at Army and joint training centers
   (c) Corps or unified action partners level logistics officer.
   (4) Self-development. Field grade officers should:

   (k) Seek leadership roles in the military and civilian community or other public service activities.
   (l) Throughout the process, continue to self evaluate all performances and seek assistance and guidance from
supervisors and more experienced leaders and peers.
   (m) Self-development programs should be tailored to meet changes in the environment, organizational missions, and
the individual’s developmental needs and professional interests. Every leader is responsible for his or her professional
development. Commanders and supervisors have a responsibility to provide the time and opportunity for a subordi-
nate’s self-development to be effective. Officers should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their
warfighting perspective and should include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training.
Majors must exercise continuous self-development efforts to fully master all aspects of transportation operations and
multifunctional logistics to include Joint and multinational operations.
   (5) Desired experience. Field grade officers should strive to become an expert in all aspects of logistics and the
application of transportation competencies to include application within the context of unified action partner operations.
Officers should pursue joint qualification. At the field grade level, officers should actively mentor subordinates and
participate in talent management.
   g. Lieutenant colonel (90A88) development. As with major, the majority of lieutenant colonel positions are desig-
nated multifunctional (90A). However, officers serving in primary AOC 90A and secondary AOC 88A may be
assigned to functional Transportation command and staff positions. 90A88 lieutenant colonels should also seek
assignments with unified action partner organizations.
   (1) Education. 90A88 lieutenant colonels should continue to seek educational opportunities that enhance battalion
command and brigade potential, and multifunctional, functional and joint service experience. PME at the lieutenant
colonel and colonel level includes competitive selection for resident SSC, a fellowship at a civilian college, or foreign
school opportunity that fulfills the Army requirement for a MEL 1 educational experience. Nonresident SSC is
available to all lieutenant colonels as a distributed learning option. lieutenant colonels preparing for centrally selected
battalion-level command or key billet positions will attend applicable PCCs.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Successful command of any CSL battalion command or CSL key billet are the
only assignments that are considered to be KD at the lieutenant colonel (90A88) level.
   (3) Former battalion commanders will be managed and assigned to specific jobs based on the needs of the Army.
Some examples of former battalion commander billets include division-level officers under DCS, G–3/5/7, CTC task
force senior observer/controller, Joint Staff, OSD, Army, corps or division staff, TRADOC duty, HRC Logistics
Branch chief in officer or enlisted assignments, or USAREC duty.
   (4) Broadening assignments. 90A88 lieutenant colonels should seek assignments and experience at the corps level or
higher, and in unified action partner organizations. Leutenant colonels should continue the purposeful expansion of
their capabilities and understanding provided through opportunities internal and external to the Army. They should
pursue assignments in different organizations where the culture will result in understanding of how to work in concert
with elements of national power as well as lead, manage, and compete for resources at the executive level. Lieutenant
colonels should seek assignments to gain experience through the range of military operations and with unified action
partners. Positions include:
   (a) Positions listed in paragraph 35–4e(2).
   (b) Corps Transportation officer.
   (c) Transportation surface brigade (SDDC), S3 operations officer.
   (d) ESC/TSC mobility branch chief (lieutenant colonel authorized).
   (e) Senior observer/controller at Army and joint training centers.
   (f) Primary staff officer at the corps level or higher (Army staff, Joint Chiefs of Staff, AMC, Defense Logistics
Agency.)
   (g) Assignments to the operating and generating forces.
   (h) Nominative assignments or professor of military science. Assignments at this level prepare senior leaders to
assume strategic leadership responsibilities in military or national security organizations. lieutenant colonels should
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              363

strive to achieve joint service qualification. The Army requires senior leaders groomed for execution of strategic level
enterprise systems. Officers should actively mentor subordinates and participate in talent management.
   (5) Self-development. Lieutenant colonels should:
   (a) Devote time to hone their competence and depth of technical knowledge within logistics and Transportation core
competencies as well as tactical and strategic principles.
   (b) Complete a MSAF.

sors and more experienced leaders and peers.
   (n) Self-development programs should be tailored to meet changes in the environment, organizational missions, and
the individual’s developmental needs and professional interests. The concept of self-development places responsibility
squarely on the leader to do his or her share to attain and maintain competency. Commanders and supervisors have a
responsibility to provide the time and opportunity for a subordinate’s self-development to be effective.
   (6) Desired experience. These assignments have increased responsibility and require mature, skilled, and well-
grounded officers. Field grade officers should strive to become an expert in all aspects of logistics and the application
of transportation competencies. Joint officer qualification is desired. lieutenant colonels should actively mentor subordi-
nates and participate in talent management.
   h. Logistics (90A88) colonel development. The majority of colonel positions are designated multifunctional and joint
duty. However, officers holding primary AOC 90A and/or secondary AOC 88 may be assigned to functional Transpor-
tation command and staff positions. 90A88 colonels should continue to seek assignments in unified action partner
organizations toward joint service qualification.
   (1) Education. PME at the colonel level includes competitive selection for resident SSC for any branch of service, or
a civilian college, fellowship, or foreign school opportunity that fulfills the Army requirement for senior officers with a
MEL 1 educational experience. Nonresident SSC is available as a DL option. Colonels must be programmed to be SSC
complete prior to assumption of colonel-level command. Colonels preparing for centrally selected command or key
billet positions will attend applicable PCCs to prepare senior leaders to assume strategic leadership responsibilities in
military or national security organizations.
   (2) KD assignments. Successful performance in a CSL designated colonel command/key billet position is the only
colonel KD assignment.
   (3) Former brigade commanders will be managed and assigned to positions based on the needs of the Army.
   (4) Broadening assignments. In addition to multifunctional logistics positions, 90A88 colonels can serve in key staff
positions at Army, joint, and senior-level headquarters, such as USTRANSCOM, CASCOM, TRADOC, assistant
commandant U.S. Army Transportation School, and AMC. Broadening assignments are developmental positions that
provide exposure to experiences outside the officer’s core branch or FA competencies. Broadening assignments expand
of the capabilities and understanding of officers through opportunities internal and external to the Army that are
characterized by different organizational cultures and practices.
   (5) Self-development. Self-development opportunities include nonresident SSC completion for those not selected for
resident course attendance. Other educational opportunities include: graduate degree, Joint Forces Staff College (JPME
II), and International Society of Logistics Engineers (Sole) Certified Professional Logistician Program. Continue to
assess and modify your immediate, near-term and long-range goals. Complete a MSAF. Use the Army Career Tracker
to review your PDM, communicate with mentors, and review useful links to career development information. Affiliate
and participate in professional organizations. Read and write for professional publications. Study history, doctrine, and
professional manuals and publications. Analyze current events. Seek leadership roles in the military and civilian
community or other public service activities. Throughout the process, continue to self evaluate all performances and
seek assistance and guidance from supervisors and more experienced leaders and peers. Self-development programs
should be tailored to meet changes in the environment, organizational missions, and the individual’s developmental
needs and professional interests. Every leader is responsible for his or her professional development. As a senior leader,
you can take a primary role in mentoring subordinates and ensuring they develop effective self-development habits.
   (6) Desired experience. Colonels will serve primarily in key staff and/or joint positions in ESCs, TSCs, and division,
364                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

corps, and higher staffs. Select colonels will have the opportunity to command brigades. Successful completion of
brigade command will provide an opportunity to serve in positions of greater responsibility. Former brigade command-
ers are given the opportunity to serve as DCOs, and chiefs of staff and support operation officers of ESCs. In addition,
former brigade commanders can serve as executive officers for general officers to the CGs of the logistics ACOMs and
DCS, G–4 and serve as assistant commandant at the Transportation School. Senior leader development at this level
prepares senior leaders to assume strategic leadership responsibilities in military or national security organizations.
Joint officer qualification is desired by this level. Colonels are key mentors and advisors on talent management. As a
senior leader, you take a primary role in mentoring subordinates and ensuring they develop effective self-development
habits.
   i. Voluntary Transfer Incentive Program. All branch transfers are being executed through VTIP. The VTIP provides
an opportunity for all officers to pursue a career path that they believe is best suited to their talents and preferences and
enables the Army to best utilize those talents. VTIP balances branch and FAs strength at year group detail based on
Army requirements. The program provides a retention tool to keep talented officers in the Army and provides
flexibility and opportunity for (voluntary) strength management. Officers seeking to transfer into or out of the logistics
branch should review paragraph 35–4e and contact their State chain of command, ARNG Policy Branch, HRC, Army
Reserve Active Duty Management Directorate or the USAR Command, as appropriate.

35–10. Warrant officer development
   a. Unique knowledge and skills of a Transportation warrant officer. Transportation corps warrant officers are the
Army’s premiere technicians in deployment and distribution. Transportation Warrant Officers are the Army’s mission-
focused subject matter experts, skilled technicians, confident warrior-leaders, proficient trainers, mentors, and expert
technical advisors for the Transportation Corps, supporting all modes of Deployment and Distribution. Through
progressive levels of developmental assignments, education, and professional development, Transportation Corps
warrant officers evolve into operational, tactical, and strategic thinking, well-rounded senior warrant officers within
their specialties. Highly specialized transporters, they support various Army and Joint missions, at every level of
command, throughout their careers. The warrant officer Education System requires specific, highly technical training,
designed to prepare Transportation warrant officers to serve in positions of greater responsibility. The Transportation
Corps requires warrant officers to be highly skilled technicians in their specialty. The Transportation warrant officer
developmental model is shown at figure 35–4.
   (1) MOS 880A Marine Deck Officer. This MOS has two distinct critical skill levels of technical training and
professional credentialing; MOS 880A1 and 880A2. Warrant Officers within this MOS command and operate Army
watercraft and watercraft detachments; serve aboard Army watercraft as the commanding officer, master, navigator,
cargo officer or deck watch officer; serve as an Army harbormaster or port operations officer; serve on a battalion-level
staff or higher as the maritime operations officer; or as a Service school instructor. Additionally, they manage the
operation of U.S. Army watercraft and deployment/distribution measures in both tactical and peacetime environments.
They support Army missions by planning, coordinating, and directing Army units during ocean, joint-logistics-over-
the-shore, coastal, harbor and inland water (CHI) missions as well as strategic, operational, and tactical movement.
   (2) MOS 881A Marine Engineering Officer. This MOS has two distinct critical skill levels of technical expertise,
training and professional credentials; MOS 881A1 and 881A2. Warrant officers in this MOS command watercraft
maintenance detachments and maintain Army watercraft, serve as the chief engineer, assistant engineer, or engineering
watch officer; or may serve on a battalion-level staff or higher as the marine maintenance officer or as a Service school
instructor. Additionally, they manage and supervise the maintenance of U.S. Army watercraft.
   (3) MOS 882A Mobility Warrant Officers. This MOS assists the commander and staff in developing specific
procedures, estimates, analyses, and timelines for deployments, decisive action operational maneuver transportation
support requirements, area of operation movement support coordination to include route synchronization planning and
MSR/ASR control, and retrograde and redeployments. The warrant officer works closely with BSB support operations
section, the movement control battalion and MCTs arranging convoys in support of BCT sustainment and heavy lift
requirements; ensuring uninterrupted flow of critical sustainment commodities such as fuel, ammunition, food, and
water to operating forces within the BCT area of operation. The warrant officer also provides the commander and staff
information on data resident in ITV systems. They also coordinate deployment and distribution actions with multina-
tional, joint, Army, and commercial agencies. Officers in this MOS may serve at company level or higher, or as a
Service school instructor.
   b. Transportation warrant officer professional development model. The warrant officer development model is
focused on the quality and range of technical expertise. Established gateways are required to ensure that the warrant
officer progresses from the entry level of their career to the subject matter expert at the strategic level. Proper
development will foster warrant officers that remain the experts in their functional skill, but are also extremely diverse
in knowledge based education and experience. Leader development is a deliberate, continuous, progressive process,
grounded in the Army Values that grows competent, committed, professional leaders of character. Leader development
is achieved through the career-long synthesis of training, education, and experiences acquired through opportunities in
the in the institutional, operational, and self-development domains, supported by peer and developmental relationships.
   (1) Initial entry warrant officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a Warrior Ethos and gain
important leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) WO1/CW2. Throughout a warrant officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain technical and tactical
competency through developmental assignment experience. Warrant officers should continue their self-development
with training, PME, experience, various operational assignments, professional reading, and pursuit of civilian education
goals. CW2s may have opportunities for broadening experience through operational and institutional assignments.
   (3) CW3/CW4. At this point in a warrant officer’s career, the model highlights the need of a broader understanding
of the tactical and operational levels. The increase in responsibility at these ranks requires warrant officers to have the
ability to operate and integrate staff functions, as well as demonstrate leadership skills. CW3s/CW4s must continue
their professional growth with assignments in both the operating force and generating forces; these include broadening
assignments as well as Training With Industry opportunities. At this level the warrant officers should develop further
through broadening assignments, self-development, and additional functional and professional training. Embracing this
concept will provide the Transportation Corps with warrant officers who are self-aware, critical thinkers, adaptive
integrators, and technically skilled managers in deployment and distribution. Warrant officers at this rank should
366                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

continue their role as a coach, mentor, and advisor to junior warrant officers. Warrant officers should continue their
self-development, professional reading and pursuit of the next civilian education goals.
   (4) CW5. The pinnacle rank for all warrant officers. At this point in their career, a CW5 brings an unparalleled
wealth of both technical and tactical knowledge and experience, and is adept at critical problem solving. Increased
responsibility allows the CW5 to operate and integrate in all levels of command, to include the JIIM environment.
Lifelong learning supported by both civilian and military education provides critical opportunities for assignment.
CW5s may work outside one’s normal career path, such as broadening or nominative positions. Flexible timelines
enable warrant officers to serve longer in developmental assignments, ensuring warrant officers have adequate time to
utilize their skills and experience, and also support unit readiness and cohesion. Figure 35–3, below, shows the career
development models of the Marine Deck Officer (880A), the Marine Engineering Officer (881A), and Mobility
Warrant Officer (882A).

certification as outlined in AR 56–9, chapter 5.
35–11. Transportation Branch Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. A significant portion of Transportation assets resides in the RC. Transportation
Branch RC officers serve in the same roles and missions as their AA counterparts. The unique nature of the RC
Soldier’s role as a “citizen Soldier” poses a challenge for their professional development. However, RC Transportation
officers are expected to follow AA officer developmental patterns as closely as possible.
   b. Branch development opportunities. Officers are professionally developed through a succession of schooling and
assignments. Generally, education and self-development requirements parallel those identified for AA officers. See
figure 35–5, for the RC Transportation life-cycle model. Recommended RC Transportation officer professional devel-
opment by grade is as follows:
   (1) Lieutenant.
   (a) Education. The Transportation BOLC is the starting point for newly accessed RC Transportation officers. RC
officers should complete BOLC immediately following their commissioning but no later than their third year (USAR)
or 18 months (ARNG) of service. BOLC trains lieutenants to be subject matter experts for unit movement and
deployment requirements (unit movement officer).
   (b) Assignment. Upon graduation from Transportation BOLC, Officers should obtain assignments to transportation
units at the company level to gain leadership experience and to enhance technical and tactical competence. Lieutenants
should expect to serve as a platoon leader, company executive officer, movement control officer, or detachment
commander for a period of time that allows the officer to gain depth of skills and experience. If there is limited
leadership opportunity available within the Transportation competencies in the initial assignment, then the officer
should strive to seek to increase logistics knowledge within the Quartermaster or Ordnance competencies and pursue a
Transportation related position when available as a follow-on assignment.
   (c) Self-development. Lieutenants must focus on transportation core competencies, troop-leading skills, training,
management, communication, technical, and tactical skills.
   (2) Captain (90A88).
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           369

   (a) Education. Complete the RC CCC. Upon graduation, Transportation officers will be inducted into the Logistics
branch.
   (b) Developmental and broadening assignments. In order to be best prepared for the duties of a major, RC captains
should successfully serve in one of the following branch-preferred positions for a period of time that allows the officer
to gain an in-depth understanding of transportation operations as well as the multiple aspects of logistical operations.
   1. Company commander.
   2. Battalion/brigade staff officer.
   3. Movement control officer.
   (c) Self-development. RC Captains should expand their knowledge through professional readings, support military
and civilian transportation professional and social organizations, attend seminars and conferences, participate in
community activities, and complete a MSAF. Use the Army Career Tracker to review your PDM, communicate with
mentors, and review useful links to career development information.
   (d) RC Captains must be proficient in all Transportation core competencies in order to be an effective leader at the
company and battalion level. Additionally, officers must gain a working knowledge of battalion-level staff operations
and multifunctional logistical operations at the battalion and brigade levels.
   (3) Major (90A88).
   (a) Education. RC majors must complete ILE.
   (b) Developmental and broadening assignments. The majority of major positions are designated multifunctional
(90A). However, 90A88 Majors may be assigned to functional Transportation commands and staff positions. In order
to be best prepared for multifunctional logistical operations at the battalion and brigade levels, it is recommended that
RC majors serve in one of the following positions:
   1. Brigade/group/battalion executive officer.
   2. Movement control battalion operations officer
   3. Support operations officer.
   4. ESC/TSC staff officer.
   5. SDDC staff officer.
   6. Division transportation officer.
   7. Joint staff officer.
   (c) Self-development. Officers should obtain a master’s degree and devote time to a professional reading program to
broaden their warfighting and logistics perspective. Additionally, they should conduct research and write articles for
professional and military publications. Complete a MSAF. Use the Army Career Tracker to review your PDM,
communicate with mentors, and review useful links to career development information.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel (90A88).
   (a) Developmental and broadening assignments. The RC lieutenant colonels should continue to seek educational
opportunities that enhance battalion command potential, and multifunctional, functional and joint service experience.
RC lieutenant colonels should be assigned to a battalion/brigade-level command and/or senior staff.
   (b) Self-development. Officers should obtain a master’s degree and devote time to a professional reading program to
broaden their warfighting perspective and should include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional
training. Complete a MSAF. Use the Army Career Tracker to review your PDM, communicate with mentors, and
review useful links to career development information. They should conduct research and write articles for professional
and military publications. In order to be best prepared for the duties of colonel, RC lieutenant colonels should serve in
one of the following senior-level assignments:
   1. Battalion commander.
   2. SDDC transportation staff officer.
   3. Deputy commander (transportation/sustainment command).
   4. Brigade executive officer.
   5. HQDA/ACOM transportation staff officer.
   6. Division G4
   7. Service school staff/faculty.
   8. USTRANSCOM transportation staff officer.
   9. TSC staff officer.
   10. ESC staff officer.
   (5) Colonel (90A88). RC officers selected for colonel are advised to seek assignments of greater responsibility in the
branch. Officers selected for promotion to colonel should seek resident SSC-level educational opportunities. Alterna-
tively, officers not selected or not able to attend the resident SSC-level courses should seek distance learning SSC
courses such as the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course. RC Transportation colonels contribute to the
branch by serving in critical assignments to include the following:
   (a) Colonel-level command.

   (h) Service school staff/faculty.
   (i) ESC/TSC staff.
   c. Branch-transfer officers. Officers who wish to branch transfer at the ranks of captain through major who have
already completed a CCC or advance course must transfer into the Logistics branch (see para 35–6). All requests for
branch transfer are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Captains/majors who wish to hold the Transportation AOC within
the Logistics branch must take the Senior Transportation Officer Qualification Course. The objective of the Senior
Transportation Officer Qualification Course is to provide the student with a working knowledge of the duties and
responsibilities of a Transportation Corps officer operating at the battalion-level or higher. The course is in ATRRS;
course title: Senior Transportation Qualification Course; course number is 8C–F46 (DL).

35–12. Transportation Branch Reserve Component warrant officers
Reserve Component warrant officer development. The RC warrant officer development objectives and qualifications
basically parallel those of the AA, with the difference being the RC time in service and time in grade requirements.
The RC warrant officers, like their AA counterparts, are assigned to positions requiring their unique military occupa-
tional skills and grade. Specific schooling and operational assignments which will best prepare an RC warrant officer
and make them more competitive for positions of greater responsibility and promotion. These mirror those in the active
duty. The RC warrant officer developmental model is at figure 35–5.

35–13. Introduction to the Ordnance Branch
   a. Purpose. The Ordnance branch performs four core missions for the Army: maintenance, ammunition supply and
distribution, EOD, and explosives safety through the Defense Ammunition Center. The Ordnance Corps is consistently
ranked as the second largest branch in the Army in all three Components—Active, Reserve, and National Guard. The
Ordnance branch has two officers AOCs, nine warrant officer MOSs, and 32 enlisted MOSs. There are Ordnance
Soldiers assigned to every unit in the Army.
   b. Proponent information. The Chief of Ordnance is the branch proponent for the Ordnance branch. The Ordnance
Personnel Development Office is responsible for the eight personnel development system life-cycle management
functions for all Ordnance officers, warrant officers, Soldiers, and related civilian occupational series, to include
structure, acquisition, distribution, development, deployment, compensation, sustainment, and transition. Contact the
Ordnance Personnel Development Office at the U.S. Army Ordnance School, Fort Lee, VA, 23801, 804–765–7384/
7385. The official Web site is www.goordnance.army.mil.
   c. Functions. The Ordnance branch core competencies are maintenance, ammunition management, EOD and explo-
sives safety through the Defense Ammunition Center.

   (1) Maintenance. The management and physical performance of those actions and tasks involved in servicing,
repairing, testing, overhauling, modifying, calibrating, modernizing, and inspecting materiel in the operational inven-
tory and the provision of technical assistance to equipment users in support units of the Army Logistics System.
   (2) Ammunition. Ordnance officers manage the systems and physical performance of supply, storage and distribu-
tion of ammunition requirements for unified action partners.
   (3) Explosive Ordnance Disposal. The Army EOD mission is to support national security strategy and national
military strategy by reducing or eliminating the hazards of conventional unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO); CM,
biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) devices and materiel; and improvised explosive
devices that threaten personnel, operations, installations, property, or materiel. These missions occur during major
contingency operations (MCO), smaller scale contingency operations (SSCO), stability operations, and support opera-
tions. EOD operations are the detection, identification, field evaluation, render safe, recovery, and final disposal of
unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO).
   (4) Explosive Safety. U.S. Army Technical Center for Explosives Safety executes technical aspects of the Army
Explosives Safety Management Program for the Director of Army Safety.
   d. History and background. The Ordnance branch is one of the oldest branches of the U.S. Army, established on 14
May 1812. However, the duties and responsibilities of the profession date back to the colonial era with the appointment
of Samuel Sharpe as the first master gunner of ordnance for the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629. During the
Revolutionary War, Ordnance provided support to the army in the field and by manufacturing arms and equipment. By
the dawn of the War of 1812, the Secretary of War recognized the need for a distinct branch to manage the
procurement, research, and maintenance of ordnance materiel. With the establishment of the Ordnance Department, the
Army could specifically train a cadre of professional Ordnance officers with the skills necessary to research, procure,
and maintain the weapons and ammunition used by the Army. In World War I, the dramatically increased role of
mechanization and the sudden increase in the size of the Army required a massive growth in the Ordnance Department.
It was during World War I that the Ordnance Department established the tradition of attendance at an Ordnance school
as a necessary part of the professional education of Ordnance Soldiers. In 1985, the Ordnance Corps was reorganized
under the Regimental System, and the Chief of Ordnance gained responsibility for Ordnance branch proponency,
materiel systems, force structure, concepts and doctrine, and training doctrine. In 2009, the Ordnance School consoli-
dated from its two locations at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD and Redstone Arsenal, AL, and moved to Fort Lee,
Virginia. The Ordnance Corps maintains its commitment to sustaining the Army’s materiel, providing ammunition, and
protecting our unified action partners through EOD operations.
35–14. Ordnance officer characteristics required
Unique knowledge and skills of an Ordnance officer. Leadership in materiel maintenance and munitions management
or EOD requires officers with physical, technical and mechanical aptitude, “hands-on” people with good mechanical
and logical-mathematical skills. Ordnance officers must be able leaders and managers, people who can develop tasks
and work processes for desired outcomes. They must also possess an acute sensitivity to visual details, a capability for
rapid visualization and orienting to three dimensions with ease. Ordnance officers must be fit, prudent risk-takers, able
to operate confidently with technical accuracy in stressful situations, as well as synthesize forensic intelligence to
determine the deeper meaning or significance of what is occurring, especially EOD. Perhaps most importantly, all
Ordnance officers must be mission-focused, as sustainment determines the depth and endurance of Army operations.
There are two AOCs for Ordnance officers. Both are open to men and women. All academic disciplines are accepted.
Relevant degrees include: Acquisition/Contract Management, Applied Sciences & Engineering, Automotive Engineer-
ing, Business Management, Chemistry, Computer Systems & Technology, Disaster Management, Distribution Manage-
ment, Hazardous Materials Management, Industrial Engineering, Logistics Management, Mathematical Sciences,
Mechanical Engineering, Operations Research & Management, Supply Chain Management, Forensic Sciences. Ord-
nance/Logistics officers are offered opportunities to compete for advanced civil schooling in Business Management
(MBA), logistics, supply chain, and explosives engineering/manufacturing, as well as Training With Industry. Lieuten-
ants are trained and serve in leadership and staff positions within the Ordnance core competencies. After completion of
the CLC3, they will become Logistics branch officers serving in multifunctional logistics positions, as well as
ordnance-centric positions throughout the remainder of their careers. (See Logistics Branch).
   a. Materiel Maintenance and Munitions Management Officer (AOC 91A). Officers working in this AOC provide
oversight and supervision to Soldiers in 32 Ordnance enlisted and nine warrant officer MOSs as readiness enablers to
build and maintain combat power. They are responsible for the Army maintenance process that ensures weapon
systems are operational, ready, and available. Officers are responsible for integrated maintenance support of Army
conventional weapon systems, small arms, artillery, fire control equipment, missile systems and their associated ground
support equipment; electronics; track and wheel vehicles; and engineer and power generation equipment. Maintenance
functions include metalworking, fabrication, welding, inspection, test, service, calibration, repair, overhaul, and recla-
mation. Officers must develop a comprehensive knowledge of maintenance management techniques and integrated
logistics support. Officers must be technically competent in production control and quality assurance techniques. The
technical sophistication of today’s Army weapon systems; the high dollar cost of production, fielding and maintaining;
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             373

and their tactical importance require officers with the highest managerial and leadership skills. Officers will become
proficient with automated logistics information systems. These officers also manage the Army’s munitions inventory.
These officers lead, manage, plan, and direct ammunition supply, storage, transportation, maintenance, surveillance,
inspection, stock control, safety, and security, including maintenance of associated test and handling equipment.
   b. Explosive Ordnance Disposal officer (AOC 89E). EOD officers are gained as Ordnance lieutenants. Following
completion of Ordnance BOLC B, they attend the best tactical and technical training that Army and civilian academia
can provide, including Naval School EOD, Federal Bureau of Investigation Post Blast, and several others. EOD officers
graduate from the Naval School explosives ordnance disposal and maintain EOD qualifications in accordance with
applicable regulations, are assigned to a military unit with a Service-defined EOD mission, and meet service and
assigned unit requirements to perform EOD duties. EOD officers have received specialized training to address
explosive hazards during both peacetime and wartime. EOD officers are trained and equipped to perform render safe
procedures (RSP) on nuclear, biological, CM, conventional munitions, and improvised explosives devices. EOD
officers provide a unique and critical service to the Army, unified action partners, and defense support of civil
authorities. EOD officers plan, develop, and integrate EOD operations for all types of contingency operations. These
officers advise, integrate, and execute the render safe operations of CM, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive
ordnance disposal (CBRNE) functions stemming from threats posed by unexploded ordnance (UXO), improvised
explosive devices, and WMD. These officers lead, manage, plan, and direct activities and organizations concerned with
identification, location, rendering safe, handling, removal, and disposal of U.S. and foreign unexploded conventional,
nuclear, and CM munitions and improvised explosive devices. Additionally, EOD officers provide support/protection to
the President of the United States, senior American officials, military and foreign dignitaries, and support intelligence
activities through analysis of foreign munitions, technical and biometric exploitation of improvised explosive devices,
and perform the forensic analysis of post-blast explosive materials. EOD officers may also serve in ammunition officer
(90A91) and Logistics officer (90A) command and staff positions throughout their careers. In order to be highly
competitive for multifunctional logistics commands, as well as EOD commands, it is important for EOD officers to
serve in both areas of expertise. There are specific qualifications for EOD officers in accordance with AR 611–105:
   (1) A physical demands rating of very heavy.
   (2) A physical profile of 111121.
   (3) Normal red/green color perception.
   (4) Top secret eligibility based on a favorable SSBI is required. At least an interim secret eligibility is required prior
to EOD training.
   (5) Eligibility for assignment to a category II Presidential support position per AR 380–67.
   (6) Must complete EOD Specialist Course, Phase I at Fort Lee, VA and Phase II at Naval School EOD
(NAVSCOLEOD) at Eglin Air Force Base, FL.
   (7) Be an EOD duty volunteer.
   (8) Be a U.S. citizen.
   (9) Must possess a valid driver’s license.
   (10) Must be interviewed and accepted by an EOD officer or an EOD SFC or above in an EOD TOE/TDA position.
35–15. Ordnance officer development
   a. Officer professional development model. The Ordnance officer PDM depicts only Ordnance specific education,
assignments and experience. (Note. See the Logistics PDM for those areas common to all Logistics officers.) The
Ordnance PDM shows a career model whereby the officer is developed through PME, and additional training,
completes KD assignments, and other Ordnance functional assignments and broadening opportunities. See paragraph
3–4b(2)(f) for a description of broadening opportunities. Each individual officer is responsible for his or her own self-
development, and the mentorship of their subordinates throughout their career. Officers are encouraged to develop a
personal five-year plan, and discuss their goals with a mentor and their assignment officer at HRC. Use of the Army
Career Tracker can assist the officer with communicating with mentors, as well as providing useful links to their PDM
and career development information. Ordnance officers will grow through experience to understand mission command
sustainment systems, distribution management, and become effective logisticians in support of unified land operations
essential to retaining and exploiting the initiative and achieving decisive and sustainable land operations.
   (1) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain training, education, and experiences.
Officers should understand that manner of performance is paramount and results in nominations and selection for
competitive command and broadening opportunities.
   (2) Leader development is a continuous and progressive process, spanning an officer’s entire career, consisting of
institutional training, operational assignments, and self-development. Officer training begins in schools and training
centers where they are introduced to fundamental skills and tasks that will prepare them to integrate and contribute
effectively to a unit’s collective capabilities on the first day they arrive into a unit. However, most leader development
occurs during operational assignments where the officer gains baseline knowledge of mission capability at the
individual, crew, unit, staff, and leader level. Operational assignments build on the fundamental skills, knowledge and
behaviors developed in institutional training. Officers develop through challenging, unfamiliar experiences that require
374                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

them to adapt theory to reality. They learn from mistakes, learn to take risks and experiment with non-textbook
solutions to problems. Officers will return to schools from operational assignments at certain points to gain skills,
knowledge, and behaviors needed for their current assignment, as well as prepare them for the next duty assignment
and for higher levels of responsibility. Officers learn what they do not know and fill the gaps through self-
development. Self-development is as important as institutional training and operational assignments. Self-development
is a personal responsibility to seek out opportunities to sustain individual strength and address gaps in skills and
knowledge. To be effective, officers must be completely honest in their self-assessment and take appropriate steps to
enhance their capabilities which enhance qualifications for a current position or helps prepare an officer for future
positions. Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to
develop both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an
expeditionary force—regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (3) Ordnance officers are inducted into the Logistics branch upon graduation from the CLC3. Subsequently, they
will be assigned to both multifunctional logistics assignments and Ordnance functional assignments. (See para 35–2.)
   (4) Ordnance officers are serving in every BCT and separate brigade in the Army all over the world. Ordnance
officers may compete for joint assignments, advanced civil schooling and Training With Industry programs as Logistics
officers, as well as Ordnance specific broadening opportunities such as Training With Industry programs for Ordnance
officers. Officers should coordinate with their assignments officers at HRC.
   b. Ordnance lieutenant development (91A and 89E).
   (1) Education. Ordnance lieutenants will complete their BOLC B at ALU at Fort Lee, Virginia. If an Ordnance
lieutenant has been accepted for EOD, he or she will attend follow-on EOD Phase I training at Fort Lee, and EOD
Phase II, Naval School EOD (NAVSCOLEOD) at Eglin Air Force Base, Fort Walton Beach, Florida.
   (2) Assignment. Ordnance lieutenants are typically assigned at the company level to lead Soldiers executing
maintenance, ammunition management, or EOD operations in the following positions: platoon leader, maintenance
control officer, company executive officer, ammunition control officer, or EOD operations officer. Lieutenants should
learn field and sustainment maintenance operations, workload management, utilization of Standard Army Management
Information Systems reports, and ammunition supply and management. EOD (89E) lieutenants will be assigned to
EOD companies to lead Soldiers and conduct disposal and render safe operations. Lieutenants should expect to serve in
progressive positions to develop their leadership and technical skills, and when appropriate, to complement this with
staff experience at the battalion and brigade level.
   (3) Self-development. Every officer is responsible for his or her professional development. These initiatives focus on
maximizing leader strengths, minimizing weaknesses, and achieving individual leader development goals. Start with a
self-assessment. Ask for feedback from your experienced peers, commanders and leaders to assess your strengths and
weaknesses. A critical component of the self-development domain is MSAF. Although officers may take ample steps to
facilitate self-development, the MSAF program-also referred to as 360 Degree Assessment-helps officers raise self-
awareness and better shape their self-development efforts. The MSAF provides input from peers, superiors, and
subordinates which help the rated officer develop as a self-aware and adaptable leader. Use the Army Career Tracker to
review your PDM, to communicate with mentors, and review useful links to career development information. Use this
information to direct self-development efforts and rank actions for improving performance and achieving maximum
potential. Self-development actions fall into three categories—immediate, near-term and long-range goals. Immediate
goals focus on correcting weaknesses and reinforcing strengths associated with your current assignment. Near-term
goals focus on developing those skills, knowledge and attributes needed for your next operational assignment. Long-
term goals focus on preparing for more complex duties beyond your next operational assignment. Take initiative to
attend courses that support your developmental needs. Affiliate and participate in professional organizations. Read and
write for professional publications such as the Ordnance Magazine and Sustainment Magazine. Take appropriate
courses such as identification of ammunition, transportation of hazardous materials, language and culture training.
Study history, doctrine, and professional manuals and publications. Analyze current events. Seek leadership roles in the
military and civilian community or other public service activities. Throughout the process, continue to self evaluate all
performances and seek assistance and guidance from supervisors and more experienced leaders and peers. Self-
development programs should be tailored to meet changes in the environment, organizational missions, and the
individual’s developmental needs and professional interests. The concept of self-development places responsibility
squarely on the leader to do his share to attain and maintain competency. Commanders and supervisors have a
responsibility to provide the time and opportunity for a subordinate’s self-development to be effective.
   (4) Desired experience. Lieutenants must focus on acquiring and refining troop-leading skills, Ordnance com-
petencies, communication, management, and technical and tactical skills. The primary concern of all officers should be
their manner of performance. Lieutenants should exude enthusiasm and initiative, seek to develop their core com-
petencies and professional attributes, and demonstrate potential for increased responsibility and advancement. Lieuten-
ants should strive to become technical and tactical leaders of Ordnance operations by training with the warrant officers
and senior enlisted Soldiers in their units. Lieutenants must learn the intricacies of how to best lead and take care of
Soldiers and accomplish the mission. Before promotion to captain, officers should possess a detailed knowledge of the
Ordnance core competencies and have a basic knowledge of logistics.
   c. Ordnance captain (90A91 and 89E) development.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             375

   (1) Education. (See para 35–2.)
   (2) Key developmental assignments. (See para 35–2.)
   (3) Developmental assignments. All assignments are developmental. At the captain level, Officers should seek
positions in Ordnance core competencies, as well as other logistics functions. EOD officers may pursue logistics
assignments as well as EOD assignments. See paragraph 35–2 for a discussion of multifunctional assignments. See the
Ordnance PDM for a description of Ordnance functional assignments.
   (4) Broadening assignments. To develop leaders for strategic level positions within the Army and beyond, officers
are encouraged to broaden their experience beyond tactical-level operations. The Army Broadening Opportunity
Program provides competitive officers with extraordinary experiences to serve outside their functional fields. See
paragraph 3–4b(2)(f) for a description of broadening opportunities. For a complete description of current programs, see
the Broadening Opportunity Programs Web page on the HRC Web site, and discuss your timelines with your
assignment officer.
   (5) Self-development. (See para 35–2.)
   (6) Desired experience. (See para 35–2.)
   d. Major development. (90A91 and 89E) The majority of major positions are designated multifunctional logistics,
90A. However, 90A91 and 89E91 majors may be assigned to functional Ordnance command and staff positions.
   (1) Education. (See para 35–2.)
   (2) Key developmental assignments. See paragraph 35–2 for a list of 90A KD positions. Other major level KD
positions in Ordnance functional units include EOD battalion S3, EOD company/detachment commander authorized a
major, and the ammunition battalion munitions materiel management officer.
   (3) Developmental assignments. All assignments are developmental. At the major level, Officers should continue to
enhance their Ordnance core competencies, as well as other logistics functions. EOD officers may pursue logistics
assignments as well as EOD assignments. See the Logistics Branch for a discussion of multifunctional assignments.
See the Ordnance PDM for a description of Ordnance functional assignments.
   (4) Broadening assignments. Following KD jobs, majors should seek positions for experience beyond the tactical
domain. To develop leaders for strategic level positions within the Army and beyond, officers are encouraged to
broaden their experience beyond tactical-level operations. The Army Broadening Opportunity Program provides
competitive officers with extraordinary experiences to serve outside their functional fields. See paragraph 3–4b(2)(f) for
a description of broadening opportunities. For a complete description of current programs, see the Broadening

35–16. Ordnance warrant officer development
   a. Unique knowledge and skills of an Ordnance warrant officer. Ordnance warrant officers are the Army’s premiere
maintenance and logistics system expert, leader, trainer, mentor, and advisor. They administer, manage, maintain,
operate, and integrate Army maintenance and logistical systems and equipment across the full range of Army
operations. Ordnance warrant officers are confident warrior-leaders, mission-focused subject matter experts, innovative
integrators of emerging system technologies, and expert technical advisors. As highly specialized maintainers, they
support a multitude of Army missions throughout their career. Ordnance warrant officers must meet certain standards
in terms of professional development, broadening and developmental assignments to evolve as a well-rounded senior
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             377

warrant officer within their specialty. Meeting these standards ensures the warrant officer acquires the skills, knowl-
edge, and attributes to remain proficient in their specialty and serve at all levels within the Army. The warrant officer
education system requires specific training designed to prepare warrant officers to serve in positions of greater
responsibility. The warrant officer developmental model at figure 35–8, displays key operational, developmental,
institutional, and broadening assignments as well as PME and civilian education goals. As a general rule, Ordnance
warrant officers can consider TOE positions as developmental and TDA positions as broadening with some exceptions.
Complete listings of available Ordnance warrant officer positions can be found on the FMS Web and Army Career
Tracker.

   b. Ordnance warrant officer professional development model. The warrant officer PDM is focused on the quality
and range of experience, as well as specific gates required to progress to the strategic level. If done correctly, proper
development will foster a warrant officer cohort that remains experts in their functional skills but are also diverse in
experience, education, and exposure. Leader development is the deliberate, continuous, progressive process, founded in
Army Values that grows competent, committed, professional leaders of character. Leader development is achieved
through the career-long synthesis of training, education, and experiences acquired through opportunities in the institu-
tional, operational, and self-development domains, supported by peer and developmental relationships.
   (1) Initial entry warrant officers gain branch expert technical and tactical skills to develop a Warrior Ethos and gain
important leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) WO1/CW2. Throughout a warrant officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain technical and tactical
competency through developmental assignments. Warrant officers at this rank should continue their self-development
through training, education, experience, professional reading and pursuit of civilian education goals. CW2s may have
opportunities for broadening experience in operational or institutional assignments.
   (3) CW3/CW4. At this point in a warrant officer’s career, the model highlights the need to be self-aware and
adaptive integrators and managers of Army systems as exposure opportunities exist at higher levels of command.
Increased responsibilities require warrant officers to exercise leadership, mandate an ability to operate and integrate
staff functions at the tactical to operational level. CW3/CW4s must continue their developmental growth while
378                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

recognizing the increased opportunities within the generating force, broadening assignments, functional training, and
self-development requirements that capitalize on their technical skills. Warrant officers at this rank should author
professional articles in support of sustainment publications highlighting their master technical competence. Warrant
officers at this rank should continue their role as a coach, mentor, and advisor to junior warrant officers.
   (4) CW5. At this point in a warrant officer’s career, the model highlights the need to be comfortable operating in
ambiguity and adept at solving ill-structured problems. CW5s bring an unequaled depth and breadth of knowledge,
experience, and perspective to their primary area of expertise. Increased responsibilities mandate an ability to operate
and integrate within staff functions at the tactical to strategic level, and necessitate cultural and JIIM environment
expertise. CW5 assignments are available outside one’s normal career path that are nominative, broadening or JIIM in
nature. Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Flexible timelines enable CW5s to serve longer in developmental assign-
ments ensuring they have adequate time to utilize their skills and expertise in their understanding of the complex
operating environment to strengthen the nation’s adaptive land force for decisive action.
   c. Warrant officer one development.
   (1) Education. After completing the WOCS, WO1s attend their MOS WOBC. Appointment to WO1 is contingent
upon successfully completing the WOBC for the officer’s respective MOS. All WO1 and CW2s should strive to
complete an associate’s degree.
   (2) Developmental assignment. Company-level tactical and technical experts serve at the TOE platoon, company,
and battalion level, with some brigade and higher-level support positions in the following type units: forward support
company, maintenance section/company (brigade troops battalion, brigade support battalion, engineer company/battal-
ion, CSSB), Patriot/Avenger support teams, ammunition transfer holding point, modular ammunition company (heavy
or light), Ordnance company ammunition/maintenance and/or Signal company/battalion. This type of assignment gives
the junior Ordnance warrant officer a solid base of technical experience, developmental exposure, depth, and breadth
on systems maintenance and processes that ultimately prepares them for assignments at the higher levels.
   (3) Self-development. Warrant officers should devote time to self-development, which should include professional
certifications, correspondence courses, institutional training, and civilian education. Junior warrant officers should
utilize a professional reading program to broaden both their warfighting perspective and technical comprehension.
   (4) Desired experience. The junior warrant officer should focus on acquiring and refining tactical and administrative
skills as well as MOS-unique technical skills during their developmental assignments.
   d. Chief warrant officer two.

their MOS WOAC no later than 1 year after promotion to CW3. Although not a requirement for promotion, all officers
in the grade of WO1 and CW2 should strive to complete an associate’s degree.
   (2) Developmental and broadening assignments. Typically, CW2s will continue in developmental tactical assign-
ments however CW2s can expect assignments to CW3 positions upon completion of WOAC and should consider
broadening assignment opportunities. CW2s can compete for Training With Industry assignments.
   (3) Self-development. The CW2s should continue to acquire and refine their advanced MOS-unique technical skills
and continue pursuing professional certifications, correspondence courses, institutional training, and civilian education.
CW2s should refine their communication and critical thinking skills as they prepare for operational and broadening
assignments.
   (4) Desired experience. Successful completion of every duty assignment is important and determines promotion
potential.
   e. Chief warrant officer three.
   (1) Education. Upon promotion to CW3, the warrant officer is eligible and should attend the WOSC no later than 1
year after promotion to CW4. Although not a requirement for promotion, all officers in the grade of CW3 should strive

technical experts who normally serve as the senior warrant officer in TOE positions at the brigade level and below,
ammunition transfer holding detachment, sustainment brigade/sustainment command distribution management center,
forward support company, maintenance section/company (brigade support battalion, engineer company/battalion/bri-
gade, CSSB), Ordnance company missile and/or Signal company/battalion, component repair platoon. CW3s should
begin pursuing broadening assignments but can expect assignments to CW4 positions upon completion of WOSC.
CW3s can compete for Training With Industry assignments.
   (3) Self-development. The CW3s should continue to acquire and refine their master MOS-unique technical skills.
CW3s should perfect their communication and critical thinking skills in preparation for operational and strategic
assignments.
   (4) Desired experience. CW3s should provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs,

commands, Service school, CASCOM, Army staff or separate DOD agencies. CW5s may serve in positions that are
MOS non-specific.
   (3) Self-development. CW5s should sharpen their knowledge of personnel force integration functions for doctrine,
training, and personnel as pertains to the Ordnance branch. CW5s should become familiar with the constitutional,
statutory, and regulatory basis for the force projection Army and the capabilities that must be sustained through
management of doctrinal, organizational, and materiel change.
   (4) Desired experience. CW5s at this level should provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to
NCOs, warrant officers, and branch officers in support of a globally responsive and regionally engaged Army. CW5s
have special mentorship responsibilities for other warrant officers at all levels and are responsible for providing
essential advice to commanders on technical and warrant officer issues. The CW5s must become familiar with Army
organizational roles, functions, and missions, especially at the ACOM and Army staff level and with the force
management processes, from the determination of force requirements through to the resourcing of requirements and the
assessment of their utilization in order to accomplish Army functions and missions in a joint/combined environment.

                         Figure 35–8. AC Ordnance warrant officer professional development model
35–17. Reserve Component Ordnance officers
   a. General career development. The RC of the Army includes the National Guard and the Army Reserve. RC
Ordnance officer career development closely parallels the AA as described in paragraphs 35–3 and 35–4. Key
differences are in RC time in service/time in grade requirements. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation
through assignments in their branch before specialization begins.
   b. Key developmental assignments. Although RC officers are limited by unit availability and geographical considera-
tions, they should strive for an initial assignment within the Ordnance competencies of ammunition, maintenance, and,
when applicable in the National Guard, EOD. RC officers are more likely than their active duty counterparts to
experience assignments outside their basic branch. RC officers should concentrate their early assignments in Ordnance
basic branch assignments to develop their necessary technical skills.
   (1) Lieutenant. At the rank of lieutenant, the RC officer should concentrate on developing leadership skills and
communicative, management, technical, and tactical skills. This is the stage where officers develop their branch core
competency for the rest of their careers. If there are limited leadership opportunities available within the Ordnance
competencies in an officer’s initial assignment, the officer should strive to seek to increase logistics knowledge within
the Transportation or Quartermaster competencies and pursue an Ordnance-related position when available as a follow-
on assignment. In all assignments, lieutenants should concentrate on learning the basics of how the Army works, how
to lead Soldiers, and how to maintain a motivated and positive outlook.
   (a) During the second lieutenant years, RC officers are required to complete Ordnance BOLC B and complete a
bachelor’s degree. Those lieutenants selected to become EOD officers in the National Guard can expect to attend Phase
1 EOD School at Fort Lee and Phase 2 EOD School at NAVSCOLEOD immediately after BOLC. Second lieutenants
should strive to become technical and tactical experts by training with the warrant officers and senior enlisted Soldiers
in their units. Second lieutenants must learn the intricacies of how best to lead their formations and support their
command. Second lieutenants not only lead their platoons they must develop technical competencies by managing the
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                          381

maintenance process, such as manage work order flow, common equipment failures and repair, repair parts manage-
ment, and tracking work orders and parts status through automated systems.
   (b) During the first lieutenant years, the focus is on acquiring and refining troop-leading skills, Ordnance com-
petencies, coordination skills, and increasing logistics and administrative skills. Typical positions may include, but are
not limited to, platoon leader, maintenance control officer, and company XO or detachment commander. Within 2 years
of consideration for promotion to captain, RC officers should enroll and begin the CCC–RC Ordnance or CLC3 and
continue to hone troop-leading procedures. Because all initial assignments are important, an officer should be primarily
concerned with manner of performance, development of professional attributes, enthusiasm for the job, and demon-
strate potential. Before promotion to captain, officers should possess an excellent knowledge of the Ordnance com-
petencies and have basic knowledge of other logistics competencies.
   (c) Branch transfer is not open to lieutenants. Lieutenants that have completed other than Ordnance BOLC B must
take the Ordnance Officer Branch Qualification Courses.
   (2) Captain. (See para 35–6).
   (a) For promotion to the rank of captain, a bachelor’s degree is required. Officers will complete the CCC–RC
(Ordnance) or when available, complete the resident CLC3 Ordnance. At the completion of either course, they will be
inducted into the Logistics branch and be designated 90A. Additionally, it is recommended they complete the Support
Operations Course to prepare captains for the transition into the Logistics branch.
   (b) Captains should seek the responsibility of commanding troops. ARNG EOD captains, who are not selected for
an EOD company command, should strive for other types of logistical command assignments for their key develop-
ment assignment. When not in command, typically captains will occupy assignments as battalion staff officers,
battalion-level primary staff officers, training division staff officers, joint force headquarters (JFHQ) staff officers, or
RC school commandants. RC captains may also serve in branch immaterial broadening assignments.
   (c) Captains should continue to gain an in-depth understanding of logistics operations and become proficient in other
logistics competencies, if they have not the opportunity to do so. The TLog, advanced maintenance or supply courses,
Support Operations Course, or an advanced degree in engineering, physical science, business, or logistics management
all contribute to the Ordnance officer’s professional development. However, job performance, completion of KD
assignment requirements, and logistics experience are required to prepare the officer for advancement to the next grade.
   (3) Major. (See para 35–6.)
   (4) Lieutenant colonel. (See para 35–6.)
   (a) Key assignments include battalion commander of a multifunctional logistics, ammunition, or EOD battalion
(National Guard), key staff in sustainment brigades, maintenance division chief at USARC headquarters, joint staff in a
state command, director for maintenance at area readiness support groups, deputy assistant chief of staff materiel,
materiel maintenance officer, plans officer at a ESC, or maintenance evaluation team leader at a training division.
   (b) Lieutenant colonels should complete Advanced Operations and Warfighter Course if it was not completed as a
major. The full gamut of schools is available to RC officers subject to lesser funding and seat availability. Lieutenant
colonels should seek an advanced degree from a civilian institution, they should also apply for SSC and the RC
National Security Course.
   (5) Colonel. (See para 35–6). At the rank of colonel, officers should have a broad background in multifunctional
logistics with highly developed skills in materiel management. Colonel career objectives include the following:
successfully complete colonel-level command of a sustainment brigade, united services property and fiscal offices
(USP&FOs), or regional support group (RSG) if selected and serve on a general staff. Officers must attend the SSC or
enroll in the Army War College Distributed Learning Course in order to become competitive for General Officer
nomination. Completion of ILE is a requirement for promotion to colonel.
   (6) Branch transfer. Officers who wish to branch transfer at the rank of captain through major must transfer into the
Logistics branch. Officers who wish to hold an Ordnance AOC within the Logistics branch must take the Ordnance
Officer Branch Qualification Course, available online on the Army Distributed Learning Web site.

35–19. Introduction to the Quartermaster Branch
   a. Purpose. The Quartermaster Corps provides integrated logistics support to sustain Soldiers, units and their
equipment in war and peace. The Quartermaster Corps is the largest branch in the U.S. Army with over 150,000
officers, warrant officers, enlisted and civilian personnel serving in all three components—AA, USAR, and the ARNG.
   b. Proponent information. The Quartermaster General is the proponent for the Quartermaster Corps. The Office of
the Quartermaster General is responsible for the eight personnel development system life-cycle management functions
for all Quartermaster officers, warrant officers, Soldiers, and related civilian occupational series including: structure,
acquisition, distribution, development, deployment, compensation, sustainment, and transition. Contact the Office of the
Quartermaster General proponent officer at the U.S. Army Quartermaster School, Fort Lee, VA. 23801, (804)
734–4503. Our website is http://www.quartermaster.army.mil.
   c. Functions. Quartermaster core competences are:
   (1) Supply and Services: Supply and distribution management, supply automation, mortuary affairs, aerial delivery
and sling load operations and laundry/shower operations
384                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (2) Subsistence: Field feeding operations and subsistence supply management
   (3) Petroleum/Water: Petroleum & water supply operations, petroleum laboratory testing, petroleum storage, water
purification and water storage
   d. History and background. The Quartermaster Corps traces its origins to 16 June 1775. From 1818 to 1860, then
Quartermaster General Brigadier General Thomas Sidney Jessup, the “Father of the Quartermaster Corps,” instituted an
improved system of property accountability and experimented with new modes of transportation, including canal boats
in the east, camel caravans in the desert southwest and early railroads. During the Civil War, Quartermasters purchased
clothing, equipment, animals and services at an unprecedented pace. In 1862, the Quartermaster Department assumed
responsibility for burial of war dead and care of national cemeteries. In 1912 Congress consolidated the former
Subsistence, Pay and Quartermaster Departments in order to create the Quartermaster Corps as we know it today. It
became a fully militarized organization with its own units trained to perform a host of supply and service functions on
the battlefield. With this consolidation came the missions of subsistence and food service. When the Army began
purchasing motorized vehicles, as early as 1903, the Quartermaster Corps assumed the new petroleum supply mission.
During World War I, the modern era witnessed the first use of specialized Quartermaster units in France including
laundry, bath, salvage depots and port operations. During World War II, the Quartermaster Corps operated on a scale
unparalleled in history, with theaters of operation in the Mediterranean, northern Europe, the Pacific, and even the
China-Burma-India Theater and Bataan, Leyte, Salerno, Normandy, and Bastogne. At the height of the war, Quarter-
masters were providing over 70,000 different supply items, more that 24 million meals each day, and recovered and
buried nearly a quarter of a million Soldiers in temporary cemeteries around the world. We can expect that in the future
Quartermaster Soldiers will continue to uphold the regimental motto of “Supporting Victory.”
35–20. Quartermaster officer characteristics required
Unique knowledge and skills of a Quartermaster officer. Lieutenants gained by the Quartermaster Corps develop
functional branch skills for the first three to 4 years of their career. Quartermaster officers possess one AOC (92A) and
may be trained in one of the following three SIs: petroleum and water/SI R8, aerial delivery and materiel/SI R9, and
mortuary affairs/SI 4V all of which are open to male and female officers. Quartermaster officers upon successful
completion of the CLC3 are inducted into the Logistics Corps. AOC 90A becomes their primary AOC with a
secondary AOC of 92A (90A92). See paragraph 35–4 for an in-depth explanation of Logistics branch officers. These
officers maintain their Quartermaster Regimental Affiliation, and may continue to serve in Quartermaster functional
assignments throughout their career.
   a. Quartermaster, Supply and Materiel Management (AOC 92A). Officers command, directs, plans and implements
materiel management and integration into the overall DOD logistics system. They are responsible for service support
functions including, but not limited to, graves registration, clothing and textile renovation, laundry and bath and aerial
delivery. They direct and supervise the collection, evacuation and accountability for all classes of supply classified as
salvage, surplus, abandoned or uneconomically repairable. As a staff officer, they advise commanders on matters
regarding supply and services support as well as unit capabilities. They develop and execute materiel management
programs, to include inventory control and distribution throughout the logistics system. Officers determine and plan
storage requirements for field and permanent depot activities.
   b. Petroleum and Water (SI R8). Officers attending the Petroleum Officer Course (POC) may command, direct, plan,
and/or exercise staff responsibility for units engaged in petroleum and/or water operations. Officers direct the acquisi-
tion, storage, inspection, testing, issue, and distribution of petroleum products, and water. They serve in staff positions
requiring petroleum and water experience.
   (1) They determine requirements for bulk and packaged petroleum products and water, storage space, distribution
systems, and quality surveillance. Officers recommend locations; direct the operations and user maintenance for
petroleum and water pipelines, hose-line routes, terminals, supply points, and depots. They advise commanders on
water and bulk petroleum distribution system design. Officers plan, coordinate, and supervises loading and discharge of
oceangoing tankers and other petroleum vessels. They direct quality surveillance at point of procurement and through-
out the petroleum distribution system. They direct the operations of base or mobile laboratories in testing of petroleum
products. Officers supervises performance of standard physical and CM tests, evaluate test results to insure products
meet Federal and military specifications, and recommends disposition of off-specification or captured petroleum
products.
   (2) Officers determine water requirements, establish and direct operation of water purification, storage, distribution,
and issue systems in support of field operations. They develop, direct, and coordinate water conservation programs
when appropriate. They develop, direct, and coordinate unit procedures and programs on the environmentally sound
handling of petroleum, wastewater, and water treatment CMs. Officers monitor waste disposal procedures for waste
produced by unit petroleum and water operations. They report all unit petroleum, wastewater, and water treatment CM
spills in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies. Officers monitor unit spill containment and clean-
up operations.
   c. Aerial Delivery and Materiel (SI R9). Officers attending the Aerial Delivery Materials Officer Course may
command, direct, plan, and/or manage units engaged in storage, packing, preparation, and delivery of materiel by air
drop means. Officers determine requirements for and plan the employment of aerial delivery systems in support of
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             385

tactical and special operations. They command, direct, supervise, and train personnel engaged in the storage, packing,
and preparation of materiel for aerial delivery distribution. They plan and supervise the inspection, repair, testing,
packing, rigging, and storage of parachutes, allied assemblies, aerial delivery containers, airdrop kits, and cargo
parachutes. They advise and assist in the coordination of transportation requirements to include recovery of airdrop
equipment.
   d. Mortuary Affairs (SI 4V). Officers attending the Mortuary Affairs Officer Course may direct, plan, and coordi-
nate MA support for military operations and civil mass fatality operations. Officers are involved in recovery, tentative
identification, and evacuation of deceased U.S. military personnel.
35–21. Quartermaster officer development
   a. Officer professional development model. The officer PDM is focused on the range and quality of experience,
rather than specific gates or assignments required to progress. The PDM shows a flexible timeline whereby the officer
is developed through PME, functional training, operational assignments, and broadening opportunities. In addition,
each officer is responsible for his or her own self-development, and the mentorship of their subordinates throughout
their career. Officers are encouraged to develop a personal 5 year plan, and discuss their goals with a mentor and their
assignment officer at HRC. Use the Army Career Tracker to assist officers communicating with mentors, as well as
providing useful links to their PDM and career development information. Quartermaster officers grow through
experience to understand mission command sustainment systems, distribution management, and become effective
logisticians in support of unified actions essential to retaining and exploiting the initiative and achieving decisive and
sustainable land operations.
   (1) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain experience and exposure to mission
command systems in support of unified action partners such as joint, governmental, nongovernmental, private sector
and multinational organizations.
   (2) Leader development is a continuous and progressive process, spanning an officer’s entire career, consisting of
institutional training, operational assignments and self-development. Officer training begins in the generating force in
schools and training centers where they are introduced to fundamental skills and tasks that will prepare them to
integrate and contribute effectively to a unit’s collective capabilities on the first day they arrive into a unit. However,
most leader development occurs during operational assignments where the officer gains baseline knowledge of mission
capability at the individual, crew, unit, staff and leader level. Operational assignments build on the fundamental skills,
knowledge and behaviors developed in institutional training. Officers develop through challenging, unfamiliar experi-
ences that require them to adapt theory to reality. They learn from mistakes, learn to take risks and experiment with
non-textbook solutions to problems. Officers return to PME from operational assignments to gain skills, knowledge and
techniques required in their for their next duty assignment and for higher levels of responsibility.
   (3) Officers learn and fill the gaps in understanding through self-development. Self-development is as important as
institutional training and experiential assignments. Self-development is a personal responsibility to seek out opportuni-
ties to develop individual strength and address gaps in skills and knowledge. Officers must be completely honest in
their self-assessment and take appropriate steps to develop their capabilities which enhance qualifications for current
positions or helps an officer for future responsibilities. Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military
education, provides critical opportunities to develop functional, joint and expeditionary competencies.
   (4) Quartermaster officers are inducted into the Logistics Branch upon graduation from the CLC3. Subsequently,
they are assigned to both multifunctional logistics assignments and Quartermaster functional assignments.
   (5) Quartermaster officers serve in every BCT and separate brigade in the Army with duties all over the world.
Quartermaster officers are selected to serve in joint assignments, Advanced Civilian Schooling and Training With
Industry Programs.
   b. Quartermaster lieutenant development. All newly gained Quartermaster Corps officers are designated AOC 92A,
Quartermaster, Supply and Materiel Management. Selected officers receive additional entry-level training as a mortuary
affairs officer (SI 4V), petroleum and water officer, (SI R8) and/or aerial delivery and materiel officer (SI R9)/sling
load certification functional course.
   (1) Education. To prepare newly commissioned Quartermaster officers to meet the challenge of their duties,
lieutenants begin their formal PME with attendance of the Quartermaster BOLC. Quartermaster BOLC is conducted at
Fort Lee, VA. The course develops lieutenants into competent small-unit leaders with a common warfighting focus
while providing branch-specific functional training. This training prepares them for functional assignments as a platoon
leader capable of performing entry-level technical tasks in supply, distribution, materiel management, subsistence
management, general material management, petroleum and water operations, and field services.
   (2) Assignments. Upon completion of Quartermaster BOLC, lieutenants are normally assigned to company-level
units in order to gain leadership experience and to enhance technical and tactical competence. Lieutenants expect to
serve as a platoon leader, company executive officer, or staff officer at the battalion and brigade level to develop
leadership and technical skills.
   (3) Self-development. Every officer is responsible for his or her professional development. These initiatives focus on
maximizing leader strengths, minimizing weaknesses, and achieving individual leader development goals. Start with a
386                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

self-assessment. Ask for feedback from your experienced peers, commanders and leaders to assess your strengths and
weaknesses.
   (a) A critical component of the self-development domain is the MSAF tool. Although officers may take ample steps
to facilitate self-development, the MSAF program also referred to as 360 degree assessment helps officers raise self-
awareness and better shape their self-development efforts. The MSAF tool provides input from peers, superiors, and
subordinates which help the rated officer develop as a self-aware and adaptable leader.
   (b) Use the Army Career Tracker to review your PDM, to communicate with mentors, and review useful links to
career development information. Use this information to direct self-development efforts and rank actions for improving
performance and achieving maximum potential.
   (c) Self-development actions fall into three categories—immediate, near-term and long-range goals. Immediate goals
focus on correcting weaknesses and reinforcing strengths associated with your current assignment. Near-term goals
focus on developing those skills, knowledge, and attributes needed for your next operational assignment. Long-term
goals focus on preparing for more complex duties beyond your next operational assignment. Take initiative to attend
courses that support your developmental needs. Affiliate and participate in professional organizations. Quartermaster
lieutenants have the opportunity to attend career enhancing intuitional training such as Airborne (SI 5P), Ranger (SI 5R
or 5S), Air Assault (SI 2B), and Pathfinder (SI 5Q). Quartermaster officers must possess the airborne identifier prior to
attending the Aerial Delivery and Materiel Officer Course.
   (4) Desired experience. Lieutenants strive to become technical and tactical experts by training with warrant officers
and senior enlisted Soldiers in their units. Lieutenants learn the intricacies of how to best lead and take care of
Soldiers, to support their commands and function as quartermaster officers from their subordinates peers and supervi-
sors. Understanding the management of the distribution process, maintenance, and the use of automated logistics and
sustainment systems is the minimum expectation. Before promotion to captain, lieutenants possess an expert knowledge
of the purpose, mission, and core competencies of the Quartermaster Corps and have basic knowledge of other logistics
competencies achieved through practical experience in multifunctional sustainment operations.

                                     Figure 35–11. AA Quartermaster officer development
35–22. Warrant officer development
   a. Unique knowledge and skills of a Quartermaster warrant officer. Quartermaster warrant officers are expert
technicians and war fighters who are technically proficient able to manage and maintain Army property accounting
systems, supply accounting systems, material distribution systems, aerial support systems, food service programs, and
petroleum/water systems. They are self-aware and adaptive Quartermaster technical experts, leaders, trainers, and
advisors who must maintain the proper balance between their technical skills and the ability to understand and apply
appropriate tactical skills at the right moment. Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and
education, Quartermaster warrant officers administer, manage, maintain, operate, and integrate Quartermaster systems
and equipment across all levels within the Army. Quartermaster warrant officers are innovative integrators of emerging
logistical technologies, dynamic teachers, confident warfighters, and developers of specialized teams of Soldiers.

surveillance throughout the petroleum distribution system. Recommend location of petroleum pipeline routes, terminals,
supply points, and depots; advises on bulk petroleum distribution system design. Report unit petroleum spills per
applicable laws, regulations, and policies.
   c. Warrant officer development model. The warrant officer PDM is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a Warrior Ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) WO1/CW2. Throughout a warrant officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain operational assignment
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              389

experience. The warrant officers should continue their self-development, professional reading and pursuit of education
goals.
   (3) CW3/CW4. At this point in a warrant officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain a broaden
understanding of their AOC/MOS. Nominative assignment should be sought. Warrant officers should continue their
self-development, professional reading and pursuit of the next civilian education goals.
   (4) CW5. Capstone achievement for all MOSs. Once a warrant officer has reached the pinnacle grade, they should
strive to obtain training and assignments that will give them the additional skills necessary to become premier technical
experts. This training and assignments are often outside of normal Ordnance positions, and are nominative or JIIM in
nature. Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Flexible time lines enable warrant officers to serve longer in developmental
assignments ensuring warrant officers have adequate time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness
and cohesion.
   d. WO1 development. The warrant officers must meet certain professional developmental standards in terms of
schooling and operational assignments to evolve to a well-rounded senior warrant officer within their specialty.
Meeting these standards ensures the warrant officer has acquired the skills, knowledge, and attributes to remain
proficient in their specialty and serve at entry levels within the Army. For a warrant officer to be considered fully
trained in the Quartermaster branch, he/she should be tactically and technically proficient, be physically fit, and be of
the highest moral and ethical character. Recognizing that various assignments require different strengths, techniques,
and backgrounds, a warrant officer’s most important assignment is the current one and therefore should focus on an
outstanding performance in that job assignment. Quartermaster branch requires warrant officers to be skilled techni-
cians in their specialty. Every warrant officer learns and trains to be a well-rounded logistician while gaining expertise
in their specialty through progressive levels of assignments. All Quartermaster warrant officer MOSs are open to male
and female Soldiers. Quartermaster warrant officer life-cycle development and utilization are listed at figure 35–14 for
MOSs 920A, 920B, 921A, 922A, and 923A.
   (1) Education. Quartermaster WO1s must continue their professional development and remain competitive for
promotion to CW2. WO1s must successfully complete the Quartermaster WOBC. The WOBC provides functional
training in Quartermaster MOSs 920A, 920B, 921A, 922A, and 923A and reinforces leadership training while further
developing technical skills. Upon successful completion of WOBC, the warrant officer is certified in their MOS and
given an initial operational assignment commensurate with their rank. WO1s should begin work on the prerequisite
course for the WOAC Army nonresident Action Officer Development Course. This is an MOS-immaterial course
administered by the Distributive Education Section of the WOCC. Successful completion of this course is a require-
ment prior to attendance to the resident Quartermaster WOAC.
   (2) Assignment. WO1s can expect junior level assignments within their specialty which are typically at the brigade
level. These assignments give the junior Quartermaster warrant officer a solid base of experience, depth, and breadth
on systems and processes that ultimately prepares them for assignments at the sustainment brigade and higher levels.
   (3) Self-development. Self-development should include correspondence courses, institutional training, and civilian
education. The WO1s should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden both their warfighting
perspective and technical comprehension. Civilian education objectives should include working towards obtaining an
associate’s degree. WO1s who do not possess an associate degree are strongly encouraged to pursue this educational
goal.
   (4) Desired experience. WO1s are entry-level warrant officers who should possess basic level tactical and technical
experience. Successive functional expertise will be gained with progressive assignments within their specialty.
   e. CW2 development.
   (1) Education. Quartermaster CW2s must continue their professional development and remain competitive for
promotion to CW3. Upon promotion to CW2, the warrant officer will be eligible to attend the resident Quartermaster
WOAC. Completion of WOAC should be completed no later than 1 year after promotion to CW3. Prior to attendance
and enrollment in ATRRS for WOAC, warrant officers must complete the mandatory nonresident “Action Officer
Development Course.” This is an MOS-immaterial course administered by the Distributive Education Section of the
WOCC.
   (2) Developmental and broadening assignments. CW2s can generally expect assignments at the sustainment brigade
level. These assignments give the junior Quartermaster warrant officer a solid base of experience, depth, and breadth
on systems and processes that ultimately prepares them for assignments at the sustainment and higher levels.
   (a) Typical 920A assignments include: property accounting technician; TAC.
   (b) Typical 920B assignments include: supply systems technician; materiel manager (brigade support operations/
SUS brigade); TAC officer.

390                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

or functional courses offered by the U.S. Army Quartermaster School (USAQMS). CW2s should devote time to a
professional reading program to broaden both their warfighting perspective and technical comprehension. Civilian
education objectives should include work towards obtaining a baccalaureate degree in a logistics-related field (such as
logistics or business management). CW2s who do not possess a baccalaureate degree are strongly encouraged to pursue
this educational goal.
   (4) Desired experience. Junior level warrant officers are expected to begin mastering the basics of their particular
functional MOS. Successive functional expertise will be gained with progressive assignments within their specialty.
   f. CW3 development.
   (1) Education. Quartermaster CW3s must continue their professional development and remain competitive for
promotion to CW4. Upon selection to or promotion to CW3, the warrant officer will be eligible to attend the WOSC.
The WOSC is an MOS-immaterial course conducted by the WOCC. Completion of the WOSC is a professional
development requirement and should be completed no later than 1 year after promotion to CW4. Within completion of
WOSC, Quartermaster warrant officers are required to attend the Quartermaster WOSC (follow-on) course at the
Technical Logistics College, Fort Lee, Virginia. The Quartermaster WOSC follow-on course is designed to provide
technical training at the high tactical and lower operational level.

broaden both their warfighting perspective and technical comprehension. Civilian education objectives should include
working towards completing a baccalaureate degree in a logistics-related field (such as logistics or business manage-
ment). The CW3s who have not completed a baccalaureate degree are strongly encouraged to complete this educational
goal. CW3s who have a sound educational background and a proven record of outstanding duty performance in their
MOS may apply for a fully funded advance degree in a discipline directly related to their specialty. The degree
completion program is highly competitive and selection is based upon demonstrated performance and potential for
promotion. Many Quartermaster warrant officers are also selected to attend the TLog Planners Program at ALU, where
advanced degrees in procurement and logistics management can be obtained through ALU’s Cooperative Degree
                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           391

Program with the Florida Institute of Technology. Quartermaster Warrant Officers can also participate in fellowships
and the Training With Industry program. The Training With Industry program provides a warrant officer an opportu-
nity to spend up to 12 months with a civilian industry that provides training in industrial procedures and practices. The
training is designed to enhance knowledge, experience, and perspectives in management and operational techniques.
The Training With Industry program is very competitive and requires the warrant officer to coordinate with the

   (4) Self-development. Self-development opportunities include completing logistics-related courses offered by the
ALU or functional courses offered by the USAQMS. The CW4s should devote time to a professional reading program
to broaden both their warfighting perspective and technical comprehension. Civilian education objectives should
include working towards completing a master’s degree in a logistics-related field (such as logistics or business
management). The CW4s who have not completed a baccalaureate degree are strongly encouraged to complete this
educational goal. CW4s who have a sound educational background and a proven record of outstanding duty perform-
ance in their MOS may apply for a fully funded advance degree in a discipline directly related to their specialty. The
degree completion program is highly competitive and selection is based on demonstrated performance and potential for
promotion. Many Quartermaster warrant officers are also selected to attend the TLog Planners Program at ALU, where
advanced degrees in procurement and logistics management can be obtained through ALU’s Cooperative Degree
Program with the Florida Institute of Technology. Quartermaster warrant officers also have the opportunity to
participate in fellowships and the Training With Industry Program. The Training With Industry program provides
warrant officers an opportunity to spend up to 12 months with a civilian industry that provides training in industrial
procedures and practices. The training is designed to enhance knowledge, experience, and perspectives in management
and operational techniques. The Training With Industry program is very competitive and requires the warrant officers
to coordinate with the Quartermaster warrant officer career assignment officer at the HRC.
   (5) Desired experience. The CW4s serve as senior technical and tactical experts who are expected to perform their
primary technical and MOS-immaterial duties at various levels within the Army.
   h. CW5 development.

   (4) Self-development. The CW5s will serve as the senior Quartermaster technical advisor and accordingly, the
officer must be able to communicate effectively on each of the five Quartermaster warrant officer specialties.
   (5) Desired experience. Quartermaster CW5s are master-level, tactical and technical experts who should expect to
serve in ACOM or higher-level positions. The CW5s provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to
NCOs, warrant officers, and branch officers. CW5s have special mentorship responsibilities for other warrant officers
at all levels and specialties and provide essential advice to commanders on Quartermaster technical and warrant officer
issues. The CW5s should sharpen their knowledge of personnel force integration functions for doctrine, training and
personnel as pertains to Quartermaster functions. In addition, CW5s should become familiar with the constitutional,
statutory, and regulatory basis for the force projection Army and the capabilities that must be sustained through
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                         393

management of doctrinal, organizational, and materiel change; become familiar with Army organizational roles,
function, and missions, especially at the ACOM and Army secretariat/staff levels; and with the force management
processes, from the determination of force requirements through researching of requirements and the assessment of
their utilization in order to accomplish Army functions and missions in a joint/combined environment.
                                Figure 35–12. AA Quartermaster warrant officer development
35–23. Reserve Component officers
   a. General.
   (1) RC Quartermaster officer qualifications and development closely parallel those of their AA counterparts. Life-
cycle development and utilization also parallel the AA. The increase of RC mobilization and deployments requires the
RC officer to train at the appropriate level. This is necessary in order to acquire those skills required for commanding,
training, and managing RC organizations for peacetime operation as well as mobilization. RC officers must realize that
a large portion of their education and training is accomplished on their own time in accordance with their units’ duty
assignments. A variety of correspondence courses are available as well as a full range of PME courses that they may
attend as a resident student. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation of tactical and technical expertise through
assignments in the Quartermaster branch before induction into the Logistics branch at the rank of captain.
   (2) The RC Quartermaster officers serve the same role and mission as their AA counterparts. The unique nature of
their role as a “citizen Soldier” poses a challenge to their professional development. However, RC officers’ profes-
sional development and qualifications parallel those of their AA counterparts as closely as possible, except as noted
below. The two primary exceptions are RC officers spend more time in developmental positions and have more time to
complete mandatory educational requirements. Refer to paragraphs below for detailed description of RC officers’
career management and development.
   b. Active Guard Reserve.
   (1) In accordance with 10 USC 101(16), the term “Active Guard and Reserve” is a member of a RC who is on
394                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

active duty pursuant to 10 USC 12310, or 32 USC sections 502(f) and 709(a). AGR Quartermaster officers serve in
full-time, AA positions in worldwide locations. They provide day-to-day operational support needed to ensure RC units
are ready to mobilize when needed. AGR officers perform administrative and training duties in direct support of the
ARNG, USAR, and AA. The primary objective of the AGR officer is to enable a greater level of readiness, agility, and
responsiveness of the RC. To meet this mission, they must not only become expert in logistics, but also become experts
in the RC’s administrative, training, and managements systems. To meet both requirements, AGR officers should seek
a balanced amount of time at tactical, operational, and strategic levels within the operational and generating forces. RC
force structure and mission limit the number of traditional KD positions available for Logistics AGR officers;
therefore, to compensate for the lack of KD positions, AGR officers should seek to develop management and
leadership skills through branch immaterial and broadening assignments. Although AGR officers are encouraged to
seek command whenever possible, most officers will never command above company level. RC lieutenant colonels and
colonels should compete for battalion and brigade command when a command board is held. To develop leadership
experience, AGR officers should seek KD positions when available and other senior staff positions of large TPUs or
mobilization day (M–Day) organizations (example: sustainment brigades, ESCs, RSGs, RSCs, SSCs, or divisions).
   (2) The career path for AGR officers is to seek a balance of generating and operating force assignments that prepare
them to be competent and strategic leaders at the senior ranks. AGR officers should not serve in more than one
consecutive assignment in a generating force organization before being assigned to an operational assignment. The
needs of the RC and force structure may hinder the objective to achieve a balance between operational and generating
force assignments. Homesteading (over 4 years) in the same command or region is highly discouraged.
   (3) Professional development considerations. The officer PDM is the foundation for developmental assignments, but
AGR officers in many cases will not have the opportunity to follow the officer PDM.
   c. Logistics branch qualification and development. RC officers are inducted or appointed into the Logistics branch
upon completion of the RC CCC or CLC3. Officers hold 90A as their primary AOC and a secondary AOC of 92A.
This applies to the following officers: AGR, TPU, M–Day, IMA, and IRR. There are no lieutenants (nor non-CCC
graduates) in the Logistics branch. Even though RC officer development is challenged by geographical considerations
and time constraints, each officer should strive for Logistics branch developmental assignments and educational
opportunities that yield the same opportunities as their AC counterparts.
   d. RC officers must meet certain standards in terms of PME and operational assignments to be proficient in the
Logistics branch at each grade, but due to geographical, time available, and civilian employment constraints, officers
may find it challenging. Nevertheless, RC officers are expected to complete PME and advanced schooling require-
ments. They need to aggressively seek operating and generating force assignments to remain proficient as a Logistics
officer.
   e. Lieutenant development.
   (1) Education. The initial development of a Quartermaster officer include establishment of basic leadership skills in
the areas of communication, management, technical and tactical knowledge and troop-leading experience. Officers
must complete Quartermaster BOLC within 2 years of initial appointment or completion of college if commissioned
early.
   (2) Assignments. Typical assignment positions may include, but are not limited to, platoon leader, supply and
service officer or company executive officer. The professional development objective for this phase is platoon leader
assignment. If there is a limited leadership opportunity available within the Quartermaster competencies in an officer’s
initial assignment, the officer should strive to seek to increase logistics knowledge within the Transportation or
Ordnance competencies and pursue a Quartermaster-related position when available as a follow-on assignment.
Lieutenants should strive to become technical and tactical experts by training with warrant officers and senior enlisted
Soldiers in their units. Within 2 years of consideration for promotion to captain, RC officers should enroll and begin
the RC CCC (Quartermaster) and continue to hone troop-leading procedures. Because all initial assignments are
important, an officer should be primarily concerned with manner of performance, development of professional attrib-
utes, enthusiasm for the job and demonstration of potential. Before promotion to captain, officers should posses an
excellent knowledge of Quartermaster competencies and have basic knowledge of other logistics competencies.
   (3) National Guard. Due to the Title 32 requirements to be federally recognized in a branch, the National Guard may
consider all captain 90A-coded positions as FA positions. This allows for lieutenants to be promoted to captain at the
appropriate time and not be hindered by the extended time for completion of RC CCC.
   f. Captain development. (See para 35–6.)
   g. Major development. (See para 35–6.)
   h. Lieutenant colonel development. (See para 35–6.)
   i. Colonel development. (See para 35–6.)
   j. Branch transfer. Officers who wish to branch transfer at the rank of captain through major must transfer into the
Logistics branch. Officers who wish to hold a Quartermaster AOC within the Logistics Branch must take the
Quartermaster Branch Qualification Course, and or complete Support Operations Course, both are available online on
the Army Distributed Learning Web site.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             395

   k. Reserve Component warrant officer education. Military education requirements for RC Quartermaster warrant
officers are shown in figure 35–14, and coincide with the AC.
   (1) ARNG warrant officers complete the WOAC prior to promotion to CW3. Army Reserve warrant officers not
listed on the active duty promotion list must complete the WOAC prior to selection to CW3.
   (2) ARNG warrant officers must complete WOSC follow-on prior to promotion to CW4. Army Reserve warrant
officers must complete WOSC follow-on prior to selection to CW4.
   (3) ARNG warrant officers must complete WOSSC follow-on prior to promotion to CW5. Army Reserve warrant
officers must complete WOSSC follow-on prior to promotion to CW5.
   l. Reserve Component warrant officer development. The RC warrant officer development objectives and qualifica-
tions basically parallel those planned for their AA counterparts. Junior warrant officers must develop a strong
foundation through assignment in their branch. Even though geographical considerations limit some RC warrant
officers, all should strive for Quartermaster assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as their AA
counterparts. The RC life-cycle development model for Quartermaster warrant officers is at figure 35–12.
Chapter 36
Adjutant General Branch
36–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. The purpose of the AG Branch is to provide manpower, HR and music support to commanders at all
echelons to enhance the readiness and operational capabilities of the total force and ensure success across the full
spectrum of military operations. AG branch is an accession branch that is aligned with the force sustainment functional
category. AG officers manage functions from the HR life-cycle that include personnel procurement, training, profes-
sional development, distribution, sustainment, retirement or separation, to help ensure a quality force and direct the use
of Army bands to support friendly forces at home and abroad.
   b. Proponent information. Proponent for the AG’s Branch is the Commandant, Adjutant General School (Personnel
and Leader Development Division), 10000 Hampton Parkway, Fort Jackson, SC 29207–7025. Personnel developers can
be reached at 803–751–8445 or DSN 734–8445.
   c. Functions. HR support includes 4 core competencies and 13 key functions (FM 1–0). These competencies are
unique and directly ensure Army readiness. HR support is an element of personnel services and is aligned under the
sustainment warfighting function as described in ADP 3–0 and 4–0. The four core competencies are:
   (1) Man the Force—consists of all functions and tasks that affect the personnel aspects of building combat power of
an organization. This includes the key functions Personnel Readiness Management (PRM), Personnel Accountability,
Strength Reporting, Retention Operations, and Personnel Information Management (PIM).
   (2) Provide HR services—HR services are those functions conducted by HR professionals that specifically impact
Soldiers and organizations and include the key functions of Essential Personnel Services (EPS), Postal Operations and
Casualty Operations.
   (3) Coordinate personnel support—these functions normally require coordination by DCS, G–1/AG and S1s and
generally fall under their responsibility. The functions include Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR), command
interest programs (CIP) and Army music.
   (4) Conduct HR planning and operations—are the means by which HR leaders envision a desired HR end state in
support of the operational commander’s mission requirements. Operation of HR mission command includes establish-
ing, operating and maintaining connectivity to HR data and voice communications nodes needed for HR operations
across all commands and echelons.
36–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for the 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army
Values and the Warrior Ethos, competent in their core competencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the
spectrum of conflict. AG Corps officers manage the Army’s most important resource—its people. They must possess
the necessary technical and operational expertise to advise commanders on the human dimension of readiness in
decisive action. They must be able to comprehend and integrate the organization, structure and doctrine of the Army as
it evolves in the face of rapidly changing situations. They employ automated HR systems and common software
applications in order to manage present requirements, prepare for near-term developments and forecast future require-
ments. They must be able to operate in JIIM environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving
their objectives. Our officers must embrace the role of the Adjutant as the trusted agent of the commander, be
culturally astute and able to use their awareness and understanding to conduct operations innovatively and
courageously to exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the operational environment. Further
explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in ADP 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this publication.
396                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   b. Unique knowledge and skills of an AG officer. AG officers must comprehend the organization, structure, and
doctrine of the warfighting Army as it evolves. In addition, they must:
   (1) Exhibit capacity and capability to understand, articulate, and solve complex concepts.
   (2) Possess the necessary technical and operational expertise in order to advise the commander and staff on the
human dimension of readiness within the operational and sustainment constructs in support of unified land operations.
   (3) Must possess the highest standards of discretion, integrity, and professional ethics.
   (4) Possess good interpersonal and communications skills (verbal and written).
   (5) Apply decision-making theory in military organizations to optimize the MDMP.
   (6) Think creatively and apply critical reasoning skills to logically sequence events and think in terms of cause and
effect.
   (7) Must understand, manage, and use automated HR systems and common software applications.
   (8) Continually improve their understanding of areas of the Sustainment community beyond HR support.
   (9) Band officers (42C and 420C) must have advanced knowledge of musical performance, conducting techniques,
contemporary entertainment media, military ceremonial practices and extensive training in music styles and practices.
   c. Areas of concentration. Duty positions associated in the AG Branch require thoroughly trained and properly
developed officers to provide the knowledge of military HR operations, its systems, relationships, and interfaces. The
AG officer may serve in one of the AOCs or skills described below:
   (1) Human Resources Officer (AOC 42B) identifies company grade HR officers.
   (2) Army Band Officer (AOC 42C) identifies all Army band company and field grade officers.
   (3) Senior Human Resources Officer (AOC 42H) identifies non-band field grade HR officers.
   (4) Human Resources Technician (MOS 420A) identifies HR warrant officers of all grades.
   (5) Bandmaster (MOS 420C) identifies Army band warrant officers.
   (6) Postal Operations (SI 4J). Officers who hold this SI formulate policies for and direct the activities of units
engaged in postal operations. Individuals must complete the Joint Service Postal Operations Course and/or the Postal
Supervisor’s Course. This SI is only awarded to HR officers.
   d. Training line of effort. The training an officer conducts throughout a career profession is an essential element of
leader development. The training line of effort is divided into home station (individual/collective training), CTC-like
exercises to include command post exercises, mission rehersal exercises, and Warfighters and the experience of training
development itself. An officer should actively seek out opportunities to experience a CTC-like training event that
stresses a unit collectively with integrated external observer controllers providing professional after action reviews.
Additionally, field grade and senior warrant officers should actively pursue multi-tiered training events above brigade
level with integrated observer controllers sourced from the Mission Command Training Programs. In addition, all AG
commissioned and warrant officers must ensure they remain proficient as part of an integrated Sustainment Warfighting
function and actively seek opportunities to broaden their knowledge of all sustainment functions to include attendance
at functional training courses and exposure to multifunctional sustainment units through home station sustainment
support. Finally, it is expected that all AG officers are proficient in the eight-step training model, planning training in
company training meetings and master the ability to plan, prepare, execute and assess training.
36–3. Commissioned officer development
   a. Officer development model. The officer development model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress. The goal of the AG Corps is to ensure
officers at each level are aware of and have an opportunity to serve in positions that develop AG core competencies;
build experience across multiple career paths; and expand an individual’s capabilities and understanding gained through
serving in different organizational cultures. This is achieved by placing the officer in a combination of KD jobs, post-
KD jobs that are regarded as highly desired by the Corps and additional broadening jobs as defined in previous
chapters.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop Warrior Ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation at the 4th or 7th year develops both specific and broad functional competencies.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive for training and assignments
that will broaden and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These broadening opportunities are
outside one’s normal branch or FA career development, and are JIIM in nature.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force - regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, etc.
   (6) Flexible timelines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   (7) Highly desired positions are determined by the AG proponent and indicate which jobs best develop an AG
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             397

officer’s skills beyond the core competencies and sets them upon a career path within the three major focuses of the
AG Corps: S1, Sustainment and Institutional Army.
   (8) All HR officers should seek membership and certification in HR associations like the Society of Human
Resource Management or the International Public Management Association for Human Resources.
   (9) A select group of AG officers will have the opportunity to serve as functional experts in organizations providing
HR support as part of the integrated sustainment warfighting function. They will be given specific opportunities as part
of their development to broaden in positions within the sustainment community beyond their basic branch skills. This
will provide officers with exceptional potential the necessary training and experience to be competitive for multifunc-
tional command opportunities. For further guidance refer to chapter 34.
   b. Lieutenant development.
   (1) Education. AG Lieutenants will attend the AG BOLC after their commission. Band (42C) lieutenants attend the

   (4) Self-development. Captains should expand their knowledge of battalion, brigade, and combined arms operations
and include the sustainment warfighting function, HR planning and support operations, HR policies and procedures,
and communication and leadership skills.
   (5) Desired experience. Company grade officers must serve as a battalion or brigade S1 for 12 to 24 months with a
target of 18 months, followed by serving in a variety of jobs across the spectrum that develops AG core competencies
in three major areas: S1, Sustainment and the Institutional Army. The intent is that each HR officer have a common
reference point in their career as the primary HR staff agent and principal advisor on the human dimension for a
commander and become practiced in the Art of HR delivery. The focus is on expanding their experience and skills and
seeking greater levels of responsibility to prepare for promotion to major. Officers should pursue a graduate degree
within an HR discipline to study the human dimension of our Army or information systems or technology to enhance
and develop our HR automation capabilities.
   d. Major development.
   (1) Education. Majors must complete ILE requirements and become JPME I qualified. RC majors should attend the
398                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

resident Human Resources Management Qualification Course prior to assignment as an S1. Officers may also attend
other HR functional training such as the brigade S1 or HR plans and operations courses and sustainment functional
training such as the support operations or TLOG planner course.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. The following list of KD assignments applies to YG2000 or later AG officers.

include functional HR, branch generalist, and joint and multinational operations. Self-development may include
correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training. Officers should devote time to a professional
reading program to broaden their multifunctional, full spectrum operational perspective. Officers should pursue a
graduate degree and specialized programs such as Training With Industry or advanced civil schooling that produce
officers with highly specialized skills or knowledge that serve in utilization tours for the Army.
   (6) Desired experience. Majors must serve 12–24 months in a KD assignment with a target of 18 months. Majors
assume greater responsibility and should expand their knowledge of battalion and brigade operations to include division
and corps. The combination of KD, highly desired and broadening jobs differ by individual. Officers, mentors, senior
AG leaders and assignment officers must work together at this point in an officer’s timeline to strategically shape and
develop future leaders of the Corps. Their focus shifts to organizational leadership, managing HR processes, and
increased operational and strategic perspective.

sum of their skills, assignments, experience, and development should have prepared them for key and influential
positions. They should be the senior HR officer that mentors and ensures relevant and reliable HR support.
   g. Branch transfers. Officers that are approved for voluntary branch transfer to the AG Corps prior to attending the
CCC will attend the AGCCC. AC and RC officers who transfer in the rank of captain and above that have attended
another basic branch CCC must complete AG specific functional training prescribed by the AG Proponent in
coordination with the AG branch assignment officer. This may be either resident, through distance learning or a
combination and should be completed as soon as practical following the transfer. They must also successfully serve 12
months in an AG coded position at their rank.

36–4. Warrant officer development
   a. Warrant officer development model. AG Corps warrant officers are adaptive technical experts, leaders, trainers
and advisors. Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, they maintain, operate,
and integrate Army HR processes and systems to support the four core competencies and 13 key functions as outlined
in FM 1–0. The goal of the AG Corps is to ensure warrant officers at each level are aware of and have an opportunity
to serve in positions that develop AG core competencies, build experience across multiple career paths and expand an
individual’s capabilities and understanding gained through serving in different organizational cultures. This is achieved
by placing the warrant officer in a variety of developmental assignments that are regarded as highly desired by the
Corps. Throughout a warrant officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (1) Initial entry warrant officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop Warrior Ethos and gain
important leadership experience in the officer corps separate and distinct from previous experience as a NCO.
   (2) Warrant officer one/chief warrant officer two. Throughout a warrant officer’s career, the model highlights the
need to gain operational assignment experience. Warrant officers should continue their self-development, professional
reading and pursuit of military and civilian education goals.
   (3) Chief warrant officer three/chief warrant officer four. At this point in a warrant officer career, they should have a
full understaning of their MOS and should seek to expand their knowledge of the operational and strategic perspective.
Nominative and joint assignments should be sought. Warrant officers should continue their self-development, profes-
sional reading and pursuit of the next civilian education goals.
   (4) CW5 is the capstone achievement for the branch. They should strive to continue training and seeking assign-
ments that will give them the additional skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. This training and assignments
are outside one’s normal career path and are nominative or JIIM in nature. Lifelong learning, supported by both
civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop both joint and expeditionary competencies.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                               401

Flexible timelines enable warrant officers to serve longer in assignments ensuring warrant officers have adequate time
to gain skills and experience and also provide continuity to support unit readiness and cohesion.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by warrant officers in an
expeditionary force—regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
It is imperative that technical warrants maintain their currency in doctrine and the tactical implementation of HR
functions through training opportunities to include, but not limited to, rotations at National Training Centers, War-
fighters, Command Post Exercises and Mission Rehearsal Exercises.
   (6) All HR warrant officers should seek membership and certification in HR associations like the Society of Human
Resource Management or the International Public Management Association for Human Resources.
   b. WO1/CW2 (420A/420C) development.
   (1) Education: 420As WO1/CW2s will successfully complete the Warrant Officer BOLC and prerequisite studies for
the Warrant Officer Advance Course. 420Cs WO1/CW2s must successfully complete the Bandmaster BOLC.
   (2) Key developmental assignments:

of operations to include functional HR, branch generalist, and JIIM operations. Self-development may include corre-
spondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training. Warrant officers should devote time to a professional
reading program to broaden their multifunctional, full spectrum operational perspective. CW3s should complete a
baccalaurette degree before eligibility for promotion to CW4. Pursue specialized programs such as Training With
Industry or advanced civil schooling, certification in PHR and SPHR.
   (5) Desired experience: 420A and 420C CW3s will focus on expanding the breath and depth of their experience and
skills while seeking broadening assignments to prepare for CW4 positions.

36–5. Reserve Component officers
All of the preceding information applies equally to the RC, ARNG and USAR with the following listed exceptions. For
additional guidance on RC officer development see chapter 7 of this pamphlet. AGR officers serve a unique function
with the RC and consideration should be made to place the best-qualified officers in these critical positions. While
many organizations and force structures will place a TPU or M-day officer in the primary position, AGR commissioned
or warrant officers serving in a CMF coded 42 deputy role or other primary staff advisory position should be
considered to have fulfilled the same KD requirement in their career development.
   a. Lieutenant development. The BOLC is the starting point for newly accessed AG officers. RC officers must
complete the resident BOLC by the second year of service.
   b. Captain development. HR officers must complete either the resident CCC (AGCCC) or the four-phase AGCCC
for RC. This course includes two phases of nonresident instruction and two active duty for training phases at the U.S.
Army AG’s School. Officers who have completed an Officer Advanced Course/CCC in a different branch must still
complete either the AGCCC (RC) or the HRMQC to satisfy 42B position requirements.
   c. Major development. Officers should enroll in and complete ILE education (officers must complete the common
core curriculum for promotion to lieutenant colonel). Officers who have completed an Officer Advanced Course/CCC
in a different branch must complete the HRMQC to satisfy AOC 42H requirements.
   d. Lieutenant colonel development. Officers must complete ILE Common Core, should complete ILE, and seek PME
at the SSC level. Officers who have completed an Officer Advanced Course/CCC in a different branch must complete
the HRMQC to satisfy AOC 42H position requirements.
   e. Colonel development. Completion of ILE plus the advanced operations course is a requirement for consideration
for promotion to colonel and SSC.

Chapter 37
Financial Management Branch
37–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. Financial managers analyze the commander’s tasks and priorities to ensure that proper financial
resources are available to accomplish the mission and to provide recommendations to the commander on the best
allocation of available resources in order to achieve desired effects in support of unified land operations. Additionally,
Financial managers support operations by ensuring commanders have what they need to sustain and prolong operations
through support to the procurement process. Through properly sized modular Financial Management units or embedded
Financial Management cells, financial managers provide the right mix of Financial Management assets based on
mission, enemy, terrain, troops, time and civilians (FM 1–06) to support unified land operations.
   b. Proponent information. Proponent for the Financial Management Branch is the Commandant, U.S. Army Finan-
cial Management School (Proponency Division), 10000 Hampton Parkway, Fort Jackson, SC 29207–7050. Personnel
developers can be reached at 803–751–8679 or DSN 734–8679.
   c. Functions. Financial Management operations sustain the Army, joint, and combined operations by providing
timely commercial vendor and contractual payments, providing various pay and disbursing services, and implementing
Financial Management policies in support of unified land operations; analyzes the commander’s tasks and priorities,
identifies resource requirements that enables commanders to achieve desired effects in accomplishing the mission. The
financial manager is a critical sustainment enabler at all levels of Army, joint, and unified partner operations across the
full range of military operations to ensure the effective stewardship and accountability of financial resources.
37–2. Required officer characteristics
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
406                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for the 21st century. Financial Management officers recognize
that accomplishment of the mission and the welfare of Soldiers is the cornerstone of our Army. They must possess the
necessary technical and operational expertise to advise commanders on Financial Management operations and/or
resource management. They must be able to comprehend and integrate the organization, structure and doctrine of the
Army and Financial Management as it evolves in the face of rapidly changing situations. These leaders must be:
proficient in their core competencies; broad enough to operate throughout unified land operations; able to operate in
JIIM action environments and leverage Financial Management capabilities in achieving their objective; culturally astute
and able to use this awareness and understanding to exploit opportunities in the conduct of operations; and grounded in
Army Values and the Warrior Ethos. Responsiveness, improvisation, and economy are key principles that enable
officers to lead units to support an agile combat force and execute operations more swiftly than their opponents.
   (1) Responsiveness. Responsiveness is providing the right support at the right place, at the right time, and the ability
to foresee operational requirements. Responsiveness is identifying, acquiring, and distributing the assets, capabilities,
and information necessary to meet support requirements. Responsiveness is the ability to meet changing requirements
on short notice. Anticipating those requirements is critical to providing responsive financial support
   (2) Improvisation. It is the ability to adapt Financial Management sustainment operations to unexpected situations or
circumstances affecting a mission. It involves adapting and creating methods and strategies that account for an adaptive
enemy. Commanders apply operational art to visualize complex operations and understand what is required at the
tactical level and leverage those Financial Management capabilities that support the achievement of the desired
operational effects.
   (3) Economy. The ability to provide Financial Management sustainment resources along with other capabilities
effectively to enable commanders to generate the greatest effects possible. The commander achieves economy through
efficient management and discipline by prioritizing and allocating resources. Staffs look for ways to eliminate
redundancies and capitalize on joint interdependencies. They apply discipline in managing resources, minimizing
waste, and unnecessary stockpiling. Disciplined sustainment assures the greatest possible tactical endurance of the force
and constitutes an advantage to commanders who achieve economy of force. Staffs also achieve economy through
contracting operational support or using host nation resources that reduce or eliminate the use of limited military
resources. Economy reflects the reality of resource shortfalls, while recognizing the inevitable friction and uncertainty
of military operations. Economy enables strategic and operational reach.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of a Financial Management officer. For entry into the Financial Management
Branch, an officer should have a baccalaureate degree with a minimum of six academic (semester) hours of accounting
or finance. Degrees specializing in finance, accounting, banking, business, economics, mathematics, computer sciences
or information systems are most beneficial in supporting the Financial Management Branch mission. Characteristics
required of all officers. has five core competencies: fund the force, banking and disbursing, accounting support and cost
management, pay support and management internal controls. To support these core competencies, Financial Manage-
ment officers must possess:
   (1) Fundamental skills in automated accounting systems that enable a financial manager to rapidly learn and
understand integrated Financial Management systems.
   (2) Basic proficiency of stand-alone and networked computers and practical experience with current business office
software.
   (3) The ability to articulate and put into operation Financial Management outputs to senior-level decision makers.
   (4) A knowledge base of the DOD military resource management process and manpower management.
   (5) Familiarity with generally accepted accounting principles.
   (6) Familiarity with mathematical functions and evolving Financial Management information systems.
   (7) Proficiency in the application of the military decision-making process.
   (8) An understanding of how to influence the funding cycle from Congress to local program budget advisory
councils (PBAC) at installations.
   c. Unique attributes.
   (1) Analytical. Financial managers at all levels will analyze financial and management reports, operational flow, and
performance management indicators to determine quality of mission support. Systematic and scientific thought
processes are the underpinning of successful Financial Management planning.
   (2) Financial managers maintain the highest standards of integrity, and professional ethics. They are trusted stewards
of public funds and are held pecuniarily liable for entrusted funds. Financial Managers must use critical/conceptual
thinking, and solve problems related to complex financial management issues.
   d. Branch transfer. AC officers may branch transfer into the Financial Management branch at the rank of captain if
they have less than 9 years of active Federal commissioned service (AR 614–100). The following rules apply for
request for transfer. The officer prepares a DA Form 4187 through command channels to HRC’s sustainment captain’s
career field manager requesting transfer to the Financial Management branch. Mailing address is: Commander, U. S.
Army Human Resources Command, Force Sustainment Division (AHRC–OPC–F), 1600 Spearhead Division Avenue,
Department 232, Fort Knox, KY 40122–5203.
   (1) The packet must include the reason for request and the officer’s choice for basic branch affiliation. Based on
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           407

branch overage and shortages the HRC Financial Management company grade assignments staff determines if there is a
valid requirement and if the officer’s skill sets support transfer. Upon acceptance into the Financial Management
branch, officers must complete the prerequisite training before the transition is complete. Captains who have not yet
attended a CCC must attend the Financial Management Captain’s Career Course (FMCCC).
   (2) Captains who have completed a non-FMCCC must complete the Financial Management Branch Qualification
Course (FMBQ).
   (3) Upon completion of PME, HRC awards the officer their regimental affiliation in Finance and then assigns the
officer to the Financial Management branch.
   (4) RC officers are eligible for transfer to the Financial Management branch from the rank of captain to lieutenant
colonel. See paragraph 37–5 for details.
   (5) Authority for final approval of voluntary branch transfer requests is vested in the director, Officer Personnel
Management Directorate, HRC, per AR 614–100.
   e. Voluntary Transfer Incentive Program. This program is primarily designed to allow officers to branch transfer.
The program supports the officer’s interests and balances the branches personnel requirement.
   (1) The program is available to AC officers only upon achieving first lieutenant (P) status through the rank of
lieutenant colonel. The officer must meet height, weight and Army Physical Fitness Test standards. They cannot have
UCMJ violations or pending adverse actions such as a general letter of reprimand or a referred OER.
   (2) Officers incur a 3 year ADSO if selected for a branch redesignation. Officers with existing ADSO are eligible to
compete but have their additional 3-year obligation added to their existing ADSO.
   f. Required training. Finance officers must immediately begin training to meet the requirements for the mandated
DOD Financial Management certification program found at https://fmonline.ousdc.osd.mil/FMCertProgram/
TrainingGuides.aspx.
37–3. Officer development
   a. Officer development model. The officer lifecycle development and utilization model (fig 37–1) is focused more on
the quality and range of experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress. The model
focuses on both functional KD and broadening experiences. Continually providing the officer opportunities to gain new
skill sets and expand their mental development builds the officer’s functional capabilities. The model ensures an
officer’s experience is broadened, rather than aligned to a specific set of fixed gates or assignments required for
progression.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a Warrior Ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Officer assignments are based on Army requirements, professional development and the officer’s preference.
Each officer is responsible for developing their own five-year career plan. The Army Career Tracker was developed
and implemented to facilitate planning out one’s career with the advice of a mentor. The Army Career Tracker
provides a PDM that helps an officer lay out goals. Working with their mentors, officers develop career paths that meet
their professional desires, align with professional development timelines and meet their expectations of what the officer
views as a successful career. Working with your assignments officer at HRC is critical to an officer’s career
management. Mentors guide officers on the best way to manage one’s career. Actively participating in career
management decisions improves the likelihood of a rewarding and successful career.
   (4) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force environment—regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, and statesmanship.
   (5) Flexible timelines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience while also supporting unit readiness and cohesion.
   (6) All Financial Management officers should seek membership and certification in Financial Management associa-
tions like the Finance Corps Association and the American Society of Military Comptrollers.
   (7) Key development.
   (a) Officers serving in KD positions (minimum 12 months) will receive KD credit for deleted/discontinued KD
positions.
   (b) Key development 90A (Logisticians) opportunities are available to finance officers (captains to majors) to hold
key 90A (Logistics) development positions: company command for captains, executive officer and support operations
officer for majors. Finance officers need to complete the CLC3 in order to obtain the requisite training to be successful
at the mentioned 90A KD positions. For finance officers who completed a non-CLC3, they need to complete the
Support Operations Course and TLog Studies Program to meet the requisite training for the mentioned 90A KD
positions. Finance officers who successfully completed the 90A requisite training and 90A KD assignment as a captain
or major provide the opportunities to compete for command of multifunctional logistics units as a lieutenant colonel
(lieutenant colonel) and sustainment brigade command as a colonel. This applies to both AC and RCs.
   b. Broadening and development. The development model focuses on the need to broaden an officer’s knowledge,
408                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

skills and abilities at each grade. Opportunities to broaden an officer outside the realm of finance operations and
resource management are extremely valuable to their development by imbuing officers with a diverse portfolio of
talents and perspective. Experiences are specifically designed to develop an officer beyond a Financial Manager’s core
competencies. There are four primary experience-based fields that broaden Financial Management officers: functional-
multifunctional; academic; generating-industrial; JIIM. These opportunities occur both internal and external to the
Army. These opportunities challenge the officer mentally, take them well outside their core competencies and expand
their critical thinking thus enabling broadening to occur.
   (1) Broadening assignments develop an officer’s functional knowledge and critical thinking skills. At each grade,
there are opportunities and goals for broadening.
   (2) During the first 4 years of an officer’s career, the focus is on broadening functional basic branch technical and
tactical skills. Sharpening an officer’s understanding of the profession, gaining leadership experience in company grade
assignments and building expertise in their basic branch is the goal.
   (3) Officers attend the FMCCC generally at the 4-year mark. One of the primary goals of FMCCC is ensuring
officers have the required skills to successfully command Financial Management operations or serve in a resource
management position. After this opportunity, captains move to a broadening assignment that expands upon their
functional expertise or go outside their FA of expertise in which they previously served. Majors need to complete ILE
as early as possible and ensure they have the skill sets required for success in their KD assignment. For majors and
lieutenant colonels alike, broadening after KD assignments focuses on an officer’s greater understanding of both the
institutional and operational Army as well as the joint and interagency environments.
   (4) PME programs are institutional broadening opportunities. From the BOLC to SSC officers must complete these
courses on time or at the earliest opportunity. Officers should not be assigned to KD positions unless they have
completed their PME requirement for that rank. Some PME opportunities enable an officer to gain a masters degree.
Officers are strongly encouraged to take advantage of these opportunities.
   (5) Advanced civil schooling broadens an officer external to the Army and develops critical thinking, external
engagement skills and exposure to other organizational cultures. Officers cannot enter the Financial Management
branch without a bachelor’s degree. Finance officers are expected to complete a master’s degree prior to competing for
colonel. Online degrees at accredited institutions meet this requirement. Course of instruction with in-class or distance
learning instructors is preferred over strictly online master’s degree programs.
   (6) Competitive selection and attendance in an Advanced Civilian Schooling Program, selected internships, scholar-
ship programs or certain fellowship programs are the most desirable civil academic environments for broadening.
   (7) The Training With Industry Program, certain internships, fellowships, government and joint assignments provide
valuable civil-industry, joint, intergovernmental and unified experiences. Broadening in these areas expands the
officer’s knowledge and understanding of organizations and corporate cultures well outside traditional financial
management core competencies. The Training With Industry Program is a competitively selected work experience
program that provides extensive exposure to managerial techniques and industrial procedure within corporate America.
This experience broadens the officer’s critical thinking skills and knowledge of civil-enterprise systems and civil-
governmental operations. The training is not available through PME or the civilian educational system. The program
broadens the participant’s appreciation of financial management from a civil-industry point of view and is followed by
an appropriate utilization assignment. This program does not produce a degree. The participating industries for
financial management are the Armed Forces Bank, and Global Exchange Services. Others may also be available upon
request.

Judge Advocate General’s Corps
38–1. Unique features of The Judge Advocate General’s Corps
   a. Purpose. The mission of JAGC is to provide proactive legal support on all issues affecting the Army and the
Joint Force, and deliver quality legal services to Soldiers, retirees, and their Families. This legal support encompasses
the six core legal disciplines: administrative and civil law, military justice, international and operational law, contract
and fiscal law, legal assistance and claims.
   b. Proponent information. TJAG is the branch proponent of JAGC as administered through the Office of Personnel,
Plans, and Training at Office of The Judge Advocate General, 2200 Army Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310–2200.
   c. Functions. The JAGC is a special branch of the Army (10 USC 3064) whose duties and functions are discussed in
AR 27–1 and FM 1–04.
   (1) The JAGC consists of the following:
   (a) General officers serving as TJAG; the Deputy Judge Advocate General; Assistant Judge Advocate General for
Military Law and Operations (AJAG/MLO); the Commander, U.S. Army Legal Services Agency (USALSA); the
Commander, The Judge Advocate General’s Legal Center and School (TJAGLCS), Joint Chiefs of Staff Legal Counsel
when assigned from the U.S. Army JAGC, Chief Judge, U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals (RC), Assistant Judge
Advocate General for Military Law and Operations (RC), and Special Assistant to TJAG ARNG.
   (b) Commissioned officers with a PMOS 27A or 27B who are:
   1. In the AA and appointed in the JAGC; or
   2. Members of the USAR and assigned to the JAGC; or
   3. Members of the Army National Guard of the United States (ARNGUS) and assigned to the JAGC.
416                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (c) Warrant officers with PMOS 270A who are certified as legal administrators and are:
   1. In the AA and appointed in the JAGC; or
   2. Members of the USAR and assigned to the JAGC; or
   3. Members of the ARNGUS and assigned to the JAGC.
   (d) Enlisted Soldiers with the MOS 27D who are:
   1. In the RA and are assigned to the JAGC; or
   2. Members of the USAR and assigned to the JAGC; or
   3. Members of the ARNGUS and assigned to the JAGC.
   (e) Other members of the Army assigned to the JAGC.
   (2) TJAG is the military legal advisor to the Secretary of the Army and all officers and agencies of the Department
of the Army. Under TJAG’s authority to direct members of the JAGC in the performance of their duties (10 USC 3037
and AR 27–1) and to assign judge advocates UCMJ, Article 6, codified at 10 USC 806; AR 614–100), TJAG recruits,
selects, determines qualifications, assigns and provides legal education for members of the JAGC. TJAG assigns all
staff judge advocates (SJAs) and has final authority over all JAGC assignments. TJAG’s frequent inspection of military
legal offices in accordance with UCMJ, Article 6 (10 USC 806), offers a unique opportunity to mentor JAGC leaders
directly and to monitor how junior officers are developed. In the Office of The Judge Advocate General (OTJAG), the
Personnel, Plans, and Training Office (DAJA–PT) manages the JAGC under the supervision of TJAG, and represents
TJAG in all Judge Advocate personnel proponent matters in coordination with TJAGLCS. Personnel policies are
published annually by TJAG in publication JAG Pub 1–1.
   (3) Judge advocates are attorneys who perform their duties under commanders of their assigned or attached
commands or under other supervisory judge advocates, such as the SJA; Chief, Trial Judiciary; or the Chief, Trial
Defense Service (TDS).
   (a) The JAGC officers include judge advocates and warrant officer legal administrators in the AA, the USAR, and
the ARNGUS. All JAGC officers receive technical legal supervision from TJAG and from the SJAs of their higher
headquarters.
   (b) Only judge advocates assigned to the U.S. Army TDS, or made available as an individual defense counsel, may
provide advice and assistance to Soldiers suspected, accused or convicted of violations of the UCMJ on matters relating
to those violations or suspected violations.
   (4) Although judge advocates are U.S. Army officers and Soldiers first, they should primarily perform professional
legal duties for which they are extensively trained. They normally should not be assigned nonlegal duties, such as
officer of the day, inventory officer, range officer, FLIPL investigating officer, casualty notification officer, casualty
assistance officer, or other duties that would interfere with or pose a conflict of interest with their primary assigned
legal duties.
   (5) To ensure a diverse assignment pattern for judge advocates, TJAG is delegated waiver authority to the force
stabilization requirements.
   (6) TJAG ensures that the numbers of authorized JAGC billets, by grade, will be sufficient to meet TJAG’s statutory
responsibility to provide quality legal services to the Army. Officers desiring more information on the JAGC
authorizations or inventory should contact PP&TO, Office of The Judge Advocate General, 2200 Army Pentagon,
Washington, DC 20310–2200.
   (7) The JAGC branch consists of two AOCs with eight JAGC specific SIs and one warrant officer MOS. Judge
advocates are classified as either 27A (Judge Advocate) or 27B (Military Judge). The eight JAGC specific SIs are: 3D
(Government Contract Law Specialist), 3F (Patent Law Specialist), 3G (Claims/Litigation Specialist), 3N (International
Law Specialist), and 3I1, 3I2, 3I3, and 3I4 (Specialist in Military Justice). Warrant officers in the JAGC are officers
classified as 270A (Legal Administrators). These officers may also hold other ASIs.
   (8) In support of 3I1, 3I2, 3I3, and 3I4 (Specialist in Military Justice), the JAGC developed four separate graduated
SIs that allows the JAGC to better train and challenge judge advocates throughout their careers to improve their
military justice proficiency. In addition to establishing basic (and in some cases continuing) training requirements,
these SIs require progressive experience in military justice and litigation.
   (a) 3I1/Code 3I—Basic Military Justice Practitioner.
   (b) 3I2/Code 3M—Senior Military Justice Practitioner.
   (c) 3I3/Code 3P—Expert Military Justice Practitioner.
   (d) 3I4/Code 3T—Master Military Justice Practitioner.
38–2. Officer characteristics required (Active Army, U.S. Army Reserve, Army National Guard of the
United States)
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All judge advocates are expected to possess the base characteristics that
will enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders. They must be grounded in Army Values and the Warrior
Ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the range of military operations.
They must be able to operate in JIIM environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving their
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            417

objectives. Judge advocates must be culturally astute and able to use their awareness and understanding to conduct
operations innovatively and courageously to exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the operational
environment. Further explanation of these characteristics may be referenced in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this
publication. Judge advocates should leverage their training and educational background to help the command in
operational environments. The JAGC officers must be focused on leadership, not only within the legal offices, but also
the impact of legal operations on the command. Leadership training is required to be integrated into courses of
instruction at TJAGLCS. The JAGC officers must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide
at all times. Regardless of assignment, all JAGC officers must be deployable, with their units or as individuals, to
accomplish missions across the full range of military operations, from kinetic to counterinsurgency, to stability and
reconstruction. Judge advocates must prepare themselves and their Families for this challenging lifecycle function.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of a judge advocate. Judge advocates must have the education, training, and
experience equal or similar to that required of other members of the legal profession (10 USC 3065(e)) to include
receiving a juris doctorate from an American Bar Association accredited school law school. TJAG certifies that judge
advocates may practice law in the JAGC and this certification is required to maintain the appointment as a judge
advocate. Per AR 27–1, judge advocates must be admitted to practice and have membership in good standing (as
defined by the pertinent licensing authority) of the licensing authority of at least one jurisdiction. Attorney conduct is
bound by the state rules of conduct in the state in which the attorney is licensed to practice law and AR 27–26.
   (1) Judge advocates are required to maintain their good standing with their licensing authority and provide proof of
good standing when considered for primary zone of a promotion board or first time consideration for school selection
board.
   (2) Judge advocates must self-certify to TJAG their good standing status in odd numbered years.
   c. Unique requirements for judge advocates.
   (1) Judge advocates develop themselves through progressively challenging assignments and by continuing their
military and professional education.
   (2) Continuing professional education for judge advocates. All judge advocates participate in continuing legal
education throughout their careers. This training is required by many licensing states; it also keeps officers abreast of
current legal developments. Continuing legal education consists of training conducted by SJAs, military judges, and
regional and senior defense counsel; civilian training; and training provided at TJAGLCS. As judge advocates develop
professionally and become eligible for more senior assignments as military judges, SJAs, and deputy SJAs, they attend
specialized training, which is part of their overall professional development. Senior judge advocates may also be
offered the opportunity for specialized management training.
38–3. Active Army judge advocate development
   a. Officer development model. The judge advocate development model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress. See figure 38–1, below, for Judge
Advocate AA developmental model. All assignments are made in the best interests of the Army. The objective of the
JAGC career developmental model is to develop, employ, and retain broadly skilled judge advocates capable of
performing successfully in any core legal discipline, at any location, in roles appropriate for their grade. Broadly skilled
judge advocates provide the JAGC with officers capable of accomplishing today’s mission and succeeding in an
uncertain future. No single path to success exists in the JAGC. Sustained superior performance in a variety of
assignments that develop and display each officer’s broadly developed skills as an attorney, manager, and leader are
the guarantors of success. The JAGC also recognizes its obligation to distribute talented officers fairly throughout the
Corps: between TDA and TOE units, between CONUS and OCONUS commands, between the National Capital Region
and the field, and between instructors who educate the Army and the legal advisors supporting commanders in day-to-
day operations. The JAGC’s career development, assignment, schooling, and promotion practices reflect these
concerns.
   (1) Initial entry judge advocates gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a Warrior Ethos and gain
important leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an judge advocate’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Lifelong learning, supported by civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop joint
and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expeditionary force -
regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, and statesmanship.
   (4) Flexible time lines enable judge advocates to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring they have
adequate time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   (5) The goal is to maintain a healthy, upwardly mobile career path as broadly skilled judge advocates. Fair, candid,
and open personnel management is critical to meeting the JAGC’s mission. Personnel management will be effective
only when interest in professional development is shared among the JAGC leadership, supervisors, and individual
members of the corps.
   (6) Judge advocates will compete within their career field for promotion to all ranks.

                                    Figure 38–1. Active Army judge advocate career model
   b. Judge advocate career.
   (1) Becoming a judge advocate.
   (a) Applicants will continue to be accessed into the branch primarily by direct commissioning.
   (b) Applications for appointment as a judge advocate come primarily from law school students, Reserve Officer
Training Command (ROTC) officers attending law school on an educational delay, active members of the civilian bar,
and active duty commissioned officers seeking participation in the Funded Legal Education Program. On occasion,
officers transfer to the JAGC from other branches in the Army. To be appointed, a person must have earned a law
degree from a law school accredited by the American Bar Association and must be admitted to practice and have
membership in good standing (as defined by the pertinent bar) of at least one licensing authority.
   (c) Judge advocates commissioned directly from civilian life enter active duty as AA officers. They are awarded 18
months constructive credit for promotion for the time spent in law school. Officers who do not qualify for appointment
as captains are appointed as first lieutenants and are usually eligible for promotion to the rank of captain upon
completion of initial entry training.
   (d) The Funded Legal Education Program, authorized by 10 USC 2004 and AR 27–1, allows a small number of
active duty officers to attend law school at U.S. Government expense. The program is available to officers with not less
than 2 years or more than 6 years of total active Federal service at the time law school begins. Officers are detailed to
the JAGC but remain in their basic branch until later appointed in or assigned to the JAGC in the rank in which they
are serving.
   (2) Company grade development.
   (a) Education. The 12.5 week-long Judge Advocate Officer Basic Course (JAOBC/BOLC B) provides AC and RC
judge advocates receiving their original appointment into the JAGC with the basic orientation and training necessary to
perform their duties. The Fort Lee Phase of JAOBC/BOLC B serves to in-process judge advocates and augments
training in Soldier skills that judge advocates will receive at the Direct Commissioned Officer Course (DCC). The Fort
Lee Phase of JAOBC/BOLC B is approximately 2 weeks in length and is conducted at Fort Lee, Virginia. The Legal
Center and School (LCS) Phase of JAOBC/BOLC B stresses military law. It is 10 1/2 weeks in length and is
conducted at the LCS in Charlottesville, Virginia, immediately after completion of the Fort Lee Phase. All newly
assessed judge advocates and Funded Legal Education Program officers will complete JAOBC/BOLC B. Failure to
complete the course satisfactorily will result in return to basic branch, discharge, or other appropriate action. After
completing JAOBC/BOLC B, all officers will attend the six-week DCC course. DCC is designed to provide judge
advocates with Soldier and leadership training to instill the Warrior Ethos and build esprit de corps. DCC also provides
an environment where judge advocates will work and train alongside each other in a tactical field setting.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                           419

   (b) Assignment. Pre-graduate course assignments are KD milestones for new judge advocates. This initial assign-
ment is normally the time when judge advocates develop basic technical skills and learn about the Army. New judge
advocates are rotated through a variety of duties in many of the legal specialties in which judge advocates are expected
to practice. The first JAGC assignment is not normally in a state in which a judge advocate is licensed, attended law
school or performed on-the-job training (if a Funded Legal Education Program officer). These initial assignments may
include, but are not limited to, legal assistance officer, claims judge advocate, administrative law attorney, labor
counselor, contract/fiscal law attorney, operational law attorney, environmental law attorney, appellate attorney, Joint
Task Force judge advocate, Special Forces battalion judge advocate, trial counsel, and defense counsel. In these early
assignments, some judge advocates will have the opportunity to supervise other attorneys, Soldiers, and civilians. Most
judge advocates serve as defense counsel before the graduate course, although first assignment judge advocates are not
normally assigned to the U.S. Army TDS directly from initial entry training
   (c) Self-development.
   1. Judge advocate captains must continue to professionally grow as attorneys and as officers. This professional
growth includes attending continuing legal education within their licensing jurisdiction or at TJAGLCS to ensure judge
advocates grow academically. Judge advocates should attend applicable short courses at TJAGLCS to include the
Criminal Law Advocacy Course (CLAC), legal assistance courses, contract and fiscal law courses, and any other
course designed to assist the judge advocate’s current mission.
   2. Upon graduation from BOLC III, judge advocates are enrolled in the Judge Advocate Tactical Staff Officer
Course and complete the course within 24 months of enrollment. The Judge Advocate Tactical Staff Officer Course is
designed to familiarize judge advocates with the tactical staff officers’ skills necessary to function effectively as part of
a tactical-level staff. It consists of approximately 20 hours of online, self-paced instruction and includes eight lessons:
Army Doctrine, the Military Decision-Making Process, Symbology, Army Organizations, Intelligence Preparation of
the Battlefield, Joint Operations, Military Briefings, and BCT staff.
   3. Judge advocates should also dedicate time to professional reading to gain a historical perspective on tactical, legal
and leadership challenges.
   (d) Desired experience. Varied experience across all the core legal disciplines at diverse locations produces broadly
skilled judge advocates who can deploy in support of combat operations and provides judge advocates with a
foundation for the Judge Advocate Graduate Course.
   (3) Major development.
   (a) Education. The centerpiece of junior officer professional development is attendance at the 10-month Judge
Advocate Graduate Course. Judge advocates are selected to attend the Judge Advocate Graduate Course upon selection
for promotion to major or earlier if officers’ career time lines allow earlier attendance (senior captains). The Judge
Advocate Graduate Course educates career judge advocates in all areas of military law, legal communications, and
management. The course prepares officers for middle and senior grade positions and also provides an opportunity to
develop specialized knowledge and skills. The Judge Advocate Graduate Course is accredited by the American Bar
Association as a graduate legal education program and is statutorily empowered to award the only graduate law degree
(LL.M.) in military law in the United States. Officers incur a 2-year ADSO upon completion of the Graduate Course
and normally serve a 2-year utilization tour. The Judge Advocate Graduate Course fulfills the role of the CCC and the
Branch-Specific Intermediate Level Education (ILE) Qualification Course required of basic branch officers. The course
serves as the Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course portion of the MEL ILE requirement. Upon graduation
from the Graduate Course, judge advocates must complete ILE either in residence at Fort Leavenworth or at a satellite
location. After completion of the Graduate Course and ILE, judge advocates will be JPME I qualified. All judge
advocates must go before the ILE Advanced Operations Course selection board that convenes approximately 15 months
after the Judge Advocate Graduate Course and may compete in the ILE Advanced Operations Course selection board
the second and third year after the Judge Advocate Graduate Course. The board results from the Command and
General Staff College board determines which judge advocates will attend Command and General Staff College (in
residence at Fort Leavenworth). These board results also determine which judge advocates will have the opportunity to
attend advanced civil schooling to obtain a LL.M., based on the needs of the Army, in areas like constitutional,
criminal, tax or international law, health sciences or cyber-related issues. Selectees for Command and General Staff
College and civil schooling to obtain an LL.M. will then serve a two-year utilization tour. Major judge advocates not
attending Command and General Staff College and those selected for the LL.M program will attend ILE–Advanced
Operations Course short course at a satellite location.
   (b) Key, developmental, and broadening assignments. Following the graduate course, officers are assigned to field
grade positions. Some judge advocates partially specialize but continue to be generalists. Some focus on specific legal
disciplines such as military justice, or contract and fiscal law. Judge advocates also receive significant opportunities for
leadership and management. Judge advocate majors can expect to serve as brigade judge advocates at a brigade, senior
defense counsel, branch and division chiefs in large legal offices, deputy staff judge advocates, OICs of branch offices,
command judge advocates of non-GCMCA commands, instructors at TJAGLCS, Command and General Staff College
or at West Point, or as staff and trial attorneys in the litigating divisions in Washington, DC, other defense and U.S.
Government agencies, or in the OTJAG.
   (c) Self-development. Judge advocate majors must continue to professionally grow as attorneys and as officers. This
420                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

professional growth includes attending continuing legal education within their licensing jurisdiction or at TJAGLCS to
ensure the judge advocate grows academically. Majors should also dedicate time to professional reading to gain a
historical perspective on tactical, legal, and leadership challenges.
   (d) Desired experience. As a major in the JAGC, TJAG expects these officers to be the trusted command counsel at
a brigade, to be mid-level leaders, to attain higher levels of Army and JIIM legal expertise, to be practitioners in
specialized areas, and to be instructors at various DOD institutions.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel development.
   (a) Education. Senior lieutenant colonel judge advocates become eligible for selection to attend resident SSC or the
Army War College Distance Education Program. The JAGC has numerous officers attend the U.S. Army War College,
Industrial College of the Armed Forces, National War College, Naval War College and the Department of Justice
Fellowship each year.
   (b) Assignment. Lieutenant colonels have the opportunity to serve in more specialized assignments and in senior
leadership positions. Judge advocate lieutenant colonels have their first opportunity to serve as military judges, regional
defense counsel, or SJAs. They also serve as branch and division chiefs in the largest offices; the Office of the Judge
Advocate, U.S. Army Europe; or the National Capital Region.
   (c) Self-development. Judge advocate lieutenant colonels must continue to professionally grow as attorneys and as
officers. This professional growth includes attending continuing legal education within their licensing jurisdiction or at
TJAGLCS to ensure judge advocates grow academically. Lieutenant colonels should also dedicate time to professional
reading to gain a historical perspective on tactical, legal, operational and leadership challenges.
   (d) Desired experience. JAGC lieutenant colonels are assigned in highly complex practice areas and lead junior
judge advocates officers, enlisted paralegals and civilian paraprofessionals. Lieutenant colonels serve as advisors to
senior leaders and are exposed to the highest levels of DA, DOD, and the legislative processes.
   (5) Colonel development.
   (a) Education. Most colonels remain eligible for selection to attend resident SSC or the Army War College Distance
Education Program. The JAGC has numerous officers attend the U.S. Army War College, Industrial College of the
Armed Forces, National War College, Naval War College and the Department of Justice Fellowship each year.
   (b) Assignment. Judge advocate colonels are senior trial and appellate military judges; SJAs at major installations,
divisions, corps, ASCCs, ACOMs, DRUs, or combatant commands; division chiefs in the OTJAG and the USALSA,
and dean and center director at TJAGLCS.
   (c) Self-development. Judge advocate colonels must continue to professionally grow as attorneys and as officers.
This professional growth includes attending continuing legal education within their licensing jurisdiction or at
TJAGLCS to ensure judge advocates grow academically. Colonels should also dedicate time to professional reading to
gain a historical perspective on tactical, legal, operational and leadership challenges. Staff judge advocate positions
require MEL ILE and attendance at the Staff Judge Advocate Course at TJAGLCS. The MEL ILE is obtained by
completing an Army ILE course or equivalent. Lieutenant colonel SJAs and colonels serving as division and corps
SJAs will normally be assigned for a two-year tour. Colonels otherwise serving as SJAs will normally be assigned for a
two or three-year tour.
   (d) Desired experience. Colonels comprise the senior leadership of the JAGC and are the senior counsel to the
leaders of the Army and DOD. These senior judge advocates occupy leadership positions on division and higher
echelon staffs that require a thorough knowledge of strategy and the art and science of developing and using
instruments of national power. Current operations mandate our senior judge advocates who advise the Army’s senior
flag officers be thoroughly versed and familiar with strategic thinking. Judge advocates at all levels, from the Joint
Chiefs of Staff down through the brigade, assist in, advise on, and review the preparation and execution of plans
crucial to success in all operations. Legal expertise is listed as a necessary capability for military forces for the
successful execution of counterinsurgency operations (FM 3.24 Counterinsurgency).
   (6) Judge advocate positions. Assignments in CONUS are normally a maximum of 3 years; however, the need to
staff all legal offices properly and to develop the careers of all judge advocates effectively may require shorter or
longer tours. Tour lengths for OCONUS assignments are outlined in AR 614–30.
   (7) Joint assignments. After selection for promotion to major, judge advocates may be considered for joint duty
assignments in joint organizations worldwide, including the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Joint Staff,
and the combatant commands. Joint experience is important to the Army. Due to the limited number of joint
assignments available, judge advocates are not precluded from advancing into senior leadership positions because they
are not titled “Joint Qualified” (see 10 USC 619a(b)(3)(C)). Based on the breadth of JAGC assignments, from
lieutenant to colonel, judge advocates become masters of handling joint operations. Judge advocates serving in
nominative positions as either legal advisors or SJAs will normally be assigned for three-year tours.
   (8) TDS assignments. TDS assignments are considered a part of a normal career development in the JAGC. Judge
advocates will normally be assigned to TDS for 18 months. Regional defense counsel and senior defense counsel will
normally be assigned for a two-year tour.
   (9) Brigade judge advocates (BJA), Special Forces group judge advocates, and the Ranger Regiment judge advo-
cate. Majors assigned to a brigade operate under the command of a brigade commander and as part of a BCT staff with
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              421

whom they have a habitual relationship. The BCT includes a BJA, a trial counsel, and a senior paralegal NCO. The
BJA serves a critical role to providing expert and timely legal advice to brigade commanders and staff. Similarly,
group judge advocates and the Ranger Regiment judge advocate operate under the command of an O6 commander
while operating with a staff. The groups and the Ranger Regiment legal teams typically include a unit judge advocate
and a senior paralegal NCO. TCs are typically assigned to each battalion echelon in these 2 formations.
   (10) Military judges. Military judge positions require completion of the Military Judge Course at TJAGLCS and the
Judge Advocate Officer Graduate Course. Officers selected for military judge positions will be scheduled to attend the
next scheduled Military Judge Course, unless already certified as a military judge.
   (11) TJAGLCS. TJAGLCS is the home of the Regiment and is the cornerstone of the JAGC’s training, education,
and operational force management. Because the health of the JAGC is contingent on an intellectually vibrant institution
that is in touch with the field’s needs, the assignment of quality, experienced officers and NCO to the TJAGLCS
faculty and staff is a high priority.
   (12) Other assignments. Judge advocates may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated above.
These assignments may include duty with the Department of Justice, the Department of State, and the White House.
The range of possible assignments is large. Many of these assignments are characterized as highly responsible and
important, requiring mature, skilled and well-grounded officers. Assignments contained in subparagraphs 38–3a(5),
above, and this paragraph are collectively known as JIIM assignments. Judge advocates do not serve in branch/FA
(FA) generalist assignments.
   (13) Other Army training for judge advocates. Judge advocates are Soldiers, officers, and lawyers. They participate
in broad officer training programs including the BOLC, ILE, the Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course, and
SSC. JAGC officers are encouraged, and may volunteer to participate, as their primary legal mission schedule permits,
in their unit’s military training operations and in specialized training such as combat lifesaver, combatives, airborne and
air assault training. The purpose of participating in additional unit training or Soldier skills development, however, is to
provide judge advocates exposure to the Army’s missions and to enhance their primary role of advising commanders
on legal issues.
   (14) Advanced civilian schooling. TJAG selects a limited number of judge advocates annually to attend civilian
institutions for 1 year at Government expense to obtain advanced legal education in specialized areas. This schooling
supplements TJAGLCS graduate course training.
38–4. Warrant officer characteristics required (Active Army, U.S. Army Reserve, Army National Guard
of the United States)
   a. Unique knowledge and skills of legal administrators. As strategic and tactical planners, legal administrators
anticipate changes in the military climate, instituting changes to ensure the JAGC can support the Army’s continually
evolving missions.
   (1) Leadership role. Legal administrators must be highly motivated, possessing tact, initiative, integrity, and mature
judgment. Legal administrators are leaders, mentors, trainers, and technical and warfighting experts within their
organizations. Legal administrators serve as the Chief of the Administrative or Operations Division. Legal administra-
tors are principal members of the legal leadership team who take an active role in preparing, planning, and managing
military legal operations in garrison and operational environments.
   (2) Expertise. Legal administrators must have education, training, and experience in legal operations, HR budget,
security, project management, information and knowledge management, and the core legal disciplines (administrative
and civil law, international and operational law, claims, military justice, legal assistance, contract and fiscal law, and
legal assistance) and apply their knowledge and expertise in any environment. Legal administrators are the system
administrators and technical experts for all JAGC specific applications, hardware, and facilities. (See DA Pam 611–21
for additional information duties and responsibilities.)
   (a) Military justice. Legal administrators play a key role in assisting the SJA and the Chief of Military Justice with
managing and executing pre-trial processing, case management, production of expert witnesses, post-trial processing,
and budgets of courts martial.
   (b) Operational law. Legal administrators assist the SJA and chief of operational law with planning, organizing, and
executing office participation in contingency operations, including manning personnel documents, training all attorneys,
paralegal specialists and NCOs in the execution of operational law missions
   (c) Administration. In Staff Judge Advocate Offices, legal administrators serve as the Chief of the Administrative
Division. In this capacity, they supervise office personnel, manage HR, office budgets, facilities, and equipment
required to support legal services in garrison and deployed environments.
   (d) Information technology. Within information management systems, legal administrators are responsible for the
protection of attorney-client information. Legal administrators are also responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of
the electronic Judge Advocate Warfighter System and provide the primary training for judge advocates and paralegals
in hardware and software applications necessary for remote operations or deployment. Legal administrators are the
SJA’s operational law technologist.
422                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   b. Certification. TJAG certifies that legal administrators may perform legal administrator duties in the JAGC and
this certification is required to maintain the appointment with a PMOS 270A. See DA Pam 611–21.
38–5. Active Army legal administrator, warrant officer development
   a. Warrant officer development model. The legal administrator warrant officer development model is focused more
on the quality and range of experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress. See figure
38–2 for JAGC AA warrant officer development model. All assignments are made in the best interests of the Army.
The objective of the JAGC career developmental model is to build an expert, flexible force by balancing the needs of
the Army, professional development, personal and Family needs, and personal preferences in every assignment.
TJAG’s goals are to develop every warrant officer professionally, ensure diversity of assignments, and provide
opportunities for management, leadership and education. No single path to success exists in the JAGC. Sustained
superior performance in a variety of assignments that develop and display officers’ skills as Soldiers, managers, and
leaders are the guarantors of success. The JAGC relies on legal administrators as experts and systems managers for the
duration of their careers. Designed to provide career-long continuity to legal office operations, they may also serve in
key positions within the JAGC such as OTJAG, TJAGLCS, and USALSA. These additional assignments provide
opportunities for acquiring and developing additional skills in project and knowledge management, JAGC specific
software application development, force management, and training development.
   (1) Legal administrators are accessed from the JAGC enlisted corps (27D) through a board process. Soldiers serving
in MOS 27D with between 5 and 12 years of service who have excelled in a variety of JAGC positions are candidates
for accession. The Army’s goal is to access these Soldiers between 5 and 8 years of service to maximize the amount of
time they may serve prior to retirement. A waiver from the DCS, G–1 is required for Soldiers with a date of rank over
12 years.
   (2) After successful completion of the WOCS and before attendance at the Legal Administrator WOBC, WO1s are
assigned to staff judge advocate offices at their duty stations or first legal administrator assignments, where they are
paired with experienced legal administrators to help mentor individuals for WOBC and future duties as legal adminis-
trators (currently only available to AA warrant officers).
   b. Utilization.
   (1) Warrant officer one/chief warrant officer two. Should be utilized in operational assignments to develop and gain
valuable experience in operational management of legal offices. The first assignment should allow legal administrators
an opportunity to develop their technical skills and officer proficiencies. Legal administrators should continue their
self-development, professional reading and pursuit of educational goals.
   (2) Warrant officer three/chief warrant officer four. At this point in warrant officers’ careers, the model highlights
their need to gain a broader understanding of their MOS. Nominative assignments are sought at this development stage.
Warrant officers should continue their self-development, professional reading and pursuit of civilian educational goals.
Senior legal administrators should continue to be utilized in operational assignments and positions of greater responsi-
bility to continue to expand their knowledge and skills. Warrant officers at this development stage should seek
assignments that will increase their value to the JAGC and the Army. Legal administrators should continue their self-
development, professional reading, and pursuit of the next civilian educational goals. Senior legal administrators should
serve as role models and mentors for junior warrant officers by assisting them in developing their skills. Senior legal
administrators also develop more specific skills and experiences to qualify for senior positions.
   (3) Chief warrant officer five. Capstone achievement for all legal administrators. Once legal administrators attain
this rank they should be assigned to nominative or joint, interagency, intergovernmental, or special assignments.
Lifelong learning, supported by civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop joint and
expeditionary competencies. Master legal administrators should serve as role models and mentors for junior and senior
warrant officers, by assisting them in developing their skills. CW5s utilize all of their skills, abilities and talents at the
most challenging assignments. Flexible timelines enable master warrant officers to serve longer in developmental
assignments ensuring warrant officers have adequate time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness
and cohesion.
   c. Length of tour. Warrant officers will ordinarily complete the minimum months assigned on station as prescribed
in AR 614–30 before being reassigned; however mission requirements may require earlier departure from an assign-
ment. Reassignments are based on the need to maintain an OCONUS rotational base, satisfy requirements for special
qualifications, and provide for career progression.
   d. Promotion time line. RA WO1 is promoted to CW2 after 2 years in grade on the recommendation of the first
lieutenant colonel in the chain of command. All other warrant officers, CW2 through CW5, are normally considered for
promotion to the next higher rank by a DA promotion board, first below the zone after 3 years in grade and then in the
zone after 4 years in grade. DA publishes zones of consideration prior to each promotion board. Warrant officers, upon
promotion to CW2, are commissioned and appointed into the RA.
   e. Assignments. The Chief Warrant Officer of the Corps (CWOC) manages the assignments of AA legal administra-
tors in coordination with the JAGC’s PP&TO.
   f. Legal Administrators Course. All legal administrators (AA, USAR, and ARNG), should attend the annual Legal
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                                 423

Administrators Course which focuses on new developments in technical management and mid-level management of
Staff Judge Advocate office administration, operations, and support services.
   g. WO1 development.
   (1) Education.
   (a) Complete all prerequisite MOS related distance learning courses prior to attendance at the WOBC. For specific
course information, newly appointed WO1s should visit TJAGLCS’s Web page.
   (b) Must successfully complete the judge advocate WOBC. The WOBC is a 6-week resident course conducted at
TJAGCLS for all newly appointed WO1s (AA, USAR, and ARNG). All newly appointed WO1s must attend and
complete this six-week course and prerequisite studies that prepare the JAGC’s warrant officers for assignment as a
legal administrator. Upon completion, warrant officers are certified, per DA Pam 611–21, and awarded the MOS 270A,

38–6. Reserve Component judge advocate development
   a. General. Judge advocates serve in both the USAR and the ARNG. TJAG exercises technical supervision of
USAR JAGC officers not on the active duty list. PPTO assists TJAG by developing policy and providing technical
assistance in the career management of USAR judge advocate officers. TJAG, with the assistance of the National
Guard Special Advisor to TJAG, through the Chief, NGB, also provides technical assistance to the respective State AG
for the career management of ARNG judge advocates. In general, qualifications and professional development are
similar to AA judge advocates. All judge advocate assignments are made upon the recommendation of TJAG (Article
6, UCMJ, and 10 USC 806).
   b. RC judge advocate career development.
   (1) Professional development objectives are:
   (a) Develop officers with the professional attributes and capabilities to meet the mobilization and warfighting needs
of the Army, and in the case of ARNG judge advocates, to meet the additional civil and defense needs of the states and
territories.
   (b) Develop officers in the quantity and skill sets to meet the functional requirements of the Army in mobilization,
and in the case of ARNG judge advocates, to meet the additional requirements of the states and territories.
   (c) Develop officers with technical, managerial and administrative skills to serve in positions of increasing responsi-
bility in the JAGC.
   (2) Company grade development.
   (a) Assignments. Company grade judge advocate assignments allow officers an opportunity to learn to be military
lawyers, Soldiers, and officers. Company grade officers are exposed to a wide variety of experiences. The Army
understands that at the same time judge advocates are learning their military craft, they are engaged in a full-time
civilian career; however, high standards of Army participation and performance are still required.
   1. Company grade judge advocates are assigned to junior positions, including Operational Law (OPLAW) judge
advocate or trial counsel for a brigade, legal operations detachment team member or assistant team chief, defense
counsel, and various junior positions (legal assistance, administrative and civil law, trial counsel) within staff and
command judge advocate offices and sections. Judge advocates with less than 4 years experience will normally not be
assigned to positions where they are the sole or senior judge advocate.
   2. On rare occasions, company grade judge advocates are assigned to DIMA positions. Supervisors of DIMA judge
advocates should provide training in military legal requirements and exposure to Soldier experiences. When possible,
supervisory judge advocates should coordinate pairing up of new judge advocates with a platoon leader of a local line
unit for a 1 or 2-day orientation on life as a Soldier. Supervisors should counsel junior officers on their legal abilities,
Soldiering skills, and leadership. Junior DIMA judge advocates should occasionally drill, at least part of the year, with
a TPU in their home area.
   3. Non-JAGC assignments are generally discouraged for judge advocates; however, exceptions may be approved in
rare circumstances where the non-JAGC assignments may be beneficial to the JAGC and the individual judge advocate.
Such rare assignments must broaden the individual’s perspective concerning the mission of the Army and enhance a
judge advocate’s ability to perform at a higher-level position later in his or her career. TJAG approves all requests for
non-JAGC assignments, for a period not exceed 3 years.
   4. Company grade judge advocates should not be assigned to the IRR except in unusual circumstances. Appointment
of new judge advocates should be fixed to an authorization in a unit or a DIMA position. Company grade judge
advocates should avoid spending greater than 24 months in the IRR.
   (b) Education. The 12.5 week-long JAOBC/BOLC B provides AC and RC judge advocates receiving their original
appointment into the JAGC with the basic orientation and training necessary to perform their duties. The Fort Lee
Phase of JAOBC/BOLC B serves to in-process judge advocates and augments training in Soldier skills that judge
advocates will receive at the DCC. The Fort Lee Phase of JAOBC/BOLC B is approximately 2 weeks in length and is
conducted at Fort Lee, Virginia. The LCS Phase of JAOBC/BOLC B stresses military law. It is ten and one half weeks
in length and is conducted at the LCS in Charlottesville, Virginia, immediately after completion of the Fort Lee Phase.
All newly assessed judge advocates and Funded Legal Education Program officers will complete JAOBC/BOLC B.
Failure to complete the course satisfactorily will result in return to basic branch, discharge, or other appropriate action.
After completing JAOBC/BOLC B, all officers will attend the six-week DCC course. DCC is designed to provide
judge advocates with Soldier and leadership training designed to instill the Warrior Ethos and build esprit de corps.
DCC also provides an environment where judge advocates will work and train alongside each other in a tactical field
setting.
   (3) Major development.
   (a) Assignments. Judge advocates usually have at least 7 years commissioned service when promoted to major. This
rank is a mid-level grade with opportunities to supervise other judge advocates. Judge advocate majors should serve as
role models and mentors for junior judge advocates, assisting them in developing their skills. This career phase is also
426                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

a time to develop more specific skills and experiences to qualify for senior JAGC positions. RC JAGC majors should
seek assignments as division-level deputy SJAs, legal operations detachment team chiefs, brigade-level command judge
advocates, senior defense counsel, and GOCOM staff or command judge advocates or section chiefs. These assign-
ments should follow developmental unit or DIMA experiences relating to the type of law practiced by the unit.
   (b) Education.
   1. The JAGC Officer Advanced Course (JAOAC) is designed to provide a working knowledge of the duties and
responsibilities of field grade judge advocates. This course is the nonresident version of the Judge Advocate Graduate
Course. This course serves as branch qualification for officers to serve in field grade judge advocate positions.
Completion of the course is a prerequisite for promotion to Major. The JAOAC consists of 2 legal subject phases.
Phase I is a correspondence phase. Phase II is a 2-week resident phase taught at TJAGLCS. This course should be
taken between the second and fifth years of commissioned Service as a judge advocate.
   2. ILE is the means by which the Army ensures universal MEL ILE/JPME 1 qualification among Majors in the AA
and RCs to develop familiarity with employment of multiservice and multinational forces used in Joint and combined
arms operations; to develop basic knowledge of the joint operations planning process; and to create awareness of DOD
requirements as well as individual Service capabilities, problems and needs. While some RC judge advocates may be
selected to attend ILE in residence at Fort Leavenworth, KS, most will complete the requirement through a combina-
tion of distance education and two-week tours of active duty for training through TASS.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel development. Judge advocates usually have at least 14 years of commissioned service when
promoted to lieutenant colonel. This career phase is the beginning of senior-level assignments and performance
expectations. Lieutenant colonels possess the legal expertise, Soldier skills, and confidence to communicate effectively
with senior Army commanders. Lieutenant colonels serve as role models and mentors for junior judge advocates,
counseling and assisting them in developing their skills and careers. Lieutenant colonels compete for principal tenured
judge advocate positions, such as division SJA, GOCOM SJA (lieutenant colonel), regional defense counsel, or military
judge (lieutenant colonel). The degree to which a judge advocate is competitive for these assignments is a function of
prior developmental assignments and consistent performance as reflected on their evaluations. Developmental assign-
ments for division SJA and GOCOM SJA (lieutenant colonel) may include the following:
   (a) Unit officers. Deputy or section chief within an SJA office, legal operations detachment team chief, brigade-level
command judge advocate, regional defense counsel, and military judge (lieutenant colonel).
   (b) DIMA. SJA or deputy SJA and TJAGLCS professor or staff.
   (5) Colonel development.
   (a) Assignments. Judge advocates usually have at least 14 years of commissioned Service when promoted to colonel.
For the majority of judge advocates, this career phase is their most senior level of service to the Army. This career
phase is a period of full utilization of the officer’s talents, experience, and training. Colonels interact effectively with
senior Army commanders. Colonels lead, discipline, teach, and develop the field grade judge advocates under their
technical and command supervision. Colonels, through training and experience, have prepared themselves for maxi-
mum use of their skills, abilities and talents as GOCOM staff judge advocates, legal operations detachment command-
ers, state judge advocates, and senior military judges. TJAG approves all colonel assignments. Prior assignments that
offer the experience necessary to succeed at some of these assignments are listed below.
   1. To succeed as a GOCOM SJA or state judge advocate, officers should serve in the following:
   a. Unit officers. Division SJA, GOCOM SJA, legal operations detachment commander, or military judge.
   b. DIMA. GOCOM SJA (lieutenant colonel or colonel) or deputy SJA (lieutenant colonel), or TJAGLCS professor
or staff (lieutenant colonel).
   2. To succeed as an legal operations detachment commander, officers should serve in the following:
   a. Unit officers. Division SJA, GOCOM SJA, legal operations detachment section chief, or military judge.
   b. DIMA. GOCOM SJA or deputy SJA of a major command.
   3. To succeed as a senior military judge, officers should serve in the following:
   a. Unit officers. Military judge (lieutenant colonel), legal operations detachment commander, regional defense
counsel.
   b. DIMA. USACCA (lieutenant colonel or colonel), TDS (lieutenant colonel or colonel), or TJAGLCS instructor in
criminal law (lieutenant colonel or colonel).
   (b) Education.
   1. SSC. The Army War College is a SSC designed to prepare officers for duty as commanders and staff officers at
the highest echelons. The course is not a prerequisite for promotion, but enhances any officer’s ability to perform at the
highest level. The Army War College Distance Education Course is a two-year distance education program consisting
of home study and 2-week resident phases at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. Selection for this course is by a
centralized board convened by HRC. This course is the only distance education course that the Army recognizes as
MEL SSC producing. Completion of the course should occur between the 21st and 26th year of service.
   2. Continuing legal education. Each year TJAGLCS offers specialized continuing legal education courses at Charlot-
tesville, VA and at over 35 locations around the world. Taught by TJAGLCS faculty, these courses provide an essential
update in a particular field of law. RC judge advocates are required to attend this training to maintain their basic
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                              427

professional competence as military lawyers. Individuals may apply for TJAGLCS resident continuing legal education
training that varies in length from 3 days to 3 weeks. These courses provide practice oriented continuing legal
education for military attorneys. TJAGLCS also provides weekend, on-site continuing legal education training at 20
CONUS Army locations and at selected OCONUS Army sites. Judge advocates should attend at least one continuing
legal education course each year.
   (c) The Military Judge Course. The purpose of the Military Judge Course is to provide military attorneys with
advanced schooling to qualify them to perform duties as military judges at courts martial. This course is a 3-week
course taught at TJAGLCS. The Chief Trial Judge, U.S. Army Trial Judiciary, selects Army officers for attendance.
   (6) Career development model. See figure 38–3 for Reserve Component Judge Advocate career model.
                              Figure 38–3. Reserve Component judge advocate career model
38–7. Reserve Component legal administrator (warrant officers) development
   a. General. Legal administrators serve in the USAR and the ARNG. TJAG exercises technical supervision of USAR
JAGC warrant officers not on the active duty list. CWOC in coordination with PP&TO assists TJAG by developing
policy and providing technical assistance in the career management of USAR warrant officers. TJAG, with the
assistance of the National Guard Special Advisor to TJAG, through the Chief, NGB, also provides technical assistance
to the respective State AG for the career management of ARNG legal administrators. In general, qualifications and
professional development are similar to AA legal administrators (see para 38–5).
   b. RC legal administrator career development.
   (1) Professional development objectives are as follows:
   (a) Development of warrant officer legal administrators with the professional attributes and capabilities to meet the
mobilization and warfighting needs of the Army, and in the case of ARNG warrant officer legal administrators, to meet
the additional civil and defense needs of the states and territories.
428                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

   (b) Development of warrant officer legal administrators in the numbers and skills to meet the functional require-
ments of the Army in partial or total mobilization, and in the case of ARNG warrant officer legal administrators, to
meet the additional requirements of the states and territories.
   (c) Development of warrant officer legal administrators with technical, managerial and administrative skills to serve
in positions of increasing responsibility in the JAGC.
   (2) Utilization (see JAGC Warrant Officer (RC - AGR/TPU) life-cycle development and utilization model).
   (a) Warrant officer one/chief warrant officer two. Legal administrators are utilized in operational assignments to
develop and gain valuable experience in operational management of legal offices. Legal administrators should continue
their self-development, professional reading, and pursuit of educational goals. The first assignment provides legal
administrators an opportunity to develop their technical skills and officership development. The Army understands that
RC warrant officers are learning their military craft, while they are engaged in a full-time civilian career; however,
high standards of participation and performance are still required.
   (b) Chief warrant officer three/chief warrant officer four. Senior legal administrators continue to be utilized in
operational assignments and positions of greater responsibility to continue to expand their knowledge and skills. Senior
legal administrators seek assignments that will increase their value to the JAGC and the Army. Legal administrators
should continue their self-development, professional reading, and pursuit of the next civilian educational goals. Senior
legal administrators should serve as role models and mentors for junior warrant officers, by assisting them in
developing their skills. This career phase is also a time to develop more specific skills and experiences to qualify for
senior positions.
   (c) Chief warrant officer five. Capstone achievement for all legal administrators. Once legal administrators attain
this rank they should be assigned to nominative, joint, interagency, intergovernmental, or special assignments. Lifelong
learning, supported by civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop joint and expeditionary
competencies. Senior legal administrators should serve as role models and mentors for junior warrant officers, by
assisting them in developing their skills. At this career phase, CW5s are fully utilized through their highly developed
skills, abilities and talents at the most challenging assignments.
   c. Promotion time line. The USAR and ARNG legal administrators must complete all prerequisite levels of military
education applicable to legal administrators prior to selection to the next higher rank. For USAR warrant officer
promotions, see AR 135–55. Also, for USAR warrant officers (CW2–CW4) with a date of rank earlier than 1 January
2005, see Reference Memorandums, DAAR–HR, dated, 8 October 03, Subject: Army Reserve Warrant Officer

Chapter 39
Chaplain Corps
39–1. Unique features of Chaplain Corps
   a. Unique purpose of Chaplain Corps. The Chaplain Corps is a special branch of the Army whose mission is to
provide for the comprehensive religious support to the Army across the spectrum of operations.
   b. Unique functions performed by Chaplain Corps. Chaplains provide the religious, spiritual, moral and ethical
support to the Army in any contingency. As religious leaders, they provide the Army community the opportunity to
participate in worship and religious educational opportunities and to receive the pastoral care and spiritual enrichment it
seeks. Chaplains preserve and perpetuate the faith-based values that often serve as the bedrock of our units and
communities. As special staff officers, they coordinate religious support activities to support the commander’s opera-
tional plans and objectives in war and peace. Similarly, they provide commanders with professional advice on the
impact of religion on military operations.
   c. Unique features of work in Chaplain Corps. Chaplains serve on the personal and special staff of the commander
and assist in ensuring that the policies and leadership practices of the command are in keeping with strict moral, ethical
and humanitarian standards. The Chaplain advises the commander and staff on matters pertaining to religion, morals
and morale. The senior Chaplain assigned to a unit or headquarters is normally designated the Staff Chaplain or
Command Chaplain. The Chaplain is responsible to the commander for all chaplain related activities within the
command. The Staff Chaplain or Command Chaplain exercises staff and technical supervision of the activities of the
other Chaplains assigned to the headquarters or organization. He or she provides staff supervision for the activities of
Chaplains in subordinate commands and provides commanders and staff with advice, information, recommendations,
programming, funding data and plans concerning religious activities, morale, chaplain and chaplain assistant personnel
matters.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            431

   (1) The Chaplain branch encompasses two AOCs: Command and Unit Chaplain (56A); and Clinical Ministries
Supervisor (56D).
   (a) The Command and Unit Chaplain (56A) serves as a religious leader with staff functions for unit of assignment
and to units requiring area religious coverage. The duties of Chaplains are those, which normally pertain to the clergy
profession and those, which are prescribed by law, regulations and distinctive conditions and circumstances of the
Department of the Army.
   (b) The Clinical Ministries Supervisor (56D) applies to two types of supervisors who offer specialized supervision in
the areas of Clinical Pastoral Education and Approved Supervisors for Family Life Chaplaincy.
   (2) The Chaplain branch incorporates six SIs:
   (a) Chaplain Educator/Trainer in Ethics or World Religions (7E).
   (b) Chaplaincy Resources Manager (corps and installation) (7F).
   (c) Marriage and Family Specialist (7K).
   (d) Chaplaincy Resource Manager (HQDA, headquarters IMA, Region, ACOM, DRU, ASCC, USACHCS) (7M).
   (e) Hospital Ministries Chaplain (7R).
   (f) Combat Medical Ministry (7S).
39–2. Officer characteristics required
Chaplain officers are fully qualified members of the clergy of a religious faith group. Entry-level requirements are
established by public law, DODIs, and ARs. Chaplains are required to possess a baccalaureate degree of no less than
120 semester hours; have completed a master’s degree consisting of 72 semester hours (minimum) of graduate
professional study from an accredited institution in theology or approved subjects and be certified by a qualified
religious organization which has met all the administrative requirements established by the Armed Forces Chaplains
Board.
   a. Competencies and actions common to all. The Army must have officers who can understand what leadership is
and does. (For additional discussion of the definition of leadership, see ADP 6–22.) The enduring expression of Army
leadership has been BE–KNOW–DO. Army leadership begins with what the leader must “BE”-the values and attributes
that shape character. The knowledge that leaders should use in leadership is what Soldiers and Army Civilians
“KNOW”. Leaders cannot be effective until they apply what they know. What leaders “DO”, or leader actions, is
directly related to the influence they have on others and what is done.
   (1) Values. Values are at the core of everything the Army is and does. The Army is an institution of people with
unique and enduring values. These values must be a part of the men and women—officers, enlisted personnel and
civilians—who are the Army. These values provide the sense of purpose necessary to sustain our soldiers in combat
and help resolve ambiguities in operations other than war. Officers must establish and maintain an environment in the
Army where soldiers and civilians do what is right; where individuals treat each other as they should be treated; and,
where everyone can be all they can be. There are seven Army Values (leadership).
   (a) Loyalty. Bear true faith and allegiance to the U.S. Constitution, the Army, your unit and other Soldiers.
   (b) Duty. Fulfill your obligations.
   (c) Respect. Treat people as they should be treated.
   (d) Selfless-service. Put the welfare of the nation, the Army and your subordinates before your own.
   (e) Honor. Live up to all the Army Values.
   (f) Integrity. Do what is right, legally and morally.
   (g) Personal courage. Face fear, danger or adversity (physical or moral).
   (2) There are six Chaplain Corps attributes (SACRED).
   (a) Spirituality. Engage others to seek and explore their faith.
   (b) Accountability. Encourage individuals to make sound moral and ethical decisions.
   (c) Compassion. Love in word and deed.
   (d) Religious leadership. Influence others to live their faith.
   (e) Excellence. Motivate individuals to do their best in all aspects of life.
   (f) Diversity. Believe that our differences make us stronger.
   (3) Leader attributes. Attributes are fundamental qualities and characteristics. Attributes define what an officer
should be and guide leader actions. Army leader attributes are described in three categories—mental, physical, and
emotional.
   (a) Mental attributes describe aptitudes and capacities for learning that leaders should possess and develop. Included
in this category are will, self-discipline, initiative, judgment, confidence, intelligence and cultural awareness.
   (b) Physical attributes specify physical dispositions or aptitudes that can be nurtured and developed. Included in this
category are health fitness, physical fitness, stamina, military bearing and professional bearing.
   (c) Emotional attributes are those affective aptitudes or capacities that contribute to how one feels and substantially
contribute to leadership. Included in this category are self-control, balance, and stability.
   (4) Leader skills. Skills are synonymous with competencies. They are abilities or competencies that one develops
432                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

and uses with people, with ideas and with things. Competence is of primary importance for all Army officers. The
Army recognizes that officers must develop four types of skills.
   (a) Interpersonal skills reflect competence in communicating with people.
   (b) Conceptual skills refer to competence in handling ideas.
   (c) Technical skills reflect competence with things.
   (d) Tactical skills refer to the ability to put together technical, interpersonal, and conceptual skills and apply them to
warfighting tasks.
   (5) Leader actions. Officers provide purpose, direction and motivation as they influence their subordinates, operate
to accomplish their mission and strive to improve their unit or organization. Leader actions are how Army officers act
to achieve excellence and get the job done. These actions are applicable across all levels of leadership.
   (a) Influencing refers to the use of appropriate people skills to guide subordinates or teams toward mission
accomplishment. Influencing subdivides into communicating, decision-making and motivating.
   (b) Operating or accomplishing the mission refers to the relative short-term actions of getting the job done.
Operating divides into planning, executing and assessing.
   (c) Improving refers to the long-term investment-type actions essential to improving everything the leader influ-
ences. Improving subdivides into developing (people), building (teams) and learning.
   b. Unique skills. Chaplains must fully comprehend the organization, structure and doctrine of the warfighting Army
as it evolves in the 21st Century. In addition, they:
   (1) Plan and execute the Command Master Religious Plan in support of the unit’s mission.
   (2) Assess the impact of indigenous religious beliefs and practices on the unit’s mission.
   (3) Provide religious services of worship, including funerals and memorial services that occur in field and garrison.
   (4) Provide specific Essential Elements of Religious Services that normally take place apart from formal religious
services.
   (5) Provide ministry to marriages and families.
   (6) Offer pastoral care through counseling and advising.
   (7) Teach classes on moral leadership, suicide awareness and religious education.
   (8) Render pastoral care in a hospital setting.
   (9) Render pastoral care in a confinement facility.
   (10) Design and implement Unit Ministry Team training.
   (11) Provide religious education for doctrinal understanding and spiritual development.
   c. Unique knowledge. Chaplains must remain up-to-date on Army organization, structure and doctrine. They also:
   (1) Possess expert knowledge of distinctive faith groups in order to perform and provide for the religious needs of
the Army’s Soldiers and Families.
   (2) Remain current on developments in the civilian religious community for possible application to their area of
expertise.
   (3) Understand the elements of suicide awareness and prevention.
   (4) Know the characteristics of healthy marriage and family relationships.
   (5) Possess the knowledge of the dynamics of ethical decision-making.
   (6) Assess the religious needs, prepare the command master religious plan, implement and evaluate the command-
er’s religious program.
   (7) Understand cultural issues and advise leaders on religious implications.
   d. Unique attributes. Chaplains must possess the highest standards of discretion, integrity and professional ethics. In
addition, they will:
   (1) Provide religious support in a religiously pluralistic and diverse setting.
   (2) Ensure the free exercise of religion.
39–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
Chaplain professional development provides skills, knowledge and experience enabling them to provide religious,
spiritual and moral leadership and to perform staff officer functions in the Army. This is a comprehensive system that
assigns chaplains according to the needs of the Army, and identifies and provides the training required to prepare and
sustain chaplains for serving in these assignments.
   a. Branch qualification. Upon completion of Chaplain BOLC, chaplain officers are eligible for worldwide deploy-
ment in their specialty. There are no by grade standards for AC chaplains.
   b. Chaplain Officer Education System and branch development.
   (1) Newly commissioned chaplain. The Chaplain BOLC provides initial entry military training for newly commis-
sioned chaplains. Chaplain BOLC consists of 12 weeks of military training divided into four modules: Chaplain’s
Initial Military Training, Phase I (Staff Officer Introduction), Phase II (Pastoral Care Training), and Phase III (Ministry
in a Combat Environment). Chaplain BOLC builds on the professional ministerial knowledge and skills acquired in
                                              DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                             433

civilian institutions prior to commissioning as a chaplain. Chaplain BOLC equips chaplains with knowledge and skills
necessary to perform their duties as staff officers and to provide religious support at the battalion level. A non-
combatant course, Chaplain BOLC trains chaplains how to conduct or provide religious support in today’s multi-ethnic,
multi-cultural, religiously diverse and pluralistic Army, across the full spectrum of military operations.
   (2) Captain. Chaplain captains are normally assigned to battalions. They may also serve as hospital chaplains, and
confinement facility Chaplains. Chaplains attend their branch CCC to acquire professional development in the Officer
Education System. Captains selected for promotion are eligible to enroll in the ILE course, which further prepares them
to serve as staff officers at the Brigade and Division level of competency. A select number of chaplain captains will be
selected annually to attend Clinical Pastoral Education in order to prepare for ministry in the hospital setting.
   (3) Major.
   (a) Chaplain majors generally serve as brigade or group chaplains, assistant division chaplains, depot chaplains,
service school instructors (or staff), family life chaplains, hospital chaplains, installation chaplain resource managers,
installation chaplain training managers, and corps staff action officers.
   (b) All chaplain majors attend ILE in conjunction with the Chaplain Brigade Course and complete the program
within their first 2 years in grade.
   (c) Some chaplain majors will attend fully funded civilian schooling and Clinical Pastoral Education to prepare them
for chaplain assignments requiring additional skills. Such assignments include instructor in ethics, homiletics or world
religion; resource management; family life chaplain; or hospital chaplain ministry.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel.
   (a) Chaplain lieutenant colonels serve as division staff chaplains, HQDA, ACOM, DRU, ASCC, and region staff
action officers, installation staff chaplains, Clinical Pastoral Education and Family life supervisors, and hospital
chaplains.
   (b) A select number of chaplain lieutenant colonels and colonels will either attend SSC in residence, or complete it
through the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Program.
   (5) Colonel. Chaplain colonels serve primarily as corps, ACOM, DRU, and ASCC staff chaplains, CONUS Army
staff Chaplains, joint or unified command staff chaplains, installation staff chaplains, HQDA directors, Region, and
medical center staff chaplains. Army Reserve chaplain colonels serve at the USARC, operational, functional, training
and RSCs. ARNG chaplain colonels serve as Joint Force headquarters (formerly known as STARC) chaplains.
   c. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Chaplain officers do not normally serve in branch or FA
generalist (formerly branch immaterial) assignments. These assignments will be made only as an exception to policy.
   d. Joint assignments. Joint experience is important to the Army and valuable to the officers who serve in those
billets. Joint assignments for chaplains are limited and not required for advancement to senior leadership.
39–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
   a. Preferences. The chaplain branch has diverse assignment opportunities, which allow for varied career develop-
ment paths. The goal of the professional development of chaplain branch officers is to produce and sustain highly-
qualified clergy and staff officers. Assignments in the chaplain branch, which meet the needs of the Army, will be
made to develop the chaplain’s ability to achieve that goal. Requests from officers for assignments that do not
contribute to achieving that goal will likely be rejected.
   b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility on the
sequence of assignments. Some chaplain officer billets will be designated as requiring advanced education, either
military or civilian. Officers assigned to those jobs must complete the required courses prior to reporting to their duty
assignments.
   c. Reserve Component. RC assignments are managed on a volunteer and position vacancy basis under the guidance
of senior supervisory chaplains at all echelons. USAR AGR assignments are managed at HQDA, similar to the AC.
39–5. Duration of critical officer life-cycle assignments
Assignment duration. Most assignments for chaplain officers will be 24 to 36 months in length. OCONUS locations
will continue to require specific tour lengths.
39–6. Requirements, authorizations and inventory
   a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for chaplain officers.
   b. Officer Personnel Management System III implementation. The number of authorized chaplain billets, by grade,
will vary as force structure decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more
information on chaplain branch authorizations or inventory are encouraged to contact the branch office.
39–7. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for the Chaplain Corps
   a. Acquire. Direct commissioning is the primary means of accessioning chaplain officers.
   b. Develop. The chaplain branch provides a diversity of assignments and PME designed to equip chaplains to
perform and provide religious support in pluralistic and diverse contexts. The chaplain branch affords equitable
434                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

opportunities for chaplains to excel at their current level and to prepare for higher level of increased responsibility. As
chaplain officers progress through their careers, in addition to PME, they become eligible for advance civilian training,
which prepares them for specialized ministry positions (see fig 39–1).
   c. Utilize. The Chief of Chaplains (CCH), as proponent of the branch, manages all chaplain officer personnel
assignments. Chaplain officers serve at all echelons worldwide, from battalion to echelons above Corps. The goal of
the chaplain assignment process is to place the right chaplain with the right experience and skills in the right position at
the right time in order to provide the unit with the most effective and comprehensive religious support for the
operational context. Key principles of chaplain officer utilization are:
   (1) Pastoral—provide personal attention and pastoral consideration.
   (2) Equitable—provide transparency and equity for all chaplains in balancing professional development, personal
needs, and mission requirements.
   (3) Responsive—implement a flexible and agile system in anticipation of transforming Army personnel
requirements.
   d. Sustain. The chaplain branch provides the career opportunities in which chaplain officers fulfill their calling and
meaningful utilization of their abilities and competencies for ministry. The chaplain branch stresses the necessity of
continuing education and a strong relationship between the chaplain and his/her endorsing agent in order to maintain
professional qualifications for ministry. Chaplain branch officers must remain personally and professionally prepared to
serve in a variety of contexts in garrison or worldwide deployment. Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high
levels of readiness or fixed-site TDA organizations, all Chaplain Corps officers must be prepared to deploy with their
units or as IMAs to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of operations. to deter potential adversaries, to protect
national interests, or to support joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace
keeping missions. The chaplain branch expects chaplain officers must prepare themselves and their families for this
most challenging life-cycle function. The chaplain branch also expects supervisory chaplains to mentor subordinate
chaplains to maximize their strengths and competencies and to develop them for service at the next level.
   e. Promote. Chaplain officers compete at all grades for promotion within the chaplain branch, not against officers of
other branches. The chaplain branch follows DA policies and procedures to ensure fairness and equitability for
promotion, selection, and CCH Advisory Boards when selecting chaplain officers for promotion, key positions, and
specialized advanced civilian training, in order to identify those chaplains who demonstrate the potential to serve at a
higher level of responsibility and/or specialized area of ministry.
   f. Transition. The CCH is the approving authority for chaplain officer separations due to retirement or unqualified
resignation. Chaplain officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers. Chaplains can
retire with less than 20 years of active Federal service at age 62. The chaplain branch recognizes and appreciates the
honorable service of all chaplains, regardless of their length of service, and will provide responsive and respectful
transition to retirees and those who resign their commissions.
39–8. Chaplain Corps Reserve Component officers
The chaplain RC officer is an integral part of the Army chaplaincy. The RC, ARNG and USAR, provide one half of
the uniformed force structure in the Total Army Chaplaincy.
   a. General career development. Developmental patterns and objectives are the same for the RCs with the following
exceptions:
   (1) Chaplain candidates are RC officers of the chaplain branch with the 56X AOC designation. Chaplain candidates
are seminary students who are working to establish their academic and ecclesiastical credentials, in order to seek an
appointment as an Army chaplain. Their training includes the Chaplain BOLC, while providing ministry practicum
experiences and unit training. These ministry practicum include ministry at various installations, in Army medical
centers, and in the disciplinary barracks. Candidates can enter RC or AC chaplain assignments upon completing their
academic and ecclesiastical credentials and receiving an endorsement from their church bodies.
   (2) The Chaplain Officer Basic Course for Reserve chaplains is the same as the course provided to AC Army
chaplains. RC promotion to captain requires completion of all phases of Chaplain BOLC.
   b. Branch qualification and development opportunities. Even though RC officers are limited by geographical
considerations, they should strive for chaplain assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as their AC
counterparts. RC chaplains of all ranks (lieutenant through colonel) may serve in positions similar to AC (see fig
39–2).

Army Medical Department
40–1. The Army Medical Department description
The AMEDD is a special branch of the Army whose mission is to provide health services for the Army and, as
directed, for other agencies, organizations and military Services. Six separate officer Corps or branches provide the
leadership and professional expertise necessary to accomplish the broad Soldier support functions implicit to the
mission. Specific information on AMEDD officer professional and career development may be found in detail in DA
Pam 600–4.
40–2. Personnel management
The key to the distinctive personnel management system of the AMEDD is the six individual Corps, each with a
defined mission; some with missions provided for by statute. The separate nature of the many disciplines that combine
to make the total health care delivery system dictates some diversity in approach to the management of the personnel
within that system. The AMEDD capitalizes upon the diversity of its Corps and is committed to developing and
selecting the very best-qualified officers from its entire Corps for key leadership positions. The Surgeon General is
responsible for AMEDD officer career management within the general policies established by the DCS, G–1. The
Director of Personnel, Office of The Surgeon General, and the Commander, HRC manage AMEDD officers with the
advice and assistance of the six AMEDD Corps chiefs and professional consultants.

Chapter 41
Army Acquisition Corps
41–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. The Army Acquisition Corps is responsible for equipping and sustaining the world’s most capable,
powerful and respected Army. Our first responsibility is to the Soldier who protects and preserves our Nation. We
strive to meet the needs of the Soldier throughout the full spectrum of operations by incorporating technical solutions
to respond to the rapidly evolving threat environment. We ensure the production of quality capabilities, providing the
right product or service to the right place, at the right time to ensure the Army is equipped for the 21st century. Our
next responsibility is to our Partners—Army, Joint, industry, international, and academia. We work with these partners
to develop, acquire, deliver, sustain, and safely dispose of weapons systems and provide contracting services to our
Soldiers in all military operations. We work closely with our partners to continually improve Army capabilities and
ensure their interoperability. Our final responsibility is to the American public. We must be good stewards of the
taxpayers’ dollars and work to continuously achieve the highest levels of effectiveness and efficiency in our business
decisions while maintaining strict adherence to acquisition ethics policies, regulation, and laws. The Army Acquisition
Corps consists of commissioned officers, NCO and DA Civilians.
   b. Proponent information. The proponent for the AC and the USAR acquisition workforce is the U.S. Army
Acquisition Support Center (http://asc.army.mil). The proponent for the ARNG acquisition workforce is the ARNG
Acquisition Career Management Office. While each officer is his or her own best career manager, Army Acquisition
Corps officers are strongly encouraged to establish and maintain dialogue with the proponent for professional develop-
ment information as well as for opportunities that impact the Army Acquisition Corps. Officers are also encouraged to
maintain a dialogue with their respective assignment officer. Maintaining an open dialogue optimizes the opportunities
for enhanced professional development training, education, and experience.
   c. Functions. Unique functions performed by the Army acquisition workforce are based in statute and cannot be
performed by non-acquisition personnel. Applicable statute is contained in the Defense Acquisition Workforce Im-
provement Act (DAWIA), consisting of 10 USC Chapter 87 and further referenced in the DODI 5000 series. FA 51
officers effectively and efficiently develop, acquire, field, test and evaluate, sustain and safely dispose materiel by
leveraging domestic, organic, commercial and foreign technologies, and capabilities to meet the Army’s current and
future mission requirements. Acquisition officers are primarily responsible for the “M” domain in doctrine, organiza-
tion, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities.
   d. Career specialization. FA 51 officers are functional experts and are therefore required to develop expertise in an
AOC. After completing their initial acquisition training and reporting to their first assignment, officers should focus on
obtaining primary certification in one of two AOCs: Program Management (AOC A) or Contracting (AOC C).
Focusing on one of these two AOCs will provide the Army with the expertise needed to develop, acquire, deliver, and
sustain the systems and services needed for our 21st Century professional Army. FA 51 officers will become grounded
and skilled in one of these AOCs through multiple developmental and KD assignments. FA 51 officers’ ultimate goal
is to achieve DAWIA Level 3 certification in their primary AOC before promotion to lieutenant colonel. Officers can
strive for other experiences that lead to broadening assignments in their primary AOC. While Program Management
and Contracting are the two primary career tracks, acquisition officers can receive training, education, and experience
in other ACFs to which they are assigned. Certification must be obtained in accordance with current DOD certification
guidelines.
   (1) Program Management (AOC A) assignments focus on the management of materiel systems or services across all
phases of life-cycle management. The life-cycle includes: planning and refining the initial requirements; development
and maturation of technology through a disciplined engineering process; producing and deploying a materiel capability;
supporting a fielded capability in the operational force; and, ultimately, disposal. A system may include but is not
limited to weapon systems, individual equipment, aircraft and vehicle platforms, IT, and command and control
capabilities. A service may include but is not limited to portfolios related to installation, knowledge management,
medical, and logistics. FA 51 officers assigned to AOC A positions may perform program management; IT; test and
evaluation; and/or systems planning research, development, and engineering—science and technology management
related work. AOC A responsibilities include the Government’s management of program cost, schedule, performance,
risk, and test and evaluation. Other AOC A responsibilities include managing supply chains, and science and technol-
ogy projects. Officers coordinate with warfighters and TRADOC capability managers (the warfighter’s representative)
to determine requirements. Throughout the life-cycle, AOC A officers manage the efforts of the government and our
industry partners. A positions normally includes assignments in a PEO which is the Government organization responsi-
ble for managing Army systems. Other AOC A positions include developmental and operational test and evaluation
activities to ensure materiel solutions adequately address operational effectiveness, suitability, and safety criteria;
management of IT programs which are unique in their cost, schedule, and performance due to rapid changes in
technology; and science and technology program management that focuses on linking laboratories, academia and
Soldiers to determine technology-based solutions for challenges faced by warfighters.
   (2) Contracting (AOC C) assignments focus on officers leading teams that provide contracting support worldwide to
expeditionary operations throughout the entire spectrum of military operations. These officers will lead contingency
438                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

contracting teams, contracting efforts for installations, military construction, and weapon systems procurement. They
execute contract awards, manage contract administration, and provide industrial management/oversight at contractor
facilities worldwide. Officers coordinate the appropriate contracting action with the supported warfighter or program
manager to address requiring activity needs. These officers are responsible for making determinations on contract
awards and supporting the development of acquisition plans and instructions. Assignments with a contracting focus
may include contracting support to the warfighter; assisting contract support planning at all levels of Army operations,
systems and service contracting in major purchasing commands. Positions within AMC encompass the Army Contract-
ing Command, Expeditionary Contracting Command, and Life-Cycle Management Commands (LCMCs). Other AOC
C positions are at the PEOs and military construction in the USACE. Duties may include determining best contract
types and agreements, negotiating contract terms and conditions; obligating funds; awarding contracts; leading post
award actions; monitoring performance and production; providing contract surveillance; performing risk analysis; and
advising warfighters, program managers, and industry.
   (3) AOC Z. In some instances, acquisition officers may be assigned to positions that are coded 51Z. The Z is an
AOC but it is not a recognized ACF. It is a unique position designator to account for positions that are not focused on
either AOC A or C, and are filled by acquisition officers with either a predominantly Program Management or
Contracting background at the grade of lieutenant colonel and above. FA 51 officers assigned to 51Z AOC positions
may occupy the following ACFs: A, C, I, and T.
                       Figure 41–1. Military Acquisition Workforce within the Army Acquisition Corps
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                          439

41–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for the 21st Century. These leaders must be proficient in their
core competencies and broad enough to operate across all military operations. They must be able to inform and
influence activities with joint, interagency, and multinational partners. All of these attributes must be balanced with
cultural awareness and grounded in the Army Values and Warrior Ethos. Further explanation of these characteristics
can be referenced in ADP 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this publication. The U.S. Army Acquisition Support Center is the
proponent for the following Army SIs (detailed descriptions contained in DA Pam 611–21):
   (1) 4M—Acquisition Corps Candidate.
   (2) 4Z—Acquisition Corps Member.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of an Acquisition Corps officer. The work performed by FA 51 officers requires in-
depth knowledge and synergy of acquisition, business, technology and military operations which cannot be duplicated
by other branches or FAs. Acquisition officers oversee and manage contracts and programs worth billions of dollars,
and supervise the technical development efforts and purchases which satisfy warfighter requirements in the rapidly
changing operational environment. FA 51 officers of all grades operate at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels
with joint, interagency, and multinational partners. An understanding of military operations is critical. The ability to
lead a diverse workforce that includes military, civilians, other Services, elements of the federal government, civilian
industry, and other nations is paramount. FA 51 officers must find and exploit opportunities to quickly provide mature
materiel capabilities or services which satisfy warfighter needs while conducting themselves beyond reproach. Acquisi-
tion support to operations includes finding and purchasing capabilities or services during civil support operations or
rapidly developing and fielding an urgent operational need to deployed forces.
41–3. Officer accessions
   a. Active Component officer accession process. HRC executes three primary methods of accession into the U.S.
Army Acquisition Corps. Ideally, officers are accessed into FA 51 through the Army Acquisition Corps Functional
Designation Board or quarterly VTIP at their 6th or 7th year of service. Select officers are also accessed through the
Experimental Test Pilot Program selection process. Critical to accession as a FA 51 officer is demonstrated, successful
leadership performance in the appropriate KD position in the grade of captain as outlined in the officer’s basic branch
of this DA Pam. Upon accession, officers are optimally assigned into FA 51 positions prior to their 7th year of service.
Officers interested in the Army Acquisition Corps are strongly encouraged to read current military personnel (MIL-
PER) messages to ensure sufficient time is allocated to prepare for upcoming accession processes.
   b. U.S. Army Reserve acquisition officer accessions. HRC executes USAR FA 51 accessions for AGR/IMA/TPU
officers. AGR officers may also request accession through the VTIP but they may not participate in the Experimental
Test Pilot Program. TPU/IMA officers may not participate in VTIP or the Experimental Test Pilot Program.
   c. Army National Guard officer accessions. The ARNG FA 51 officers are managed by State AGs in coordination
with the ARNG Acquisition Career Management Office and the ARNG Human Capital Management Office. Newly
accessed officers will normally complete their current tour in their basic branch prior to being trained and assigned to
their first acquisition assignment.
41–4. Officer development
   a. There are three domains of leader development: Institutional training and education, assignments, and self-
development. These domains define and engage a continuous cycle of education, training, selection, experience,
assessment, feedback, reinforcement, and evaluation which shapes officer development throughout career progression.
Officers should balance assignments in order to gain a breadth and depth of operational and staff experience across a
variety of organizations and environments. The 21st century requires flexible and adaptable officers with a broad
experience base gained by executing critical functions in different organizational cultures and practices.
   (1) Active Component career and assignments management. AA FA 51 officers are centrally managed by the
Acquisition Management Branch within the Force Sustainment Division, Officer Personnel Management Directorate,
HRC. The Acquisition Management Branch provides career development through the management of schooling and
assignment opportunities for FA 51 officers.
   (2) U.S. Army Reserve career and assignments management. USAR FA 51 officers are centrally managed by the
Acquisition Management Branch at HRC. The HRC Acquisition Management Branch manages FA 51 assignments for
USAR officers regardless of basic branch affiliation.
   (3) Army National Guard career and assignments management. ARNG FA 51 officers are managed by State AGs in
coordination with the ARNG Human Capital Management Office and the ARNG Acquisition Career Management
Office.
   b. Officer development model. The foundation of FA 51 officer professional development is the experience,
440                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

education and training required to obtain DAWIA certification. All acquisition officers can expect to have ample
opportunities to serve in diverse assignments and receive the training required to attain DAWIA Certification.
Professional military schooling, acquisition unique training and experience as well as a strong manner of performance
help officers to be competitive for subsequent positions with increasing responsibilities and challenges.
   (1) Certification. Officers are required to obtain a professional certification in accordance with the DAWIA, Public
Law 101–510, 10 USC Chapter 87 and other DOD directives and instructions. Certification levels are assigned to each
acquisition position: Level I (captain/major); Level II (major); Level III (lieutenant colonel/colonel). The different
levels of certification build upon acquisition skills and competencies gained at each level which include education,
training (institutional) and experience against established criteria. Certification levels are reflected on the officer’s
official DA Form 4037. Information on current certification requirements can be located in the DAU catalog at http://
icatalog.dau.mil.
   (2) Professional/self-development requirements. The tool used to track and maintain self-development requirements
is an Individual Development Plan (IDP). An IDP is a five-year living document between an officer and his/her rater
that outlines specific objectives and training that an officer will accomplish during the course of an assignment.
Officers at all ranks are required to complete 80 Continuous Learning Points (CLPs) every 2 years in order to maintain
their proficiency and professional development. IDP, CLP, and training certification tools can be accessed at https://rda.
altess.army.mil/camp. All AC and RC (AGR) FA 51 officers may apply for the opportunity to attend a fully funded
advanced civil schooling or Training With Industry program after their first acquisition assignment. Selection to
advanced civilian schooling or Training With Industry is contingent upon the needs of the Army, the officer’s
promotion potential, their potential for academic success, and their career timeline. Eligible officers pursuing off-duty
undergraduate or graduate civilian education courses may apply for tuition assistance under the provisions of AR
621–5. Acquisition officers should also dedicate time to professional reading and maintain currency with industry
trends and new technologies.
   (3) Re-greening. “Re-greening” provides an opportunity for Army Acquisition Corps officers to refresh their
exposure to current tactics, techniques, procedures, and weapons systems in operationally current and relevant environ-
ments. After promotion to Major and before selection to Colonel, each acquisition officer is expected to experience a
“re-greening” opportunity that is operationally intensive and relatively limited in duration. They will serve primarily in
acquisition billets. The Director of Acquisition Career Management is the approving authority to assign an acquisition
officer to a non-acquisition billet for any re-greening opportunity; the Director of Acquisition Career Management
directly manages and approves non-acquisition assignments on a case-by-case basis. These requirements may be
accomplished using several options:
   (a) Temporary assignment to a Worldwide Individual Augmentation System (WIAS) billet (6 to 12 months in
duration).
   (b) Temporary assignment as a Science and Technology Advisor to deployed headquarters (4 to 12 months in
duration).
   (c) Temporary assignment to a Forward Operational Assessment team that supports a deployed headquarters or other
contingency missions (4 to 12 months in duration).
   (d) TDY deployment to training centers, the Network Integration Evaluation (NIE), or combat areas of responsibility
as an embedded observer or as additional manpower for the deploying battalion, brigade, or division (2 months or
longer).
   (e) Contracting assignments that support deployments, exercises, and other contingencies are considered to be
inherently re-greening.
   (f) Operational testing and certain combat development assignments.
   (g) Other experiences as coordinated with the first general officer in the officer’s chain of command, or HRC.
   (4) Acquisition Corps Membership. At the time of accession, commissioned officers in the Army Acquisition Corps
are designated as FA 51 officers and become acquisition workforce members. Designation as an Acquisition Corps
member occurs when specific training, education and experience milestones are met. Acquisition Corps membership
shall be made in accordance with criteria and procedures established by the Secretary of Defense. Only officers who
meet all of the following requirements may be considered for Acquisition Corps membership:
   (a) Have received a baccalaureate degree at an accredited educational institution authorized to grant baccalaureate
degrees, with at least 24 semester credit hours (or the equivalent) of study from an accredited institution of higher
education from among the following disciplines: accounting, business finance, law, contracts, purchasing, economics,
industrial management, marketing, quantitative methods, and organization and management or equivalent training; or,
at least 24 semester credit hours (or the equivalent) from an accredited institution of higher education in AOC A or
AOC C and 12 semester credit hours (or the equivalent) from such an institution from among the disciplines listed
above.
   (b) The officer must be in the grade of major or above and have at least 4 years of experience in an acquisition
position in DOD or in a comparable position in industry or government.
   (c) The officer must be a minimum of DAWIA Level II certified in at least one ACF.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            441

   (5) Critical acquisition positions, key leadership positions (KLPs), and CSL: Per 10 USC Chapter 87, Section 1733,
a critical acquisition position may only be filled by an Acquisition Corps member.
   (a) Critical acquisition positions. The Army acquisition executive designates critical acquisition positions based on
the criticality of the position to the acquisition program, effort, or function supported. All military acquisition positions
in the grade of lieutenant colonel and higher are designated as critical acquisition positions unless waived by the
appropriate authority. The statutory tenure for all critical acquisition positions is 3 years.
   (b) Key leadership positions. The Army acquisition executive and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition
Technology and Logistics identify, designate and account for KLPs. KLPs are a subset of critical acquisition positions
with a significant level of responsibility and authority and are essential to the success of a program or effort.
Organizations will establish guidance to ensure personnel occupying KLPs either meet DAWIA education, training and
experience standards or obtain an approved waiver.
   (c) Centralized selection list. A HQDA board centrally selects a limited number of high performing officers for
command and key billets. The CSL system identifies the most critical organizations that require centrally selected
officers to meet their leadership and management needs. This process selects the best-qualified officers, with the right
skill and experiences, to lead Army professionals, prepare for the full spectrum of military operations, and manage the
Army’s resources. The Army’s Centralized Command/Key Billet Selection System designates all the Army’s CSL
positions into one of two categories: CSL Command or CSL Key Billet. All Army Acquisition Corps CSL positions
are designated as CSL Key Billet who represent the Army Acquisition Corps’s top leaders. The types of Army
Acquisition Corps CSL Key Billets are project manager, contracting support brigade commander, product manager,
contracting battalion commander, and acquisition director (both at the colonel and lieutenant colonel level).
   (6) Joint qualification. The Joint Qualification System acknowledges both designated joint billets as well as
experience-based joint duty assignments in contributing to the development of joint qualified officers. These assign-
ments with the necessary JPME culminate with an officer being identified as a fully Joint Qualified Officer and the
receipt of the 3L SI. Additional information can be found in DODI 1300.19.
   (7) Mentorship. Mentorship is a powerful tool that can help build competence, leadership skills, self-awareness, and
morale. FA 51 officers are strongly encouraged to pursue mentorship opportunities at all levels. Senior acquisition
officers should actively serve as mentors to junior acquisition officers, in order to offer their perspective on what it
takes to succeed in the Army Acquisition Corps and pass on their knowledge and experience. It will be critical for key
leaders to support mentoring efforts publicly. Military leaders must take care to avoid micromanaging mentors and
requiring participation in formal mentoring programs. When developing formal mentoring programs, planners should
consider vetting mentors and deliberately select those with demonstrated efficacy in other interpersonal relationships.
Some of these key interpersonal skills are communication ability, empathy, listening, and emotional intelligence. These
skills will help to ensure greater success in the mentor role. Supervising and mentoring junior leaders is an integral
component of an effective professional development program, while on-the-job experience will fulfill some of the
requisites for acquiring tactical and technical proficiency. Leaders must establish a sound process for subordinate
development that furnish the guidelines and establish the parameters for arming and infusing our subordinates with
honed leadership capabilities. Using this knowledge, junior officers as mentees can advance their confidence, skills,
and capabilities; maximize their potential; and grow as leaders.
   c. Captain/major development. En route to their first acquisition assignment, all acquisition officers are required to
attend the Acquisition Basic Qualification Course. The composition of Acquisition Basic Qualification Course training
depends on whether their first assignment is in Program Management (AOC A) or Contracting (AOC C).
   (1) FA 51A officers will attend the Army Acquisition Foundation Course, followed by the Army Acquisition
Intermediate Program Management Course (AIPM). The completion of these two courses ensures that FA 51A officers
will meet the training requirements needed for Level II certification in Program Management before they report to their
first acquisition assignment.
   (2) FA 51C officers will similarly attend the Army Acquisition Foundation Course, but they will follow this course
with the Army Basic Contracting Course. This sequence allows them to attain the necessary training requirements for
Level I certification in Contracting before they report to their first contracting assignment. The Army Acquisition
Foundation Course, AIPM, and Army Basic Contracting Course are taught at the U.S. Army Acquisition Center of
Excellence (AACoE) in Huntsville, AL, and represent the initial PME courses for FA 51 officers. USAR and ARNG
officers may attend these courses (in lieu of DAU courses) on a space available basis and in coordination with their
career manager.
   (3) Upon graduation from the Acquisition Basic Qualification Course, newly trained captains and majors will be
assigned to a position which is designed to develop their functional understanding in either program management or
contracting. Most assignments for AA, USAR, and ARNG FA 51 officers will be between 24–48 months. Assignments
OCONUS locations may require shorter tour lengths. The goal is to expose officers to multiple acquisition experiences
in order to grow agile and adaptive leaders who are prepared to lead highly complex, multifunctional organizations and
provide acquisition expertise throughout the full range of military operations. FA 51C officers will return to the
AACoE either during or after their first contracting assignment to complete the Army Acquisition Intermediate
442                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

Contracting Course. Upon completion of the Army Acquisition Intermediate Contracting Course, they will have the
training requirements needed to attain Level II certification in contracting.
   (4) For increased competitiveness for promotion to lieutenant colonel, officers should have achieved a minimum
MEL 4. For FA 51 officers, MEL 4 is awarded after successful completion of the common core ILE and FA 51
Intermediate Qualification Course (IQC). All officers in YDCS, G–1994 and subsequent should complete the ILE and
the follow-on FA 51 IQC no later than their 15th year of Active Federal commissioned service. Officers should meet
the statutory requirements prior to selection to lieutenant colonel. More information can be found at: http://asc.army.
mil. An additional Army Acquisition Corps goal is for FA 51 officers to obtain a master’s degree in an acquisition
related discipline. Officers must complete or have completed the minimum number of business hours required for
Acquisition Corps membership and any specific requirement for specific ACF certification prior to selection to
lieutenant colonel.
   (5) Careful planning and attention to an individual’s qualifications and expertise are essential in facilitating an
officer’s growth to a high-level of technical proficiency. Multiple developmental and KD assignments in a single AOC
best achieve this goal and facilitate Level III certification prior to promotion to lieutenant colonel. In some cases, an
officer may have the opportunity to seek broadening assignments upon achieving Level III certification.
   (6) Developmental assignments expose an acquisition officer to a full spectrum of experiences within their primary
AOC which allows them to develop acquisition skills and become technically proficient. Examples of these assign-
ments, identified below in alphabetical order, include but are not limited to:
   (a) Combat developer.
   (b) Contracting team member.
   (c) Systems manager.
   (d) Test and evaluation officer.
   (7) A KD assignment is one that is deemed fundamental to the development of an officer’s core branch or FA
competencies or deemed critical by the senior Army leadership to provide experience across the Army’s strategic
mission. AA captains and majors should have a goal to serve at least 24 months in one or a combination of KD
assignments. Examples of these assignments, identified below in alphabetical order, include but are not limited to:
   (a) Administrative Contracting Officer.
   (b) Assistant Product Manager.
   (c) Contracting Team Leader.
   (d) Program Integrator.
   (8) Broadening assignments provide officers the opportunity to expand their expertise in their primary AOC or to
experience a secondary ACF. FA 51 officers may serve in a variety of broadening assignments at OSD, DA Staff, Joint
Commands, Combatant Commands, International assignments, National Laboratories, Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, and NASA. These positions provide exposure to experiences inside and outside of Army organiza-
tions, characterized by different organizational cultures and practices. All AC and RC (AGR) FA 51 officers may apply
for the opportunity to attend a fully funded advanced civil schooling, Naval Postgraduate School, or Training With
Industry Program. Selection to advanced civilian schooling or Training With Industry is contingent upon the needs of
the Army, the officer’s promotion potential, their potential for academic success, and their career timeline. Examples of
broadening assignments, identified below in alphabetical order, include but are not limited to:
   (a) ASA(ALT) or DA staff officer.
   (b) Joint/OSD staff officer.
   (c) Service with another Government agency
   d. Lieutenant colonel development. The career development goal for a lieutenant colonel is to leverage acquired
acquisition skills in CSL or critical acquisition position. Selection to a CSL position represents the pinnacle of service
at the lieutenant colonel level and serves as an indicator of potential for promotion and selection to colonel and SSC.
Officers who do not serve in a CSL position will continue to serve an essential role in the success of the Acquisition
Corps by providing leadership in critical acquisition position billets. All lieutenant colonels should progressively seek
challenging CSL and non-CSL positions to include: product manager, contracting commander, product director, Joint
and HQDA Staff positions, acquisition director, and other key positions. All lieutenant colonel positions are considered
critical acquisition positions and officers assigned to such positions must be Acquisition Corps members and DAWIA
Level III certified, upon selection to lieutenant colonel officers will have 24 months to meet these statutory require-
ments. In order to compete for CSL Key Billet selection, an officer must be an Acquisition Corps member and have
achieved a minimum of Level III certification in either program management or contracting ACFs. Lieutenant colonels
selected for CSL Key Billet must complete a PCC and complete CSL statutory requirements. FA 51 officers compete
for SSC (MEL 1) along with other branches/FAs. SSC is the highest level military educational program available to
prepare officers for the positions of greatest responsibility in the DOD. All AC and RC (AGR) FA 51 officers may
apply for the opportunity to participate in the Training With Industry program. Selection to Training With Industry is
contingent upon the needs of the Army, the officers’ promotion potential, their potential for academic success, and their
career timeline. Critical acquisition position assignments examples are identified below in alphabetical order, include
but are not limited to:
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014                                            443

   (1) Acquisition director.
   (2) Contracting battalion commander.
   (3) DASC director.
   (4) Deputy project director.
   (5) Joint/OSD staff officer.
   (6) Military science advisor.
   (7) Product manager.
   (8) Test and evaluation officer.
   e. Colonel development. The career development goal for a colonel is to serve in a FA 51 CSL Key Billet as project
manager, contracting support brigade commander, or acquisition director. Colonels successfully completing a CSL
assignment are assigned to senior leadership positions with significant and strategic importance to the future of the
Army and DOD. Other developmental positions at the colonel level include positions on the OSD/Joint staff, operations
officer/strategic planner, and deployed positions in theaters worldwide in support of acquisition operations.
                                           Figure 41–2. AC officer development
41–5. Army Acquisition Corps Reserve Component officers
RC Army Acquisition Corps officers (ARNG and the USAR) contribute to the acquisition workforce mission during
daily operations, contingency operations, and upon mobilization. RC acquisition officers serve in the same types of
career fields and assignments as AC officers and are required to complete DAWIA certification requirements. RC
officers may acquire their acquisition experience through prior active duty service as an FA 51 officer, expertise
obtained in their civilian careers, extended periods of active duty, or mobilization. USAR acquisition officer profes-
sional development is based on the basic Army officer professional education model presented both within chapter 7,
of this publication and AR 135–155. Eligible ARNG/USAR officers may compete for CSL Key Billet selection at the
lieutenant colonel and colonel level along with AC officers (ARNG uses the Acquisition Career Record Brief in place
of the ORB for centrally selected boards). ARNG/USAR officers are normally slated to organizations that support their
respective components. The ultimate goal is to create an integrated Army Acquisition Corps that standardizes educa-
tion, training, and experiences across all components.

Section II
Terms
Area of concentration
Identifies a requirement and an officer possessing a requisite area of expertise (subdivision) within a branch or FA. An
officer may possess and serve in more than one AOC.
Branch
A branch is a grouping of officers that comprises an arm or Service of the Army in which, as a minimum, officers are
commissioned, assigned, developed and promoted through their company grade years. Officers are accessed into a
single basic branch and will hold that branch designation, which is later augmented between the 5th and 6th YOS with
a FA. An accession branch admits officers upon commissioning; a non-accession branch admits experienced officers
from the accession branches. With the exception of SF, all other branches are accession branches. SF recruits officers
with a minimum of 3 years experience. (See chap 15 for further discussion.) Officers will serve their first 8 to 12 years
developing the leadership and tactical skills associated with their branch. They will continue to wear their branch
insignia throughout their military Service. All career branches are in the operations career field.
Branch/functional area generalist position
An 01A or 02A-coded position that may be filled by any officer, regardless of branch or FA designation. This is an
umbrella term used to collectively describe two subset categories defined as officer generalist and combat arms
generalist positions. (Note: Previously termed immaterial positions.)
Captain Career Course
This course is the second major branch school officers attend before company-level command. It combines the
instruction formerly taught in the branch Officer Advanced Course and the Combined Arms and Services Staff School.
The branch phase consists of 18-weeks of branch-specific technical and tactical training with integrated common core
instruction. The 6-week TDY staff process phase at Fort Leavenworth prepares officers to function as staff officers at
battalion, brigade and division level.
Career field
A specific grouping of functionally related officer, warrant officer, enlisted and civilian positions into management
categories having a common mission area. Career fields consist of officer branches and FAs, warrant officer and
enlisted military occupational specialties and civilian occupational series. There are four career fields: operations,
information operations, institutional support, and operational support. (The term career field in lower case is also a
generic term commonly used by military and civilian personnel when referring to their branch, FA, MOS, or civilian
occupational series.)
Combat arms generalist position
A duty position requiring a broad understanding of combined arms doctrine, training and force structure. A combat
arms generalist position is not identified with one specific branch or FA, but is limited to officers whose branches are
Infantry, Armor, Field Artillery, Air Defense Artillery, Aviation, Special Forces, and USACE; and who are currently
managed in the operations career field. These positions are documented in The Army Authorization Documents System
with code 02A. (Note: Previously termed combat arms immaterial positions.)
Functional area
A FA is a grouping of officers by technical specialty or skill, which usually requires significant education, training and
experience. An officer receives his or her FA between the 5th and 6th YOS. Individual preference, academic
background, manner of performance, training and experience, and needs of the Army are all considered during the
designation process.
Functional designation
The process whereby officers are reassigned from an accession branch to a FA or other branch. This designation is
472                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 3 December 2014

made by a formal panel within HRC that weighs factors including needs of the Army, officer preference, rater and
senior rater recommendations, education, training, and unique skills or attributes.
Officer generalist position
A duty position requiring a broad understanding of Army leadership, doctrine, policy, force structure and management.
An officer generalist position is not identified with or limited to one specific branch or FA, but indicates that any
officer may be assigned to the position. For example, both Armor Branch officers in the operations career field and FA
45 Comptrollers in the institutional support career field are eligible to serve in officer generalist positions. These
positions are documented in The Army Authorization Document System with code 01A. (Note: Previously termed
branch immaterial positions.)
Skill
Identifies a requirement and an officer possessing specialized skills to perform duties of a specific position that may
require significant education, training, and experience. A skill can be related to more than one branch or FA. An officer
may have more than one skill.
Special branches
A grouping of branches and officers primarily concerned with providing combat Service support and/or administration
to the Army as a whole but managed separately from combat Service support branches. Special branches include
AMEDD, Chaplain Corps, and JAGC.
Strategic human resource management
A broader, more holistic perspective on personnel management that extends beyond the fundamental life-cycle
functions. Strategic human resource management focuses on the long-term vision of OPMS and links fundamental
personnel management decisions to the desired end state. Strategic human resource management links character and
leader development, the new OERs (DA Form 67–10 Series) and the personnel life-cycle management functions
addressed in OPMS XXI. While the initial focus of SHRM is on officer personnel, Strategic human resource
management will encompass the total force of officers, warrant officers, enlisted and civilian personnel.
