Part One
Philosophy and Management
Chapter 1
Introduction
1–1. Purpose
This pamphlet serves primarily as a professional development guide for all officers. It does not prescribe the path of
assignments or educational requirements that will guarantee success, but rather describes the full spectrum of develop-
mental opportunities an officer can expect for a successful career. This document also serves as a mentoring tool for
leaders at all levels and is an important personnel management guide for assignment officers, proponents, and HQDA
selection board members. Its focus is the development and career management of all officers of the United States
Army.
1–2. References
Required and related publications and prescribed and referenced forms are listed in appendix A.
1–3. Explanation of abbreviations and terms
Abbreviations and special terms used in this pamphlet are explained in the glossary.
1–4. Current perspective
   a. Officer development for the Army should effectively balance breadth and depth of experience. Army operations
are inherently Joint. Officers must understand the terms of the Joint Officer Management Program as per DODI
1300–19P, 31 October 2007 and the Joint Qualification System. Officers should focus on developmental positions that
enhance career progression and lead to Joint Qualification status. All assignments are important to sustain a trained and
ready Army. An officer’s focus should be on bringing the warrior ethos to every job and every facet of their
development. Officers use challenging assignments at all levels to help them hone, through experience, what they have
learned through their formal education about leading and training Soldiers. Operational factors — the constraints of
time, Army requirements, positions available, and readiness — all influence the amount of time an officer will need to
acquire appropriate leadership skills. Success will depend not on the number or type of positions held, but rather on the
quality of duty performance in every assignment. It is tied to individual contribution, and related to the individual
officer’s definition of success in the profession of arms. Not all officers will be afforded opportunities to perform all
types of duty. The types and extent of duties and assignments are articulated in the following chapters. For this
publication, the term "officers" encompasses warrant officers, a warrant officer one (WO1) is commissioned upon
promotion to chief warrant officer two (CW2), company grade officers, and field grade officers. All officers are direct
representatives of the President of the United States. Chapters relating to officer education, general promotion policies,
and officer evaluation apply to all special branches as well. Specific policies applicable to the Judge Advocate
General’s Corps, the Chaplain Corps, and the Army Medical Department are found in chapters 49, 50, and 51,
respectively. The governing regulations for this pamphlet are AR 600–3 and AR 350–1.
   b. Officers are encouraged to read all branch and functional area chapters, regardless of branch functional area,
military occupational specialty (MOS), or career field held, because unique and valuable lessons in Army culture and
officer professional development are found in every chapter.
   c. This pamphlet documents the third revision since the Officer Personnel Management System (OPMS) XXI study
of 1998 and Warrant Officer Personnel Management Study (WOPMS) XXI of 2000, and incorporates the changing
philosophies of the Army leadership. OPMS enhances the warfighting capability of the Army; provides all officers with
a reasonable opportunity for success; and fulfills Army requirements with an officer corps balanced with the right
grades and skills. Although a warrant officer personnel management system has been in place since the 1970s and was
further defined by the Total Warrant Officer Study (TWOS) of 1986, the subsequent studies mentioned above
reinforced the need for a development and career management system that provides for the career development needs
of the warrant officer segment of our officer corps. Better integration of warrant officers into the officer corps enhances
the effectiveness and professionalism of warrant officers through improvements in training, development, assignment,
promotion and retention practices.
1–5. Warrior ethos and Army Values
Everything begins with the warrior ethos. The warrior ethos compels Soldiers to fight through all conditions to victory
no matter how much effort is required. It is the Soldiers’ selfless commitment to the nation, mission, unit, and fellow
Soldiers. It is the professional attitude that inspires every American Soldier. Warrior ethos is grounded in refusal to
accept failure. It is developed and sustained through discipline, commitment to Army Values, and pride in the Army’s
heritage. Warrior ethos is the foundation for our total commitment to victory in peace and war. It is the conviction that
military service is much more than just another job. It defines who officers are and what officers do. It is linked to this
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                                1

country’s long-standing Army Values, and the determination to do what is right and do it with pride. Soldiers enter the
Army with their own values, developed in childhood and nurtured through experience. We are all shaped by what we
have seen, what we have learned, and whom we have met. But once Soldiers put on the uniform and take the oath,
they have opted to accept a warrior ethos and have promised to live by Army Values. Army Values form the very
identity of the Army. They are nonnegotiable and apply to everyone at all times, in all situations. The trust that
Soldiers have for one another and the trust the American people put in us demands that we live up to these values.
These values are interdependent; that is, they support one another. You cannot follow one value and ignore another.
The seven values that guide all leaders and the rest of the Army are loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor,
integrity, and personal courage. Leaders must believe in them, model them in personal actions, and teach others to
accept them. Officers require a demonstrated mastery of branch, functional area, or MOS-specific skills, and grounding
in these seven values to successfully lead Soldiers in the 21st century. Officer leaders who adopt a warrior ethos and a
joint, expeditionary mindset will be confident that they are organized, trained, and equipped to operate anywhere in the
world, at any time, in any environment, against any adversary to accomplish the assigned mission.
1–6. Leader development overview
   a. Leader development is the means for growing competent, confident, self-aware leaders who are prepared for the
challenges of the future in combined arms joint, interagency, intergovernmental and multinational (JIIM) operations.
Future Force leaders must be multifunctional, capable of supporting the range of military operations within the JIIM
environment, comfortable with ambiguity, information systems literate, and capable of intuitive assessments of situa-
tions for rapid conceptualization of friendly courses of action. Through the leader development process, the Army
develops leaders with character and competence for today and tomorrow to be trainers, role models, and standard
bearers. Leader development through progressive, sequential, and continuous education and experience throughout
one’s career benefits the Army and the leader.
   b. The Army’s leader development and education system trains, educates, and grows Army leaders that are the
centerpiece of a campaign quality Army with a joint expeditionary mindset. Leader development is accomplished in
three domains — operational, institutional, and self-development.
   c. In the operational domain, leader development is principally gained through firsthand combat and contingency
operational experience, from lessons learned, and from individual and collective training, assessment, and feedback;
from superiors, peers and subordinates. Operational experience is the linchpin component of leader development from
which officers learn "what right looks like."
   d. The institutional domain provides standards-based training and education that develop Army leaders who are
grounded in an ideal of service to the nation, instilled with a warrior ethos, have a common doctrinal foundation, are
self-aware, innovative, adaptive, and are capable of taking initiative and successfully operating as part of a joint team
in the range of military operations within the contemporary operational environment. This domain provides training on
common Soldier tasks and selected critical tasks, and leverages education and information technologies to develop,
maintain, and distribute training and educational materials for individual Soldier and unit use. Institutional leader
development builds on leaders’ operational experiences and enables lifelong learning through resident and nonresident
schooling at Army, joint and civilian schools using live-virtual-constructive training as a foundation for experiential
learning.
   e. Self-development is the third domain of leader development and an essential component of lifelong learning. Self-
development is a goals-based, feedback-driven program of activities and learning that contributes to professional
competence, organizational effectiveness, and professional development. Individual and organizational assessment and
feedback programs in the operational and institutional domains, linked to developmental actions, grow competent and
confident leaders and result in trained and ready organizations and units. Developing Army leaders to meet the needs
of the Army and the Nation requires agile and innovative leader development and education systems.
   f. The DA Pam 350–58 describes the Army’s approach to leader development. The U.S. Army Training and
Doctrine (TRADOC) Commander is the single responsible official to direct the execution of the Army’s leader
development program. The governing regulations for DA Pamphlet 350–58 are AR 600–3 and AR 350–1. The Army
DCS, G–3/5/7 is the proponent for DA Pam 350–58 and is the single DA functional process manager for Army training
and leader development. As such, the DCS, G–3/5/7 is responsible for approval and management of the Army Training
and Leader Development Program. To accomplish this, the DCS, G–3/5/7 conducts a Training General Officer Steering
Committee semiannually to identify deficiencies and recommend improvements in training policy, strategy and
capabilities.
1–7. Mentoring, counseling and coaching
   a. Today’s leaders have the critical responsibility to develop future leaders who are prepared to meet tomorrow’s
challenges. An essential component of this development is mentoring. The term mentorship refers to the voluntary,
developmental relationship between a person of greater experience and a person of lesser experience that is character-
ized by mutual trust and respect.
   b. Mentorship impacts both personal development (maturity, interpersonal and communication skills) as well as
professional development (technical and tactical knowledge, and career-path knowledge).
2                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   c. The goal of mentorship is to assist the lesser-experienced person in reaching his/her personal and professional
potential. It is critical to understand that mentorship is not any one behavior or set of behaviors, but rather includes all
of the leader development behaviors (for example, counseling, teaching, coaching, and role modeling) that are
displayed by a trusted advisor.
   d. The strength of the mentorship relationship is the fact that it is based on mutual trust and respect. Assessment,
feedback and guidance accelerate the developmental process and enhance performance. When this occurs within a
mentoring relationship, even higher performance results.
   e. Mentoring requires taking advantage of any opportunity to teach, counsel, or coach to build skills and confidence
in the mentored. Mentoring is not limited to formal sessions but can include every event from quarterly training briefs
to after-action reviews to casual, recreational activities.
   f. One of the most important legacies that today’s senior leaders can leave on the Army is to mentor junior leaders
to fight and win future conflicts. Mentoring develops great leaders to lead great Soldiers.
1–8. Officer Personnel Management System overview
   a. Historical perspective. Officer personnel management reviews and analysis have been on a continuum of
constructive change for many years. The Officer Personnel Management System (OPMS) was instituted in 1972 as a
result of The U.S. Army War College Study on Military Professionalism and a follow-on analysis directed by the
Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel. Numerous changes in personnel management policy were incorporated into OPMS
between its implementation in 1975 and 1981. After passage of the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act
(DOPMA) by Congress in 1981, the Chief of Staff, Army, ordered a major review to examine the impact of the
legislation on OPMS policies. As a result, OPMS II was developed in 1984 to accommodate the changes brought about
by DOPMA, including the creation of functional areas, dual tracking and Regular Army integration. These and other
mostly evolutionary proposals were implemented beginning in 1985. Two years later, the Chief of Staff, Army,
directed a review of officer leader development to account for the changes in law, policy, and procedures that had
occurred since the creation of OPMS II. As a result of the study, the Leader Development Action Plan was approved
for implementation in 1989. Over 50 recommendations representing the latest revisions to the officer personnel system
were incorporated into OPMS. The Army has undergone significant changes with widespread affect on the officer
personnel system, brought about by the drawdown at the end of the Cold War and by major legislative initiatives. The
Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, also known as the DOD Reorganization Act, required the Services to improve
interoperability and provided the statutory requirements for joint duty assignments, joint tour credit and joint military
education. In 1986, Congress also passed Public Law 99–145, which specified the acquisition experiences and
education necessary for an officer to be the project manager of a major weapons system. This law later led to the
creation in 1990 of the Army Acquisition Corps. The Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvements Act (DAWIA) of
1990 placed additional requirements on Acquisition Corps officers and directed them to single track in their functional
area. Congressional Title XI (1993) legislation placed additional officer requirements on the Active Army in their
support of The Army National Guard and Army Reserve. The Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act (ROPMA)
in 1996 brought the Reserve Component (RC) officer promotion systems in synchronization with the Active Compo-
nent. This legislation established a best-qualified promotion system for RC officers, thereby replacing the fully
qualified system previously used and allowing full integration into OPMS. With an 8-year span since the last formal
OPMS review, the Deputy Chief of Staff, G–1 assembled a team of senior field grade officers to examine a series of
OPMS-specific issues and determine whether a general review of the entire officer system was warranted. This OPMS
XXI Precursor Study Group, under the direction of CG, PERSCOM, now the U.S. Army Human Resources Command
(USAHRC), ultimately reviewed more than 60 individual issues. Based on the collective body of these issues, the
Deputy Chief of Staff, G–1 recommended to the Chief of Staff, Army that a comprehensive review of the Officer
Personnel Management System was necessary. As a result, the OPMS XXI Task Force convened in July 1996 to
review and recommend changes to the Officer Personnel Management System. Consistent with the task of developing
capabilities to meet the challenges of the next century, the Chief of Staff, Army, instructed the task force to link their
work with other ongoing Army planning efforts. In designing the personnel system for the future, the Chief of Staff,
Army, directed that the task force also create a conceptual framework integrating OPMS with the Leader Development
System, ongoing character development initiatives, and a new officer evaluation report. The focus was to take the
Army in a direction to meet its vision of the future instead of simply solving individual problems. The task force
concluded that OPMS should incorporate a holistic, strategic human resource management approach to officer develop-
ment and personnel management. In addition, the task force called for the creation of an officer career field-based
management system composed of four career fields (CFs): operations, operational support, institutional support, and
information operations. Under OPMS XXI, officers were designated into a single CF after their selection for major, and
serving and competing for promotion in their designated CF, from that point on in their career. The results of these
strategic recommendations, approved by the Army Chief of Staff in December 1997, formed the basis for the changes
to the Officer Personnel Management System.
   b. Current perspective. The Army continues to transform; this transformation process is ongoing and continuous in
nature. The OPMS working group has been tasked by the Chief of Staff to continue to modernize the Army’s
assignment and professional management systems to meet the Army’s needs, now and as the Army transforms.
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                               3

   c. Purpose. The purpose of OPMS is to enhance the effectiveness and professionalism of the officer corps. The
OPMS encompasses all policies and procedures by which Army field grade, company grade, and warrant officers are
trained, educated, developed, assigned, evaluated, promoted, and separated from Active Duty. The OPMS consists of
personnel management policies and procedures that assure a deployable, professional officer corps capable of meeting
the challenges of the future as embodied in Joint Operations Concepts.
   d. Coordination. The personnel proponents provide guidelines concerning career patterns and leader development, as

1–9. Warrant officer personnel management overview
   a. Historical perspective. Personnel management of warrant officers is the product of a number of dynamic yet
disparate systems and events. The present Warrant Officer Program was announced in DA Circular 611–7 on 12 April
1960. This publication outlined utilization policies, criteria for selection of warrant officer positions, and instructions
for conversion to the current warrant officer MOS system. However, the conception of a WOPMS can only be traced
back to 1966, when a study group was formed at the Department of the Army level. The group’s mission was to
develop a formal Warrant Officer Career Program, which would be responsive to future Army requirements while
concurrently offering sufficient career opportunities to attract high quality personnel. The study group examined all
aspects of the Warrant Officer Corps and made a number of recommendations in areas such as pay, promotion,
utilization, and education. As a result of these recommendations, actions were initiated to provide more attractive
career opportunities for warrant officers. A tri-level education system was established by the end of 1972 which
provided formal training at the basic or entry level for warrant officers in 59 occupational specialties, at the
intermediate or mid-career level for 53 specialties, and at the advanced level for 27 specialties. By the close of 1975,
the Army’s capability for professionally developing the Warrant Officer Corps had been significantly expanded and
warrant officers were being offered developmental opportunities not available to their predecessors. In 1974, the
Warrant Officer Division was created at PERSCOM (now Army Human Resource Command) to provide centralized
career management for all but Judge Advocate General and Army Medical Department (AMEDD) warrant officers. In
the 1981 Defense Officer Personnel Management Act, officer career management was codified, but DOPMA specifi-
cally excluded warrant officers. To fill that void, the Chief of Staff, Army chartered a TWOS in 1984. The TWOS
introduced a number of substantial changes including a new definition of the warrant officer. The TWOS also resulted
in requirements-based position coding in authorization documents and a training philosophy of "select, train and utilize.
" The Warrant Officer Management Act (WOMA) was introduced in Congress shortly after the publication of TWOS,
signed into law in December 1991 and is the current basis for the management of warrant officers on the ADL. The
WOMA is the warrant officer counterpart of DOPMA. It provided for management of warrant officers by years of
warrant officer service rather than total service, automatic RA integration at the chief warrant officer-3 (CW3) level,
created the rank of CW5, permitted selective retention and retirement, and eliminated the dual promotion system. In
February 1992, the Chief of Staff of the Army approved the Warrant Officer Leader Development Action Plan
(WOLDAP). The WOLDAP expanded upon the foundation of TWOS and WOMA and provided a blueprint for the
leader development of warrant officers in the Army of the future. The plan contained specific recommendations on
issues dealing with training, assignments, civil education, and other subjects for both active and reserve warrant
officers. In 2000, the Chief of Staff chartered the Army Training and Leader Development Panel (ATLDP) to conduct
a series of studies to recommend changes to leader development education for all segments of The Army. The Warrant
Officer Study by this panel developed a further revision of the TWOS definition of warrant officers for the future as:
“The warrant officer of the Future Force is a self aware and adaptive technical expert, combat leader, trainer, and
advisor. Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the warrant officer adminis-
ters, manages, maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment across the full range of Army
operations. Warrant officers are innovative integrators of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident war-
fighters, and developers of specialized teams of Soldiers. They support a wide range of Army missions throughout their
careers." This new definition is relevant today and will remain so for the Future Force. The warrant officer specific
component of OPMS features:
   (1) A structure that optimizes warrant officer utilization and provides sustainable inventories.
   (2) An acquisition program to access quality candidates in sufficient numbers, with appropriate requisite background
and skills, and at the appropriate time in the candidates’ careers.
   (3) Clearly defined warrant officer personnel policies and professional development requirements.
   (4) A means to maintain warrant officers’ technical expertise on current and new systems in their units.
   (5) Distribution of the right warrant officer to the right place at the right time. Building on the long history of
warrant officer service to the country, the warrant officer component of OPMS provides the mechanisms for profes-
sional development and appropriate personnel management for warrant officers throughout their careers.

   b. Current perspective. The current perspective has not changed significantly from the previous Pamphlet.
   c. Purpose. The purpose of the warrant officer component of OPMS is to enhance the effectiveness and profes-
sionalism of the warrant officer corps while thoroughly integrating management practices and leader development
education within the larger field and company grade officer corps. The OPMS encompasses all policies and procedures
by which Army warrant officers are procured, trained, educated, developed, assigned, evaluated, promoted and
separated from Active Duty. The OPMS assures a deployable, professional warrant officer corps capable of meeting the
challenges of the Future Force.
   d. Coordination. The personnel proponents provide guidelines concerning career patterns and leader development.
The coordinating agency for active component warrant officers is the U.S. Army Human Resources Command, Officer
Personnel Management Directorate (AHRC–LOPW), 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, VA 22332–0411; for Army
National Guard warrant officers, Chief, National Guard Bureau, HQDA (NGB–ARH), 1411 Jefferson Davis Highway,
Arlington, VA 22202–3231; and, for Reserve warrant officers, U.S. Army Human Resource Command
(ARPC–OPS–WO), 1 Reserve Way, St. Louis, MO 63132–5200.
1–10. Force stabilization and career development.
   a. General. The goal of the Army Force Stabilization System is to provide increased levels of readiness and combat
effectiveness for Army units by implementing an array of turbulence-reducing staffing methods. Implementation will
reduce moves, increase the period of stabilization for Soldiers, and provide predictability for Soldiers and Families.
Furthermore, stabilization provides the basis for synchronizing Soldier assignments to unit operational cycles. It is
critical that life-cycle management/cyclic management units be staffed with Soldiers who train and remain together so
that they can deploy and meet operational requirements with minimal added preparation.
   b. Strategies. The force-stabilization process is based on two primary manning strategies: unit-focused stability
(including life-cycle and cyclic methods) and stabilization (includes the individual replacement system). The individual
replacement system continues to exist, to some extent, to meet Army Transformation personnel goals, and retain
flexibility and sustainability for units with a constant mission requirement.
   (1) Unit-focused stability (UFS). This consists of two stabilization methods: life-cycle management and cyclic
management. Cyclic management combines the advantages of the individual replacement system with life-cycle
management.
   (2) Life-cycle management. Units initiate life-cycle management as designated by the Army DCS, G–3/5/7 imple-
mentation time line. Life-cycle manning synchronizes Soldier assignments with the unit’s operational cycle. Goals of
this manning method are to build better-trained and cohesive units and to maximize a unit’s readiness and deployability
during its ready phase. Total optimal cycle length is 36 months.
   (a) Phases. There are three phases in a life-cycle: reset/train, ready, and available. The reset phase is the conclusion
of the current life-cycle and initiation of a subsequent iteration. It will last approximately 2 months. During the reset/
train phase, incoming and outgoing personnel simultaneously conduct transition activities (household goods, Central
Issue Facility, in/out process, property and equipment transfer, and so on). The ready force phase consists of units
assessed as “ready” at designated capability levels (from training and readiness “gates”) to conduct mission preparation
and higher level collective training with other operational headquarters. They are eligible for sourcing and can be
trained, equipped, resourced, and committed, if necessary, to meet operational (surge) requirements. The available
phase consists of units assessed as “available” at designated capability levels (from training and readiness “gates”) to
conduct mission execution under any Regional Combatant Commander. Life-cycle management units pass through the
Available Force Pool window of time (one year). The unit is deployed against an operational requirement or available
for immediate deployment against a contingency requirement.
   1. Officers assigned to a life-cycle management unit are synchronized to arrive during the reset phase of the unit
operational cycle. For the remainder of the unit’s operational cycle, officers will remain in the unit, training and
preparing for war, deployment or any expeditionary requirement. The unit commander is responsible for repositioning
officers to appropriate leadership positions, as required.
   2. In life-cycle units, most losses are replaced in an annual replacement package. Critical losses are replaced using
individual replacements in a specific grade and MOS to cover the loss of personnel in unique positions limited to 10
percent of the authorizations.
   3. Promotions will not automatically alter positions. For example, there is nothing inherently wrong with a captain
who performs as a company executive officer. If promotion causes the officer to be excess to authorized positions of
the unit, the officer will remain in the assignment until the conclusion of the unit life-cycle. Such action will not be
considered negatively when determining the officer’s future potential for promotion. The unit commander may reassign
the officer anywhere inside the unit to best accomplish the unit’s missions.
   4. Junior officers who are branch detailed and assigned to a life-cycle managed unit are not eligible to transition to
their controlling branch or attend the transition course until the reset phase of that unit.
   5. Battalion/brigade command tour length will coincide with the length of assignment in life-cycle managed units.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                                5

   6. Officer attendance at military leader development courses is preferred to occur during the reset phase. Command-
ers may send officers to functional training courses in a temporary duty (TDY) and return status during the ready
phase, when it does not conflict with operational requirements.
   (b) Cyclic management. Cyclic management is focused on headquarters elements above brigade level and low
density/high impact units where continuity of operations is paramount. The goals of cyclic management are to
synchronize the Soldier’s assignment to the operational cycle of the unit increasing unit readiness and enhancing
cohesion while retaining flexibility in personnel management. Cyclic management consists of two phases — a sustain
phase and a ready phase. During the 1-2 month duration of the sustain phase, leader and Soldier assignments are
organized into personnel replacement packages that are synchronized to arrive within this short phase. The ready phase
begins at the end of one sustain phase and continues approximately 10 months to the beginning of the subsequent
sustain phase. New personnel are rapidly integrated into the team, as this integration only occurs once per cycle. Total
cycle optimum length is 12 months.
   1. Officers assigned to a cyclic-managed unit are synchronized to arrive at the beginning of the sustain phase of the
unit operational cycle. Each officer assigned to this unit remains in the unit for their stabilized tour which is a multiple
of the cycle lengths. Officers will depart during the sustain phase at completion of their 36-month tour but prior to the
unit preparing for its next ready phase. In a cyclic-managed unit, losses are replaced using individual replacements in a
specific grade and MOS to replace the loss of personnel in critical positions. Promotion eligibility windows will be
considered in assignments to cyclic-managed units. If promotion timing causes officers to be excess to the authorized
positions of the unit, the officer will remain in the unit until the next sustain phase. Officers will not be penalized for
working temporarily in a position below their current rank. Movement of personnel within the cyclic-managed unit is at
the discretion of the unit commander.
   2. Junior officers who are branch detailed and assigned to a cyclic-managed unit are not eligible to make the
transition to their controlling branch or attend the transition course until the sustain phase of that unit.
   3. Battalion/brigade command tour length policy does not require adjustment for cyclic-managed units. Changes of
command will be synchronized to occur during a sustain phase.
   4. Officer attendance at military professional development courses is preferred during the sustain phase. Command-
ers may send officers to functional training courses in a TDY and return at any time except during an operational
deployment.
   (c) Stabilization. The stabilization strategy is a set of policy and regulatory constraints, overlaid on the existing
personnel system, that provide for longer initial tours at selected major continental United States (CONUS) locations.
The goal is to stabilize Soldiers and Families for as long as possible, moving them only to support requirements based
upon needs of the Army, leader development, and Soldier preference. Stabilization through company level assignments
would optimize cohesion within the units. For commissioned officers, stabilization must be balanced with the need to
broaden their developmental experience. For example, when captains complete professional development courses, such
as the Captain Career Course (CCC), they should be assigned to a brigade combat team other than the type in which
they previously served. If the officer served in a heavy brigade combat team as a lieutenant, it is important that the
officer serve in either a Stryker or light brigade combat team or training brigade. This very often means the officer will
be assigned to a different location than where the officer served at as a lieutenant.
   1. Stabilization is primarily at CONUS installations which house table of organization and equipment (TOE)
maneuver combat brigades. Stabilization at other installations is based on those installation’s capabilities to sustain
junior officers for a complete extended initial tour. A majority of the junior officers initially assigned to a CONUS
installation will be stabilized at this first installation for an extended period of time that allows for branch development
at the rank of captain. This initial extended tour may include hardship tours or attendance at leader development
schools (permanent change of station (PCS) with a professional military education (PME) waiver or PCS), but in each
case the officer will return to their stabilization installation. Filling life-cycle units may require officers to attend leader
development schools and PCS to a different installation.
   2. The length of battalion/brigade command tours is under review.
   3. The commander, in consultation with AHRC, will have greater influence over procedures in selection and
attendance for officer personnel at military schools. However, officers will not normally attend military schools under
conditions that will permanently remove them from their stabilization unit prior to branch development assignments as
a captain.
   4. Stabilization supports transition to UFS and will generally be established first. A unit designated for management
under either concept of UFS will still fall under the stabilization of the parent installation.
   (d) Manning. The Army force generation (ARFORGEN) system sets conditions for commanders to teams that are
ready to meet the Combatant Commander’s needs, build highly cohesive combat teams for the Combatant Command-
er’s use. The ARFORGEN is a readiness initiative and not a personnel stabilization initiative. While it is true that
Soldier will have more predictability with ARFORGEN, it is not a means to stabilize the force. It is a readiness issue to
ensure the U.S. Army has trained and ready forces to provide the Combatant Commander.

1–11. Officer Evaluation System overview
The Officer Evaluation Reporting System (OERS) is a subsystem of officer evaluations. The primary function of OERS
is to provide information from the organizational chain of command to be used by HQDA for officer personnel
decisions. This critical information is documented on the DA Form 67–9 (Officer Evaluation Report) (OER) and the
DA Form 1059 (Service School Academic Evaluation Report) (AER). The information contained on these evaluation
reports is correlated with the Army’s needs and individual officer qualifications to provide the basis for officer
personnel actions such as promotion, functional description, retention in grade, elimination, retention on Active Duty,
reduction in force, command and project manager designation, school selection, and assignment. An equally important
function of OERS is to encourage the professional development of the officer corps through structured performance
and developmental assessment and counseling. The OERS is an important tool for leaders and mentors to counsel
officers on the values and any specific elements of the Army Leadership Doctrine necessary to improve performance
and enhance potential.
Chapter 2
Officer Leader Development
2–1. Leader development overview
The goal of Army leader development is to produce agile and adaptive expeditionary leaders who are knowledgeable
and experienced enough to confidently conduct operations anywhere along the full spectrum of conflict under the
conditions of any operational theater. Army leaders must be able to frame and analyze their environment across a
multitude of operational variables — political, military, economic, social, information, infrastructure, physical environ-
ment, and time. Our leaders must be able to defeat an enemy who presents asymmetric threats, who is a fleeting target
and embedded in the populace, who is adaptive and unpredictable, who has the capability to shift between irregular and
conventional warfare, and who is a near peer enemy capable of conventional offense and defense operations as well.
Our officer leaders must have the skill to fight among the populace, denying support to our adversaries while
encouraging support to the local government. Leaders must also remain fully prepared to take the offensive when
necessary to engage multiple adversaries with multiple agendas simultaneously. The leader and functional com-
petencies we develop through training and experience must provide us with the capability to successfully interact at the
human level with not only our own Soldiers, but with joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational partners;
the indigenous populace and government; and with local, U.S., and international media. To develop this complex and
comprehensive set of leader capabilities requires a strategy that employs military and civilian education, leverages
experience gained during assignments in operational or generating force units, and self-development activities that are
broad ranging. This strategy must produce a steady flow of agile leaders who are proficient in core leader and
functional competencies across the Operational themes and comfortable with risk. Leader competencies for Full
Spectrum Operations will expand to encompass cross-cultural communications, language, and the ability to enable
economic development, governance, and conflict resolution through negotiation.
2–2. Leader development process
Pursuit of the strategy outlined above employs the three domains of leader development — institutional training,
operational assignments, and self-development. These domains define and engage a continuous cycle of education,
training, selection, experience, assessment, feedback, reinforcement, and evaluation. Learning, experience, and feed-
back provide the basis for professional growth. Overall, the leader development process enhances leader capabilities so
leaders can assume positions of greater responsibility. The over-arching priority of the leader development process is to
develop agile and adaptive leaders of character and competence who act to achieve decisive results and who understand
and are able to exploit the full potential of current and future Army doctrine.
2–3. Domains of leader development
   a. Institutional training. The institutional Army (schools and training centers) is the foundation for lifelong learning.
During institutional training, leaders learn the knowledge, skills and attributes essential to high-quality leadership while
training to perform critical tasks. When these leadership dimensions are tested, reinforced and strengthened by follow-
on operational assignments and meaningful self-development programs, leaders attain and sustain true competency in
the profession of arms. Institutional training provides the solid foundation upon which all future development rests.
Institutional training supports the progressive, sequential education and training required to develop branch/functional
area technical and tactical competencies, as well as the core dimensions of leadership. The bedrock of institutional
training at all levels among company grade, field grade and warrant officers is taught in the small group instructional
(SGI) format where greater emphasis is placed on an individual student officer’s contribution to, and participation in,
the learning process.
   b. Operational assignments. Operational assignments constitute the second domain of leader development. Upon
completion of institutional training, leaders are ideally assigned to operational positions. This operational experience
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                                7

provides them the opportunity to use, hone and build on what they learned through the formal education process.
Experience gained through on-the-job training in a variety of challenging assignments and additional duties prepares
officers to lead and train Soldiers, both in garrison and ultimately in combat. The commander or leader in the unit
plays a significant and instrumental role in this area. Commanders and other senior leaders are particularly responsible
for mentoring that is vital to the development of junior officers. They introduce the officer to their unit and establish
leader development programs. They explain both unit and individual performance standards, and provide periodic
assessments and continual feedback to develop the officer. Beyond accomplishing the mission on a daily basis,
developing subordinate leaders is a professional responsibility, which must be carried out to guarantee the quality of
our future leaders.
   c. Self-development. Learning is a lifelong process. Institutional training and operational assignments alone do not
ensure that Army officers attain and sustain the degree of competency needed to perform their varied missions. The
profession of arms requires comprehensive self-study and training. Leaders must commit to a lifetime of professional
and personal growth to stay at the cutting edge of their profession. They must keep pace with changing operational
requirements, new technologies, common weapons platforms, and evolving doctrines. Every officer is responsible for
his or her own self-development. Self-assessment and taking appropriate remedial or reinforcing action is critical to a
leader’s success. Self-development programs include activities that stretch the individual beyond the demands of on-
the-job or institutional training. Self-development, consisting of individual study, research, professional reading,
practice and self-assessment, is accomplished via numerous means (studying, observing and experiencing), and is
consistent with an officer’s personal self-development action plan and professional goals. Self-development is the key
aspect of individual officer qualification that solidifies the Army leader development process.
2–4. Leader principles
Six principles are inherent in officer development and career management. These principles serve as a frame of
reference for the individual officer, commander, mentor and branch and functional area proponents.
   a. Leader development is doctrinally based with FM 1–0 providing the foundation for our warfighting doctrine. It
articulates the constitutional and legal basis for our being, the national security objectives, the spectrum of warfare and
our beliefs concerning the profession of arms to include the professional Army ethic and values. FM 3–0 is our
keystone warfighting doctrine for subordinate and tactical level doctrine, professional education and individual and unit
training. FM 7–0 tells us how we should train, including the senior leader’s role. FM 6–22 outlines the core dimensions
of leadership and the basis for leadership excellence. Together, these references provide the foundation needed to
develop competent, confident leaders capable of assuming positions of greater responsibility and create the conditions
for sustained organizational success.
   b. Leader development programs should be responsive to the environment, including such factors as law, policy,
resources, force structure, world situation, technology, and professional development.
   c. An officer’s success should be measured in terms of contribution. An officer’s professional goals are directly
related to his or her own definition of success in the profession of arms.
   d. High-quality Soldiers deserve high-quality leaders. This principle is the heart of leader development and breathes
life into all aspects of the seven Army fundamental imperatives — training, force mix, doctrine, modern equipment,
quality people, leader development, and facilities.
   e. We recognize as a philosophy that leaders can be developed. While a principle in itself, it is inextricably linked to
the philosophy of shared responsibilities among the individual leaders; the schoolhouses, branches and functional area
proponents throughout the Army; and the commanders in the field.
   f. Leader development is cooperative and holistic. The individual officer, unit commanders, mentors and Army
educational institutions all share in the responsibility for developing leaders at every level.
2–5. Leader development and the Officer Education System
   a. Company and field grade officers. The Officer Education System (OES) provides the formal military educational
foundation to company and field grade officers necessary to prepare them for increased responsibilities and successful
performance at the next higher level. Its goal is to produce a broad-based corps of leaders who possess the necessary
values, attributes and skills to perform their duties in service to the nation. These leaders must know how the Army
runs and demonstrate confidence, integrity, critical judgment, and responsibility while operating in an environment of
complexity, ambiguity, and rapid change. To build effective teams capable of supporting joint and multinational
operations in this environment, they must be adaptable, creative, and bold amid continuous organizational and
technological change. The OES is discussed in more detail here in chapter 4, Officer Education. The following
paragraphs highlight key aspects of officer development—
   (1) Common core. Common core is the consolidation of common skills training and training subjects prescribed by
law, Army regulations or other higher authority. These subjects comprise the tasks all officers are expected to perform
successfully, regardless of branch. Common core instruction begins at pre-commissioning and continues at each
educational level. The instruction is progressive and sequential, building upon the skills and knowledge acquired
through previous training and operational assignments.
   (2) Entry-level officer training. Basic Officer Leadership Course (BOLC). To address shortcomings identified by the
8                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

ATLDP (Officer) study, the Army implemented the BOLC. The objective of the BOLC is to develop technically
competent and confident platoon leaders, regardless of branch, who are grounded in leadership, basic technical and
tactical skill proficiency, are physically and mentally strong, and embody the warrior ethos. To achieve this objective,
BOLC capitalizes on experience-based training, logically structured to build upon and reinforce previous lessons. The
BOLC occurs in three phases. The BOLC I is pre-commissioning training conducted by the traditional pre-commission-
ing sources. It provides the foundation of common core skills, knowledge, and attributes desired of all newly
commissioned lieutenants. The BOLC II is a common block of instruction designed to further develop all new Army
lieutenants into competent small-unit leaders with a common warfighting focus and warrior ethos. The BOLC III
consists of branch-specific technical and tactical training conducted at branch school locations. The BOLC-DCO is a
course designed to give direct commission officers, who do not have the benefit of BOLC I pre-commissioning
training, the necessary skills to achieve success at BOLC II. See chapter 4, paragraph 4–7a for further discussion on
BOLC.
   (3) Captains’ Officer Education System.Captain Career Course. The branch CCC prepares company grade officers to
command Soldiers at the company, troop or battery level, and to serve as staff officers at battalion and brigade levels.
Active Army (AA) officers incur a one-year Active Duty service obligation for attendance at a branch CCC upon
completion or termination of the course. Officers attend CCC following selection for promotion to the grade of captain,
normally before company level command. Select captains who have demonstrated superior performance in their basic
branches may be selected to receive this training at other than their branch schools. (For example, a field artillery
officer might attend the CCC for armor officers.) This cross training benefits officers of both branches. Officers
seeking accession into Special Forces will normally attend the Maneuver CCC. The captains’ PME centers on the
technical, tactical and leadership competencies needed for success in follow-on assignments. See chapter 4, paragraph
4–7d for further discussion on CCC.
   (4) Intermediate level education. The ILE is the Army’s formal education program for majors. It is a tailored
resident education program designed to prepare new field-grade officers for their next 10 years of service. It produces
field-grade officers with a warrior ethos and joint, expeditionary mindset, who are grounded in warfighting doctrine,
and who have the technical, tactical, and leadership competencies to be successful at more senior levels in their
respective branch or functional area. ILE consists of a common core phase of operational instruction offered to all
officers, and a tailored education phase (qualification course) tied to the technical requirements of the officer’s branch
or functional area. See chapter 4, paragraph 4–7e for further discussion of ILE.
   (5) Senior Service College. The SSC provides senior-level professional military education and leader development
training. The Army’s SSC, the U.S. Army War College (USAWC), prepares military, civilian and international leaders
to assume strategic leadership responsibilities in military or national security organizations. It educates students about
employment of the U.S. Army as part of a unified, joint or multinational force in support of the national military
strategy; requires research into operational and strategic issues; and conducts outreach programs that benefit the nation.
See chapter 4, paragraph 4–7g for further discussion of SSC.
   b. Warrant officers.
   (1) The ATLDP Warrant Officer Study recommended that the Army make a fuller integration of warrant officers
into the larger officer corps. In recognition of expanding leadership roles for warrant officers in the future force, the
study called for a single, world-class, leader development education system that would have distinct components for
warrant officer, company-grade, and field-grade officers. The study also called for combining warrant officer, compa-
ny-grade, and field-grade officer training, as appropriate, wherever required common officer skills are taught.
   (2) The goal of warrant officer training and education within OES is to produce highly specialized expert officers,
leaders, and trainers who are fully competent in technical, tactical, and leadership skills; creative problem solvers able
to function in highly complex and dynamic environments; and proficient operators, maintainers, administrators, and
managers of the Army’s equipment, support activities, and technical systems. Warrant officer leader development is a
continuous lifelong learning process beginning with pre-appointment training and education. The OES prepares warrant
officers to successfully perform in increasing levels of responsibility throughout an entire career. The OES provides the
pre-appointment, branch MOS-specific, and leader development training needed to produce technically and tactically
competent warrant officer leaders for assignment to platoon, detachment, company, battalion, and higher-level
organizations.
   (3) Common core is the consolidation of common skills training and training prescribed by law, Army regulations or
other higher authority. It comprises the tasks all officers are expected to perform successfully regardless of branch.
Common core instruction begins at pre-appointment and continues at each educational level. The instruction is
progressive and sequential and builds upon the skills and knowledge acquired through previous training and operational
assignments.
   (4) Pre-appointment training qualifies individuals to serve as officers. The purposes of pre-appointment training are
to educate and train candidates, assess their readiness and potential for appointment to warrant officer, and prepare
them for progressive and continuing development. All AA and U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) warrant officer candidates
must attend the resident Warrant Officer Candidate School (WOCS) at Fort Rucker, AL. The Army National Guard
(ARNG) warrant officer candidates can attend various states’ two-phased WOCS at regional training institutes (RTIs)
in lieu of WOCS at Fort Rucker. The WOCS graduates are appointed to warrant officer one, grade W1. The
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                               9

appointment is contingent upon certification by the MOS proponent that the warrant officer is technically and tactically
qualified to serve in the authorized warrant officer MOS.
   (5) Warrant Officer Basic Course. The WOBCs are branch-specific qualification courses that ensure newly ap-
pointed warrant officers receive the MOS-specific training and technical certification needed to perform in the MOS at
the platoon through brigade levels. Training is performance oriented and focuses on technical skills, leadership,
effective communication, unit training, maintenance operations, security, property accountability, tactics, and develop-
ment of subordinates.
   (6) Warrant Officer Advanced Course. The WOAC is a combination of common core and MOS proponent training
that prepares the officer to serve in senior positions at the CW3 level. The WOAC includes two phases: a nonresident
common core module and a resident phase, which includes a common core module and MOS specific module. See
chapter 4, paragraph 4–7i(3) for further discussion of WOAC.
   (7) Warrant Officer Staff Course. The WOSC is a branch-immaterial resident course which focuses on staff officer
and leadership skills needed to prepare them for duty in W4 grade technician and staff officer positions at battalion and
higher levels. Instruction includes decisionmaking, staff roles and functions, organizational theory, structure of the
Army, budget formation and execution, communication, training management, personnel management, the contempo-
rary operational environment (COE), and special leadership issues. It is designed to produce officers with a warrior
ethos who are grounded in warfighting doctrine and possess the technical, tactical and leadership competencies to be
successful at more senior levels. See chapter 4, paragraph 4–7i(4) for further discussion of WOSC.
   (8) Warrant Officer Senior Staff Course (WOSSC). The WOSSC is currently the capstone course for warrant officer
professional military education. It is a branch-immaterial resident course which provides master-level professional
warrant officers with a broader Army-level perspective required for assignment to W5 grade level positions as
technical, functional, and branch systems integrators, trainers, and leaders at the highest organizational levels. See
chapter 4, paragraph 4–7i(5) for further discussion of WOSSC.
Chapter 3
Officer Personnel Management System and Career Management
3–1. Purpose
The OPMS is executed by the U.S. Army Human Resources Command (AHRC) Officer Personnel Management
Directorate (OPMD). The purpose of OPMS is to:
   a. Acquire. Identify, recruit, select and prepare individuals for service as officers in our Army.
   b. Develop. Maximize officer performance and potential through training and education in accordance with AR
350–1, assignment, self-development and certification of officers to build agile and adaptive leaders.
   c. Utilize. Assign officers with the appropriate skills, experience and competencies to meet Army requirements and
promote continued professional development.
   d. Sustain. Retaining officers with the appropriate skills, experience, competencies and manner of performance to
meet Army requirements and promote continued professional development.
   e. Promote. Identify and advance officers with the appropriate skills, experience, competencies, manner of perform-
ance and demonstrated potential to meet Army requirements.
   f. Transition. Separate officers from the Army in a manner that promotes a lifetime of support to the Service.
3–2. Factors affecting the Officer Personnel Management System
Various factors continuously influence the environment in which OPMS operates. In turn, changes in that environment
necessitate continuous adjustments and alterations of policy by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G–1 (DCS, G–1). Factors
that influence OPMS policy are:
   a. Law. Congress passes legislation that impacts on officer professional development through required changes in
related Army policy.
   (1) The Defense Officer Personnel Management Act of 1981 created Active Duty strength limits for officers in
grades above chief warrant officer, promotion flow and timing points and the integration of Regular Army (RA) and
other than Regular Army (OTRA) into common patterns.
   (2) The Department of Defense (DOD) Reorganization Act of 1986 (Goldwater-Nichols Act) instituted joint officer
management provisions requiring a number of officers in the Army to serve in joint duty assignments as field grade
officers.
   (3) The 1986 Public Law 99–145 specified the acquisition experiences and education necessary for an officer to be
the project manager of major weapon systems. This law later led to the creation of the Army Acquisition Corps.
   (4) Warrant officer professional development is influenced directly by laws limiting the size of the Army and
budgetary concerns. The 1986 law also aligned Army warrant officers to those of the other services in that all
appointments to chief warrant officer (CW2 through CW5) would be by commissioning. In 1991, the Warrant Officer
10                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

Management Act created a uniform system for warrant officer grade management and control similar to the one used to
manage company and field grade officers (DOPMA).
   (5) The 1995 Defense Authorization Act included the ROPMA to align reserve forces with DOPMA. It was
intended to standardize personnel management for reserve officers of all services by providing flexibility in personnel
management for reserve officers.
   b. Policy. New laws often create changes in policy. The provisions of this document are in accordance with current
law and policy. Changes to those laws and policies will affect future versions of this document.
   c. Budget. The size and composition of the officer corps, accessions, strength management, promotion rates and pin-
on-points, schooling, education programs and PCS timing are but a few areas affected by budget decisions and
subsequent policies.
   d. Officer Personnel Management System vision. The OPMS vision includes the overarching concept of growing and
developing agile and adaptive leaders for 21st-century full spectrum operations. FM 3–0 states that agile and adaptive
leaders are—
   (1) Competent in their core proficiencies.
   (2) Broad enough to operate across the spectrum of conflict.
   (3) Able to operate in joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational environments and leverage other
capabilities in achieving their objective.
   (4) Culturally astute and able to use this awareness and understanding to conduct operations innovatively.
   (5) Courageous enough to see and exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the operational
environment.
   (6) Grounded in Army Values and warrior ethos.
   e. Proponent strategy. Each branch/functional area has a proponent responsible for coordinating the development of
its officer population. These duties are executed, in part, by the publication of this pamphlet. To fulfill these
requirements the proponent must:
   (1) Project future requirements for officer skills and sustain or modify elements of force structure and inventory to
meet future needs.
   (2) Define the three domains of leader development: institutional, operational and self-development balanced be-
tween the specific requirements for their particular skill and specialty and the broader developmental requirements
defined by the respective functional category proponents and the Army.
   (3) Articulate competencies required for specific branches, functional areas or AOC/MOS by grade, and provide
general guidance on TOE/TDA positions, educational and training opportunities that enable development of those
competencies.
   (4) Develop generic patterns of officer development embodied in branch and functional area officer development
models. These models are used by OPMD assignment branches to execute the proponent professional development
programs, but are not intended as prescriptions for a path to success in the Army.
   (5) As proponents modify officer skill requirements or development models to meet changing conditions, OPMS and
this pamphlet will be modified.
   f. Officer needs. The OPMS responds to the mission and requirements of the Army and attempts to balance force
structure requirements, officer professional development, and individual needs and preferences of the officer.
3–3. Officer Personnel Management System
   a. The Officer Personnel Management System. The OPMS is an evolutionary system that balances the needs of the
Army with the aspirations and developmental requirements of the entire officer corps; warrant, company and field
grade. Inherently flexible, the system is designed to respond to a variety of doctrinal, proponent, commander and
individual initiatives to meet emerging needs. Additionally, a biannual review process monitored by the Chief of Staff,
Army ensures that OPMS continues to adapt to changing Army requirements. Flexibility is embedded in OPMS
subsystems, which are interrelated and affected by each other’s changes. These subsystems are:
   (1) Strength management. The number of officers, by grade and specialty, are defined by Army requirements, law,
budget and policy. The combination of these factors results in the determination of the numbers of officers to access,
promote, develop, assign and separate. Since each of these factors is dynamic, the number, grade and branch of officers
within the inventory are also dynamic. As Army requirements for force structure change, the officer inventory will also
change and be realigned to meet the needs of the resulting force structure.
   (2) Assignments. Officers are assigned to fulfill current and future Army requirements while meeting the profes-
sional development needs of the various branches, functional areas and functional categories. This is balanced with the
best interests of the officers against the Army requirements.
   (3) Professional development. Each branch, functional area or officer skill proponent defines the appropriate mix of
education, training and assignments needed by the officer corps at each grade level within the context of the
overarching requirement to develop agile and adaptive leaders. The demands of each specialty balanced with broaden-
ing opportunities are reflected in subsequent branch or proponent chapters as life-cycle development models. The
AHRC must develop each officer, both active and reserve components, by using these models while balancing Army
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            11

requirements. To ensure the professional development of all officers, AHRC operates in concert with various responsi-
ble agents to include: the individual officer; the Army and branch proponents; the Army DCS, G–3/5/7; commanders in
the field and the senior Army leadership. Officer professional development is a responsibility shared by all. Life-cycle
development models portray the full range of training, education, and experiences for the development of our future
leaders.
   (4) Evaluation. The Army officer structure is pyramidal. The apex contains very few senior grades in relation to the
wider base. Advancement to increasingly responsible positions is based on relative measures of performance and
potential. The mechanism to judge the value of an individual’s performance and potential is the Officer Evaluation
Report described in detail in chapter 6. All OPMS subsystems are affected by the evaluation report. Promotion, school
selection, functional designation and command and key billet selection, retention in service, and development opportu-
nities are all based on the information contained in the OER.
   (5) Centralized selection. The hub around which all the subsystems revolve is centralized selection. Strength
management, professional development and evaluation of individual contribution occur in the series of centralized
Department of the Army and AHRC selection boards for retention, career status, schooling, promotion, field grade
command designation and selective early retirement. These boards employ evaluation reports, competency guidance
and strength requirements to advance individuals to the next stage of professional development. Officers generally flow
through the centralized selection subsystem by groupings based on date of rank (DOR). Company and field grade
officer groupings are termed cohort year groups. Warrant officer groupings are called the inclusive zone of eligibility.
Each board is preceded by a zone announcement that specifies the makeup of the cohort or inclusive zone. Centralized
selection perpetuates the ideals, cultural values, ethics and professional standards of the Army by advancing and
retaining only those individuals best qualified to assume positions of greater responsibility. Centralized selection has
evolved over time to account for the impact of law, policy, budget, Army and officer needs, and proponent vision.
   (6) Review process. The officer personnel management system was designed to be reviewed periodically. At the
discretion of the Chief of Staff of the Army, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, DCS, G–1 and the Commander,
U.S. Army Human Resources Command, will conduct a review of OPMS to determine the health of the system and to
recommend changes.
   b. A comprehensive system. The OPMS model is a developmental system focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation at the 4th or 7th year develops both specific and broad functional competencies.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation it is then that they should strive to get training and
assignments that will give them the additional skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These training and
assignments are outside one’s normal career path and are joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational in
nature.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so on.
   (6) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments, ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also to support unit readiness and cohesion. The functionally aligned design is
the heart of OPMS and is intended to align branches and functional areas, consistent with joint doctrine, focusing on
development of agile and adaptive leaders with broader, functionally relevant competencies.

                                          Figure 3–1. Officer Competency Evolution
   (7) Officers will be managed by categories and groups with similar functions to facilitate the development of officer
functional competencies required on the future battlefield. The design is not intended to reflect where officers serve on
the battlefield, but to align the functions and skills required. The three functional categories and associated functional
groups are:
   (a) Maneuver, Fires and Effects (MFE). This functional category gathers maneuver branches and functional areas
that have similar battlefield application or complementary roles. This grouping is comprised of the following functional
groups, with the branches and functional areas listed:
   1. Maneuver: Armor (19), Infantry (11), and Aviation (15).
   2. Fires: Field Artillery (13) and Air Defense Artillery (14).
   3. Maneuver Support: Engineer (12), Chemical (74), and Military Police (31).
   4. Special Operations Forces (SOF): Special Forces (18), Psychological Operations (37) and Civil Affairs (38).
NOTE: Per AR 5–22, the CG, USASOC, is the proponent for Army Special Operations Forces (ARSOF). This includes
Special Forces, Psychological Operations, and Civil Affairs branches, and 75th Ranger Regiment, Special Operations
Aviation and Special Mission units. The CG, USAJFKSWCS is the branch proponent for Special Forces, Psychological
Operations, and Civil Affairs.
   5. Effects: Public Affairs (46) and Information Operations (30).
   (b) Operations Support (OS): This functional category gathers two currently existing branches, Military Intelligence
and Signal, with functional areas that have similar battlefield applications or complementary roles. Also included in this
functional category are the functions associated with force training, development and education that design, build, and
train the force. The category is comprised of the following:
   1. Network & Space Operations: Signal Corps (25), plus Information Systems Management (53), Telecommunica-
tion Systems Engineer (24), and Space Operations (40).
   2. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) & Area Expertise: Military Intelligence (35), Strategic
Intelligence (34), and Foreign Area Officer (FAO) (48).
   3. Plans development: Strategic Plans and Policy (59) and Nuclear and Counterproliferation (52).

   4. Forces development: Force Management (50), Operations Research/Systems Analysis (ORSA) (49), and Simula-
tion Operations (57).
   5. Education and Training: Permanent Academy Professor (47).
   (c) Force Sustainment (FS): This functional category highlights the formation of a Logistics Corps (previously
approved by the Chief of Staff, Army (CSA) and in development by the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC)).
This category is comprised of all branches and functional areas associated with logistics, resource and Soldier support
functions:
   1. Integrated Logistics Corps: Transportation Corps (88), Ordnance (91), and Quartermaster (92), plus Logistics
Branch (90).
   2. Soldier Support: Human Resources (42H), and Financial Management (36).
   3. Acquisition Corps (51): as currently organized.
   4. Health Services (HS): Army Medical Department (AMEDD) Corps (Medical, Dental, Veterinary, Nurse, Medical
Specialist and Medical Services).
   5. Special Branches: Chaplain, Judge Advocate General (JAG)
3–4. Officer development
   a. Officer Personnel Management System. Under OPMS, company grade officers are accessed into the Army’s basic
branches, and through a series of educational and developmental assignments are given the opportunity to hold branch
developmental assignments outlined by their proponent. During their company grade years, captains are designated into
one of three officer functional categories (MFE, OS, FSD) in which they continue their development either in their
basic branch or in a functional area. Officers in the Reserve Components will also undergo functional designation with
their Active Army counterparts; but modification to the process is necessary to accommodate personnel management
considerations unique to the ARNG/USAR. Accessioning policies for the Army Acquisition Corps and SOF are unique
and are addressed in their respective chapters.
   b. Development objectives. One of the major objectives of OPMS is to professionally develop officers through a
series of developmental experiences including operational experiences, institutional education and self-development
nested with counseling and mentoring from commanders, branch proponent and Officer Personnel Management
Directorate, AHRC. These interactions are embodied in the process of officer development:
   (1) Development in a designated specialty. In the ACC, there are 34 branch and functional area specialties in
OPMS. The differences between a branch and functional area are:
   (a) Branch. A branch is a grouping of officers that comprises an arm or service of the Army and is the specialty in
which all officers are commissioned or transferred, trained and developed. Company grade officers hold a single branch
designation and may serve in repetitive and progressive assignments associated with the branch. They may not be
assigned to more than one branch. (Also see AR 310–25 for this and related definitions.) See chapter 8, paragraph 8–2
for further discussion of officer branches.
   (b) Functional area (FA). A functional area is a grouping of officers by technical specialty or skills other than an
arm, service or branch that usually requires unique education, training and experience. After functional designation,
functional area officers may serve repetitive and progressive assignments within their functional area. An officer may
not be assigned to more than one functional area at a time. See chapter 8 for further discussion of functional areas.
   (2) Key terms in operational assignments. A number of terms are used when describing operational assignments:
   (a) Command. The command is the authority that a commander in the military service lawfully exercises over
subordinates by virtue of rank or assignment. The command comprises the leadership, authority, responsibility, and
accountability for effectively using available resources and planning the employment of, organizing, directing, coordi-
nating, and controlling military forces to accomplish assigned missions. It includes responsibility for unit readiness,
health, welfare, morale, and discipline of assigned personnel.
   (b) Key billet. A duty assignment at the lieutenant colonel or colonel rank requiring specific, highly developed skills
and experience that is deemed so critical to a unit’s mission that an officer is selected for assignment by Headquarters
Department of the Army. Key billet officers exercise judgment and recommend actions to the commander. They
principally manage resources and oversee processes that operate in a leadership environment.
   (c) Centralized Selection List (CSL). A listing of command/key billet positions by type category approved by CG,
AHRC to be filled by officers selected under the Centralized Command/Key Billet Selection System.
   (d) Key developmental positions. These positions are specified, by branch or functional area in DA Pam 600–3, and
revised periodically. A key developmental position is one that is deemed fundamental to the development of an officer
in his or her core branch or functional area competencies or deemed critical by the senior Army leadership to provide
experience across the Army’s strategic mission. The majority of these positions fall within the scope of the officer’s
branch or functional area mission. Some examples of positions deemed critical by the Army leadership are the major
grade positions in TTs or PRTs held for 12 months (MILPER Message 08–175).
   (e) Developmental positions. All officer positions are developmental. They enhance some aspect of warfighting
skills, increase their level of responsibility, develop their understanding of interoperability among Army branches, or
expose them to branch related generating force/JIIM opportunities that directly contribute to success as an agile and
14                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

adaptive leader. Developmental positions that provide exposure to experiences outside the officer’s core branch or
functional area competencies are considered broadening assignments. Broadening assignments develop a wider range of
knowledge and skills, augment understanding of the full spectrum of Army missions, promote practical application of
language training or increase cross cultural exposure, and expand officer awareness of other governmental agencies,
units or environments.
   (3) Institutional education (Officer Education System). Training and education of an officer is driven by operational
demands of an officer. The AR 350–1 is the primary regulation governing officer training and education. This includes
resident and nonresident instruction, on-the-job training, individual study and when appropriate, civilian education.
   (4) Professional development counseling and mentoring. This is conducted by commanders at all levels as well as
by AHRC career managers.
   (5) Designation and election of branches, functional areas and functional categories.
   (a) Branch designation. Upon commissioning, lieutenants are designated in a basic branch for entry on Active Duty,
training and initial assignment. When required, some lieutenants are branch detailed to a combat arms branch for 3 or 4
years, or until their life-cycle or cyclic units are in a reset period. Under the branch detail program, officers attend the
company grade level education at the school of the branch to which they are detailed. Company grade officers in the 4-
year detail program receive transition branch training in conjunction with their enrollment in the captain’s level
education. During the early years of service, professional development within the branch follows the proponent’s life-
cycle model. Generally, the first 8 years of service are devoted to branch developmental assignments and training that
prepares the company grade officer for further advancement. Company grade officers may request, in writing, a
voluntary branch transfer in accordance with AR 614–100, paragraph 4–2. Detailed officers must be approved for
branch transfer by their detail branch, basic branch and AHRC (AHRC–OPD–C), in addition to meeting the require-
ments of AR 614–100. Prior to selection for promotion to captain, officers may volunteer for SOF (Special Forces,
Psychological Operations or Civil Affairs) training and, upon successful completion of training, will receive a branch
transfer into their respective branch. Selection for SOF training is made by cohort year group and upon selection for
promotion to captain. The U.S. Army Recruiting Command (USAREC) Special Operations Recruiting Battalion
recruits SOF officer volunteers in accordance with the force stabilization procedures outlined in AR 600–35. The SOF
officers are expected to have served a successful initial tour as a lieutenant in a small unit leadership position in one of
the Army’s other basic branches. As a result, they are expected to have knowledge of conventional Army operations
and be experienced in Army leadership. Lieutenants who volunteer in the targeted year group are selected by a DA
centralized SOF accession board at approximately three years of commissioned service and then go to a designated
Captain Career Course to qualify for continued Special Operations officer training.
   (b) Functional designation (FD). The Army Competitive Category (ACC) groups interrelated branches and func-
tional areas into officer management categories called functional categories and functional groups. The functional
designation process determines in which specialty they will continue their development; either in their branch or in
their functional area. Management of officer development in functional categories recognizes the need to balance
specialization of the officer corps with the inherent requirement for officers to gain more breadth in an increasingly
complex environment. Officers will have two opportunities for FD during their company grade years: at their fourth
year of service (YOS), and then at their seventh YOS. The four-year FD Board will allow a small number of officers to
be designated into select functional areas that have critical modification table of organization and equipment (MTOE)
positions to fill. It is designed to identify and target officers with critical skills early, allowing them to get trained and
bring their skills to bear as quickly as possible. The seven-year FD Board is designed to distribute the remainder of the
force into the three functional categories. The intent of this board is to fill requirements and provide the functional
areas enough time to send their officers to school and training prior to utilization. The FD process is carried out by a
HQDA centralized board. As in centralized selection, these boards consider officer education, training and experience;
evaluation reports; life-cycle development models; officer preferences; and strength requirements to ensure that the
needs of the Army are met for future field grade officer requirements in each functional category. Each functional
category has its own unique characteristics and development model for officers, which reflects the readiness require-
ments of the Army today and into the 21st century. Officers in all functional categories are assigned across the Army in
TOE and TDA organizations.
   (c) Joint Duty Assignment (JDA). The Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL), and its subset, the Joint Critical billets,
award joint credit to our officers. Assignments are usually preceded by JPME I, completed at ILE (CSC). The Joint
Critical billets are typically filled by Joint Qualified Officers (JQO), those with a previously completed joint tour, plus
JPME II, completed at JFSC or in a SSC. All of these positions, plus numerous others involve assignments/experiences
in the joint, interagency, intergovernmental, or multinational environment, but are not subject to the control measures
of the JDAL (tour length, JPME, promotion monitoring). Section 3–13 goes into greater detail on this subject.
   c. Generalist positions. Some positions in the Army are independent of branch or functional area coding and are
designated as branch/functional area generalist, combat arms generalist positions, or JIIM positions. Some company
and field grade officers should expect to serve in these assignments at various times during their careers, regardless of
their functional designation. Officers are selected for these and other similar positions based on overall manner of
performance, previous experience, military and civilian education and estimated potential for further service.
   d. Focused development. Both branches and functional areas may require more specific job skills and qualifications
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                                 15

to further prepare their officers to meet highly specialized position requirements. These specific skills are called areas
of concentration (AOC). Areas of concentration are described in the branch/functional area chapters of this pamphlet.
   (1) Branch/FA development fosters a mastery of skills, knowledge and attributes for an officer’s grade in a specific
branch or FA. Branch development enables captains to achieve mastery of common core and branch skills, knowledge
and attributes that assures the strong professional development foundation essential for success in the field grades.
Generally speaking branch development for captains equates to completion of an appropriate company grade level
education followed by successful performance as a company grade officer. Branch development for majors results from
completion of an approved field grade intermediate level education and successful performance in a branch or FA
assignment. During an officer’s field grade years, OPMS allows for the broadening of an officer’s development from
mastery of branch skills to more multifunctional skills. Branch officers have the opportunity, and are encouraged to,
expand their knowledge and skills beyond their specific branch through multiple avenues. These opportunities,
advanced civilian schooling (ACS), assignments in cross-branch/FA, and the use of JIIM assignments will enhance the
development of officers for the increasingly demanding requirements required to lead Soldiers today and in the future.
Functional area officers will also be provided the opportunity to broaden their development through the use of cross-
branch/FA and JIIM assignments.
   (2) The spectrum of military operations in the contemporary operating environment requires that Army officers be
competent at many tasks often performed in combat zones that fall outside the scope of traditional direct combat. Once
the goals of military combat operations are achieved, Army officers will be required to provide assistance to partner
nation organizations as they take the steps to re-establish societal foundations, provide security cooperation, guide
resource allocation for infrastructure reconstruction, and stabilize various governmental functions. These transitional
functions may alternate with combat operations as an embedded part of the partner nation security force. The tasks
associated with transition from direct combat to social stability and recovery will be a major part of our full spectrum
engagement in theaters of interest now and for the foreseeable future. Personnel requirements for transitional functions
will evolve as teams with labels such as Military Transition Team, Special Police Transition Team, Border Team,
Provincial Reconstruction Team, or other names, grow from our experience with current and future operations. The
invaluable experience that officers gain serving in assignments to these challenging team positions will enhance their
ability to serve in future leadership roles in the current operational environment. Assignments to such teams are
considered key developmental opportunities for officer career development. The broad exposure to local leaders,
government functionaries, nongovernmental agencies and international aid organizations will enhance an officer’s
interoperability in joint environments. Officers should seek to serve in these positions as part of their normal career
progression. Service in Transition Team positions will not preclude officers from further assignments to key develop-
mental positions specific to their branch or functional area.
   e. Promotion. Under OPMS, majors and lieutenant colonels compete for promotion from within their respective
functional categories. Selection for promotion is based on the fundamentals of performance and potential for further
service. These are measured by the officer’s relative standing with his peers as indicated in the evaluation reports,
assignment history and branch, functional area and JIIM development opportunities afforded. The selection boards are
instructed as to the number of field grade officers to select based on Army needs, law, policy and budget. Additionally,
the boards receive guidance on the officer qualities expected for promotion. All of this information is contained in the
Secretary of the Army’s Memorandum of Instruction (MOI) issued to the board. Members of the board use DA Pam
600–3 to determine branch and functional area qualifications. Congress and the Secretary of the Army approve
promotion selection lists prior to publication.
3–5. Company grade development
   a. Branch-specific development. This phase commences upon entry on Active Duty and generally lasts through the
10th year of service (see fig 3–1). Officers begin their professional development by attending the Basic Officer Leader
Course, Phase II (BOLC II), followed by the Basic Officer Leader Course, Phase III (BOLC III). For additional
information on BOLC II and III refer to chapter 4, paragraph 4–7.a through 4–7c.
   (1) Basic education. The BOLC II marks the beginning of a company grade officer’s formal military professional
development training following commissioning. The branch BOLC III prepares officers for their first duty assignment
and provides instruction on methods for training and leading individuals, teams, squads and platoons. Additionally, the
course provides officers with a detailed understanding of equipment, tactics, organization and administration at the
company, battery or troop level.
   (2) Initial assignments. After officers graduate from BOLC II and BOLC III, branch assignment officers in OPMD
will assign the majority of officers to a branch duty position. Included in these assignments are CONUS or overseas
troop units where officers begin to develop their leadership skills. All junior officers should seek leadership positions in
troop units whenever possible. Troop leadership is the best means to become educated in Army operations and builds a
solid foundation for future service.
   (3) Bachelor’s degree. Prior to promotion to captain, officers must complete their baccalaureate degree.
   (4) Captains OES. Officers normally attend their branch Captain Career Course (CCC) following selection for
promotion to the grade of captain. This is the second major branch school officers attend before company level
command. Selected captains deemed to have demonstrated superior performance in their basic branch may be selected
16                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

to receive this training at schools other than their basic branch. A field artillery officer, for example, may attend the
Armor CCC. This cross training benefits officers of both branches. Officers seeking accession into Special Forces will
attend the Infantry CCC. Officers seeking accession into the Psychological Operations or Civil Affairs branches will
attend a designated Captain Career Course. For additional information about Captains OES, see chapter 4, paragraph
4–7d.
   (5) Branch opportunities. All company grade officers must focus their efforts during the company grade years on
mastering the basic skills of their specific branch, regardless of the functional area and functional category they will
later enter. Much of the value an officer brings to a specialized functional area is dependent on experience gained by
leading Soldiers and mastering basic branch skills. Leading Soldiers is the essence of leadership development at this
stage of an officer’s career. Officers who have demonstrated the potential and desire to command Soldiers fill
command positions. The number of company commands within a specific branch may not afford all officers the
opportunity to command at the captain level. Command opportunities for captains are found in traditional tables of
organization and equipment (TOE) line units or tables of distribution and allowances (TDA) units in training, garrison
and headquarters organizations. (Note: This paragraph discusses branch opportunities in general. For information
unique to a particular branch, refer to that branch’s chapter in Part Two of this pamphlet.)
   b. Post-initial branch development. Between the 4th and 7th years of service, and after a company grade officer has
been afforded branch development opportunities, a number of options become available for continued professional
development. At this time, career managers at OPMD assess the officer’s developmental objectives for the post-branch
development phase based on assignment patterns completed, relative manner of performance achieved, individual
preferences and Army requirements available for the next developmental stage (see fig 3–1). The types of assignments
and developmental patterns for this phase are as follows:
   (1) Branch assignments. The range of further assignments to branch-coded positions is a function of the Army’s
requirements and officer availability. These assignments may include staff and faculty positions at service schools,
Combat Training Center (CTC) duty or staff positions in tactical or training units. Branch assignments further develop
the basic branch skills and employ the officer’s accumulated skills, knowledge and attributes.
   (2) Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Some company grade officers may serve in positions coded 01A
(Officer Generalist) or 02A (Combat Arms Generalist). These branch/functional area generalist positions do not require
an officer from a specific branch or functional area but may be performed by an officer with certain experiences,
manner of performance and demonstrated potential. Such assignments include USAREC staff and command positions,
ROTC or USMA faculty and staff, and major command staff positions.
   (3) Functional area specific. Officers designated into functional areas should expect training and education opportu-
nities to focus on their areas of specialization and include progressive and repetitive assignments of increasing
responsibility. Each of the functional area chapters in this pamphlet outlines developmental positions.
   (4) Advanced Civilian Schooling (ACS)/Expanded Graduate School Program (EGSP). Each year some officers will
be provided the opportunity to attend civilian academic institutions to obtain graduate level degrees in designated
disciplines. The final number varies based on budget, policy and Army requirements. These positions are annually
assessed to determine how many officers should be entered into each academic discipline. The criteria for selection are
based on the branch or functional area skill required, academic proficiency measured by undergraduate performance
and scores from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or Graduate Management Admission Test, ability to be
accepted by an accredited college and manner of performance to indicate strong potential for future service. Proponents
must forecast the education and utilization of ACS graduates to meet projected needs since the degrees typically take
12 to 22 months to complete. The specific follow-on assignment or utilization is often determined about 6 to 9 months
prior to graduation. See branch and functional area chapters for discussion of ACS/EGSP requirements. AR 621–1 is
the governing regulation and specifies the method by which officers may apply for ACS.
   (5) Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multi-national Training Opportunities. This program provides short-
term (90 to 180 days) training for officers providing them the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future.
   (6) Training with industry (TWI). Some branches and functional areas participate in TWI, where officers are
assigned to a civilian industry to observe and learn the technical and managerial aspects of that field. The total number
of training quotas varies annually from 50 to 70 based on budget, policy and requirements. Officers selected for this
program must be proficient in their branch or functional area, have a manner of performance that reflects a strong
potential for future service and be able to serve a utilization tour upon completion of training. The TWI program is
outlined in AR 621–1 and in the specific branch and functional area chapters later in this pamphlet.
   (7) Army Acquisition Corps (AAC). Between their 7th and 8th year of service, between 80 and 120 captains are
accessed into the Army Acquisition Corps (FA 51) to be professionally developed in this functional area. The AHRC
hosts an Acquisition Accession Board annually to select branch-qualified captains for FA 51. The AAC officers may
receive a fully funded master’s degree (if not already at civilian education level 2), attend the Materiel Acquisition
Management Course and other FA related training, and serve repetitive assignments in their acquisition specialties to
prepare them for critical acquisition positions at field grade level. The Army Acquisition Corps, created in early 1990,
is described in detail in chapter 42 of this pamphlet.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                              17

   c. Promotion. Selection for promotion to major. Normally an officer within a cohort year group enters the primary
zone of consideration for major around the 9th year of service. Below-the-zone consideration occurs a year earlier.
3–6. Major development
This phase, which generally encompasses the 10th to 17th years of service, begins with selection for promotion to
major. This is a critical period in an officer’s career life-cycle that demands an acute awareness of important HQDA
centralized boards and the preparations they require. The junior field grade years serve to develop the officer cohort in
a variety of branch or functional area assignments within their functional category.
   a. Development. The general development goals are to complete ILE/JPME I, and successfully complete other
branch, functional area or broadening assignments prior to consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel. All branch
and functional area officers are required to complete ILE prior to the 15th year of commissioned service. ILE provides
a quality education for all field-grade officers and prepare them for their next ten years of service. Officers must be
ILE/JPME I complete to be eligible for Senior Service College attendance. See chapter 4, paragraph 4–7e for further
discussion of ILE. Most branches and some functional areas have identified positions as key developmental (KD) for
majors. It should be noted that in all branches/ functional areas majors positions that support transitional functions,
such as Training Teams and Provincial Reconstruction Teams, are designated as KD positions as outlined in paragraph
3–5.
   b. Promotion. Cohort year group officers are generally considered for promotion to lieutenant colonel in their 16th
year of service as they enter the primary zone of consideration. Below-the-zone selection is possible, and normally
officers will be considered one year prior to their primary zone consideration.
3–7. Lieutenant colonel development
This phase generally occurs between the 17th and 22d years of service. Those selected for promotion to lieutenant
colonel now begin the senior field grade years, where they make the maximum contribution to the Army as
commanders and senior staff officers. Attaining the grade of lieutenant colonel is often considered to be the hallmark
of a successful career, although each officer defines success differently. Officers in the grade of lieutenant colonel
serve as senior leaders and managers throughout the Army providing wisdom, experience, vision and mentorship
mastered over many years in uniform.
   a. Development. The professional development goals for a lieutenant colonel are to broaden their branch, functional
area and skill proficiency at the senior levels through assignments and schooling. Most of these officers will serve in
high visibility billets in their branch, functional area or JIIM positions, and a possible assignment to a cross-branch/
functional area developmental position.
   (1) Branch assignments. Lieutenant colonels can expect branch-coded assignments to both TDA and TOE positions.
These billets can range from positions within a battalion through echelons above corps (EAC). However, the TDA
structure requires the greater portion (almost 70 percent) of the senior field grade expertise and experience. Here, the
officer’s development over the years is used to fulfill the doctrinal, instructional, policymaking and planning needs of
the Army. Branch proponents have outlined developmental standards in their respective chapters of this pamphlet.
   (2) Functional area assignments. OPMS recognizes the need for balanced specialization to meet the Army’s
challenges in the 21st Century. The system design allows officers to serve in repetitive assignments within a functional
area to gain a high degree of expertise. Functional area proponents have outlined developmental standards in their
respective chapters of this pamphlet.
   (3) Joint duty assignments. The JDAL contains approximately 1350 lieutenant colonel authorizations and officers
will continue to have the opportunity for assignment to joint duty positions as an integral part of their development.
See paragraph 3–8 for additional details on the joint officer program.
   (4) Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Some officers will serve outside their branch or functional area in
billets coded as branch/functional area generalist. Such assignments are found throughout the Army in troop and staff
organizations from the installation to Department of the Army level.
   (5) Centralized Selection. A centralized board at HQDA selects a limited number of officers for command and key
billets. The lieutenant colonel Centralized Selection List (CSL) Command and Key Billet contains both TOE and TDA
positions. The command board meets annually to select commanders from the eligible cohort year groups. Command
opportunity varies based on force structure and the command categories for which an officer competes. On average,
lieutenant colonels serve in their command tours during their 18th through 20th years of service. Once the board makes
its selections and conducts a preliminary slating for category, OPMD conducts a slating process. The AHRC coordi-
nates this slating process with the major Army commands; and the Chief of Staff, Army, reviews and approves the
slate. The Army Acquisition Corps (AAC) conducts a similar HQDA level board to select lieutenant colonel command-
ers and product managers. Only certified AAC officers can compete for these positions.
   (6) Senior Service College (SSC). The annual SSC (military education level MEL SSC) selection board reviews the
files of lieutenant colonels after their 16th year of service. The SSC is the final major military educational program
available to prepare officers for the positions of greatest responsibility in the Department of Defense. Officers must be
ILE/JPME I qualified to be eligible for SSC attendance consideration. There are about 350 resident seats available each
academic year within the SSC network. These include attendance at the Army War College (AWC), the Industrial
18                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

College of the Armed Forces (ICAF), the National War College (NWC), other Service colleges and resident fellow-
ships at governmental agencies and academic institutions. Approximately 30 to 35 percent of a cohort year group is
selected to attend during their years of eligibility that run between the 16th and 23d years of service. The SSC selection
board examines the eligible population and produces an order of merit list containing 1,300 names. The top 350
officers are activated for resident attendance while the remainder are contacted by their branch or functional area
managers and encouraged to apply for the 150 annual Active Duty seats in the U.S. Army War College Distance
Education Course. Resident and nonresident graduates are awarded the Master of Strategic Studies degree. Only the
resident SSC courses and nonresident Army War College course award MEL SSC upon completion. SSC resident
course graduates are also awarded JPME II. SSC graduates are assigned to organizations based on guidance from the
Chief of Staff, Army. Tours following graduation are to the Army Staff (ARSTAF), Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS),
Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), Army Commands (ACOMs), Army Service Component Commands (ASCCs) and
Direct Reporting Units (DRUs), and combatant command staffs in branch, functional area, branch/functional area
generalist or joint coded positions.
   b. Promotion. Cohort year group officers are normally considered for promotion to colonel in the primary zone in
their 21st year of service. Below-the-zone selection is possible, and normally officers will be considered one year prior
to their primary zone consideration.
3–8. Colonel development
Those officers selected for promotion to colonel continue their senior field grade phase that concludes with their
separation or retirement from Active Duty or selection for promotion to brigadier general. Attaining the grade of
colonel is realized by a select few and truly constitutes the elite of the officer corps. As colonels, their maximum
contribution to the Army is made as commanders and senior staff officers.
   a. Development. The general professional development goals for colonels are to further enhance branch or functional
area skill proficiency through additional senior level assignments and schooling.
   (1) Branch assignments. Many colonels can expect to receive assignments to branch coded positions at the brigade,
division, corps and echelons above corps in the TOE environment. TDA organizations throughout the Army also need
the expertise of senior field grade officers. Almost 70 percent of the colonel authorizations are in the TDA structure.
   (2) Functional area assignments. Under OPMS, functional area officers work predominantly in their specialties after
selection for promotion to major. Having risen above their peers at the grade of major and lieutenant colonel, those
promoted to colonel are truly the world-class specialists in their respective fields. These officers will serve primarily in
senior managerial billets across the Army coded for their specialty.
   (3) Joint duty assignment. The Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL) contains a number of colonel billets in branch
and functional area positions. Officers who did not serve as majors or lieutenant colonels in a JDAL billet should
continue to seek joint development. Colonels who completed the requirements for JQO designation, may serve second
and third tours in positions coded joint critical. (For more information, read paragraph 3–13, which details the joint
duty program.)
   (4) Senior Service College (SSC). The annual SSC selection board reviews the files of colonels until their 23d year
of service. Officers must be JPME I qualified to be eligible for SSC attendance consideration. The majority of colonels
will either attend the resident training or be awarded MEL SSC certification from the U.S. Army War College Distance
Education Course during the latter three years of their eligibility window. See paragraph 3–7b(6) for more information
on the available SSC-level courses.
   (5) Centralized command selection. Some officers are selected for command at the colonel level. Most positions are
branch coded and branch officers compete within designated categories for these positions. An HQDA level board also
selects AAC program managers. Officers are eligible for colonel command selection until their 26th year of service.
The HQDA command boards meet annually to select promotable lieutenant colonels and serving colonels for assign-
ment to command positions during the following fiscal year. The opportunity varies by branch and ranges from 16
percent to 50 percent. The command board prepares a slate to category and an initial slate to units. The final slate to
unit is prepared by OPMD. Slates are approved by the Chief of Staff, Army, and are coordinated with the ACOMs,
ASCCs, and DRUs. The majority of officers in a cohort year group do not command; they make their maximum
contribution to the Army in other important branch or functional area senior staff assignments.
   (6) Former brigade commander assignments. Colonels completing brigade command are assigned to positions
designated by the Chief of Staff, Army, as requiring the skills of former commanders. These post-command assign-
ments may be to branch, branch/functional area generalist assignments or joint coded positions. Emphasis is placed on
joint duty assignments for those officers without a joint qualifying tour.
   b. Promotion. Promotion to general officer is managed separately and is beyond the scope of this pamphlet.
3–9. Warrant officer definitions
The Army warrant officer (WO) is a self aware and adaptive technical expert, combat leader, trainer, and advisor.
Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the WO administers, manages,
maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment across the full spectrum of Army operations. Warrant
officers are innovative integrators of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident warfighters, and developers of
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                               19

specialized teams of Soldiers. They support a wide range of Army missions throughout their career. Warrant officers in
the Army are accessed with specific levels of technical ability. They refine their technical expertise and develop their
leadership and management skills through tiered progressive assignment and education. The following are specific
characteristics and responsibilities of the separate, successive warrant officer grades.
   a. WO1/CW2. A WO1 is an officer appointed by warrant with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level
and position given by the Secretary of the Army. CW2s and above are commissioned officers with the requisite
authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the President of the United States. WO1’s and CW2’s
primary focus is becoming proficient and working on those systems linked directly to their AOC/MOS. As they
become experts on the systems they operate and maintain, their focus migrates to integrating their systems with other
branch systems.
   b. CW3. The CW3s are advanced-level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical
leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other branch-
related duties assigned to them. As they become more senior, their focus becomes integrating branch systems into
larger Army systems.
   c. CW4. The CW4s are senior-level technical and tactical experts who perform the duties of technical leader,
manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator and advisor and serve in a wide variety of branch level positions. As they
become more senior they focus on integrating branch and Army systems into Joint and national level systems.
   d. CW5. The CW5s are master-level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical
leader, manager, integrator, and advisor. They are the senior technical expert in their branch and serve at brigade and
higher levels.
3–10. Warrant officer career patterns
The development of the professional attributes and technical capabilities of Army warrant officers to meet the needs of
the Army is accomplished through proponent-designed professional development models for each AOC/MOS. These
professional development models describe schooling, operational assignments and self-development goals for warrant
officers in each grade. Professional development models are based on Army requirements, indicating the numbers and
types of warrant officers to be accessed, retained, promoted, schooled and assigned by AOC/MOS. Proponents monitor
the Army documents pertinent to their AOC/MOSs since any change to the force structure may require a change to the
warrant officer inventory. The size of the warrant officer inventory is limited by various factors. As requirements
change, strength and professional development goals of each career field AOC/MOS are aligned accordingly. Warrant
officers are accessed into a specific AOC/MOS and can normally expect to spend their entire career in that field.
Branch, functional area and AOC/MOS are defined in appendix A, but these terms as they pertain to warrant officers
have different connotations. Branches are the officially designated categories within the service that separate personnel
and functions. Examples of branches are Field Artillery, Infantry, Quartermaster, Aviation, and so forth. Warrant
officers are appointed in the United States Army at large but contribute directly to the success and missions of the
specific branches. Warrant officers wear the insignia of the branches they support. Branch proponents play a significant
role in the management of warrant officers within the functional categories, development of life-cycle development
models, and provision of proponent based training for warrant officers. Functional areas for warrant officers are
groupings of AOCs/MOSs within branches. Examples are Electronic Maintenance and Ammunition AOCs/MOSs that
are a part of the Ordnance Branch but are grouped in a separate functional area within the Ordnance Branch. An AOC/
MOS is an assigned specialty that most warrant officers hold, with variations, for their entire career. Most warrant
officers hold and work their AOC/MOS for their entire career. Some AOCs/MOSs, notably in Aviation, Ordnance and
Signal branches merge at the grades of CW3 through CW5. The list of specialties, with general description of duties,
by grade, is contained in DA Pam 611–21. Not all assignments within a career will directly relate to the warrant
officer’s functional area/branch or AOC/MOS. Some warrant officer positions are AOC/MOS immaterial but functional
area/branch specific; that is, any qualified warrant officer within a specific branch functional area (aviation, artillery,
ordnance, and so forth) may be assigned to the position. Others are designated AOC/MOS as well as functional area/
branch immaterial; that is, any qualified warrant officer, regardless of AOC/MOS and functional area/branch, may be
assigned to the position. Some positions in leader development, professional development, personnel management,
training, and training development require the assignment of the best qualified warrant officer, regardless of AOC/MOS
or functional area/branch.
3–11. Warrant officer development
In subsequent chapters, professional development models are detailed by functional area/branch and AOC/MOS. As
WO1s and CW2s, primarily focus on their primary MOS/AOC. As they gain more experience and training, their focus
and expertise shifts from their primary MOS/AOC to integrating other systems within their branch/functional areas to
Army, Joint and national level systems. A generic professional development model, depicted in figure 3–2, consists of
the four primary levels of warrant officer utilization.
   a. Entry level. Warrant officers are accessed according to the needs of the Army. Once accepted, the applicant must
attend the Warrant Officer Candidate School (WOCS), conducted by the Warrant Officer Career College at Fort
Rucker, AL or two-phased RTI run by state ARNG. SF Warrant Officers, 180A, will attend their candidate school at
20                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

Fort Bragg, NC. The WOCS and RTIs test the mental, emotional and physical stamina of candidates to determine their
acceptability into the warrant officer corps. The focus of the course is common material providing the skills,
knowledge and behaviors required of all warrant officers, regardless of specialty. Upon course completion, the
candidates are appointed to the grade of W1 but are not yet AOC/MOS-qualified.
   b. WO1/CW2. After graduating from WOCS, the new WO1 must attend a Warrant Officer Basic Course conducted
by his/her proponent school. WOBC provides functional training in the applicable AOC/MOS and reinforces the
leadership training provided in WOCS. Upon successful completion of WOBC, the warrant officer is awarded an AOC/
MOS and given an initial operational assignment. Operational assignments continue for the next several years.
Throughout this period, warrant officers should continue their self-development, to include the pursuit of civil
education goals. The civil education goal at this career point is an Associate Degree or equivalent in a discipline related
to their AOC/MOS prior to eligibility for selection to CW3. After promotion to CW2, at approximately the third year
of warrant officer service, warrant officers can enroll in Prerequisite Studies for the Warrant Officer Advanced Course,
an AOC/MOS immaterial course administered by the Distributive Education Section of the Warrant Officer Career
College. Completion of this course renders the officer eligible to attend his/her resident WOAC. Officers are eligible to
attend the resident portion of their proponent-controlled WOAC after serving for 1 year as a CW2 and should attend
not later than 1 year after their promotion to CW3. Officers must attend WOAC prior to promotion to CW4
   c. CW3/CW4. At this point, warrant officers should actively pursue the next civil education goal, a baccalaureate
degree in a discipline related to their AOC/MOS, prior to eligibility for selection to CW4. Warrant officers will attend
the Warrant Officer Staff Course (WOSC) conducted at the Warrant Officer Career College after serving one year as a
CW3 but not later than one year after their promotion to CW4. Officers must attend WOSC prior to promotion to
CW5. Some proponents may provide follow-on functional training at this point.
   d. CW5. Upon completion of one year time in grade as a CW4 but not later than one year after promotion to CW5,
warrant officers should attend the WOSSC at the Warrant Officer Career College. Again, proponent schools may
provide a follow-on portion of this course. Upon completion of the WOSSC and promotion to CW5, the warrant officer
will serve the remainder of his/her career in positions designated for that grade.
3–12. Introduction to officer skills
A skill identifier identifies specific skills that are required to perform the duties of a particular position and are not
related to any one branch, functional area or career field. There are over 250 skills in the current Army regulation,
many of which require special schooling, training and experiences in which qualification is maintained.
3–13. Joint officer professional development
   a. Joint Qualification System (JQS). Statutory changes in the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2007 resulted in the establishment of different levels of joint qualification as well as criteria for
qualification at each level. The Joint Qualification System acknowledges both designated joint billets as well as
experience-based joint duty assignments in contributing to the development of joint qualified officers. These assign-
ments with the necessary Joint Professional Military Education culminate with an officer being identified as a fully
Joint Qualified Officer (JQO) and the receipt of the 3L identifier.
   b. Standard-Joint duty assignments (S–JDAs).
   (1) The Standard-Joint Duty Assignment List (S–JDAL) is a consolidated list of S–JDAs approved for joint credit
by the Assistant Secretary Defense for Force Management Policy (ASD (FMP)). The S–JDAL has approximately 3,916
billets for Army majors through colonels. An S–JDA is a designated position where an officer gains significant
experience in joint matters. The preponderance of an officer’s duties involves producing or promulgating National
Military Strategy, joint doctrine and policy, strategic and contingency planning, and command and control of combat
operations under a unified command. Serving in a S–JDA affords an officer the opportunity to fulfill the necessary
joint experience criteria on the path to becoming a JQO.
   (2) The provisions of Title 10, United States Code-Armed Forces, specify that officers on the active-duty list may
not be appointed to the grade of brigadier general unless they have completed a full tour of duty in a joint duty
assignment (JDA) and have been selected for the ASI of 3L (JQO). The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force
Management Policy (ASD (FMP)) may waive the JDA requirement, the JQO requirement, or both on a case-by-case
basis for the following reasons: for scientific and/or technical qualifications for which JDA positions do not exist; for
officers serving in professional specialties; for officers serving in a JDA for at least 12 months that began before 1
January 1987; for officers serving in a JDA at least 180 days on the date the board convenes; and lastly, for the “good
of the Service.”
   c. Joint Duty credit. The statutory tour length for most S–JDAs is 36 months to the day for field grade officers and
two years for general officers. After completing a full tour of duty in a S–JDA, officers will be awarded the 3A (Joint
Duty Qualified) skill identifier. An officer begins to accrue joint duty credit upon assignment to a Standard Joint Duty
Assignment List billet and stops accruing joint duty credit on departure. Critical Occupational Specialty (COS) officers
(major to colonel) who meet the early release criteria may receive full tour credit for serving at least 2 years in their
initial JDA. Officers possessing a COS may be released early from a JDA with the approval of the joint activity if they
meet all of the criteria below.
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                              21

   (1) Must be serving in their initial JDA.
   (2) Reassignment must be to the COS specific skill held by the officer being released from the JDA.
   (3) Officers must serve at least 2 years in that S–JDA.
   d. Experience-based Joint Duty assignments (E–JDAs). An E–JDA may include non-JDAL assignments and experi-
ences that demonstrate an officer’s mastery of knowledge, skills, and abilities in joint matters. Officers may gain
experience points towards achieving JQO status by having their non-JDAL assignments validated by a JQS experience
panel. These experiences may be shorter in duration; therefore, they may be aggregated to achieve the equivalent of a
full joint tour of duty in an S–JDA. Officers may submit their request for experience points through a self-nomination
process in coordination with their AHRC assignment officer and the AHRC Joint Policy Section.
   e. Joint Qualified Officers. JQOs are educated and experienced in the employment, deployment and support of
unified and multinational forces to achieve national security objectives. Joint Qualified Officers provide continuity for
joint matters that are critical to strategic and operational planning and serve within the joint arena and their service.
Field grade officers eligible for the JQO designation must meet the highest standards of performance, complete both
Phase I and II of a Joint Professional Military Education program and successfully complete a full tour of duty in a
S–JDA or have the necessary points from E–JDAs. Officers approved by the Secretary of Defense will be awarded the
3L (Joint Specialty Officer) skill identifier.
   f. Joint Professional Military Education. The Army Officer Education System is in compliance with the Officer
Professional Military Education Policy (OPMEP), CJCSI 1800.01C. The requirement for Joint education stems from
the Goldwater-Nichols DOD Reorganization Act of 1986. The Goldwater-Nichols DOD Reorganization Act of 1986
makes the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) the principal official to assist the Secretary of Defense in Joint
Professional Military Education (JPME) matters, including the joint curricula at Service schools. Further, as prescribed
in Title 10, Section 663, the Secretary of Defense, with advice and assistance from CJCS, periodically reviews and
revises the curricula of joint education programs. Intermediate and senior staff college Army institutions are accredited
by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff JPME programs. Graduates meet the requirements for Joint Professional Military
Education.
   (1) The CJCSI 1800.01C defines CJCS objectives and policies regarding the Army educational institutions that
comprise the officer PME and JPME systems. The OPMEP also identifies the fundamental responsibilities of the major
military educational participants in achieving those objectives. The Army provides officer PME and JPME to eligible
Armed Forces officers, international officers, eligible federal government civilians and other approved students. The
Army operates its officer PME system primarily to develop officers with expertise and knowledge appropriate to their
grade, branch and occupational specialty. Incorporated throughout PME, officers receive JPME from pre-commission-
ing through general/flag officer rank.
   (2) Joint Professional Military Education is a CJCS-approved body of objectives, outcomes, policies, procedures and
standards supporting the educational requirements for joint officer management. The JPME is imbedded in Army
programs of instructions and in concert with PME produces desired outcomes in support of the Joint Officer
Management System. The JPME is a three-phase joint education program taught in the Army Intermediate Staff
College (Fort Leavenworth), the United States Army War College, at other Service intermediate- or senior-level
colleges, the Joint Forces Staff College, and at the National Defense University for the CAPSTONE course.
   (3) The Army operates the officer PME system primarily to develop officers with expertise and knowledge
appropriate to their grade, branch and occupational specialty. Embedded within the PME system, however, is a
program of JPME overseen by the Joint Staff and designed to fulfill the educational requirements for joint officer
management as mandated by the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986. Incorporated throughout Army PME, officers receive
JPME from pre-commissioning through general/flag officer. Army PME is structured in five military educational levels
to support five significant phases in an officer’s career.
   (a) Pre-commissioning. Military education received at institutions and through programs producing commissioned
officers upon graduation.
   (b) Primary. Education typically received at grades O–1 through O–3.
   (c) Intermediate. Education typically received at grade O–4.
   (d) Senior. Education typically received at grades O–5 or O–6.
   (e) General/flag officer. Education received as a G/FO.
   (4) All Army branch and functional area officers will complete pre-commissioning, primary and intermediate PME
(JPME I). Award of JPME credit is dependent on completion of PME appropriate to the grade, branch, and functional
area.
   (a) JPME Phase I. The JPME Phase I is that portion of the PJE that is incorporated into the curricula of intermediate
and senior-level military service JPME schools and other appropriate educational programs that meet JPME criteria and
are accredited by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. JPME Phase I is integrated into the ILE curricula at the
Command and General Staff College and all other service Intermediate Level Colleges. Other programs, as approved
by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, may satisfy the JPME Phase I requirement.
   (b) JPME Phase II. The JPME Phase II is that portion of PJE that complements JPME Phase I. The JPME Phase II
is taught at JFSC to both intermediate and senior-level students. Field grade officers must complete JPME Phase I to be
22                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

eligible to attend JPME Phase II. Under exceptional conditions, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff may approve
a direct-entry waiver to permit an officer to complete JPME II without having completed JPME Phase I. The JPME
Phase II is integrated, along with JPME Phase I, into the curricula at all Senior Level Colleges to include the U.S.
Army War College.
   (5) JPME Phase II graduates. The Army must ensure that the following requirements are met by officers who
graduate from each of the NDU schools (for example, the NWC, the ICAF, or the JFSC) for each fiscal year:
   (a) All JQOs must be assigned to a JDA as their next duty assignment following graduation, unless waived on a
case-by-case basis by the ASD (FMP).
   (b) More than 50 percent (defined as 50 percent plus one) of all non-JQO graduates from each of those schools must
be assigned to a JDA as their next duty assignment following graduation.
   (c) One half of the officers subject to that requirement (for each school) may be assigned to a JDA as their second
(rather than first) assignment following graduation, if necessary for efficient officer management.
   (d) The Army shall coordinate with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to document compliance.
3–14. Assignment process and considerations
The life-cycle of a cohort year group spans 30 years of service. Some officers from a cohort may attain general officer
status and be retained in service beyond that point. Some warrant officers may attain the rank of CW5 and also serve
up to 30 years of warrant officer service.
   a. The assignment process throughout an officer’s career is based on several factors and considerations. The
environmental factors in which OPMS operates can affect the assignments an officer may receive. The assignment
process has these elements:
   b. Army requirements. The central engine that drives OPMS and the assignment process is Army requirements.
Army requirements are those positions that must be filled by officers to accomplish our wartime and peacetime
missions. When an officer leaves a position, the losing agency generates a requisition for a replacement. Army
requirements for officers are specified on the various TOE and TDA structures. Grade, branch, functional area, skill,
and special remarks are documented for each position within The Army Authorization Documents System (TAADS),
which is maintained by the DCS, G–3/5/7. Annually, the Army projects positions to be filled and places officers on
permanent change of station (PCS) orders to occupy the vacancies. Within OPMD, requisition cycles are opened
quarterly, and the assignment branches determine which officers meet the position requirements and are available for
the assignment.
   c. Availability for assignment. Officers are considered available for assignment when they complete the required
tour length as specified in AR 614–100 for CONUS and OCONUS locations. DOD and Army policies for tour length
are changed based on a variety of external factors, to include budget limitations. Force stabilization is an important
factor in future assignment decisions.
   d. Professional development needs. Professional development in the officer’s designated branch, functional area or
AOC/MOS is important to the assignment manager; however, force stabilization will be an equally important consider-
ation. Each branch and functional area has a life-cycle development model. The officer’s career needs are examined in
light of these models to ensure the next assignment is progressive, sequential and achieves the professional develop-
ment goal for that grade.
   e. Other assignment considerations. Besides Army requirements, availability and professional development, the
assignment managers scrutinize other considerations in arriving at an appropriate assignment.
   (1) Preference. Officers should frequently update their preference statement for location, type of assignments,
personal data, professional development goals and education and training needs. Assignment managers may not be able
to satisfy all preferences because of dynamic requirements, but they do attempt to satisfy as many as possible.
   (2) Training and education. Whenever possible, assignment managers provide schooling en route to the officer’s
next assignment to meet the special requirements of the position. Civilian educational goals that are specific require-
ments of positions or professional development will also be considered during the assignment process.
   (3) Personal and compassionate factors. Personal crises occur in every officer’s career. The OPMD assignment
managers attempt to assist in such circumstances by adjusting the assignment. However, officers should apprise their
assignment manager of such personal or compassionate considerations at the time they occur and not wait until an
assignment action is pending. In some cases, formal requests for compassionate deferment from assignment or request
for reassignment are needed. Officers should coordinate with local Soldier support activity for processing such
documents. Officers with dependents having special needs should enroll in the Exceptional Family Member Program.
   (4) Overseas equity. Overseas equity must be a consideration when selecting officers for assignments. With the
Army serving in a variety of overseas locations, the equitable distribution of OCONUS and unaccompanied tours
among all officers is a morale concern as well as a developmental experience in many branches and functional areas.
Overseas tours broaden the professionalism of the officer corps, and assignment managers consider this element of tour
equity in each assignment action.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           23

3–15. Individual career management
The OPMS provides leader and technical training for company grade, field grade and warrant officers. Negotiating
through this multitude of possibilities to meet the needs of the Army and the important needs of the individual is the
result of interaction among the individual officer, the commander, the proponent and the OPMD assignment manager.
Each has an important part to play in the professional development of not only individual officers, but of the officer
corps as a whole.
   a. The individual. In many respects, officers are ultimately their own career managers. While Army requirements
dictate the final outcome of all development actions, in every case the officer must participate in such decisions.
Participation in the officer development process is possible at the basic branching/career management field designation
point, volunteering for training and education programs, selection of functional area, preferences for functional
category, application for entry into special programs and long-range planning of career goals. The key is to be involved
in professional development by making informed and logical decisions and acting on them. One important element of
an officer’s involvement is the accurate reflection of capabilities in the official personnel management files maintained
by HQDA. The official military personnel file (OMPF), the DA Form 4037 (Officer Record Brief), and the career
management individual file contain the data from which important professional development decisions are made for
selection, advancement, assignment and retention. Officers should review, update and maintain these records through-
out their careers. Officers should also request periodic advice and counseling from commanders, supervisors, senior
officers and AHRC career managers to remain informed of career opportunities and to assess progress achieving career
goals.
   b. The commander. Commanders play a critical part in development by understanding the roles of all their officers,
their education and development needs and incorporating them into a unit officer professional development process. All
officers look to their rater, senior rater, and mentors for advice and career counseling. Some counseling is official, such
as the preparation and submission of DA Form 67–9 (Officer Evaluation Report) and DA Form 67–9–1 (Officer
Evaluation Report Support Form). Other forms of counseling are often unofficial and relate to career patterns, advice
about assignments and duty positions. Regardless of the type of counseling, commanders should be factually informed
before rendering advice. This pamphlet contains many of the professional development facts that commanders need to
give wise counsel.
   c. The proponents. Proponents design life-cycle development models for their branches, functional areas and AOC/
MOS and monitor the overall professional development of officer populations. Logical and realistic career patterns,
qualifying objectives and an accurate understanding of attrition and promotion flows are vital ingredients in each
branch or functional area. Leader development action plans and life-cycle development models should be constructed to
meet overall Army requirements as well as branch, functional area and functional category objectives. Constant contact
with the officer population and the OPMD assignment branches should be sustained to communicate goals and
objectives of the branch and functional area.
   d. Officer Personnel Management Directorate assignment managers. Assignment and career managers at AHRC
OPMD are responsible for fulfilling current and future Army requirements while meeting the professional development
needs of the various branches, functional areas and functional categories. Additionally, they balance the best interests
of the individual officers against the Army requirements. Career managers can provide candid, realistic advice to
officers about their developmental needs. As the executors of Army and proponent programs, they operate within the
existing policy, budget and legal framework to make decisions concerning assignments, schooling, manner of perform-
ance and subjective evaluations of competitiveness for selection and retention. All officers should stay in touch with
their assignment managers to receive guidance and advice on professional development.
Chapter 4
Officer Education
4–1. Scope
   a. Training and education requirements. Common training requirements apply to all officers, WO1 through O–6,
and specify the skills, knowledge and attributes required of every officer. Other training and education requirements for
branch, functional area or skill codes apply to officers in a particular specialty.
   b. Training and education methods. Officer education occurs in institutional training, in operational assignments and
through self-development. Institutional training represents the resident training an officer receives in military and/or
civilian institutions. Self-development encompasses nonresident schooling including individual study, distributive learn-
ing, research, professional reading, practice and self-assessment.
4–2. The Officer Education System
   a. Strategic objective. The strategic objective of the OES is to provide an education and training system operation-
ally relevant to the current environment, but structured to support the future environment by producing more capable,
adaptable and confident leaders through continuous investment in personal growth and professional development
24                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

throughout their careers. To achieve this objective, the Army has embraced an experiential and competency-based
education and training model in its education system. This model integrates current technological capabilities to rapidly
advance learning in both individual and collective training requirements while providing Army leaders the right
training and education in the right medium, at the right time and place for success in their next assignment. This model
supports the Army’s service culture and warrior ethos, and produces leaders who can resolve dilemmas under stress,
make decisions, and lead formations. The institutional side of the Army is a series of leadership laboratories focused on
learning, growing, achieving competency, and getting better training into units.
   b. Officer Education System goal. The goal of the OES is to produce a corps of leaders who are fully competent in
technical, tactical, and leadership skills, knowledge, and experience; understand how the Army runs; are prepared to
operate in JIIM environments; and can demonstrate confidence, integrity, critical judgment, and responsibility; operate
in an environment of complexity, ambiguity, and rapid change; build effective teams amid organizational and techno-
logical change; and adapt to and solve problems creatively. The products of this system are officers who are highly
specialized experts, trainers, and leaders; fully competent in technical, tactical, and leadership skills; creative problem
solvers able to function in highly complex and dynamic environments; proficient operators, maintainers, administrators,
and managers of Army equipment, support activities, and technical systems. Officer leader development is a continuous
process that begins with pre-commissioning/pre-appointment training and education.
   c. The OES is a sequence of the professional military education (PME) for professionals in subjects that enhance
knowledge of the science and art of war. The PME is a progressive education system that prepares leaders for
increased responsibilities and successful performance at the next higher level by developing the key knowledge, skills,
and attributes they require to operate successfully at that level in any environment. PME is linked to promotions, future
assignments, and career management models for all officers.
4–3. Current paths to officer education
Current Force educational models will be followed in parallel with Future Force models. Currently officers enter
Active Duty with diverse educational backgrounds and civilian experience. This diversity is amplified by the great
variety of service experiences among officers with different branches and functional areas. The current Officer
Education System permits officers to build upon achievements and experience and progress to a higher level of
learning. Opportunities exist for resident and nonresident instruction. There are multiple paths to obtaining a profes-
sional education. Officers may follow different paths to achieve success, even where they share the same branch,
functional area or MOS.
4–4. Guides for branch, MOS or functional area development courses
   a. Education requirements are satisfied by both the Army’s military schools and by civilian institutions. The Basic
Officer Leader Course and the branch Captain Career Course (CCC) includes training specific to junior officers (WO1,
O1–O3). The Intermediate Level Education (ILE), Command and Staff College (CSC), and Senior Service College
(SSC) provide opportunities for advanced military and leader development training. The WOBC and Advanced Course
(WOAC) include training appropriate to the officer’s specialty. The Warrant Officer Staff Course (WOSC) and Senior
Staff Course (WOSSC) provide opportunity to enhance functional specialty education. Specialized courses offered by
military and civilian institutions provide additional opportunities for assignment oriented functional area and functional
category education. Other Services and elements of the Federal Government offer courses that support officer
professional development. Advanced education may consist of resident and/or nonresident courses.
   b. Numerous courses support both Army requirements and the professional needs of individual officers. It is difficult
to anticipate and specify the many combinations of courses that apply to both Army and individual needs. However,
representative courses particularly suitable for various branches, MOS and functional areas are discussed in detail in
paragraphs 4–7, 4–16 and 4–17. (Also see branch and functional area specific chapters in this pamphlet.) Functional
area training: Officers designated to serve in functional areas will receive specialized training and education so that
they develop the necessary skills and technical qualifications to perform the duties required of their functional area.
Courses of study leading to graduate degrees at civilian colleges and universities may meet these needs. Specific
educational requirements are outlined in the functional area proponent chapters of this publication.
   c. The primary reference for Army courses is DA Pam 351–4 in the Army Training Requirements and Resources
System at https://www.atrrs.army.mil. Most of the courses listed in the functional area chapters include course
identification numbers that are assigned an established code. (These codes are explained in ATRRS.) The references
listed below can assist officers in planning their functional area development:
   (1) AR 350–1.
   (2) AR 611–1.
   (3) AR 621–1.
   (4) AR 621–7.
   (5) DA Pam 351–4 in the ATRRS at https://www.atrrs.army.mil.
   (6) DODD 5010.16–C.
   d. Detailed information, including enrollment procedures for correspondence courses, is included in the Army
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                               25

Training Requirements and Resources System at https://www.atrrs.army.mil. In many cases, correspondence courses
paralleling the numbered resident courses listed in ATRRS are available. The correspondence courses represent an
important alternative means of career field development to many of the resident courses because of their flexibility and
convenience.
   e. The ATRRS lists some of the applicable DOD courses. More complete listings of such courses appear in DOD
5010.16–C, indexed both by function and by responsible institution. Joint Distributed Learning (DL) provides an inter-
service distance learning catalog that can be accessed at http://catalog.jointadlcolab.org/index.asp.
   f. Occasionally, a course may be found under an Army number and the number of another Service and listed in
more than one catalog. A few of the courses listed have no numbers. In such cases, officers may want to contact the
responsible school for pertinent descriptive material.
   g. Officers will not enroll in other than Army schools without written approval of the Human Resources Command
and the Army DCS, G–3/5/7 Director of Training. Officers successfully completing other Services’ Intermediate Staff
Colleges and Senior Service Colleges accredited in accordance with CJCSI 1800.01C (OPMEP) will be awarded MEL
and JPME credit accordingly.
   h. The ATRRS is the Army system of record for training. This system allows officers to research information
regarding different schools and courses. The system is also used to track enrollment and interfaces with personnel
systems to record the completion of courses.
   i. Active Army Soldiers will generally attend resident training at the proponent site. However in some cases Active
Army Soldiers may attend The Army Training Study courses taught at Total Army School System (TASS) battalions.
These courses are resident courses. These are different from Reserve Component Configured Courses (RCCC), which
are not treated as resident courses.
4–5. Nonresident schools and instruction
   a. All officers are encouraged to further their branch, or functional area education through appropriate courses of
nonresident instruction. The successful completion of a given level of nonresident instruction is considered on an
equivalent level of attainment to, but does not rule out, future attendance at a resident course of instruction. An
exception is enrollment in the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course, which awards Joint Professional
Military Education Level I (JPME I), not JPME II as with the resident program, and rules out attendance at a resident
Senior Service College.
   b. Equivalent level of attainment means that an officer who has reached a specific military education level through
nonresident instruction receives the same consideration in assignment, promotion and future schooling as an officer
whose military education level was reached through resident instruction. Officers will not enroll in other than Army
schools without written approval of the Human Resources Command and the Army DCS, G–3/5/7 Director of Training.
Officers who do not have the opportunity to attend a resident course should complete the level of professional military
education appropriate to their grade through nonresident instruction. However, completion of ILE/JPME I and HQDA
Board selection is required for senior service college attendance. There is no equivalent level of attainment for the
BOLC II, BOLCIII where resident participation is required.
   c. Nonresident instruction allows officers to advance their professional education and their careers, thereby enhanc-
ing their overall performance and potential. Military school courses available through correspondence, with and without
a resident phase, are listed in DA Pam 351–20, ATRRS, TASS, and the TRADOC Online Library.
4–6. Educational counseling
The numerous educational opportunities and frequent moves in the Army often make it difficult to plan educational
programs. Officers frequently need professional educational counseling and should turn to their mentor, rater, and
assignment officer in OPMD, their local Army Education Center or an education counselor at the appropriate service
school. The Warrant Officer Career College at Fort Rucker, AL is another excellent source for warrant officer
education counseling. Another excellent resource for all officers is their individual commanders and supervisors. In
addition, many civilian institutions provide counseling services.
4–7. Military schools
   a. Basic Officer Leader Course Phase II (BOLC II). Upon commissioning an officer is assigned to a branch. The
first training the officer attends is BOLC II. The BOLC II is a rigorous, branch-immaterial course, physically and
mentally challenging, with the majority of the training conducted via hands-on in a tactical or field environment.
Focusing on training at the platoon level, a cadre of officers and NCOs will continuously evaluate each student’s
performance in a series of leadership positions, under various conditions/situations. The student officers also participate
in several peer reviews and self-assessments. The curriculum includes advanced land navigation training, rifle
marksmanship, weapons familiarization, practical exercises in leadership, urban operations, convoy operations, and use
of night vision equipment. It culminates in squad and platoon situational-training exercises using COE scenarios.
Additionally, students must negotiate confidence courses that challenge them to overcome personal fears. Junior
officers depart BOLC II with a confidence in their ability to lead small units, an appreciation for the branches of the
combined arms team, and a clear understanding of their personal strengths and weaknesses. There is no Active Duty
26                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

service obligation for BOLC II attendance. Direct commission officers may attend BOLC–DCO, a BOLC II prep
course for officers who did not have the benefit of participating in BOLC I pre-commissioning training.
   b. Branch detail program. Upon commissioning, selected lieutenants appointed to the Signal, Quartermaster, Ord-
nance, Transportation or Finance branches may be detailed to a combat arms branch for a minimum of two years or
longer if affected by life-cycle manning. Selected Military Intelligence and Adjutant General officers are detailed for
four years. Lieutenants under the branch detail program attend the BOLC and participate in branch specific training for
the branch to which they are detailed. On completing the detail, officers attend a four-week branch transition course, as
prescribed by their Chief of Branch, before they return to their designated branch. Officers in the four-year program
receive transition branch training in conjunction with their enrollment in the Captain Career Course. All officers
continue to participate in branch specific training once they are reassigned back to their designated branches.
   c. Basic Officer Leader Course Phase III. This is branch-specific training. Conducted at the branch schools, officers
receive specific branch training (specialized skills, doctrine, tactics, and techniques). Upon graduation, officers attend
additional assignment- oriented training (Airborne, Ranger, Language School, and so on) or proceed to their first unit
assignments.
   d. Captain Career Course. The CCC provides captains with the tactical, technical and leader knowledge and skills
needed to lead company-size units and serve on battalion and brigade staffs. The course emphasizes the development of
leader competencies while integrating recent operational experiences of the students with quality institutional training.
It facilitates lifelong learning through an emphasis on self-development. The curriculum includes common core
subjects, branch-specific tactical and technical instruction, and branch-immaterial staff officer training.
   (1) The Captain Career Common Core Course (C5) consists of the common core lessons approved by TRADOC for
conversion to DL. It is a requirement for both AA and RC officers attending either an AA or RC version of the CCC.
Officers are eligible to enroll in the C5 upon completion of BOLC III and promotion to first lieutenant. Completion of
C5 is not a prerequisite for attendance at either the AA or RC version of the CCC, but it is a requirement for
graduation. Officers can begin and potentially complete C5 prior to attendance at the resident portion of CCC.
However, resident time will be allotted for completing C5, if necessary. Officers are encouraged to complete as much
of C5 as possible prior to attending the resident phase. The C5 is listed in the ATRRS as a separate course, 01A–C22
(DL). Consequently, all AA and RC officers must enroll in C5 separately from the rest of the CCC.
   (2) The AA officer CCC attendance is an assignment action by AHRC. Reserve Component CCC attendance is
scheduled by the unit in the Army Training Requirements and Resources System at www.atrrs.army.mil. All resident
CCC attendance is in a permanent change of station (PCS) status with the exception of the MEDCOM which is
attended in a temporary duty (TDY) status.
   (3) The RC CCC provides the same educational outcomes as the CCC (AA) in roughly the same amount of time as
the former RC Officer Advanced Course and RC CAS3. The RC CCC now follows a 13-month model which includes
the C5, two 15-day resident periods, and 11 months for completing branch specific DL phases. Branches may include a
technical prerequisite DL phase prior to the first resident phase. Officers have the flexibility to complete the DL at
home station.
   (4) Coordinating Staff Modules (S1, S2, Asst S3, S4, S5, and BMO) exist to provide assignment oriented training
for AA and RC officers preparing to serve in these staff positions. Each module consists of approximately 35 hours of
DL.
   (5) The AA and AGR officers normally will attend their branch-specific CCC in residence:
   (a) As soon as practical after promotion to captain.
   (b) As soon as possible after completing four years of active Federal commissioned service (AFCS).
   (c) Prior to the seventh year of federal commissioned service.
   (6) The RC officers may enroll in the RC CCC upon completion of BOLC III and promotion to first lieutenant.
Those who desire to enroll prior to this time require a waiver by the unit commander, or by the Commander,
AHRC–St. Louis for members of the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR). The RC officers must enroll in the CCC prior to
completing 8 years of commissioned service.
   (a) The RC officers must satisfy the following prerequisites for enrollment into the CCC:
   (b) Be a commissioned officer in the grade of first lieutenant or captain.
   (c) Meet the standards of AR 140–1, AR 600–9, and AR 350–1.
   e. Intermediate Staff College. The Army Intermediate Staff College (ISC) program of professional military education
(PME) instruction is ILE. Effective in August 2005 and for officers in Year Group (YG) 1994 and subsequent Year
Groups, ILE replaced the existing Command and General Staff Officers Course (CGSOC). The ILE consists of a
common core (CC) curriculum that includes Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) Phase 1 requirements and
the required Branch and/or functional area specialized education or qualification course. Successful completion of the
ILE CC and the respective qualification course is required for award of JPME Phase I credit. JPME Phase I is that
portion of the ILE common core concentrating on instruction of joint matters. Officers must complete JPME Phase I to
be eligible to attend JPME Phase II or a Senior Service College. Completion of ILE is recognized by award of MEL
ILE and the code of CSC graduate.
   (1) The final Command and General Staff Officer Course (CGSOC) Board (4th Quarter FY04) for ACC officers was
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                               27

for officers in YG 93. The YG 93 and earlier YG officers must have been board selected to attend ILE in residence.
Efforts are being made to ensure all CGSOC Board selected officers have the opportunity to attend the resident course
at Fort Leavenworth. The YG 93 and earlier YG officers not selected for resident CGSOC attendance are afforded the
opportunity to complete ILE via DL. Officers in YG 93 and earlier who are selected for promotion to lieutenant
colonel and are not CGSOC graduates must complete ILE CC within 18 months of the date of the publication of the
selection list; attendance is to be coordinated with the appropriate personnel office. Officers in YG 93 and earlier will
be awarded JPME Phase I credit upon completion of Legacy CGSOC or the ILE common core. Year Group 93 and
earlier functional area (FA) designated officers are required to complete the FA credentialing course as directed by the
FA proponent.
   (2) All ACC branch and functional area officers will complete ILE prior to the 15th year of commissioned service.
   (3) To be eligible for attendance, all Army officers must have completed a branch officer Captain Career Course or
equivalent, served successfully in a branch leader development position at the grade of captain, and completed eight
years of active Federal commissioned service (AFCS). On a case by case basis, the eight years of AFCS requirement is
waiverable for non-due course special branch officers. Targeting multiple ACC year groups for ILE attendance and
allowing a five-year completion window following functional designation facilitates career advancement and control of
the attendance backlog. This policy also allows officers to receive an intermediate staff college education earlier in
their careers, enhances Army readiness posture, and supports Army force generation.
   (4) The ACC officers will normally attend ILE in residence. By exception, the HQDA, DCS, G–3/5/7 may approve
ACC officers to complete the ILE common core curriculum and/or the branch officer qualification course through DL
when operational requirements prevent attendance in residence. Completion of ILE by ACC officers in other than a
resident status must be coordinated with the HQDA, DCS G–3/5/7, HQDA, DCS G–1 and the Army Human Resources
Command (AHRC). At a minimum, all ACC officers are expected to attend the ILE Common Core in residence.
   (5) Army officers who complete the Naval Command and Staff Distance Education Course while attending the
Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) are eligible to receive full credit for ILE and Joint Professional Military Education
Phase I (JPME 1). This provision is subject to officer completion of the ILE Preparatory Course (P950) prior to starting
the Naval Command and Staff Distance Education Course.
   (6) Special branch officers will continue to be board selected for resident ILE attendance. Special branch proponents
will determine completion requirements and timelines for special branch officers.
   (7) Reserve Component officers will continue to be board selected for resident ILE attendance. Reserve Component
officers will complete ILE prior to their 15th year of commissioned service.
   (8) Select branch and functional area officers will receive the common core course at Fort Leavenworth, KS during
the first 16 weeks of ILE and follow on attendance at the Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course (AOWC) for
24 weeks. The remaining officers who do not attend resident ILE at Fort Leavenworth will receive the common core
course from CGSC instructors at one of the satellite campuses and as prescribed through ADL and TASS. Following
the common core instruction, functional area (FA) officers attend individual qualification course ranging from 4 to 178
weeks in length. Qualification courses provide officers the technical preparation for assignments in their respective
FAs. Completion of the ILE common core and the respective branch or FA qualification course qualifies the officers
for award of MEL ILE and the code CSC graduate and Joint Professional Military Education I (JPME I),
   (9) Branch officers will receive qualification course credit and award of JPME Phase I credit upon completion of the
other than Army intermediate staff colleges that are accredited in accordance with CJCSI 1800.01C. Branch and
functional area officers selected for attendance at other services or Joint resident intermediate staff colleges and/or
selected for attendance at other nation’s intermediate staff colleges must first complete the two week ILE preparatory
course, the ILE common core at a course location site or the ILE common core through the nonresident DL program.
Officers attending the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell AFB, AL, and the College of Naval Command and
Staff at Newport, RI, are afforded the opportunity to participate in the ILE preparatory course upon arrival at those
locations. The remaining officers attending other than the Army Intermediate Staff College are afforded an opportunity
to participate in ILE preparatory course at Fort Leavenworth, KS. Unless otherwise authorized through an HQDA,
DCS, G–3/5/7 exception to policy, branch and functional area officers selected or approved for attendance at other
Service DL, blended learning or nonresident intermediate staff colleges programs must first complete the ILE common
core at a satellite campus. Functional area and special branch officers may attend international and sister service
schools, but must still attend their respective qualification courses to be credentialed ILE.
   f. The Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP) is a yearlong resident course taught by the School of Advanced
Military Studies (SAMS) at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College. The purpose of the AMSP is to
provide the Army and the other services with specially educated officers for command and general staff positions at
tactical and operational echelons. The program provides its graduates an advanced education in the military arts and
sciences focused at the operational level. Additionally, the program provides training in the practical skills needed to
plan and conduct battles, major operations and campaigns and in adapting doctrine and techniques to the changing
realities of war. Applicants must be ILE qualified or resident students in ILE or sister service resident programs. There
are a mix of students from active Army, reserve component, other service and international officer students selected for
attendance each year. The Director, SAMS, accepts applications from August through October of each year.

   g. Senior Service College (SSC) The Senior Service Colleges (SSCs) are at the apex of the military schools system
and award JPME II credit and the SSC graduate code. SSCs prepare officers for senior command and staff positions
within the Army and DOD. These colleges include the Army War College, the National War College, the Industrial
College of the Armed Forces, the Naval War College, the Air War College, the Inter-American Defense College
(IADC), other accredited international senior military service colleges, or any one of approximately 20 civilian and
military fellowship programs.
   (1) The SSC eligibility requirements for officers are:
   (a) DA Board selected.
   (b) Must be JPME Phase 1 complete.
   (c) Must be lieutenant colonel or above.
   (d) Will have less than 25 years of active Federal commissioned service (AFSC). Promotion list service determines
years of service for AA officers (except MEDCOM). The AFSC is the governing factor for MEDCOM officers and for
other-than-RA officers.
   (2) Military and Army civilian positions that require Senior Service College education are defined as follows: A
military member, LTC/CW5 and above, or Army civilian, GS–14 and above or NSPS pay band 3 and above, who
occupies a leadership position (both command and staff) that requires a thorough knowledge of strategy and the art and
science of developing and using instruments of national power (diplomatic, economic, military, and informational)
during peace and war. This knowledge is necessary in order to perform Army, Joint, or Defense Agency operations at
the strategic level (ACOM, ASCC, DRU, Field Operating Agency, Joint Task Force or higher).
   (3) Officers who have completed 16 years AFCS, have credit for ILE schooling, do not have more than 23 years
AFCS as of 1 October of the year of entry into the college, and are serving as lieutenant colonels or colonels as of the
board’s convening date are eligible to attend an SSC. The annual Army SSC Selection Board selects officers on a best-
qualified basis. Branch and functional area floors, based on Army requirements, are considered during the SSC
selection process. There is a 2-year Active Duty service obligation for attendance at resident MEL SSC schooling.
   (4) The Army’s SLC is the USAWC at Carlisle Barracks, PA. The mission of the USAWC is to prepare selected
military, Army civilian, and international leaders for the responsibilities of strategic leadership; educate current and
future leaders on the development and employment of landpower in a joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and
multinational environment; to research and publish on national security and military strategy; and to engage in
activities that support the Army’s strategic communication efforts. The USAWC conducts both a resident education
program (REP) and a distance education program (DEP). Successful completion of either program results in the
awarding of a USAWC Diploma and a Master of Strategic Studies Degree. (The USAWC is accredited by the Middle
States Commission on Higher Education). REP graduates also receive Joint Professional Military Education Phase II
(JPME II) credit. DEP graduates receive JPME I credit.
   h. Senior Service Fellowship
   (1) The primary goal of all fellowships is professional development. Officers who participate in the SSCFP forego
any other opportunity for SSC education. SSC credit will be granted to senior Army officers who successfully complete
at least a nine-month program. The program must be academically structured to provide an educational experience
requiring fellows to study and evaluate critically broad National security policy, strategy, interagency, and operational
issues to substantially enhance their ability, as senior Army leaders, to participate effectively in the formulation and
implementation of National security policy.
   (2) Advanced Operational Art Studies Fellowship. Each year the Army sends six or seven senior service college
selectees to the Advanced Operational Art Studies Fellowship (AOASF) at the Army Command and General Staff
College’s School for Advanced Military Studies to be trained for subsequent assignment as theater level planners. The
Air Force and Navy Departments send one officer each to provide a joint perspective to the student body. Allied
officers are also enrolled to provide a multinational perspective. Army and Marine Corps officers stay at SAMS for
two years; Air Force, Navy and allied officers stay for only one year. AOASF focuses on the skills and knowledge
required for campaign planning in and between theaters of war across the entire spectrum of conflict.
   (a) The focus of the first academic year is on planning and operations at the theater strategic level at unified,
component and joint task force level headquarters. Students follow a rigorous set curriculum, with emphasis on national
security strategy, military theory, strategic studies, military history and campaign planning.
   (b) Second year fellows serve as seminar leaders for the Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP) seminars,
coordinate operational level Exercise Prairie Warrior planning, and perform other duties such as the revision of FM
3–0. Upon completion of the fellowship, fellows are normally assigned to multinational, joint and component staff
positions associated with operational level planning.
   (3) Other Senior Service Fellowships are governed in accordance with AR 621–7. The proponent for Army
fellowships is HQDA, DCS, G–3/5/7 Strategic Leadership Division.
   (4) Fellowship opportunities are designed to provide unique personal and professional educational experiences to
Army officers that are not available through traditional Professional Military Education. Fellowships enhance the
officer’s capabilities to meet specific requirements for Army leaders that serve at the highest levels of the National
Security establishment.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             29

   i. Warrant officer schools
   (1) Warrant Officer Candidate School. All warrant officer candidates (AA and RC) must attend the resident WOCS.
The WOCS graduates are conditionally appointed to warrant officer one, grade W1. Appointment is contingent upon
certification by the MOS proponent that the warrant officer is technically and tactically qualified to serve in the
authorized warrant officer MOS.
   (2) Warrant Officer Basic Course. Upon graduation from WOCS and appointment to WO1, each officer will attend
functional specialty training. The WOBC is a functional specialty development course taught at various proponent
schools that prepares newly appointed officers for their assignments as WO1. Training is performance oriented and
focuses on technical skills, leadership, effective communication, unit training, maintenance operations, security, prop-
erty accountability, tactics, and development of subordinates. The WOBC graduates are recognized of WOBC GRAD.
Branch proponents are responsible for developing and updating WOBC training and technical certification standards.
   (3) Warrant Officer Advanced Course. The Warrant Officer Advanced Course (WOAC) is MOS-specific and builds
upon the skills, knowledge, and attributes (SKA) developed through previous training and experience. The course
provides officers the leader, tactical, and technical training needed to serve in company and higher-level positions.
WOAC training consists of two components:
   (a) Prerequisite studies. This is a mandatory nonresident course that must be completed prior to attending the
proponent/branch resident WOAC training. The Action Officer Development Course (131 P00) was adopted as the
resource for this distance learning course. It is completed online via the Internet, and provides warrant officers serving
in CW2 or higher duty positions relevant training in organization and management techniques, communication skills,
preparing and staffing documents, conducting meetings and interviews, problem solving, time management, writing,
coordinating activities, and ethics. Enrollment must occur after promotion to CW2 in order to qualify for WOAC
Prerequisite Studies credit. CW2s have the flexibility to enroll at any convenient time between 24 and 48 months of
total warrant officer service. Once enrolled, the course must be completed within one year.
   (b) Resident Course. CW2s are eligible to attend their MOS WOAC. Active Duty List (ADL) warrant officers will
attend the advanced course at their respective proponent school not later than one year after promotion to CW3.
National Guard warrant officers complete this training prior to promotion to CW3. Army Reserve warrant officers not
on the Active Duty list must complete this training prior to selection for CW3. The branch phase varies in length
depending on the branch. Primary focus is directed toward leadership skill reinforcement, staff skills, and advanced
MOS-specific training. The course consists of in-depth training in MOS- specific and branch-immaterial tasks.
Graduates of the WOAC receive the designation of MEL code WOAC.
   (4) Warrant Officer Staff Course. The WOSC is a resident course conducted at the Warrant Officer Career College.
This course focuses on the staff officer and leadership skills needed to serve in the grade of CW4 at battalion and
higher levels. The course which includes instruction in communication skills, staff skills and relationships, problem
solving and decision making, educates and trains officers in the values and attitudes of the profession of arms and in
the conduct of military operations in peace and in war. The CW3s are eligible to attend the WOSC. The ADL warrant
officers will complete this course not later than one year after promotion to CW4. National Guard warrant officers will
complete this course prior to promotion to CW4. Army Reserve warrant officers will complete this course prior to
selection to CW4. WOSC graduates are recognized by MEL code WOSC.
   (5) Warrant Officer Senior Staff Course. The WOSSC is the capstone for warrant officer professional military
education. It is a branch immaterial two-week resident course conducted at the Warrant Officer Career College. The
WOSSC provides a master level professional warrant officer with a broader Army level perspective required for
assignment to CW5 level positions as technical, functional and branch systems integrators and trainers at the highest
organizational levels. Instruction focuses on "How the Army Runs" and provides up-to-date information on Army level
policy, programs and special items of interest. CW4s are eligible to attend the WOSSC. ADL warrant officers will
complete this course not later than one year after promotion to CW5. National Guard warrant officers must complete
this course prior to promotion to CW5. Army Reserve warrant officers will complete this course prior to promotion to
CW5. Graduates are recognized by MEL code WOSSC.
4–8. Department of Defense and Department of State schools
Based on Army requirements, OPMD may designate officers to attend courses at schools operated by the Department
of Defense, Department of State and Foreign Service Institute.
4–9. Foreign schools
Each year, based on quotas received by the U.S. Government, approximately 30 qualified officers are selected to attend
26 foreign schools in 15 different countries as students. AR 350–1 contains a list of the foreign schools that U.S.
officers attend. Foreign Area Officers receive preference for most of these schools.
4–10. Language training
More than 50 language courses are offered to meet Army requirements for officer linguists. The majority of these
courses are longer than 20 weeks, requiring the officer to PCS to a Defense Language Institute in Monterey, CA, or
Washington, DC. Officers receive language training only if being assigned to a language-coded position. Officers
30                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

trained at Government expense test in that language every year and are expected to maintain their proficiency at a 2/2
level as measured by the Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT).
4–11. Aviation training
All aviation officers attend initial entry flight training in conjunction with their officer basic course (WOBC/BOLC).
Company grade officers may volunteer for initial entry flight training in rotary wing aircraft under the provisions of
AR 611–110. Aviation qualification and transition training is based on worldwide aviation requirements. Aviators
requiring additional skills normally receive training during a permanent change of station (PCS) move. All officers may
volunteer for aircraft specific or MOS specific training. Course descriptions and prerequisites are in DA Pam 351–4.
4–12. Pre-command course
The pre-command course (PCC) is the Chief of Staff, Army’s program. It prepares selectees for command by providing
a common understanding of current doctrine and by providing both new and refresher training in selected functions and
duties. Brigade and battalion command preparation is a multi phase program that provides focused leader development
opportunities for all of the Army’s future senior leaders. Active Army (AA) and Active Guard Reserve (AGR) brigade
and battalion–level command selectees will attend a three or four phase pre-command continuing education and
training program, depending on type and level of command prior to assuming command. Phase I is the branch-
immaterial PCC at Fort Leavenworth, KS, followed by two or more of the following PCC phases prior to assuming
command. Phase II is training for specific command categories (MTOE Operational, IMT, Garrison, Recruiting,
Acquisition Corps and Corps of Engineers Division/ District Commands). Phase III is branch/functional training. Phase
IV is the senior officer’s legal orientation course, Charlottesville, VA. Prerequisites for the branch-immaterial PCC and
the Tactical Commanders Development Program are outlined in the Army Training Requirements and Resources
System (ATRRS) at www.atrrs.army.mil. Attendance at PCC is scheduled by the Human Resources Command
(AHRC), the Senior Leader Development (SLD) Office, or the ARNG as appropriate unless other wise stated. The
PCC requirements are detailed in AR 350–1.
4–13. Other military schooling
Many military school courses provide the knowledge or skills necessary for a specific assignment. Officers may apply
for these courses or are scheduled by OPMD, AHRC for such courses to qualify for a specific assignment. Complete
information on such courses is contained in DA Pam 351–4.
4–14. Application for military schools
Officers do not apply as students to centrally selected military schools. They receive automatic consideration for
centrally selected schools when they enter the appropriate zone of eligibility (except those officers who have completed
the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course). Officers may apply for training through their assignment
officers if they desire training en route to the next assignment or through their command channels if TDY and return to
the installation is appropriate. The OPMD, AHRC may automatically schedule such training if necessary for the
position.
4–15. Service obligation
   a. Attendance at military courses of instruction or civilian education programs at Government expense will incur a
service obligation. AR 350–100 governs all service obligations to include which courses of instruction result in an
active duty service obligation, what the policies and procedures are for computing service obligations and how service
obligations are fulfilled. Policies in AR 350–100 take precedence over other Army publications if there is a conflict.
   b. An Active Duty Service obligation (ADSO) differs from a requirement to be assigned to an Army Educational
Requirements System (AERS) position. An ADSO is a specific period of Active Duty that an officer serves before
eligible for voluntary separation. Assignment to an AERS position may be required in addition to the ADSO for the
Army to derive the greatest benefit from Government sponsored civilian education. AR 621–108 specifies the types of
education that require assignment to an AERS position.
4–16. Civilian education
   a. The Army Advanced Civilian Schooling program has two objectives: to meet Army requirements for advanced
education and to provide selected officers the opportunity to satisfy their educational aspirations.
   b. Company grade officers are required to obtain a baccalaureate degree from a qualifying educational institution
prior to attending the Captain Career Course. Officers are not eligible to attend the CCC before their 3rd year of
commissioned service.
   c. Officers should take advantage of opportunities for advanced education and should consider their civilian
education background when determining their qualifications for study in a given discipline. Officers who want to
pursue advanced degrees should do so in an academic discipline that supports their designated branch, functional area
or MOS. On completion of schooling, officers are assigned by grade, branch, functional area, MOS, civilian education
level, and when possible, academic discipline (or related discipline set) for initial utilization in an AERS validated
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            31

position. In this manner, specific Army requirements are satisfied while simultaneously contributing to the professional
development of the officer corps and the satisfaction of an officer’s educational aspirations.
   d. The appropriate proponent determines academic disciplines that support each branch, functional area or MOS.
4–17. Education programs
Officers may pursue full-time studies toward a master’s or doctoral degree through either fully funded or partially
funded programs or a bachelor’s degree through the Degree Completion Program. Officers are encouraged to pursue
advanced degrees particularly when there is an opportunity to do so in coordination with resident training such as CSC
and SSC. Officers with liberal arts undergraduate degrees should not be dissuaded from their pursuit of graduate
education in the sciences. Available education programs are discussed in general below. (AR 621–1 governs specific
civil school programs.)
   a. Fully funded programs. Under these programs, the Army pays all tuition costs and reimburses officers up to $600
per fiscal year for textbooks and supplies. In addition, the Army provides officers with full pay and allowances and
moves officers and their Families to the college or university of study. Normally, the period of schooling does not
exceed 18 months. Officers may not draw veterans’ benefits concurrent with fully funded education.
   (1) Advanced degree program. Selected officers attend graduate school to meet specific Army requirements estab-
lished by the AERS. On completing graduate studies, officers are assigned to AERS positions according to branch or
functional area, grade and appropriate academic skills. Utilization assignments are for 3 years. Officers can also expect
future utilization assignments to capitalize on the knowledge gained through participation in this program. Primary
zone of consideration to attend graduate school normally occurs on completion of the Captain Career Course, with
sufficient basic branch or MOS experience, and 6 to 8 years of AFCS; but no later than the 17th year of service.
   (2) Short course training. Tuition funds allocated to organizations are available for unprogrammed training that is
needed for current job performance when the training is less than 20 weeks and is in subjects for which the Army has
no in-house training capability.
   (3) Fully Funded Legal Education Program (FLEP). The Judge Advocate General’s (TJAG) Funded Legal Education
Program provides instruction leading to a law degree at an approved civilian school at Government expense (normally
3 academic years) for up to 25 selected company grade officers each fiscal year. Upon completion, the officer accepts
an appointment in The Judge Advocate General’s Corps for the period of the Active Duty obligation incurred under the
provisions of chapter 14, AR 27–1 and AR 350–100. The FLEP is the only approved program currently available for
Army officers to study the legal profession. Program participants perform on-the-job-training duties under the supervi-
sion of a staff judge advocate or legal officer designated by TJAG when school is not in session for 5 days or longer.
Program participants who do not finish school, or fail to pass the bar exam after two attempts, return to service in their
basic branch.
   (4) Training with industry. This program provides training in industrial procedures and practices not available
through military service schools or civilian education. The TWI provides officers with vital knowledge, experience and
perspective in management and operational techniques to fill responsible positions in Army commands and activities
that normally interface with civilian industry. It provides the trainee an opportunity to grapple with real problems
inherent to the business environment. Currently, these programs are concentrated in the areas of transportation,
procurement, logistics management, research and development, public affairs, banking, communication-electronics,
advertising and marketing, physical security, artificial intelligence and automation systems. The programs are normally
10 months with a predetermined follow-on assignment focusing on the experience gained. AR 621–1 provides
information on application procedures.
   b. Partially funded programs. Under these programs, the officer bears the cost of all tuition, fees and textbooks.
Many officers elect to use their in-service veterans benefits (if applicable) to help defray educational costs. The Army
provides officers with full pay and allowances and moves officers and their Families to the school location if the
schooling is 20 weeks or more. Participants attending schools for less than 20 weeks attend in a permissive TDY
status. After their branch notifies officers that they are accepted into the program, it is their responsibility to select and
be accepted by an accredited college or university.
   (1) Degree Completion Program (DCP). This program authorizes officers up to 18 months of full-time civilian
education to complete undergraduate or graduate degree requirements. Officers who lack an undergraduate degree are
encouraged to pursue studies on their own; however, the Army can assist by providing up to 1 year to allow
completion of the degree. Company and field grade officers pursuing an advanced degree must agree to study in an
academic discipline that supports their branch or functional area (or, in some cases, a designated skill). The primary
zone of consideration for the graduate level is the 5th through the 17th year of service.
   (2) Cooperative degree programs. Selected students attending schools such as the Command and General Staff
College (CGSC), the Logistics Executive Development Course (LEDC) at the Army Logistic Management College,
and certain Senior Service Colleges (SSCs) are offered the opportunity to participate in various courses conducted by
cooperating civilian institutions. Attendance at these courses is concurrent with the military schooling. After gradua-
tion, officers are authorized up to 12 months to complete graduate degree requirements as full-time resident students at
32                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

the civilian institution. Those attending SSC normally pursue studies during the summer school sessions immediately
before and after the military course. In all cooperative degree programs, officers pay for educational costs.
   c. Fellowships, scholarships, or grants. According to AR 621–7 eligible officers may apply for permission to accept
fellowships, scholarships or grants offered by corporations, foundations, funds or educational institutions. Participation
in such programs normally does not exceed 1 year and incurs an ADSO.
4–18. Tuition assistance
Eligible officers pursuing off duty undergraduate or graduate civilian education courses may apply for tuition assistance
under the provisions of AR 621–5. If approved, the Army pays up to 100 percent of tuition costs. Individual officers
pay all other amounts, such as fees for registration and matriculation and the cost of books and supplies. Participants
agree in writing to remain on Active Duty for a minimum of 2 years after completing the course or courses. (See AR
621–5, paragraph 2–9b(1).)
4–19. Eligibility criteria and application procedures
   a. Since many elements of the programs discussed in this chapter differ, officers should consult the governing Army
regulations for the specific eligibility criteria and application procedures.
   b. Selection for full-time civil schooling is governed by the needs of the Army; the officer’s demonstrated
performance, and his or her academic background. Officers pursuing a graduate degree should choose a discipline that
fulfills the professional development requirements of the officer’s designated branch, functional area or MOS. In
addition, applicants must have completed the Captain Career Course. Since selection for full-time schooling programs
is based in part on the availability of the officer, OPMD retains schooling applications until the applicant withdraws
from further consideration or becomes ineligible by virtue of military performance or years of service. Officers selected
for Advanced Civilian Schooling should expect a utilization assignment immediately after graduation. Officers who
attend fully funded educational programs are normally subject to recoupment if, prior to completing their required
service obligation, they separate from the Army voluntarily or involuntarily.
Chapter 5
Officer Promotions
5–1. General
This chapter covers the Active Duty promotion system for officers through the grade of colonel. This system
constitutes a vital aspect of military personnel management affecting each officer and, therefore, must be legally correct
and logically sound. Further, it must be administered fairly and equitably; to do otherwise would jeopardize the
effectiveness of the officer corps.
5–2. Promotion process objectives
   a. Though the specific procedures for selecting officers for grade advancement have varied over time, the objectives
of this process have remained constant—
   b. Ensure advancement to the higher grades of the best-qualified officers.
   c. Meet Army branch/MOS/functional area and grade requirements.
   d. Provide career incentive.
   e. To promote officers based on the whole person concept and potential to serve in the next higher grade.
   f. Although not an objective, identifying and eliminating ineffective officers is another result of the promotion
process.
5–3. Statutory requisites
The objectives of the promotion system are consistent with statutory requisites and the realities of the Army structure
and authorizations.
   a. The legal basis for the officer promotion system is contained in Title 10, United States Code (USC). This law
prescribes strength and grade authorizations, promotion list components, promotion procedures, and separation proce-
dures resulting from non-selection. The statutory requirements of Title 10 USC have been promulgated through
regulatory, directive, and policy means in the establishment and administration of the promotion system.
   b. The Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) became effective 15 September 1981. The DOPMA
was a major revision to Title 10 USC and is now the basis for the management of the company/field grade officer
corps. In 1984, the DOPMA provisions of Title 10 USC were amended to overcome certain unintended consequences
of the original act and to give the Service secretaries more flexibility in limiting eligibility for promotion consideration.
The current law:
   (1) Establishes statutory limitations on the number of officers who may serve in senior grades.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                                33

   (2) Provides common law for the appointment of Regular officers and for the Active Duty List service of Reserve
officers.
   (3) Provides uniform promotion procedures for officers in the separate Services.
   (4) Provides common provisions governing career expectation in the various grades.
   (5) Establishes common mandatory separation and retirement points for regular commissioned officers.
   (6) Increases the amount of separation pay for officers separated involuntarily short of retirement.
   (7) Provides related authorities to manage the officer force under the revised personnel system.
   (8) Increases the flexibility of Presidential authority under mobilization in times of declared crisis.
   c. The Warrant Officer Management Act (WOMA) was passed into law as part of the Fiscal Year 1992/1993
National Defense Authorization Act and went into effect on 5 December 1991. The WOMA is a major revision to Title
10 of the USC and has become the basis for the management of the Active Duty warrant officer corps. The current law
established—
   (1) Single promotion systems for warrant officers.
   (2) Tenure requirements based upon years of warrant officer service.
   (3) The grade of CW5.
   (4) Authorization for the Secretary of the Army, to convene boards to recommend, retirement-eligible warrant
officers, for selective mandatory retirement.
   d. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2007, effective 1 October 2006, highlighted the
Title 10, U.S. Code requirement to accommodate a standard for exemplary conduct as part of the officer promotions
process. The DODI 1320.4 sets policy for how promotion selection boards, special selection boards, and special review
boards evaluate officers against the standard of exemplary conduct and deal with adverse information on officer
conduct.
5–4. Active Duty List
   a. Background. The DOPMA and WOMA revised the laws providing for the establishment of separate Regular
Army (permanent) and Army of the United States (AUS) (temporary) lists and established a single, consolidated Active
Duty List (ADL). The DOPMA and WOMA, as revised, provide for the following:
   (1) Establishment of an initial ADL. No later than 6 months after 15 September 1981, all officers of the Army
serving under Chapter 36 of Title 10 USC as amended by DOPMA (except for those identified in section 641 of Title
10 USC) will be placed on the ADL in the same relative seniority that they held on 14 September 1981. Pre-WOMA
relative seniority was determined according to seniority criteria outlined in AR 600–8–29, and was primarily based on
the AUS date of rank a warrant officer held on 4 December 1991.
   (2) Adjustment to the ADL. Adjustments to the ADL are made to maintain the relative seniority among officers of
the Army as it existed on the day before the effective date of the law. Under provisions of Title 10 USC 741, the
Secretary of the Army did establish and/or adjust the ADL date of rank of any company/field grade officer who was
serving on Active Duty on 14 September 1981. Any Regular Army (RA) or U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) officer, who
on the effective date of DOPMA (15 September 1981) was serving on Active Duty in a temporary (AUS) grade that
was equal to their permanent (RA or USAR) grade, was awarded an ADL date of rank equal to that held in their AUS
grade. WOMA provided for the establishment of an initial Active Duty list that placed all warrant officers of the Army
serving under Title 10, USC, in the same relative seniority, which they held on 4 December 1991.
   b. Current law. As required by Title 10 USC, the Army maintains a single ADL on which officers are to be carried
in order of seniority. They are considered for promotion, each time a selection board is convened to consider officers in
an established DOR zone of consideration for their competitive category. The provisions of Title 10 USC 741 and 742
relate to rank among officers of the same grade as follows:
   (1) Establishes relative rank of the various officer grades.
   (2) Provides that rank among officers of the same grade or equivalent grade is initially determined by date of rank.
An officer with an earlier date of rank is senior to an officer with a later date of rank.
   (3) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army have prescribed rules for breaking date-of-rank ties and
general rules for establishing dates of rank when breaks in service, service credit and placement on the ADL
determinations must be made. The DOR and rank/precedence criteria have been published in AR 600–8–29.
   (4) To maintain the relative seniority among warrant officers of the Army as it existed on the day before the
effective date of the law, the Secretary of the Army established/adjusted the ADL on 4 December 1991. Any RA or
USAR warrant officer who, on the effective date of WOMA, was serving on Active Duty was awarded an ADL date of
rank equal to the highest grade, temporary (AUS) or permanent (USAR or RA), he or she had achieved.
5–5. Promotion process
   a. Title 10 USC provides for a single promotion process of all officers on Active Duty and on the ADL, regardless
of their component. Active Duty reserve officers serving on the ADL are no longer considered by Reserve boards.
34                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   b. The effect of the Title 10 USC/DOPMA/WOMA on the tenure and retirement opportunity for officers is shown in
table 5–1.
   c. The WOMA mandated a single promotion process for all warrant officers on Active Duty and the ADL,
regardless of their component. The requirement for warrant officers to be recommended by two different selection
boards (temporary and permanent) for promotion to the next higher grade was eliminated. On 5 December 1991,
warrant officers serving on Active Duty assumed as their permanent grade the highest grade, temporary (AUS) or
permanent (USAR or RA), they had held. Active Duty reserve officers serving on the ADL are no longer considered
by a reserve board.

5–6. Army grade structure
   a. The distribution of grades at major and above is controlled by Title 10 USC and may be further constrained by
Congress, the Office of the Secretary of the Army or the Chief of Staff, Army. Although Title 10 USC is subject to
revision and modification, the basic concept remains unchanged. In effect, the by-grade number of field grade officers
allowed depends on total officer authorized strength levels, which are based on the total size of the Army and
prescribed by the Secretary of the Army.
   b. The distribution of grade CW5 is established and controlled by Title 10 USC and WOMA and may be further
constrained by Congress, the Office of the Secretary of the Army, or the Chief of Staff of the Army. Although Title 10
and WOMA are subject to revision and modification, the basic concept remains unchanged. In effect, the number of
CW5 positions depends on the total warrant officer authorized strength level. The total number of warrant officer
authorizations is based on the size of the Army and is prescribed by the Secretary of the Army.
5–7. Promotion flow
   a. Changes in authorizations, losses and promotions to the next higher grade create fluctuations in both the time in
service (TIS) and time in grade (TIMIG) at which promotions occur. Under ideal circumstances, each qualified officer
would advance through the grade structure with some degree of predictability. However, a relatively standardized
promotion flow does not occur consistently due to expansion and contraction of the Army, changes in promotion
policies and variations in officer losses each year.
   b. Title 10 USC establishes minimum TIMIG requirements for promotion to the next higher grade as shown in table
5–2.
   c. The promotion timings, as stated in Department of Defense Instruction 1320.13 are expressed in terms of the
years of active Federal commissioned service at which promotion occurs. The promotion opportunity (DOPMA rate),
as stated in DODI 1320.13, is the percentage of total selects over the eligible in-the-zone population. Promotion timing
and opportunity objectives are shown in table 5–2.
   d. Changes in authorizations, losses, and promotions to the next higher grade create fluctuations in the point within a
warrant officer’s career at which promotions occur. Under ideal circumstances, each qualified warrant officer should
advance through the grade structure with some degree of predictability. This relatively standardized promotion flow is
not consistently obtainable due to expansion and contraction of the Army, changes in promotion policies, and variations
in warrant officer losses each year.
   e. The WOMA establishes minimum TIMIG requirements for promotion to the next higher grade. The warrant
officer promotion flow objective may be expressed in terms of years at which, warrant officer service promotions
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                                      35

occur. History has consistently revealed that rapid promotions, in terms of reduced time in grade, have occurred during
periods of force expansion. Conversely, promotions have always slowed down when force reductions occur. The
current warrant officer promotion flow objectives are shown in Table 5–2.

Notes:
1 TIS is separated into years of warrant officer service (WOS) for Tech and Aviation warrants.
5–8. Below-the-zone promotions
The below-the-zone (BZ) or secondary zone promotion capability is designed to allow the accelerated promotion of
outstanding officers who have demonstrated performance and indicated potential clearly superior to those who other-
wise would be promoted. Below-the-zone promotions apply only to promotion to the ranks of CW3, CW4, CW5,
major, lieutenant colonel and colonel. Officers will normally receive only one BZ consideration per grade. By law, the
number of officers recommended for promotion from below-the-zone may not exceed 10 percent of the total number
recommended; except that the Secretary of Defense may authorize that percentage to be increased to not more than 15
percent. Army policy sets the ACC below-the-zone promotion capability at 5.0 to 7.5 percent. Note that AMEDD,
Chaplain Corps and Judge Advocate General’s Corps are not part of the ACC.
5–9. Competitive categories
Each officer on the ADL is grouped in a competitive category for promotion as authorized in Title 10 USC and
prescribed in DOD Directive 1320.12. Competitive categories are established to manage the career development and
promotion of certain groups of officers whose specialized education, training, or experience, and often relatively
narrow utilization, make separate career management desirable. Officers in the same competitive category (see
paragraph 8–1b) will compete among themselves for promotion. There are six competitive categories for officers: the
Army Competitive Category includes all branches and functional areas other than the special branches; chaplains and
judge advocates are in separate categories; and the Army Medical Department has a category for the Medical Corps, a
category for the Dental Corps, and a category for all other Medical Department branches. There are two competitive
categories for the warrant officer corps, Technical and Aviation warrants.
5–10. Impact of the Officer Personnel Management System evolution
With the implementation of OPMS revisions, changes have occurred in company grade, field grade, and warrant officer
personnel management. These changes affect only Army Competitive Category officers and warrant officers.
   a. Promotion plan. As part of OPMS, the Army defines primary and secondary zones of consideration for field
grade promotions by basic year groups. The in-the-zone population, or primary zone, is usually established by the dates
the first and last due course officer was promoted from a specific year group. A due course officer is one who has been
on continuous Active Duty since commissioning as a second lieutenant and who has neither failed selection for
promotion nor been selected for promotion from below-the-zone. This primary zone is accessed into the Army, and at
times shaped, to achieve a promotion opportunity (table 5–2) that is relatively similar over a period of the next 5 years.
This procedure has become known as the five-year Field Grade Promotion Plan. OPMS revisions have not changed this
policy.
   b. Decentralized selections. The officer’s local commander approves promotion to first lieutenant (1LT) and CW2.
Normally, the battalion commander promotes with the recommendation of the company commander. Although the
promotion is thought of as being automatic upon completion of a specific period of Active Duty, the promotion is
based on an officer’s demonstrated performance. Officers who fail promotion to 1LT and CW2 are generally released
from Active Duty or discharged.
   c. Centralized selections. Officers promoted from captain through colonel and CW3 to CW5 are selected by HQDA
36                                                       DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

centralized boards. Selection boards are asked to recommend fully or best qualified (as appropriate) officers from an
inclusive zone of consideration (ZOC). The ZOC includes officers from above, in and below the promotion zone.
When the number of officers being considered exceeds the maximum number to promote, the boards operate under
best-qualified criteria. Centralized boards, except captain, are provided minimum promotion requirements (floors) by
branch, functional area or area of concentration to ensure the Army’s skill and grade mix balances with its needs.
Recommendations are based upon branch, MOS and functional area competency, the potential to serve in the higher
grade and the whole person concept. Factors considered include:
   (1) Performance.
   (2) Embodiment of Army Values.
   (3) Professional attributes and ethics.
   (4) Integrity and character.
   (5) Assignment history and professional development.
   (6) Military bearing and physical fitness.
   (7) Attitude, dedication and service.
   (8) Military and civilian education and training.
   (9) Concern for Soldiers and Families.
   d. Special branches. Promotion within special branches (AMEDD, Chaplain Corps and JAG Corps). The officer
promotion system reinforces all other personnel management programs to acquire and retain the right number of
officers, with the proper skills, to meet the Army’s needs. The objective of promotion within the special branches is to
maintain an orderly promotion flow that replaces losses, meets changing requirements, and recognizes uneven attrition
rates within these competitive categories. Provisions of the system include mandated floors by branch, functional area
or AOC and the optional employment of selection ceilings. Selection opportunity may vary among competitive
categories based upon projected requirements in the higher grades
   e. Instructions to promotion boards. Each board receives a Memorandum of Instruction from the Secretary of the
Army providing guidance for the selection process. Copies of these memorandums are released to the officer corps
following approval and public release of the board results. That portion pertaining to specialization has been expanded
significantly to indicate that, in today’s Army, the specialist has a significant role and responsibility. The instructions
highlight the need for the different officer professional development patterns required for accomplishing the Army’s
total mission. Instead of a single traditionally accepted career pattern through various grades, multiple paths for
advancement exist as the Army recognizes divergent Service needs and individual capabilities. Further, instructions to
promotion boards prescribe that promotion potential will be determined, for the most part, based on an officer’s record
of performance in their designated branch or functional area and the officer’s overall performance.
   f. Promotion board membership. Personal qualifications, experience, and performance determine promotion board
membership. The ACOM, ASCC and DRU commanders recommend board members (colonel and below) from lists
provided by the HQDA Secretariat for Selection Boards of eligible candidates who meet qualifications in a broad
spectrum of military fields. Following policy guidance from the Secretary of the Army, membership is designed to
adequately reflect the skills, commands and diversity of the competitive category under consideration. The Director of
Military Personnel Management, ODCS, G–1, approves the final slate of members on behalf of the Secretary of the
Army. The Chief of Staff, Army, approves general officer membership.
   g. Special selection boards. Special selection boards (SSBs) are convened as required to consider officers with dates
of rank above or in the promotion zone that were erroneously omitted from consideration or whose official records
contained material errors seen by the original board. Erroneous entries or omissions on the officer record brief (ORB)
generally do not justify reconsideration by a SSB. The officer’s responsibility to review his or her ORB at least
annually and the provision of AR 600–8–29 entitling officers in the zone of consideration to submit a letter to the
president of the board are considered sufficient opportunity to overcome minor administrative deficiencies.
Chapter 6
Officer Evaluation System
6–1. Overview
   a. The Officer Evaluation System identifies those officers most qualified for advancement and assignment to
positions of increased responsibility. Under this system officers are evaluated on their performance and potential
through duty evaluations, school evaluations and HQDA evaluations (both central selection boards and AHRC officer
management assessments).
   b. The assessment of an officer’s potential is a subjective judgment of the officer’s capability to perform at a
specified level of responsibility, authority or sensitivity. Potential is normally associated with the capability to perform
at a higher grade. However, the Army also assesses the officer’s potential for retention and increased responsibility
within a specified grade.
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                               37

   c. Officer qualifications provide the real link between the needs of the Army and individual officer performance.
They focus on an officer’s background in terms of experience and expertise and include such items as specialty
qualification, successful performance in demanding positions, civil and military schooling and physical profile. Per-
formance is the execution of tasks in support of the organization or Army missions. While results or accomplishment
of a series of tasks is the primary focus, the manner in which tasks are approached and a general adherence to officer
corps professional values are also important. The performance assessment by HQDA differs significantly from that
accomplished in the organizational duty environment. The organizational duty assessment involves personal knowledge
of the situations surrounding a specific performance for a specified period of time. The HQDA assessment is
accomplished by an after-the-fact assessment of a series of reports on performance over a variety of duty positions and
covering the officer’s entire career.
6–2. Officer Evaluation Reporting System
   a. The Officer Evaluation Reporting System is a subsystem of the Officer Evaluation System. It includes the
methods and procedures for organizational evaluation and assessment of an officer’s performance and an estimation of
potential for future service based on the manner of that performance.
   b. The official documents of these assessments are the OER and the academic evaluation report (AER).
   (1) The performance evaluation contained on the OER is for a specific rating period only. It focuses on comparing
the officer’s performance with the duty position requirements and the standards of the rating officials. Performance
includes the methods or means of effort used by an officer in accomplishing tasks assigned by superiors or implied by
the duty position. The results of his or her efforts or degree of task accomplishment and the degree of compliance with
the professional norms or values that apply to all officers regardless of duty position, grade or specialty.
   (2) The potential evaluation contained on the OER is a projection of the performance accomplished during the rating
period into future circumstances that encompass greater responsibilities. The primary focus of this assessment is the
capability of the officer to meet increasing levels of responsibility in relation to his or her peers.
   (3) The AER is prepared for officers who take part in resident and nonresident training at service schools and
civilian educational institutions. It explains the accomplishments, potential, and limitations of students while attending
courses.
   c. The OER system is directly linked to the OPMS. Raters and senior raters are required to recommend a potential
functional category Branch and/or functional area for future service on all Army Competitive Category captains in
Parts Vc and VIId on each OER. These rating chain recommendations, given by rating officials over a series of OERs,
will provide pertinent information for Functional Designation Boards.
6–3. Relationship with OPMS, leader development, and character development process
   a. The primary function of the Officer Evaluation Reporting System is to provide information from the organiza-
tional chain of command to be used by HQDA for officer personnel decisions. The information contained in the OER
is correlated with the Army’s needs and individual officer qualifications. It provides the basis for OPMS personnel
actions such as promotion, branch and functional area designation, elimination, retention in grade, retention on Active
Duty, reduction in force, command and project manager designation, school selection, assignment and specialty
designation.
   b. An equally important function of the Officer Evaluation Reporting System is to encourage the professional
development of the officer corps. To accomplish this, the system uses the Army’s leadership doctrine to relate teaching,
coaching, counseling and assessing of the Army Values to improve performance and enhance professional develop-
ment. Particularly valuable is the developmental counseling fostered through senior officers linking the Army’s
evaluation system to its leader development and personnel management systems. Developmental counseling is the
responsibility of senior officers to provide feedback concerning professional growth, potential and career pathways to
success. While these aspects of developmental counseling through mentorship have always been a major element of the
evaluation process, they must be continually emphasized.
   c. For further information on the Officer Evaluation System, see AR 623–3 and DA Pam 623–3.
Chapter 7
Reserve Component Officer Development and Career Management
7–1. Purpose
   a. The Officer Personnel Management System (OPMS) for the Reserve Component (RC) is primarily executed by
AHRC for Army Reserve and by the State Human Resource Offices for the Army National Guard. Some elements of
OPMS are executed at local unit level due to the unique aspects of RC duty. The purpose of OPMS as it is applied to
the RC is the same as outlined in paragraph 3–1. This chapter discusses the unique aspects of OPMS for the RC.
   b. The Reserve Components of the Army include the ARNG and the Army Reserve. When not in a Federalized
status (under Federal control), the ARNG comes under control of the states, the territories of Guam and the Virgin
38                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or the District of Columbia. The Army Reserve is a Federal force within
the Department of the Army.
7–2. Factors affecting Officer Personnel Management in the Reserve Components
   a. OPMS within the RC is also influenced by factors described in paragraph 3–2. In addition OPMS for RC officers
is influenced by the different categories that RC officers serve in.
   b. The RC consists of three categories: the Ready Reserve, the Standby Reserve, and the Retired Reserve. All
Reserve and Guard officers are assigned to one of these three categories.
   c. The Ready Reserve is the largest category in the RC and contains the overwhelming majority of RC officers. The
Ready Reserve consists of the Selected Reserve, the IRR and the Inactive National Guard (ING).
   (1) The Selected Reserve consists of the following:
   (a) Units manned and equipped to serve and/or train either as operational or as augmentation units. These units
consist of:
   1. Troop program unit (TPU) Reservists. These are officers who are required to perform (drill) 48 unit training
assemblies (UTAs) per year and 14 days (15 days for ARNG) per year in annual training (AT) status. These members
are in a paid status while performing these duties.
   2. Active Guard Reserve (AGR). In accordance with Title 10 USC, section 101(16), the term “Active Guard and
Reserve” means a member of a reserve component who is on Active Duty pursuant to Title 10, USC sections 12310 or
Title 32 USC, sections 502(f) and 709(a) and in accordance with DODI 1205. These officers are Guard or Reserve
members who are ordered to Active Duty or full-time National Guard duty for the purpose of organizing, administer-
ing, recruiting, instructing or training the Reserve component units. The AGR status is defined as officers serving in an
Active Duty status for at least 180 days, performing administrative and training duties in direct support of the ARNG
and USAR. The primary objective of the AGR program is to improve the readiness of the Reserve Component.
   3. AR Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA). These officers are trained individuals assigned to an active
component, Selective Service System or Federal Emergency Management Agency organization in billets that must be
filled on, or shortly after mobilization. Officers assigned to this control group perform at least 12 days of AT each year
and are assigned to a specific duty position in an AA unit or organization.
   (b) Training Pipeline (Non-deployable Account). These are officers who have not yet completed initial active duty
for training, and include all officers who are in training for professional categories including: undergraduate flying
training, chaplain candidates, health profession students, early commissioning program participants, and cadets enrolled
in the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP).
   (2) The AR Individual Ready Reserve. These officers are Reserve officers not serving in the Selected Reserve. The
IRR is a manpower pool comprised of trained individuals who have some period of their military service obligation or
contractual commitment remaining. Members may voluntarily participate in training for retirement points and promo-
tions with or without pay. The IRR members may be required to meet the same training requirements as Selected
Reservists. Required training (involuntary) may not exceed 30 days a year. The IRR officers serve in one of four
control groups—
   (a) Control Group-Annual Training. Ready Reserve officers with a training obligation, but who do not belong to an
Army Reserve unit. They must perform AT when so directed.
   (b) Control Group-Reinforcement. All other non-unit Ready Reserve officers not assigned to another control group.
   (c) Control Group-Officer Active Duty Obligor. Active duty officers who are appointed in the Army Reserve but do
not enter onto Active Duty at the time of their appointment. These officers maintain their obligated status and may be
ordered to Active Duty or duty with an ARNG or Army Reserve unit.
   (d) Control Group-Dual Component. Regular Army of the United States warrant officers who hold Army Reserve
commissions or warrants.
   (3) ARNG Inactive National Guard personnel. The ING consists of National Guard personnel in an inactive status in
the Ready Reserve, not in the Selected Reserve, attached to a specific National Guard unit. To remain ING members,
they muster once a year with their assigned unit, but do not participate in training activities. The ING Soldiers are
considered mobilization assets of the unit. Similar to other IRR, some ING members have legal and contractual
obligations. The ING members may not participate in training activities for points or pay and are not eligible for
promotion.
   d. The Retired Reserve is comprised of all Reserve officers who receive retired pay on the basis of Active Duty and/
or reserve service; all Reserve officers who are otherwise eligible for retired pay but have not reached age 60 and who
have not elected discharge and are not voluntary members of the Ready or Standby Reserve; and other retired
reservists. All retired members who have completed at least 20 years Active Duty (Regular or Reserve), regardless of
the retired list to which assigned, may be ordered to Active Duty involuntarily whenever required as determined by the
Secretary of the Army.
7–3. Officer Personnel Management System
   a. The flexibility of the OPMS enables AR and ARNG unique policies, where necessary, to facilitate officer
                                              DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           39

management and development for RC officers. The OPMS subsystems of: Strength Management, Assignments,
Professional Development, Evaluation, Centralized Selection, and Review Process, described in paragraph 3–3 apply to
both the AA and RC. Examples of RC-unique policies within these subsystems are:
   (1) Assignments. Assignments for AR TPU, IMA and ARNG M–Day officers are constrained by geography and
structure. Assignment policies for the RC take into account these constraints and enable officers not serving full time to
continue to develop while allowing those officers to establish and maintain civilian occupations. Assignment policies
for AGR personnel have constraints, however AR AGR assignments are not limited by geography, and ARNG AGR
assignments are limited only by State boundaries.
   (2) Centralized selection. The implementation of the Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act in 1996 brought
the RC company and field grade officer promotion systems in synchronization with the Active Component. It
established a best-qualified promotion system for RC officers, replacing the fully qualified system previously used.
There is a centralized selection process for officers in the AR and ARNG. However, there are also policies and
procedures to conduct decentralized unit vacancy promotions to fill critical positions, and both the AR and the ARNG
have policies and processes within OPMS for a decentralized selection process where required to account for
geographic constraints, Within the ARNG, States conduct selection for brigade and battalion level commands. Within
the AR, Regions conduct selection for battalion level commands.
   (3) Professional development. While RC officers share the same mission as their AA counterparts, the unique nature
of the RC officer’s role as a “citizen Soldier” poses a challenge for professional development. RC officers are expected
to follow AA officer development patterns as closely as possible, except that RC officers, in some instances, have
increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. To meet professional development objectives, RC
officers may need to rotate among TPU, the IRR, and the IMA programs. These transfers are necessitated by
geographical considerations, as well as the need to provide as many officers as possible the opportunity to serve with
troops in leadership and staff positions. Additionally, there may be occasions when officers need to transfer to the IRR
while they complete mandatory educational requirements. Such transfers will be temporary and should not be seen as
impacting negatively on the officer’s career. The success of an officer is not measured by length of service in any one
component or control group, but by the officers breadth of experience, duty performance and adherence to branch and
functional requirements.
   b. The OPMS model described in paragraph 3–3b applies to the Active Army and Reserve Component. The OPMS
model provides the flexibility to allow officers to grow in their basic branch or functional area, and gain and breadth of
experience. Managing officers within the functional aligned design will provide opportunities for officers to be well
grounded in their branch and functional, provide opportunities to gain additional competencies to create multiple-
skilled leaders, and still provide the flexibility necessary to compensate for the challenges of civilian employment,
geography, and structure.
7–4. Officer development
   a. Reserve Component officers are accessed into the RC at company grade and field grade level. Initial accession is
into the Army’s basic branches; and officers should seek educational and developmental assignment opportunities
outlined by their proponent to gain depth in their chosen branch. Officers previously commissioned by another
component are accessed in either their current branch/functional area or will undergo a branch/functional area transfer.
   b. RC officers do not have a centralized functional category designation, but choose to transition to a functional area
and functional categories at critical points of their career. Officers who choose to designate in a functional area will
complete PME or other qualification training necessary. Once a RC officer commits to a functional area designation,
normally at the senior company grade/junior field grade level, officers should seek assignment to positions requiring
expertise in the particular specialty associated with the officer’s functional category branch or functional area skills.
Senior RC officers well grounded in their branch/functional area should increase their breadth by seeking assignments
outside their basic branch/functional areas, in developmental positions that require leadership and managerial skills
common to all officers.
   c. The objectives of OPMS in the RC are achieved through interaction between the individual, proponent, career
managers, and the field commander. The level of control and the nature of that interaction differ based on the
component and status the officer. Each, however each plays a vital role in the officer’s development. As a general rule
HR organizations at the Army and State level play a greater role in AGR officer’s assignment development. Individuals
and commanders are more influential in the development of TPU and M–Day officers.
   (1) Development in a designated specialty: Although RC officers serve in the same branches and functional areas as
the AA, RC officers may be limited to certain branches and functional areas based on their geographic location and the
military structure.
   (2) Officer professional education. This includes resident and nonresident instruction, on-the-job training, individual
study and when appropriate, civilian education. The AR is pursuing a change to current regulatory guidance to remove
military education as a promotion selection criterion for captain through colonel.
   (3) Progressive operational assignments. Progressive operational assignments serve to give officers depth in their
chosen branch or functional area. RC officers should aggressively seek operational assignments of increasing responsi-
bility and complexity. The assignment and transfer of officers is a collective effort between the career management
40                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

officer, the officer and his or her unit. The applicable TOE or TDA prescribes the grade, branch and MOS require-
ments for positions to which officers may be assigned. In the RC environment, assignment options are constrained by
the force structure and demographic and geographic limitations. For these reasons, RC officers may need to accept
assignments throughout the Selected Reserve. RC officers must also realize the possibility of occasional temporary
transfers to the IRR, especially in conjunction with the completion of Professional Military Education (PME) require-
ments. These transfers provide the officer an opportunity to complete required studies without the distraction of a troop
assignment and allow other officers the opportunity to gain troop leadership experience. The concepts of equivalent
assignment and constructive credit should be considered when determining RC operational assignments. There are
numerous leadership positions within the RC structure that do not fall into the traditional definition of TOE/TDA
command. TOE Leadership and command positions should be recognized, and desired as potential assignments,
however there are also TDA staff positions in Regional and State commands that require quality leaders and provide
similar operational experience as battalion and brigade staff positions. Careful planning and programming by agencies,
commanders and the individual officer are essential to maximize the career potential and efficient use of officer skills,
knowledge and attributes. Experience gained through challenging and varied assignments enhances officer development
and provides trained officers able to meet the dynamic needs of the Reserve Components.
   (4) Professional development counseling and mentoring. Counseling and mentoring is a critical component of RC
officer development. Counseling is conducted by commanders at all levels as well as by career managers at AHRC or
the State. However, the development of each officer will vary due to the assignment opportunities available to the
officer given his geographic location and civilian occupation. These realities of RC service make mentors especially
critical for RC officer professional development.
   (5) Designation and election of branches, functional areas and functional categories.
   (a) Branch designation. Upon commissioning, lieutenants are designated in a basic branch for training and initial
assignment. Officers attend the company grade level education at the school of the branch to which they are detailed.
During the early years of service, professional development within the branch follows the proponent’s life-cycle model.
Generally, the first 8–12 years of service are devoted to branch developmental assignments and training that prepares
the company grade officer for further advancement. Company grade officers may request, in writing, a voluntary
branch transfer in accordance with AR 140–10.
   (b) Functional designation (FD). The Army Promotion List (APL) groups interrelated branches and functional areas
into officer management categories called functional categories and functional groups. The RC officers may choose,
based on operational or civilian experience, structure limitations or personal preference to specialize in a functional
area. The AR 140–10 outlines how RC officers are designated in a functional area. Officers who choose to designate in
a functional area are encouraged to continue to choose assignments that continue to build depth in their chosen
specialty. Education, training and experience; and evaluation reports are taken into account in determining an officer’s
suitability to serve in a functional area and additional training required to be qualified in the chosen functional area.
   1. Many RC officers are leaders in industry, the community and in the corporate world. Many positions in
corporations provide training and experience not only useful to the military but closely related to military specialty
skills officers at all levels should be sensitive to the relationship between civilian occupations and training and military
skills. Being the financial officer for a corporation certainly provides evidence of qualification as a military finance
officer. Leadership in a civilian occupation provides evidence of potential for military leadership positions. These are
examples of constructive credit possibilities that should be considered in determining an officer’s qualification for
branch and functional area designation, and award of areas of concentration and skills. Section VII of Chapter 4, AR
611–1 provides guidance for evaluating civilian education and occupation experience in the classification of RC
officers. Officers may also apply for constructive or equivalent credit for military education courses in accordance with
AR 135–155.
   2. ARNG Officer Personnel Classification Boards (OPCB) can determine an officer to be qualified in his or her duty
position, however, the officer may not be considered fully qualified until meeting other related criteria in this pamphlet
(for example 12 months service in a functional area assignment or 36 months as a commander). The officer does not
have to be considered fully qualified in his or her Branch area of concentration (BR–AOC) or functional area (FA)-
AOC to be considered for favorable personnel actions. Additional requirements beyond the mandatory military
education for award of the AOC will not preclude the officer from being promoted or reassigned.
   (c) Joint Duty Assignment Reserve (JDA–R). Officers in the RC serve in Joint Headquarters, Joint State Task Force
Headquarters and in other assignments that interact with other services and agencies. The definitions and management
processes for Joint accreditation for RC officers was established 1 Oct 07, John Wagner National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act 2007. Experience–Joint Duty Assignments (E–JDA) are assignments and experiences that demonstrate an
officer’s mastery of knowledge, skills, and abilities in joint matters. Experience Joint Duty Assignments (E–JDAs)
include non-Joint Duty Assignment List (non-JDAL) RC in OSD, the Joint Staff, Combatant Command HQs, and
Defense Agencies HQs. This includes joint credit for Desert Shield/Desert Storm and for service in designated Joint
Task Forces (JTFs). All officers are eligible to have their non-JDAL billet experiences reviewed for possible award of
joint experience points. These points, along with completion of the requisite JPME would make them eligible for joint
qualifications. RC officers have opportunities to gain JPME I and II credit, and will gain JPME credit along with their
                                              DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                              41

AA counterparts at ILE (JPME I) and at the Joint Forces Staff College or in a Senior Service College (SSC) (JPME II).
RC officers also serve in numerous positions that involve assignments/experiences in the JIIM.
   d. The RC has positions that are independent of branch or functional area coding and are designated as branch/
functional area generalist, immaterial positions. RC company and field grade officers can expect to serve in these
assignments at various times during their careers, regardless of their functional designation. Officers are selected for
these positions based on overall manner of performance, previous experience, military and civilian education and
estimated potential for further service.
   e. Both branches and functional areas may require more specific job skills and qualifications to further prepare their
officers to meet highly specialized AOC position requirements. Areas of concentration are described in the branch/
functional area chapters of this pamphlet.
   f. Branch/FA development fosters a mastery of skills for an officer’s grade in a specific branch or FA. Branch
development enables captains to achieve mastery of common core and branch skills that assure a strong professional
development foundation essential for success as a field grade officer. Generally speaking, branch development for RC
captains equates to completion of the appropriate CCC and successful performance in a key developmental assignment.
Branch development for majors results from completion of Intermediate Level Education and successful performance
in a branch or FA assignment. During an RC officer’s field grade years, OPMS allows for the broadening of an
officer’s development from mastery of branch skills to more multifunctional skills. RC officers have the opportunity
and are encouraged to expand their knowledge and skills beyond their specific branch through multiple avenues. These
opportunities could include assignments in cross-branch/FA, assignments and opportunities to serve in JIIM
assignments.
   g. Under the current OPMS, RC APL majors and lieutenant colonels compete for promotion without regard to their
branch or functional area. Selection for promotion is based on the fundamentals of performance and potential for
further service. These are measured by the officer’s relative standing with his peers as indicated by their evaluation
reports, educational qualification, and assignment history. The selection boards are instructed as to the number of field
grade officers to select based on Army needs, law, policy and budget. As with the AA promotion boards, the boards
receive guidance on the officer qualities expected for in the Secretary of the Army’s Memorandum of Instruction
(MOI). Congress and the Secretary of the Army approve promotion selection lists prior to publication. In addition to
selection for promotion via a DA centralized selection board, or a unit vacancy promotion process, RC officers must be
assigned in the position of higher grade to be promoted.

Notes:
1 Officers attain JPME I qualification by completing the full ILE curriculum. Completing only the ILE Common Core will preclude serving in joint assignments
and attending JPME II/AJPME institutions, including Senior Service Colleges.
7–5. Company grade development
The goals of OPMS for the Reserve Component are the same as those for the Active Duty. Laws and regulations
specific to the ARNG and AR affect OPMS implementation. OPMS in the ARNG is executed by the state, within the
guidance and policies established by HQDA and NGB. OPMS for USAR is executed by the Army Human Resources
Command (AHRC-St Louis). Specific guidance for USAR officers is addressed in AR 135–175, and AR 140–10, and
for the AR 135–18 for Active Guard and Reserve officers.
   a. Branch-specific development. The Basic Officer Leader Course Phase I (BOLC I) is the commissioning source
(OCS, ROTC, Direct Appointment). Upon commissioning, all RC officers begin their professional development by
attending the Basic Officer Leader Course, Phase II (BOLC II), followed by the Basic Officer Leader Course, Phase III
(BOLC III).
   (1) Basic education. BOLC marks the beginning of a company grade officer’s formal military professional develop-
ment training following commissioning. BOLC II and III prepare officers for their first duty assignment and provide
instruction on methods for training and leading individuals, teams, squads and platoons. Additionally, the course
42                                                       DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

provides officers with a detailed understanding of equipment, tactics, organization and administration at the company,
battery or troop level. All phases of BOLC must be completed within 2 years of commissioning for an officer to be
eligible for promotion, a mobilization asset, and remain in the Army Reserve and ARNG. For additional information on
BOLC II and III refer to chapter 4, paragraphs 4–7a-c.
   (2) Initial assignments. RC officers are normally assigned to a predetermined unit of assignment upon accession into
the Army Reserve. Included in these assignments are CONUS or overseas troop units where officers begin to develop
their leadership skills. All junior officers should seek leadership positions in troop units whenever possible. Troop
leadership is the best means to build a solid foundation for future service.
   (3) To be eligible for promotion to captain, RC officers must complete both their baccalaureate degree and phases II
and III of BOLC.
   (4) Captains OES. The Army’s current formal education process for captains is the Captain Career Course which
officers attend either in resident or nonresident status. The RC officers should attempt to attend and complete their
branch CCC before or immediately following their promotion to the grade of captain. The course combines the
instruction formerly taught in the branch Officer Advanced Course (OAC) and the Combined Arms and Services Staff
School (CAS3). If their CCC does not include the Combined Arms Exercise (CAX) (formerly CAS3), then the officer
must also attend CAX to be eligible for further education opportunities. Selected captains deemed to have demonstrated
superior performance in their basic branch may be selected to receive this training at schools other than their basic
branch. Officers seeking accession into Special Forces will normally attend the Maneuver CCC. For additional
information about Captains OES, refer to chapter 4, paragraph 4–7d.
   (5) Branch opportunities. All company grade officers should focus their efforts during the company grade years on
mastering the basic skills of their specific branch. Much of the value an RC officer brings to future assignments is
dependent on experience gained by leading Soldiers and mastering basic branch skills. Officers who have demonstrated
the potential and desire to command Soldiers should seek command positions. The number of company commands
within a specific branch, or a specific area may not afford all officers the opportunity to command at the captain level.
Command opportunities for captains are found in traditional tables of organization and equipment (TOE) line units or
tables of distribution and allowances (TDA) units in training, garrison and headquarters organizations.
   b. Post-initial branch development. After a company grade officer has been afforded a branch development opportu-
nity, a number of options for continued professional development are available. At this time, the officer, commanders,
and career managers assess the individual’s developmental objectives for the post-branch development phase. The types
of assignments and developmental patterns for this phase are as follows:
   (1) Branch assignments. The range of further assignments to branch-coded positions is a function of the Army’s
structure, unit fill, and officer’s flexibility. These assignments may include staff and faculty positions at training
schools, duty with Regional or State Headquarters, or staff positions in tactical or training units. Branch assignments
further develop the basic branch skills and employ the officer’s accumulated skills, knowledge and attributes.
   (2) Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Some company grade officers may serve in positions coded 01A
(Officer Generalist) or 02A (Combat Arms Generalist). These branch/functional area generalist positions do not require
an officer from a specific branch or functional area but may be performed by an officer with certain experiences,
manner of performance and demonstrated potential.
   (3) Officers who choose to designate into functional areas should expect training and education opportunities to
focus on their areas of specialization and include progressive and repetitive assignments of increasing responsibility.
Each of the functional area chapters in this pamphlet outlines developmental positions.
   (4) Advanced degrees. Officers should seek opportunities to obtain graduate level degrees in designated disciplines.
Advanced degree programs for RC officers are currently limited; however officers should try to further their education
through tuition assistance (TA), and State and local programs.
   (5) Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multi-national Training Opportunities. This emerging program intends
to provide short-term (90 to 180 days) training for officers providing them the skills necessary to lead the Army of the
future.
   (6) Training with industry. Some branches and functional areas participate in TWI, where officers are assigned to a
civilian industry to observe and learn the technical and managerial aspects of that field. The total number of training
quotas varies annually from 50 to 70 based on budget, policy and requirements. Officers selected for this program must
be proficient in their branch, have a manner of performance that reflects a strong potential for future service and be
able to serve a utilization tour upon completion of training. The TWI program is outlined in AR 621–1 and in the
specific branch and functional area chapters later in this pamphlet.
   (7) Army Acquisition Corps (AAC). The AHRC hosts an Acquisition Accession Board annually to select branch-
qualified captains for FA 51. The AAC officers may receive a fully funded master’s degree (if not already at civilian
education level 2), attend the Materiel Acquisition Management Course and other FA related training, and serve
repetitive assignments in their acquisition specialties to prepare them for critical acquisition positions at field grade
level. The Army Acquisition Corps, created in early 1990, is described in detail in chapter 48 of this pamphlet.
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            43

   (8) Selection for promotion to major. Below-the-zone opportunities are currently being considered for AR officers.
BZ opportunities occur approximately a year earlier than officers are currently considered for the DA Board.
7–6. Major development
   a. This phase begins with selection for promotion to major. The junior field grade years serve to develop the officer
cohort in a variety of branch or functional area assignments within their functional category.
   b. The general development goals are to complete military education level (MEL) Intermediate Level Education
(ILE), and successfully complete other branch, functional area or broadening assignments prior to consideration for
promotion to lieutenant colonel. The ILE will provide a quality education for all field-grade officers and prepare them
for their next ten years of service. See paragraph 4–7e for further discussion of ILE.
   c. The minimum time in grade (TIG) for majors is 4 years and the maximum TIG is 7 years
7–7. Lieutenant colonel development
   a. This phase generally occurs when an officer has at least 3 years TIG. Officers in the grade of lieutenant colonel
serve as senior leaders and managers throughout the Army providing wisdom, experience, vision and mentorship
mastered over many years.
   b. The professional development goals for a lieutenant colonel are to broaden their branch, functional area and skill
proficiency at the senior levels through assignments and schooling. Most of these officers will serve in high visibility
billets in their branch, functional area or JIIM positions, and a possible assignment to a cross-branch/functional area
developmental position.
   (1) Branch assignments. RC lieutenant colonels can expect branch-coded assignments to both TDA and TOE
positions. These billets can range from positions within a battalion through echelons above corps (EAC). Branch
proponents have outlined developmental standards in their respective chapters of this pamphlet.
   (2) Functional area assignments. The OPMS design allows officers to serve in repetitive assignments within a
functional area to gain a high degree of expertise. Functional area proponents have outlined developmental standards in
their respective chapters of this pamphlet.
   (3) Joint duty assignments. Although the RC does not have a formal Joint Credentialing program, there are many
assignments available in the RC to gain exposure and experience in joint operations.
   (4) Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Some officers will serve outside their branch or functional area in
billets coded as branch/functional area generalist. Such assignments are found throughout the Army in troop and staff
organizations from the installation to Department of the Army level.
   (5) Semi-Centralized Selection. A semi-centralized board is held by each Regional Readiness Command (RRC)/
Regional Support Command (RSC) which selects a limited number of officers for command and key billets. The
lieutenant colonel Command Assignment Selection Board (LTCCASB) contains both TOE and TDA positions. The
command board meets at least annually (usually semi-annually) to select commanders from the eligible officers.
Command opportunity varies based on force structure and the command categories for which an officer competes. On
average, lieutenant colonels serve in their command tours during their 18th through 20th years of service
   (6) Senior Service College (SSC). The Army War College does not accept individual applications into its Senior
Service College programs except through special exceptions. Students are centrally selected by their component. Army
Reserve officers are selected according to AR 140–12 (and DA Pam 140–12). Commissioned officers from all
components should remember that according to the provisions of AR 350–100, attendance at the Army War College
incurs a 2-year service obligation. U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course (DEP) allows you to participate
in a two-year, rigorous program of instruction that results in the award of the same graduation certificate and the same
fully-accredited master of science degree awarded to graduates of the resident program. You will need to devote 15
hours each week to a program that is delivered to you via the Internet, one that leverages technology to enhance the
educational experience. Only the resident SSC courses and nonresident Army War College course award MEL SSC
upon completion. SSC graduates are assigned to organizations based on guidance from the Chief of Army Reserve, and
Director of Army National Guard. Tours following graduation are to the Army Staff (ARSTAF), the JCS, Secretary of
Defense (SECDEF), Army Command (ACOM), and combatant command staffs in branch, functional area, branch/
functional area generalist or joint positions.
   c. Below-the-zone selection is possible, and officers will only be considered once prior to their primary zone
consideration.
7–8. Colonel development
   a. Those officers selected for promotion to colonel continue their senior field grade phase that concludes with their
separation or retirement from Active Duty or selection for promotion to brigadier general. Attaining the grade of
colonel is realized by a select few and truly constitutes the elite of the officer corps. As colonels, their maximum
contribution to the Army is made as commanders and senior staff officers.
   b. The general professional development goals for colonels are to further enhance branch or functional area skill
proficiency through additional senior level assignments and schooling.
44                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   (1) Branch assignments. Many colonels can expect to receive assignments to branch coded positions at the brigade,
division, corps and echelons above corps in the TOE environment. TDA organizations throughout the Army also need
the expertise of senior field grade officers.
   (2) Functional area assignments. Under OPMS, functional area officers should strive to work predominantly in their
specialties after selection for promotion to major. Having risen above their peers at the grade of major and lieutenant
colonel, those promoted to colonel are truly the world-class specialists in their respective fields. These officers should
seek senior managerial billets in the RC coded for their specialty.
   (3) Joint duty assignment. Although there is currently no RC Joint Duty Assignment Reserve List (JDA–R), officers
should seek joint development in positions that provide Joint experience.
   (4) Command selection. Some officers are selected for command at the colonel level. Most positions are branch
coded and branch officers compete within designated categories for these positions. The command selection process
differs depending on the officers’ status as an AGR, or TPU officer. Command selections are approved by the CAR or
the State Adjutants General. The majority of officers in a cohort year group do not command; they make their
maximum contribution to the Army in other important branch or functional area senior staff assignments.
7–9. Warrant officer development
Career management is of critical importance to the modern RC warrant officer. Most RC warrant officers have their
civilian goals and projections programmed several years into the future. However, coordinated management of RC
warrant officers’ military careers is a recent innovation. The modern RC warrant officer is a complex person with
numerous skills and disciplines, both civilian and military. The need for a thorough, professionally designed leader
development plan is both obvious and imperative. The career RC warrant officer must be well trained to fill his or her
mobilization role.
   a. Army National Guard.
   (1) ARNG warrant officer career management is the responsibility of the State Adjutants General.
   (2) The National Guard Bureau (NGB) communicates Department of the Army policy to the State Adjutants General
in all matters concerning warrant officer career management.
   (3) Leader development is a primary command responsibility. Commanders at all levels assist in the administration
of WOLDAP–ARNG by coordinating with the officer personnel manager (OPM) to develop and properly guide the
career of each officer in their command, recommending assignments according to qualifications, aptitudes, potential
and desires of their officers, serving as mentors, conducting periodic evaluations and counseling, and recommending
leader development schools and training.
   (4) Organization personnel officers, especially at battalion level, play a vital role in career management for ARNG
warrant officers. The responsibilities of the personnel officer include maintaining liaison with the OPM, assisting
warrant officers in maintaining their records, counseling warrant officers concerning requirements for designation of
MOS and functional areas, maintaining the Military Personnel Records Jacket (MPRJ), and making recommendations
to the commander and the MPMO for changes to the personnel status of warrant officers.
   (5) Warrant officers have the final responsibility for ensuring they are progressing satisfactorily in their professional
development. They establish goals and evaluate progress, making necessary adjustments to achieve personal goals and
professional proficiency.
   (6) The OMPFs for all ARNG warrant officers are maintained at NGB. The appropriate State Adjutant General
office maintains a field military personnel record jacket for each warrant officer.
   (7) The Adjutant General of the State establishes unit location and stationing.
   b. USAR.
   (1) Commanders and personnel management officers (PMOs) are charged with the duty of developing the most
professionally competent USAR warrant officers possible by consistently providing meaningful training opportunities
for the warrant officers within their area of management responsibility. The PMO has training programs available
which are designed to provide a balance of military experience during each USAR warrant officer’s career.
   (2) The TPU is one important training vehicle. In the TPU, warrant officers gain the operational assignment
experience necessary for leader development. In this area, commanders must be closely involved with the developmen-
tal process of their subordinate warrant officers by offering progressive and sequential assignments and ensuring that
appropriate skills, knowledge, and attitudes are developed.
   (3) A balance must be maintained between assignments to TPUs and assignments within the IMA and IRR.
Diversity of assignment reduces the probability of narrow, limited training and assignment experience. Stagnation in
any category of assignment can be counterproductive to the development of the individual officer, as well as
improperly utilizing the availability of assignments to enhance the professional capability of the entire warrant officer
corps.
   (4) In the IRR, the warrant officer is able to "update" his background by training with the Active Army in
progressive career field assignments. This type of assignment is called “counterpart training.” IMA assignments may
also be available.
   c. Warrant officer management considerations.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                               45

   (1) Army National Guard. To properly plan for the development and assignment of warrant officers into positions of
increasing responsibility, it is necessary to have an overview of the State force structure and an inventory of warrant
officer positions. States develop a State Master Development Plan (SMDP) as a tool for this purpose. The SMDP
allows for analysis of all MOSs authorized by State force structure documents, to determine career progression patterns
for warrant officers within the State. The SMDP is used to determine how many warrant officers in each MOS the
Adjutant General needs to develop. The proper selection, training, and utilization of warrant officers is dependent on
each State’s military occupational specialty requirements. Institutional training must be completed at the appropriate
warrant officer career point, the best-qualified warrant officers must receive progressive operational assignments in
recognition of their demonstrated skills, and all warrant officers must be aware of their responsibility to achieve the
highest possible goals of self-development.
   (a) All warrant officers are assigned according to individual qualifications that are properly documented.
   (b) The professional capabilities of all warrant officers are developed through planned and progressively responsible
assignments. This ensures a sufficient number of qualified warrant officers at all times to accomplish assigned
missions.
   (c) All warrant officers have equal opportunity for promotion selection and for higher assignments on the basis of
their demonstrated abilities.
   (d) All warrant officers are aware of the guidelines and expectations in their career planning.
   (2) USAR. Decisions on assignments will be made on the basis of the "whole person" concept and unit require-
ments. Military training priorities must be integrated with the officer’s civilian job and personal/community
responsibilities.
   (a) The PMO will ensure that the background information on each warrant officer is complete. Each record will be
reviewed to determine the extent and quality of activity during service. Those IRR officers without recent active
participation may be programmed for counterpart training, if available, with an active component unit prior to
consideration for assignment to a troop unit.
   (b) Warrant officers serving in the IRR will be considered for reassignment to a TPU or an IMA assignment based
on the following factors. The PMO must ensure that officers have the prerequisite and, when appropriate, civilian
schooling required to prepare them for the reassignment.
   1. Availability and type of TPUs within a reasonable commuting distance (AR 140–1), normally within a 50-mile
radius or a 90-minute travel time. Distance is based on travel by car, one way, under normal traffic, weather, and road
conditions over the most direct route to the warrant officer’s home or current residence.
   2. Prior experience, both active and reserve component, and the level of this experience compared to a typical
warrant officer of the same grade, MOS/functional area, and age.
   3. Career field and level of military schooling or potential to acquire the required skills within 3 years of
assignment.
   4. Amount of time the warrant officer can make available for military activities and officer’s preferences for types
of assignments.
7–10. Warrant officer 1 development
A WO1 is an officer appointed by warrant with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position given
by the Secretary of the Army. WO1s are basic level, technically and tactically focused officers who perform the
primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, and advisor. They also perform any
other branch-related duties assigned to them. They also provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervi-
sion necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. WO1s have specific responsibility for accomplishing the
missions and tasks assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility for
how well their command performs its mission. The WO1’s primarily support levels of operations from team through
battalion, requiring interaction with all Soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide leader development, mentor-
ship, and counsel to enlisted Soldiers and NCOs. The appropriate Warrant Officer Basic Course must be completed
within 2 years of appointment to be a mobilization asset and remain in the ARNG and Army Reserve.
7–11. Chief warrant officer 2 development
A CW2 is a commissioned officer with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the
Secretary of the Army. CW2s are intermediate level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of
technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, and advisor. They also perform any other branch-
related duties assigned to them. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for
subordinates to perform their duties. They have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions and tasks
assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility for how well their
command performs its mission. CW2s primarily support levels of operations from team through battalion, requiring
interaction with all Soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and
counsel to NCOs, other warrant officers and company-grade branch officers.

7–12. Chief warrant officer 3 development
A CW3 is a commissioned officer with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the
Secretary of the Army. CW3s are advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of
technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other
branch-related duties assigned to them. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision
necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. CW3s have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions
and tasks assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility for how well
their command performs its mission. CW3s primarily support levels of operations from team through brigade, requiring
interaction with all Soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and
counsel to NCOs, other warrant officers and branch officers. CW3s advise commanders on warrant officer issues.
7–13. Chief warrant officer 4 development
A CW4 is a commissioned officer with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the
Secretary of the Army. CW4s are senior level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of
technical leader, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator and advisor. They also perform any other branch-related
duties assigned to them. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for
subordinates to perform their duties. CW4s have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions and tasks
assigned to them and, if assigned as a commander, the collective or organizational responsibility for how well their
command performs its mission. They primarily support battalion, brigade, division, corps, and echelons above corps
operations. They must interact with NCOs, other officers, primary staff, and special staff. CW4s primarily provide
leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs, other warrant officers and branch officers. They have
special mentorship responsibilities for other warrant officers and provide essential advice to commanders on warrant
officer issues.
7–14. Chief warrant officer 5 development
A CW5 is a commissioned officer with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the
Secretary of the Army. CW5s are master level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of
technical leader, manager, integrator, advisor, or any other particular duty prescribed by branch. They provide
direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. CW5s
have specific responsibility for accomplishing the missions and tasks assigned to them. CW5s primarily support
brigade, division, corps, echelons above corps, and major command operations. They must interact with NCOs, other
officers, primary staff and special staff. They provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to warrant
officers and branch officers. CW5s have special warrant officer leadership and representation responsibilities within
their respective commands. They provide essential advice to commanders on warrant officer issues.
7–15. Management considerations
   a. Army National Guard.
   (1) General. To properly plan for the development and assignment of officers into positions of increasing responsi-
bility, an overview of the state force structure and an inventory of officer positions is necessary. States develop a State
Master Development Plan (SMDP) as a tool for this purpose. The SMDP allows for analysis of all branches authorized
by state force structure documents to determine career progression patterns for officers within the state. The SMDP is
used to determine how many officers in each branch, functional area and AOC the adjutant general needs to develop.
   (2) Career planning. Orderly career planning provides for progressive duty assignments and military schooling to
meet current needs and develop officer skills for future assignments. The success of the officer career planning and
management program is dependent upon policies and plans that ensure:
   (a) All officers are assigned according to individual qualifications that are properly documented.
   (b) The professional capabilities of all officers are developed through planned and progressively responsible assign-
ments. This ensures a sufficient number of qualified officers are available at all times to accomplish assigned missions.
   (c) All officers have equal opportunity for promotion selection and for higher assignments based on their demon-
strated abilities.
   (d) All officers are aware of the guidelines and expectations concerning career planning.
   b. USAR.
   (1) Previous Active Duty assignments. When evaluating an officer’s Active Duty assignments, consideration should
be given to the duty positions held by the officer, as well as his or her experience level. Active duty experience should
be capitalized upon by assigning these officers to positions in which they can share their experiences and expertise.
   (2) Experience. The officer’s record should be reviewed for previous assignments, the level of assignment, com-
mand and staff experience, Active Duty for training (ADT) assignments, and other RC oriented training.
   (3) Military education. The officer’s record should be reviewed for military schools that have been completed.
Enrollment into resident and nonresident schools should be accomplished in a timely manner to ensure successful
completion of military education requirements. Education that incurs a service obligation must be fulfilled in either the
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             47

unit that sent the officer or in a like-type unit. Although career management officers (CMOs) are not responsible for
ensuring that managed officers complete the requirements, they play an important role in monitoring the officer’s
progress until the course is successfully completed.
   (4) Civilian background. CMOs should evaluate the officer’s civilian education and occupational background for
potential skills, knowledge and attributes that have military applications. Consideration may be given for designation of
a skill identifier for a civilian-acquired skill.
   (5) Level of participation. The most critical factor in an officer’s development is his or her willingness to participate
in leader development over an extended period of time. The successful Army Reserve officer keeps his or her CMO
informed of the type of duty, training and education that best conforms to the officer’s attributes, interests and
professional development needs. Although statutory and regulatory requirements for participation in education and
training exist, the Army Reserve remains a volunteer organization. Ideally, every officer participates in educational
opportunities to the maximum extent possible within the funding constraints that exist within the Army Reserve
environment. It is also realized that Army Reserve officers are constrained by civilian employment, Family considera-
tions and community responsibilities. However, Army Reserve officers must make every attempt to participate
consistently in training and education opportunities. Failure to do so may result in the officer’s administrative
elimination from the service through either voluntary or involuntary means (board action).
   (6) Branch officers serving in command positions. Army Reserve officers must meet branch criteria for the type of
unit they will command. This requirement is fundamental to our America’s Army concept; therefore, requesting a
waiver from this requirement is strongly discouraged. Officers can request a waiver through their chain of command
and CMO to the Chief, Army Reserve. In the absence of compelling reasons, approval of the request is not likely.
   (7) Reassignment–IRR. Officers serving in the IRR are considered for placement in a TPU position or an IMA
assignment, based upon current position availability and the officer’s career progression needs. The CMO ensures that
officers have the military and civilian schooling necessary for TPU or IMA assignments, while taking the following
factors into consideration:
   (a) Availability and type of TPUs within a reasonable commuting distance. Officers are assigned according to
established procedures using the request vacancy system. (See AR 140–1 and applicable directives.)
   (b) Availability and type of IMA assignments currently available.
   (c) Prior experience (both Active Army and Reserve Component) and the level of this experience compared to a
typical officer of the same grade, branch, functional area and time in service/time in grade.
   (d) Career field and level of military and civilian schooling or potential to acquire the necessary skills within 3 years
of assignment.
   (e) Officer’s AT control group affiliation. (Obligated members of the annual training control group or Officer Active
Duty Obligor (OADO) control group may be involuntarily assigned to a TPU or IMA position vacancy.)
   (8) Reassignment–TPU officers. A thorough review of an officer’s file will be completed upon transfer to the IRR,
and the officer should be prepared to discuss future career development needs and type of assignments desired. An
officer in the IRR should continue to seek training opportunities to remain current in branch and/or functional area
skills.
7–16. Individual Mobilization Augmentee/Drilling Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA/DIMA)
assignments (Army Reserve)
   a. General. Army Reserve officers fill a number of key positions throughout the Department of Defense and other
governmental agencies. These positions are used to rapidly expand the agencies during the early phases of mobiliza-
tion. Pre-selected, specially qualified officers are assigned to these positions and are trained during peacetime to
augment the commands and agencies to enhance mission accomplishment upon mobilization. These officers are called
IMAs/DIMAs and are assigned to Army Reserve Control Group–IMA in a Selected Reserve status. IMAs are given
pre-mobilization orientation and qualification training for the positions to which they are attached. This is accom-
plished during 12-day annual training tours. Officers assigned as DIMA receive an additional 12 days of training per
year in an inactive duty training (IDT) status, which are performed with their unit or organization of attachment. These
tours are coordinated between the unit or organization, the CMO and the officer. (For further guidance on the IMA
program, see AR 140–145.)
   b. Training. IMA officers training requirements are coordinated through the gaining agency. All requests for training
in lieu of, or in addition to, annual training tours are submitted on DA Form 1058–R (Application for Active Duty for
Training, Active Duty for Special Work, Temporary Tour of Active Duty, and Annual Training for Soldiers of the
Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve) through the proponent agency to Commander, AHRC–St. Louis,
ATTN: ARPC–PL, 1 Reserve Way, St. Louis MO 63132. The AHRC–St. Louis publishes orders if the unit or
organization concurs and funds are available. Units or organizations should provide IMA/DIMA officers the opportu-
nity to participate by completing projects for retirement credit throughout the year.
   c. Federal employees. Federal employees are declared available for mobilization by their employing command or
agency. As IMA officers, DA civilian employees may not hold IMA positions with the same HQDA general or special
48                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

staff element in which they are employed. Army Reserve members should report employment conflicts to their
proponent agencies and AR–PERSCOM CMOs when they occur.
7–17. Company and field grade officer education
   a. Resident courses. The RC officers are authorized to attend resident Army service schools to become qualified in
their present or projected assignments as funds and allocations allow. Attendance at resident service schools is the
preferred option for all RC officers since it allows for peer-to-peer interaction and an ongoing exchange of ideas and
experiences. It also allows RC officers to interact with their AA counterparts and provide them with information about
the RC. It is understood, however, that not all RC officers will be able to attend all service schools in residence due to
budgetary, time or training seat constraints. For this reason, type of school attendance (resident or nonresident) is not a
discriminator for promotion or duty assignment in the RC. Officers may also attend courses that contribute to the
military proficiency of the unit or enhance their specific abilities. DA Pam 351–4, as supplemented by pamphlets and
directives from the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command and the NGB, provides information concerning
courses of instruction offered at Army schools and various agencies in DOD.
   b. Nonresident courses. With the exception of the Basic Officer Leader Course, military schools may be taken
through nonresident courses, Total Army School System (TASS) and through Distributed Learning courses. The CCC
and ILE are available in both TASS and nonresident versions. The CMOs at AHRC–St. Louis (for Army Reserve) and
the State OPM (for ARNG) should ensure that officers are enrolled in military education courses in a timely manner to
ensure that all RC officers remain fully competitive for promotion and assignment considerations. Table 7–2 discusses
the options available for RC officers to complete their military education and the amount of time that each officer has
to complete the nonresident instruction after enrollment before being dropped from the school.
   c. Branch and functional area educational requirements. All RC officers are designated a branch upon appointment.
Branching decisions are made based upon the needs of the Army, although officer preference is considered. Branching
is usually determined prior to commissioning, although RC officers can be re-branched at any time based upon the
needs of the service until they attend BOLC; at which point their branch is fixed. Once an officer has attended BOLC,
he or she cannot be re-branched until they have either attended another BOLC or completed other branch development
courses, such as CCC.
   (1) Basic Officer Leader Course. All officers attend BOLC in their branch to meet branch development and
mobilization requirements; no alternative training method is available. Although attendance at BOLC immediately after
commissioning is preferable, RC officers must complete BOLC within 2 years of commissioning.
   (2) Captain Career Course. The RC officers may enroll in the RC CCC upon completion of BOLC III and
promotion to first lieutenant. Those who desire to enroll prior to this time require a waiver by the unit commander, or
by the Commander, AHRC–St. Louis for members of the IRR. The RC officers must enroll in the CCC prior to
completing 8 years of commissioned service. RC officers must satisfy the following prerequisites for enrollment into
the CCC:
   (a) Be a commissioned officer in the grade of first lieutenant or captain.
   (b) Meet the standards of AR 140–1, AR 600–9, and AR 350–1.
   (3) Functional area training. RC officers may apply for functional area (FA) designation once promoted to captain.
Although a functional area is not a branch, it is an area of specialization requiring additional training or experience.
Many courses provided through the DOD and in the civilian community support functional area training and qualifica-
tion, as does civilian work experience. For example, some officers are qualified as Operations Research/Systems
Analysts (ORSA) in their civilian profession; yet do not possess the ORSA (FA 49) functional area. Since this FA is
chronically short throughout the Army, these officers will be strongly encouraged to apply for it based on their civilian
experience. FA selection is therefore based on such factors as the officer’s experience and abilities, geographical
requirements and the needs of the Army. FAs allow RC officers to broaden the scope of their experience and enhance
both their assignment and promotion potential.
   d. Intermediate Level Education (ILE). This mid-level school prepares majors for assignments at the division and
corps level, as well as joint assignments. The school is branch non-specific and provides training in the military arts
and sciences, as well as introductory courses in geopolitical issues and on how the Army runs. RC officers also receive
credit for ILE by attending the resident Marine Corps, Navy or Air Force CGSC and the Western Hemisphere Institute
for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC).
   e. Associate Theater Logistics Studies Program. The ATLog replaces Associate Logistics Executive Development
Course (ALEDC) and is offered to officers in following qualifying branches Ordnance, Transportation, Quartermaster
and some Medical Service. If you have attended the Combined Logistics Officer Advanced Course or the Combined
Logistics Captain Career Course (CLC3) at Fort Lee, you meet the prerequisites for ATLog. The course targets
logisticians at the Operational level who will be positioned in the Army as multifunctional, joint, and multinational
logistics problem solvers. ATLog consists of five phases. Phase I and Phase V are mandatory resident phases. Phases
II, III, and IV are nonresident phases. All nonresident phases are offered via blackboard. All phases are required to be
taken in sequence (1, 2, 3 and so forth). This ensures that all students have the same educational background. ATLog
requires that you take the 2 week resident Joint Course on Logistics as a pre-requisite prior to enrollment into Phase
IV. Students have three years to complete the entire ATLog course. ATLog also provides Defense Acquisition
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                              49

University course equivalency for five DAU courses: ACQ 101, ACQ 201, CON 100, LOG 101 and LOG 201. The
AHRC has approved award of a skill identifier (SI) to ATLog graduates. This SI is for logistics officers focused upon
becoming the Army’s logistics planners and problem solvers in theater and expeditionary sustainment commands, as
well as joint and multinational staffs. The phases of ATLog are:
   (1) Phase 1 - Theater Logistics (resident)
   (2) Phase 2 - Data Analysis & Application (nonresident)
   (3) Phase 3 - Capabilities & Requirements/Contracting (nonresident)
   (4) Phase 4 - Material & Distribution Management/Battle Logistics Analysis Paper (nonresident)
   (5) Phase 5 - Theater Logistics (Capstone)/Regional Economic Implications (resident).
   f. Senior Service School (SSC) requirements. The SSCs provide field grade officers with advanced professional
education in both military and sociopolitical topics. The SSCs, which include the Army War College and university
fellowships, prepare officers for senior leadership positions throughout the DOD.
   g. Field-grade refresher courses. Branch refresher courses are conducted by branch proponent schools to provide
current doctrine in branch matters and special subjects for field grade officers. While no credit for promotion is given
for attendance at these courses, the opportunity to update professional knowledge is of great value to RC officers.
   h. Language training. Where a TOE or TDA position requires language proficiency, officers may apply for language
acquisition or sustainment training at either the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, CA, or the ARNG Language
Center. These resident courses are very lengthy, lasting from 25 to 60 weeks.
   i. Civilian education. The standard for civilian education for officers in the U.S. Army is a baccalaureate degree.
Most officers commissioned into the RC already have a baccalaureate degree; however, some officers commissioned
through the state Officer Candidate School (OCS) do not. Table 7–3 lists the educational requirements applicable to the
appointment and commissioning of officers without baccalaureate degrees. Effective 1 October 1995, in accordance
with the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1995, a baccalaureate degree from an accredited educa-
tional institution is required for promotion to any grade above first lieutenant. Army Nurse Corps officers appointed on
or after 1 October 1986 must possess a baccalaureate degree in nursing (accredited by an agency acceptable to HQDA)
prior to promotion to major.
   j. Other military education.
   (1) Total Army School System. The TASS offers ILE to RC officers. Since 1 October 1993, CCCs have been
offered through the branch proponent schools in RC configured courses. The TASS option offers an excellent
opportunity for completing educational requirements because of the presence of qualified instructors and the interaction
with fellow officers.
   (2) The Army Institute for Professional Development (AIPD). The Army Institute for Professional Development at
Fort Eustis, VA, administers the Army Correspondence Course Program (ACCP). The ACCP provides progressive
educational opportunities through correspondence for a wide variety of subjects. This type of military education is
particularly well suited for RC officers who cannot take advantage of resident courses. Many courses are targeted at
specific assignments, such as motor officer, personnel officer or dining facility officer. The DA Pam 351–20 contains
enrollment information, addresses and telephone numbers for course coordination.
7–18. Warrant Officer Education System
   a. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to outline the methods available to warrant officers in completing military
education requirements and civilian education goals as they progress through their military careers.
   b. Military education.
   (1) The Department of the Army military occupational specialty (MOS) proponents conduct courses in both AA and
RC configured versions combining correspondence and ADT phases for most occupational specialties.
   (2) Warrant officer training under WOES has five levels that provide warrant officers with performance-based
certification and qualification training. WOES trains and develops warrant officers for progressively more difficult and
complex assignments. The new course titles align more closely with comparable commissioned officer courses for
consistency and ease of understanding by the Army at large. All warrant officers, supervisors, and commanders must
familiarize themselves with the new WOES and understand the affect on warrant officer leader and professional
development. The five levels of WOES are:
   (a) Warrant Officer Candidate School (WOCS). This course provides candidates with initial warrant officer training.
Graduates are appointed to warrant officer, W1. Completion of WOBC within 2 years (a 1-year extension may be
granted on a case by case basis) of warrant officer appointment is required.
   (b) Warrant Officer Basic Course. This is proponent training that provides MOS-specific instruction and certification
following WOCS and is characterized by an increased emphasis on leadership. This course is an ARNG requirement
for promotion to CW2, and an Army Reserve requirement for promotion to CW2 for a warrant officer with a DOR of 1
Jan 05 or later. (Warrant officers with DOR prior to 1 Jan 05 are grandfathered for promotion to CW3.)
   (c) Warrant Officer Advanced Course. This training provides additional training for warrant officers serving at the
company and battalion level and is a two phase course consisting of:
   1. WOAC Prerequisite Studies Phase. This is a mandatory nonresident course that must be completed prior to
50                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

attending resident WOAC training. Effective 1 October 1998, the Action Officer Development Course (AODC)
(ST7000) was adopted as the resource for this distance learning course. It can be completed online via the Internet, and
provides warrant officers serving in CW2 or higher duty positions relevant training in topics such as management
techniques, communication skills, preparing and staffing documents, meetings and interviews, problem solving, writing,
coordinating, briefings, and ethics. In keeping with the Warrant Officer Education System model, enrollment must
occur after promotion to CW2 in order to qualify for WOAC Prerequisite Studies credit. The course must be completed
within 1 year of enrollment; however, CW2s now have the flexibility to enroll at any convenient time between 24 and
48 months of total warrant officer service. Completion of the AODC is mandatory requirement for promotion of all
ARNG warrant officers to CW3 including those awarded an MOS that does not have an advanced course. To enroll
online, go to http://www.adtdl.army.mil/cgi-bin/atdl.dll/accp/st7000/top.htm and follow the enrollment instructions.
   2. The resident phase of the Warrant Officer Advanced Course. This course is administered and conducted by
individual proponents and is an ARNG requirement for promotion to the grade of CW3. For Army Reserve warrant
officers, successful completion is a requirement for promotion to CW4 and CW5 until 2010 when it will be a
requirement for promotion to CW3 for a warrant officer with a DOR of 1 Jan 05 or later. (Warrant officers with DOR
prior to 1 Jan 05 are grandfathered for promotion to CW4.)
   (d) Warrant Officer Staff Course. This common core 4-week resident course prepares warrant officers to serve in
staff positions at the brigade and higher levels. WOSC is an ARNG requirement for promotion to CW4. (At this time,
WOSC is not a prerequisite for the WOSSC). For Army Reserve warrant officers, successful completion will be a
requirement for promotion to CW4 and CW5 beginning in 2010.
   (e) Warrant Officer Senior Staff Course. This 2-week resident course is conducted at the WOCC, Fort Rucker, AL
and prepares warrant officers selected for promotion to chief warrant officer, W5, to serve at the highest-level staff
positions. (This course is an RC requirement for promotion to CW5).
   (3) Correspondence courses. The Army Institute for Professional Development (AIPD) at Fort Eustis, VA is
responsible for the administration of the Army Correspondence Course Program (ACCP). The ACCP provides
progressive education opportunities through correspondence for a wide variety of subjects. This type of military
education is particularly suited for RC personnel who cannot take advantage of resident courses. Many courses are
targeted at specific assignments. The DA Pam 351–20 contains enrollment information and addresses/telephone
numbers for course coordination.
   (4) Language training. Where the MTOE or TDA position requires language proficiency, warrant officers may apply
for language training at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, CA or the ARNG Language Center in Puerto
Rico.
   c. Civilian education. There is a demand for warrant officers with an education beyond high school level to
accommodate the changing technological environment within the Army. The RC warrant officer corps must keep pace
with these changes if it is to meet the challenges of the future. Applicants for initial appointment must meet all MOS-
specific additional civilian education requirements as specified for the particular warrant officer specialty. Applicants
whose native language is not English must be tested and achieve a minimum raw score of 80 on the English
Comprehension Level Test. Civilian education goals are as follows:
   (1) The ARNG goal for warrant officers is the attainment of a specialty related associate degree or 60 college
semester hours by the eighth year of warrant officer service.
   (2) The Army Reserve goal for warrant officers is the attainment of a specialty related associate degree or 60
college semester hours by the fifth year of warrant officer service.

7–19. Promotion
See AR 135–155, and NGR 600–101 for all promotion details. Law for promotion automatically considers commis-
sioned officers of the Reserve Components who are on the Reserve Active Status List (RASL) when they have served
the required years in grade. The AR 135–155 requires that each USAR warrant officer who is in an active status be
considered for promotion at such time as he or she has served the required number of years in grade. Promotion
consideration occurs whether officers are assigned to an ARNG unit, TPU or a control group, except for the Standby
Reserve (Inactive) and the Inactive Army National Guard. The RC officers assigned to an ARNG unit or USAR TPU
have an additional opportunity for promotion to fill unit position vacancies at such time as they have completed the
education and time-in-grade requirements. Warrant officers in the Standby Reserve (Inactive) and ING are not
considered for promotion. Army Reserve warrant officers assigned to TPUs have the additional opportunity to be
considered for promotion to fill unit vacancies at such time as they have completed the required years in grade, without
regard to total years of service. The ARNG warrant officers are promoted by the State Adjutant General to fill
vacancies in ARNG units. Time in grade requirements for vacancy promotions are contained in AR 135–155, table
2–1. Army Reserve warrant officer promotion time lines are shown in AR 135–155, table 2–1.1. ARNG promotion
time lines are outlined in NGR 600–101, chapter 7.
7–20. Selection eligibility for company and field grade officers
   a. General. To be eligible for selection for promotion, an RC officer, other than a warrant officer, not on extended
Active Duty must—
   (1) Be on the RASL.
   (2) Be an active member and participating satisfactorily in RC training.
   (3) Meet the prescribed military educational requirements shown in table 7–1.
   (4) Meet the prescribed civilian educational requirements of U.S. Code, Title 10, Section 12205. The Code states
that no person may be appointed to a grade above the grade of lieutenant in the Army Reserve or be Federally
recognized in a grade above the grade of first lieutenant as a member of the Army National Guard unless that person
has been awarded a baccalaureate degree by a qualifying institution. This does not apply to the following:
   (a) The appointment to or recognition in a higher grade of a person who is appointed in or assigned for service in a
health profession for which a baccalaureate degree is not a condition of original appointment or assignment.
   (b) The appointment to or recognition in a higher grade of any person who was appointed to, or Federally
recognized in, the grade of captain before 1 October 1995.
   (c) Recognition in the grade of captain or major in the Alaska Army National Guard of a person who resides
permanently at a location in Alaska that is more than 50 miles from each of the cities of Anchorage, Fairbanks, and
Juneau by paved road, and who is serving in a scout unit or a scout supporting unit.
   (5) Meet the prescribed civilian educational requirements of AR 135–155.
   (a) Army Nurse Corps officers appointed on or after 1 October 1986 must possess a baccalaureate degree in nursing
from an accredited educational institution prior to promotion to major.
   (b) Officers other than Army nurses appointed on or after 1 October 1987 must possess a baccalaureate from an
accredited educational institution prior to promotion to major.
   (6) Have served the required time in grade shown in table 2–1, AR 135–155.
   b. Reserve appointments. Upon release from Active Duty, officers with Reserve appointments are transferred in the
grade satisfactorily held while on the ADL and, if accepted, may transfer to an ARNG unit or Army Reserve TPU;
otherwise, they are transferred to the IRR. The officer also retains his or her time in grade. Officers on the ADL
selected for promotion, removed from the ADL before being promoted, and transferred to the RASL in the same
competitive category, shall be placed on an appropriate promotion list for Reserve of the Army promotion without the
need for further consideration. Regular Army officers who leave active service must apply and be accepted for a first-
time Reserve appointment to enter Reserve duty.
7–21. Promotion selection board
   a. The minimum military education requirements shown in table 7–1, paragraph 7–4, are a prerequisite for promo-
tion. Since annual selection boards consider officers for promotion far enough in advance of the date on which the
required time in grade will be completed as prescribed in table 2–1 or 2–1.1, AR 135–155, educational requirements,
52                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

both military and civilian, must be completed no later than the day prior to the date the board considering the officer
convenes. The promotion board schedule is established annually by HQDA and is adjusted as required.
   b. After the board reports its findings and the recommendations receive final approval, each officer will be sent a
letter notifying him or her of either selection or non-selection. This promotion action cannot be accomplished unless
the officer has been found physically qualified for retention and possesses a valid, current security clearance.
   c. Selection boards consider the promotion of officers for all grades 1st lieutenant to colonel. Officers considered
qualified and selected for promotion to first lieutenant will be promoted when they have completed 2 years service in
grade. Second lieutenants are not promoted unless they have completed an Army Basic Officer Leader Course. Second
lieutenants who are not obligated and not promoted upon completion of 42 months commissioned service are separated.
   d. Warrant officers of the ARNG are appointed and promoted by the States under section 8 of the U.S. Constitution.
In order for an ARNG warrant officer to be concurrently promoted and receive Reserve Warrant Officer of the Army
designation, the State promotion action must be federally recognized. To accomplish this process, the promotion action
requires the conduct and examination by a Federal Recognition Board. The Senior Regular Army Advisor (SRAA) of
the State for the numbered Army Area (CONUSA) commanders appoints Federal Recognition Boards. Appointments to
the Federal Recognition Board are made by authority of the Secretary of the Army. The Secretary of the Army
provides administrative instructions and guidance to be used by the Federal Recognition Board in a memorandum of
instruction to the board. Federal Recognition Boards consist of a total of three commissioned officers of the Active
Army and the ARNG who are senior to the officer being considered. The senior member of the board will serve as
president of the board. A minimum of one member (preferably two) should be in the same branch as the officer to be
considered. The board will consist of at least one minority member as a voting member, if possible, when minorities
are being considered. Normally, at least one female officer will be appointed as a voting member whenever there are
females being considered. When feasible, a commissioned aviator will be included as a member of the board when
considering promotion of aviation warrant officers. Applicants for ARNG promotion are examined in accordance with
NGR 600–101.
   e. The Army Reserve CW3 and CW4 selection board selects officers for promotion without regard to vacancies in
the next higher grade using a "fully qualified" methodology. The Army Reserve CW5 selection board selects officers
for promotion utilizing a "best qualified" methodology and considers both MOS and promotion ceilings when
determining who will be promoted to fill the projected vacancies in authorized CW5 positions. Army Reserve selection
boards will be composed of at least seven members: a brigadier general as board president, two colonels and four
CW5s. At least one-half of all selection board members will be Reserve Component officers not on Active Duty. Each
selection board will consist of at least one minority member as a voting member. Normally, at least one female officer
will be appointed as a voting member whenever there are females being considered. Army Reserve unit vacancy
boards, when needed, convene on a date announced by HQDA. Selection boards convene each year as announced by
HQDA.
Chapter 8
Introduction to the Officer Functional Alignment
8–1. Introduction
   a. Overview. The functionally aligned design aligns branches, special branches and functional areas, consistent with
joint doctrine, focusing on development of versatile leaders with broader, functionally relevant and adaptable com-
petencies. Warrant officers are grouped by related MOS skills also aligned with the functional groupings associated
with company and field grade officers. For further information, refer to chapter 3, paragraphs 3–5 and 3–6. From this
chapter forward, warrant officers will refer to branch chapters to find career development and life-cycle development
models.
   b. Branch and functional area designation. Officers are designated into a branch when commissioned or in a
functional area (FA) by a HQDA-centralized selection board during their time as a captain. Some functional areas will
have officers that are functionally designated between the 4th and 7th year of service.
   (1) A branch is a grouping of officers that comprises an arm or service of the Army in which, as a minimum,
officers are commissioned, assigned, developed and promoted through their company grade years. Officers are accessed
into a single basic branch and will hold that branch designation. An accession branch admits officers upon commission-
ing; a non- accession branch admits experienced officers from the accession branches. With the exception of Special
Forces, Psychological Operations, and Civil Affairs, all other branches are accession branches. The SOF branches
recruit officers with 3 years’ experience for qualification and training. See the Special Forces, Psychological Opera-
tions, or Civil Affairs chapters for further information. Officers will serve their company grade time developing the
leadership and tactical skills associated with their branch. They will continue to wear their branch insignia throughout
their military service
   (2) A functional area is a grouping of officers by technical specialty or skill, which usually requires significant
education, training and experience. An officer receives his or her functional area while serving as a company grade
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            53

officer. Individual preference, academic background, manner of performance, training and experience, and needs of the
Army are all considered during the designation process.
   c. Assignments. Through company grade years, most officers will predominately serve in positions from within their
basic branch. Some officers will serve in functional area or branch/functional area generalist positions (not related to a
specific branch or functional area) as a company grade officer. Depending on FA educational requirements, profes-
sional time lines of the individual officer and individual preference, officers may serve in a functional area assignment
during their company grade years after they have completed branch development requirements. FA 39, FA 51 and FA
90 are the only functional areas that afford command opportunity. (See their respective chapters for further discussion.)
8–2. Officer functional alignment
   a. Overview. Officers will be managed by categories and groups with similar functions to facilitate the development
of officer functional competencies required on the future battlefield. The design is not intended to reflect where officers
serve on the battlefield, but to align the functions and skills required. The three Functional Categories in the Army
Competitive Category (ACC) consisting of basic branch and functional areas include: MFE, Operations Support (OS)
and FS directorates. There are two additional functional categories consisting of special branches: Health Services
directorate (AMEDD with six subcategories), the Chaplain Corps and the JAG Corps.
   b. Maneuver, fires, and effects. This functional category gathers maneuver branches and functional areas that have
similar battlefield application or complementary roles. This grouping is comprised of the following functional groups,
with the branches and functional areas listed:
   (1) Maneuver: Armor (19), Infantry (11), and Aviation (15).
   (2) Fires: Field Artillery (13) and Air Defense Artillery (14).
   (3) Maneuver Support: Engineer (21), Chemical (74) and Military Police (31).
   (4) Special Operations Forces (SOF): Special Forces (18), Psychological Operations (37) and Civil Affairs (38).
   (5) Effects: Public Affairs (46) and Information Operations (30).
   c. Operations Support (OS). This functional category gathers two currently existing branches, Military Intelligence
and Signal, with functional areas that have similar battlefield applications or complementary roles. Also included in this
functional category are the functions associated with Force Training, Development and Education that design, build,
and train the force. The category is comprised of the following:
   (1) Network & Space Operations: Signal Corps (25), plus Information Systems Management (53), Telecommunica-
tion Systems Engineer (24), and Space Operations (40).
   (2) Intelligence, Surveillance, & Reconnaissance (ISR) & Area Expertise: Military Intelligence (35), Strategic
Intelligence (34), and Foreign Area Officer (FAO) (48).
   (3) Plans Development: Strategic Plans and Policy (59) and Nuclear and Counterproliferation (52).
   (4) Forces Development: Force Management (50), Operations Research/Systems Analysis (ORSA) (49) and Simula-
tion Operations (57).
   (5) Education and Training: Permanent Academy Professor (47)
   d. Force Sustainment. This functional category, also known as the Logistics Corps comprises all branches and
functional areas associated with logistics, resource and Soldier support functions:
   (1) Integrated Logistics Corps: Transportation Corps (88), Ordnance (91), and Quartermaster (92), plus Multifunc-
tional Logisticians (90).
   (2) Soldier Support: Adjutant General Corps (42) and Human Resources (43), and Finance Corps (36) which
combines Finance (44) and Comptroller 45) branches.
   (3) Acquisition Corps (51): as currently organized.
   e. Health Services (HS). The U.S. Army Medical Department Corps sustains a healthy and medically protected force
with six specialty corps: medical, dental, veterinary, nurse, medical specialist, and medical services.
   f. Special branches. Per AR 600–3, there are two special branches that will exercise personnel management
authority due to the unique accessions and educational and certification/endorsement requirements. The Chaplain Corps
and JAG Corps are designed to advise commanders while caring for unique Soldiers needs, including spiritual and
legal needs, respectively.

Part Two
Maneuver, Fires and Effects
Chapter 9
Infantry Branch
9–1. Unique features of the Infantry Branch
   a. Unique purpose of the Infantry Branch. The Infantry Branch is the combat arms branch with the mission to close
with and destroy the enemy by means of fire and movement to defeat or capture him, or repel his assault by fire, close
combat and counterattack.
   b. The way ahead. The Army Transformation and the contemporary operational environment will significantly affect
how the Infantry Branch trains, assigns and develops officers. While the focus of the Infantry Branch has always been
the development of combined arms warriors, the Army’s ongoing transformation institutionalizes this concept through
the transition to combined arms formations. This will drive an increased focus on maneuver operations for company
grade officers, making a transition to a combined and joint operational focus for field grade officers. The development
of Infantry officers will also focus on the development of agile and adaptive leaders who collectively embody
knowledge of JIIM organizations. The assignment of Infantry officers will continue to be made based on (1) the needs
of the Army, (2) the professional development needs of the officer and (3) the officer’s preference. While the Human
Resources Command will make every effort to synchronize the three priorities, the needs of the Army and the
professional development needs of the officer must continue to take precedence over individual preference.
   c. Unique functions performed by the Infantry Branch. Infantry leaders are expected to synchronize all elements of
combat power on the battlefield to defeat the enemy. Infantry officers are prepared to train, lead and employ all types
of Infantry and other combat arms assets on the battlefield in the full spectrum of military operations. The Infantry
arrives on the battlefield by parachute assault, air assault, mechanized vehicle, wheeled vehicle or on foot. Insertion
means are dependent upon the Mission, Enemy, Terrain and Weather, Troops and support available, Time available and
Civilian considerations (METT–TC).
   d. Unique features of work in the Infantry Branch. Infantry officers work at all levels of command and staff and can
perform the following functions and tasks:
   (1) Command and control Infantry and combined arms forces in combat.
   (2) Provide coordination for employment of combined arms forces at all levels of Joint, Army and Coalition
Commands.
   (3) Develop doctrine, organizations and equipment for Infantry unique missions and formations.
   (4) Instruct Infantry skills at service schools and Combat Training Centers.
   (5) Serve in positions requiring general combat skills such as staff officers in all levels of headquarters and activities
requiring combat arms expertise.
   (6) Serve as Infantry instructors at pre-commissioning programs, service schools and colleges.
   (7) Serve as Infantry advisors to Foreign Military, Army National Guard, and U.S. Army Reserve organizations.
   e. Branch detail. Infantry Branch participates in the branch detailing of officers into Infantry for development and
growth at the grade of lieutenant. Officers detailed Infantry (branch code 11) will lose their Infantry designation once
they reach their branch detail expiration date and they have been re-assigned into their new branch.
   f. Branch eligibility. Infantry Branch is closed to female officers under the Secretary of Defense direct ground
combat rule. Male officers of other branches who desire a branch transfer to Infantry should submit a request in
accordance with AR 614–100, chapter 4.
9–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. General. Infantry Branch requires officers who are, first and foremost, leaders of Soldiers. They should be
mentally and physically disciplined and well-versed in Infantry and combined arms tactics, techniques and procedures.
Infantry leaders will embody the warrior ethos. They will place the welfare of their Soldiers ahead of their own, and
they will live the Army Values without exception. Their example will inspire others to achieve the same level of
commitment and professionalism. The Infantry must produce agile and adaptive leaders who are flexible, critically
reflective, comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty, and agents of change. Infantry officers must be challenged and
imbued with the confidence to be innovative and adaptive while competently performing in a JIIM environment.
Infantry officers must be:
   (1) Proficient in the art and science of the profession of arms.
   (2) Comfortable employing both lethal and nonlethal means.
   (3) Able to confront the uncertain situations of the contemporary operational environment.
   (4) Adept at using ethical decision-making to solve complex, dynamic problems.
   (5) Team builders, able to confidently lead Soldiers while engendering loyalty and trust. Additionally, there are
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                                55

several branch unique skills that require professional development. Infantry Branch is the proponent for the following
skill identifiers (SIs) (detailed descriptions contained in DA Pam 611–21):
   (a) 3X–Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle.
   (b) 3Z–Mortar Unit Officer.
   (c) 5P–Parachutist.
   (d) 5R–Ranger.
   (e) 5S–Ranger/Parachutist.
   (f) 5Q–Pathfinder.
   b. Competencies and actions common to all. Infantry officers are valued for their skills as leaders, trainers and
planners: skills which are acquired and perfected through realistic training, professional military education and service
in the most demanding positions Infantry Branch offers. The Infantry Branch values both critical warfighting operating
force assignments and equally critical assignments within the generating force. The goal of the branch is to provide
each officer with a series of leadership, staff and developmental assignments; institutional training; and self-develop-
ment opportunities in order to develop combined arms warriors with broad experience who can successfully operate in
infantry specific, branch immaterial and JIIM assignments.
   c. Unique skills. Infantry officers should consistently display outstanding performance across a wide variety of
operating and generating force positions. Infantry officers should demonstrate excellence in their warfighting skills;
technical proficiency; a well-developed understanding of joint and combined arms warfare; and the ability to lead,
train, motivate and care for Soldiers.
9–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
   a. Lieutenant. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop the requisite
Infantry Branch skills, knowledge and attributes. Lieutenants will focus on development of Infantry tactical and
technical warfighting skills and the utilization of these skills in an operating force assignment.
   (1) Education. Following successful completion of BOLC II, Infantry officers will attend the Infantry Basic Officer
Leader Course. The IBOLC course takes the graduate of BOLC II and continues his development with the mission to
“Educate and train Infantry lieutenants who are competent, confident, and professional leaders; able to lead platoons to
fight and win in any operational environment.” The IBOLC endstate: A physically rugged, competent and confident
Infantry platoon leader proficient in Infantry skills who is adaptable, flexible, and prepared train and lead Infantry
platoons on any mission in any terrain. Following IBOLC, Infantry lieutenants have the opportunity to attend Airborne
and Ranger schools. Additionally, any officer assigned to a mechanized or Stryker unit following IBOLC will attend
the Mechanized Leader’s Course (MLC) or Stryker Leader’s Course (SLC). Some officers will be selected to attend the
Infantry Mortar Leader Course. Regardless of unit of assignment and follow-on schools, the objective is for Infantry
lieutenants to serve no longer than nine months at Fort Benning from the 1st day of IBOLC in order to ensure that they
are able to complete the requisite assignments in their first duty station to provide them with the skills, knowledge and
experience necessary to build a successful foundation. All Infantry lieutenants are encouraged to volunteer for Ranger
training due to the intense tactical and leadership training it provides. Achieving the standards for graduation from
Ranger school is an indication that an officer possesses the skills and stamina necessary to effectively lead Soldiers in
the Infantry.
   (2) Assignments. The typical Infantry lieutenant will be assigned to a Brigade Combat Team as his first unit of
assignment. The key assignment during this phase is serving as a platoon leader in an operating force unit. Early
experience as a rifle platoon leader is critical, as it provides Infantry lieutenants with the opportunity to gain tactical
and technical expertise in their branch while developing leadership skills. In addition, a limited number of Infantry
lieutenants will serve as generating force company executive officers or staff officers. Other typical assignments for
lieutenants are battalion specialty platoon leader (recon, mortar, or weapons), company executive officer, or battalion
staff officer. An Infantry officer may also serve in a staff position after promotion to captain, but prior to attendance at
the Maneuver Captain Career Course (MC3).
   (3) Self-development. Self-development during this phase should focus on Infantry tactical fundamentals, troop
leading procedures, leadership skills, organizational maintenance, resupply operations, basic administrative operations
and other branch technical proficiency skills. Infantry lieutenants must take the initiative to gain knowledge and
experience for the next level of assignments and responsibilities as a captain. Self-improvement and development can
be achieved through observing different activities and officers at the battalion and brigade levels, seeking out mentors
and by gaining experience in other duty positions after successful serving as a rifle platoon leader. The CSA’s
Professional Reading List for Company-Grade Officers is an excellent source of information to assist the lieutenants in
the self-development process.
   (4) Desired experience. Each Infantry lieutenant must complete all BOLC phases, successfully serve as a platoon
leader in an operating force assignment, and continue development of his technical and tactical abilities through
assignment to a specialty platoon, executive officer, or in a staff position. The goal is a lieutenant with an understand-
ing of combined arms maneuver tactics at the platoon level. He should have a working knowledge of special operations
56                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

and close air support (CAS). A limited number of Infantry lieutenants will also serve in generating force assignments
as executive officers, instructor/writers, or commanders prior to attending MC3.
   b. Captain. The professional development objective for this phase is to develop Infantry combined arms maneuver
officers who have exhibited leadership skills as a company commander and staff officer in the operating force, and
who have rounded out their knowledge through successfully completing an assignment in the generating force. Infantry
captains who have served in both operating and generating force positions have honed their tactical skills and expanded
their capabilities through their developmental assignments.
   (1) Education. Completion of the Maneuver Captain Career Course (MC3) is mandatory during this period. Special-
ized training will be scheduled for officers after MC3 on an as-needed basis. Ideally most, if not all, officers attending
MC3 will be assigned to a different type of Infantry organization (vehicular or non-vehicular) than they served in at
their first duty station. Exceptions may be made based on operational needs. Officers must obtain a baccalaureate
degree prior to attending the Captain Career Course. Officers who do not possess a baccalaureate degree may complete
one through the degree completion program (DCP) in accordance with AR 621–1, chapter 4. The Infantry captain
should coordinate the DCP with the AHRC Infantry Branch Junior Captain Assignments Officer.
   (2) Assignments. The key assignment for a captain is command of an operating force Infantry company for 18
months, plus or minus 6 months. Second commands should be limited, and total command time should not exceed 26
months (2 x 12 month commands and 2 months for change of command inventories) unless operational needs dictate a
different course of action. Infantry captains should bear in mind that they will most likely be assigned to a type of
Infantry unit they did not serve with as a lieutenant (vehicular or non-vehicular). Officers who command generating
force companies encounter significant responsibilities and are therefore, extremely well prepared for operating force
command. Generating force company commanders having their first commands at the United States Army Infantry
School will be given a follow-on operating force assignment and the opportunity to compete for company command.
The Infantry encourages officers to seek company command opportunities in the 192nd Infantry Brigade (Basic Combat
Training) and the 198th Infantry Brigade (Infantry One Station Unit Training), on Fort Benning, prior to attendance at
MC3. Infantry captains can expect to command within these organizations for 12 to 18 months and then immediately
attend MC3. Officers that command in these generating force assignments will be provided the opportunity to compete
for command in operating force units. Captains should aggressively seek command and developmental assignments in
battalion and brigade level staff positions in order to further their understanding of Infantry leadership and tactics.
Some officers will have the opportunity to compete for selection and assignment to unique units where they may
command again, such as the 75th Ranger Regiment, 3rd Infantry Regiment (Old Guard), Special Missions Units
(SMU), and the Ranger Training Brigade. Upon completion of company command, a wide variety of developmental
assignments are available. The purpose of these assignments is to meet critical Army requirements, further develop the
officer’s knowledge base and provide him broad professional experience. Developmental assignments for Infantry
Captains include—
   (a) Generating Force staff.
   (b) Active Army/Reserve Component (AA/RC) training support brigade trainer and staff.
   (c) The CTC trainer or observer/controller.
   (d) Service school instructor or small group instructor.
   (e) Aide-de-camp.
   (f) Doctrine developer.
   (g) Training developer.
   (h) ACOM and higher-level DA staff.
   (i) USMA faculty and staff.
   (j) U.S. Army Recruiting Company Command and Staff.
   (k) Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) Assistant Professor of Military Science.
   (l) Multinational and Coalition Trainer and Staff Officer.
   (m) Army Sponsored Fellowships and Scholarships.
   (n) Other combat arms or branch generalist positions.
   (o) JIIM organizations and commands.
   (3) Self-development. During this phase, Infantry officers must hone their leadership, tactical and technical skills and
concentrate on those critical tasks required to accomplish their wartime mission while winning on the battlefield. The
officer should also begin to develop a more thorough understanding of combined arms operations in a joint environ-
ment. Captains must take the initiative to gain knowledge and experience for the next level of assignments and
responsibilities as a field grade officer. Self-improvement and development can be achieved through observing staff
activities at the battalion and brigade levels, seeking out mentors and by gaining experience in other duty positions
after successful completion of company command. Officers should continue their professional military reading with
books from the CSA’s Professional Reading List for Field Grade Officers.
   (4) Army Acquisition Corps. Small numbers of Infantry officers from each year group will be accessed into the
Army Acquisition Corps. The primary look is in year 6 of a captain’s career, and then the officer will be re-looked
during years 7–8. The Acquisition Corps conducts a DA level selection board. All applications for transfer must be
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                               57

made directly to the Acquisition Manager, OPMD, AAHRC. Volunteers make up most of the accession numbers, while
a few officers may be re-branched based on their academic degree. Officers accessed into the Army Acquisition Corps
will be transferred to acquisition corps.
   (5) Desired experience. The key assignment for an infantry captain is successful service as a company commander.
There is no substitute for an operating force company command. It develops an Infantry officer’s leadership and
tactical skills and prepares him for future leadership assignments at successively higher levels of responsibility. The
goal is to provide each infantry captain 18 months (± 6 months) operating force company command time. In some
cases a unit may require infantry captains to serve as company commanders of other organizations in order to meet
operational needs. Infantry captains should also expand their tactical and technical capabilities through assignment as a
battalion staff officer prior to re-assignment away from a BCT. Infantry captains will also serve on transition teams, a
CSA priority.
   (6) Functional Designation Board. Infantry officers will undergo an FDB at their seven-year mark. This HQDA
board will decide in which of the three Functional Categories each officer is best suited to serve. Decisions are based
on the needs of the Army, the officer’s preference, rater and senior rater’s recommendations, and the officer’s skills
and training. A limited number of officers may choose to opt-in to a FDB after 4 years of service. This board is not
mandatory and officers must choose to compete (opt-in) and the Functional Categories open each year are based on the
needs of the Army. The three functional categories are: Maneuver, Fires and Effects (MF&E); Operations Support
(OS); and FS. After the FDB board convenes, each officer will be assigned a Branch or functional area within a
functional category. Officers who are selected to serve outside of MF&E will be managed by their respective Branch or
FA Manager. Officers who remain in the MF&E functional category will be managed by Infantry Branch until
selection for colonel, when they will be managed by the Army Senior Leader Development Office. Infantry officers
who remain in the MF&E functional category will receive both Infantry Branch (11A) and branch generalist (O1A -
Branch Immaterial/O1B - AR, IN, AV, MI for BFSB command/O2A - Combat Arms Immaterial/O2B - Armor or
Infantry/O2C - AR, IN, EN, FA BCT Cdr or DCO for H, I, or SBCT) assignments.
   c. Majors. The professional development objective for this phase is to expand the officer’s tactical and technical
experience and continue to broaden him as a combined arms warrior and leader with a comprehensive understanding of
operations in a joint and expeditionary environment. Additionally, through a series of operating and generating force
developmental assignments, the Infantry major continues to increase his understanding of how the Army operates. The
key is to provide the Infantry major with the tools that prepare him for future battalion command and for increasingly
complex developmental assignments.
   (1) Education. Military education required during this phase is completion of Intermediate Level Education (ILE) at
the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College (CGSC). ILE is divided into two phases. Phase 1 is a 14-week
common core training block of instruction. Phase 2 is the AOWC, which is the field grade credentialing course
required for all Infantry officers. Officers may also compete to be selected for the School of Advanced Military Studies
(SAMS), following AOWC. Upon graduation from SAMS, the officer is required to serve up to two SAMS Utilization
Tours (minimum of one) as a corps or division plans or operations/assistant DCS, G–3/5/7 staff officer.
   (2) Assignments. Key assignments for an Infantry major are—
   (a) Battalion/Squadron Operations Officer.
   (b) Battalion/Squadron Executive Officer.
   (c) Brigade/Regiment Operations Officer.
   (d) Brigade/Regiment Executive Officer.
   (e) Battalion/Brigade Transition Team.
   (f) Operations Officer and Executive Officer equivalent positions within a Special Missions Unit (SMU).
   (g) Division Chief of Plans (SAMS Utilization).
   (h) Division Chief of Operations (SAMS Utilization).
   (i) Senior Ranger Regimental Liaison Officer.
   (j) SMU Operations Officer.
   (k) SMU Executive Officer.
   (l) Troop Commanders within a special mission unit (SMU).
   (3) Each officer should have sufficient experience in key assignments in order to develop an understanding of
Infantry and combined arms operations. There is no substitute for these key assignments at the brigade level and below
for preparing an Infantry officer for future command and for building his Infantry maneuver and combined arms skills.
The Infantry major may further expand his tactical and technical skills by serving in staff assignments at Division level
and higher. The Division Chief of Plans/Chief of Operations positions are only considered key assignments for the
SAMS graduate Infantry officers. SAMS officers must then serve a minimum of 12 months in a battalion or brigade
S3/XO position.
   (4) Infantry majors will also meet the Army’s mission requirements and broaden their experience before or after
their key assignments with developmental assignments. Developmental positions for Infantry majors include—
   (a) AA/RC S3/XO.
58                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   (b) Doctrine Developer.
   (c) Training Developer.
   (d) DA staff officer.
   (e) Joint Staff officer.
   (f) Aide de Camp.
   (g) Brigade, Division or Corps staff.
   (h) CTC trainer or staff officer.
   (i) Army Command (ACOM) staff (CONUS and OCONUS).
   (j) CGSC staff and faculty.
   (k) Service school instructor.
   (l) United States Military Academy (USMA) faculty and staff.
   (m) ROTC assistant professor of military science (APMS).
   (n) Multi-National and Coalition trainer and staff officer.
   (o) Army-sponsored fellowships and scholarships.
   (p) JIIM organizations and commands.
   (4) Self-development. Infantry majors are expected to continue self-development efforts to build organizational
leadership, strategic perspective and hone operational skills. Infantry majors will be required to develop and use a
diverse set of skills as they move between combined arms leadership positions in operating and generating force
organizations as well as in JIIM assignments.
   (5) Desired experience.The Infantry major must hone his skills in the planning and execution of combined arms
warfare to develop expertise in the JIIM operational environment. While 12 months is the minimum standard, an
Infantry major will normally serve 24 months in a key assignment. Infantry majors picked to serve as Brigade S3s may
extend that total key assignment time to 36 months. In order to be competitive for selection as a battalion commander,
Infantry officers should serve at least one assignment as battalion or brigade operations officer or executive officer. In
order to produce agile and adaptive leaders, Infantry majors who have not yet met the requirements of the vehicular to
non-vehicular imperative may be assigned to units for which they have not had previous experience following ILE.
Moving between operating and generating force assignments will further broaden an Infantry officer’s experience.
   (6) Additional factors.
   (a) The goal of the branch is to develop an inventory of field grade officers who embody a collective knowledge of
JIIM experience. While not every officer will receive an assignment in a qualifying joint assignment or serve a
fellowship in a JIIM agency, the goal is to provide the maximum opportunity for Infantry majors to receive JIIM
experience. The JIIM assignments for Infantry majors are dependent on Army demands and position/fellowship
availability.
   (b) A limited number of Infantry field grade officers may be assigned to positions currently coded as functional area
positions. A number of functional area field grade positions will be coded as open to assignment by nonfunctional area
officers. The goal is to expand position access, especially for JIIM positions. Infantry majors may be assigned to
Infantry (11A), branch generalist (01A, 02A, 02B) or functional area positions coded for access by branch officers.
   (c) The CSA has designated transition teams as vital to the success of the Army during the GWOT. In support of the
CSA directive, Infantry majors will serve on transition teams. This experience, when combined with time spent as an
S3/XO, provides the Infantry major the skills to prepare him for future operating and generating force assignments with
increasing responsibility and for battalion command.
   d. Lieutenant colonel. The professional development objective for this phase is demonstrated excellence in tactical
skills, technical proficiency and the ability to lead, train, motivate and care for Soldiers in both the staff and command
environments. As the Infantry officer increases in rank, opportunities to serve within the operating force will decrease,
while opportunities to serve in the generating force will increase. The officer’s previous generating force assignments
prepare him for his expanded role in the generating force in positions of increasing responsibility.
   (1) Education. Lieutenant colonels selected for command complete a pre-command course (PCC) and may be
selected for Senior Service College (SSC) following command.
   (2) Assignments.The key assignment for Infantry lieutenant colonels is centrally selected (CSL) battalion command
in the operating or generating force. Transition Teams are included under the Operational Category, so an officer who
decides to compete in this category will be eligible for a Transition Team chief assignment. Declining a Transition
Team chief CSL position equals decline with prejudice and the officer will not be able to compete for any battalion
command again. All other assignments are considered developmental. Infantry lieutenant colonels selected for com-
mand will normally serve two to three years in command at battalion level. Infantry lieutenant colonels are selected for
Centralized Selection List (CSL) commands in the following categories: Infantry Operations, Infantry Training,
Infantry Installation, Combat Arms Operations, Combat Arms Installation, Combat Arms Strategic Support, Branch
Immaterial Strategic Support, Branch Immaterial Recruiting and Training, Branch Immaterial Installation and Transi-
tion Team commands. All other assignments are considered developmental. Developmental positions for Infantry
lieutenant colonels include—
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             59

   (a) CTC task force trainer.
   (b) Brigade or regiment XO, and Deputy BCT Commander.
   (c) Division-level officer under DCS, G–3/5/7 (NOTE: normally a former battalion commander).
   (d) ROTC PMS.
   (e) Division or corps staff.
   (f) Service branch school staff and instructors.
   (g) HQDA or Joint Staff, NATO Staff, Combatant Commands staff.
   (h) TSB Battalion Commander.
   (i) JIIM organizations and commands.
   (j) RC support.
   (k) ACOM staff.
   (l) BCTP O/T * Note that assignment opportunity for some Infantry lieutenant colonel positions will be limited to
former battalion commanders.
   (3) Self-development. During this phase, self-assessment, off-duty civil schooling and perfecting mentoring and
managerial skills are essential to the development of the Infantry officer. The officer should also continue to hone his
combined arms warfighting skills and his understanding of the joint operational environment. Continue to read books
from the CSA’s Professional Reading List for Field Grade Officers.
   (4) Desired experience. Promotion to lieutenant colonel is the mark of a successful career for an Infantry officer.
Command selection only includes a small percentage of the Infantry lieutenant colonel population. Infantry lieutenant
colonels not selected for battalion command continue to make significant contributions at all levels of the Army and in
JIIM assignments. Infantry lieutenant colonels can expect to serve in a wide variety of professionally challenging and
personally rewarding assignments in the operating and generating forces. Former Battalion Commanders (FBCs) will
be assigned to specific billets coded for FBC and will be assigned based on needs of the Army. All FBC assignments
are vetted through the Director, OPMD. Some examples of FBC billets include division-level officers under DCS, G–3/
5/7, CTC TF Senior O/C, Joint Staff, Office of the SECDEF, Army, Corps or Division staff, TRADOC duty, Infantry
Branch chief in officer or enlisted assignments, USAREC duty, or 75th Ranger Regiment CSL command.
   e. Colonel. The professional development objective for this phase is sustainment of warfighting, training and staff
skills, along with utilization of leadership, organizational and executive talents. The majority of strategic level leaders
in the Army are colonels. Colonels are expected to be strategic and creative thinkers; builders of leaders and teams;
competent full-spectrum warfighters; skilled in governance, statesmanship, and diplomacy. They must understand
cultural context and work effectively across it.
   (1) Education. The majority of officers selected for promotion to colonel will be selected to attend Senior Service
College.
   (2) Assignments. Infantry colonels contribute to the Army by serving in crucial assignments in branch and combat
arms branch generalist positions. The critical task during this phase is to fully develop the broad skills and com-
petencies required of an agile and adaptive leader, while maintaining branch competency (warfighting skills). Officers
should make maximum use of their talents. Infantry officers will make full use of their maneuver, fires, and effects and
JIIM experience, managerial skills and executive talents to meet the needs of the Army. The key assignment for an
Infantry colonel is selection for brigade, regimental or colonel level installation command. Infantry colonels are
selected for Centralized Selection List (CSL) commands in the following command categories: Infantry Operations,
Infantry Training, Infantry Installation, Combat Arms Operations, Combat Arms Installation, Combat Arms Strategic
Support, Infantry/Armor Installation, Branch Immaterial Recruiting and Training, Branch Immaterial Installation and
Transition Team commands. Garrison command tour lengths are 24 months but can be extended to 36 months. All
other assignment are considered developmental. Developmental positions for Infantry colonels include:
   (a) Combat Training Center Operations group commander/chief of staff
   (b) TRADOC Capabilities Manager
   (c) Division or Corps Chief of Staff
   (d) Division, Corps or Field Army Assistant Chief of Staff, G–3/5/7
   (e) Executive officer to a general officer
   (f) Department Director, U.S. Army Infantry Center
   (g) HQDA or Joint Staff
   (3) Self-development. Infantry colonels must maintain their branch skills and remain current on all changes that
affect the Soldiers they command and/or manage. JIIM assignments are important during this phase.
   (4) Desired experience. The primary goal at this stage is to fully use the experience and knowledge gained in a
position where the officer can provide significant contributions to the operating and generating force. The key
assignment for an Infantry colonel is brigade level command. No other position provides the Infantry officer the
opportunity to fully use his depth of experience in joint and combined arms warfare and to capitalize on his generating
force assignments in service to the Army. Only a limited number of Infantry officers will have the opportunity to
command. Those officers not selected for command will continue to provide exceptional service in developmental
60                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

assignments within the Army and in JIIM assignments. These officers also provide the critical bridge between the
operating and generating force, and serve as the advocate of commanders in key staff elements.
   f. Joint assignments. Infantry officers will be considered for joint duty assignment based on the needs of the Army,
professional development needs of the officer and availability of a joint assignment. Infantry officers and units will
continue to be called on to participate in joint operations around the world. Joint experience, developed through
sequential assignments, will provide the joint perspective on strategic operations to be successful now and in the future.
9–4. Assignment preferences
The professional development goal of Infantry Branch is to produce and sustain highly qualified officers who are
tactically and operationally oriented to lead Soldiers and command units in combat and perform other assigned
missions. Assignments in combined arms organizations will be made to develop the officer’s overall ability to achieve
that goal. The officer’s assignments will be based on the needs of the Army, the officer’s professional development
needs and the officer’s preference. While Infantry Branch, Human Resources Command, makes every effort to support
individual officer’s assignment preferences, the needs of the Army and the officer’s professional development needs
must take priority.
9–5. Duration of critical officer life-cycle assignments
   a. Key Infantry Branch positions. The Infantry Branch officer will serve in several key and developmental positions
as they progress through their career in order to develop a joint and expeditionary mindset, tactical and technical
expertise in combined arms warfare, a firm grounding in Infantry operations, and knowledge of JIIM organizations.
There is no substitute in the Infantry Branch for service with troops in key leadership positions. The goal of the
Infantry officer professional development model is to provide the Infantry officer a series of leadership and operational
staff positions, supplemented by opportunities to round out their knowledge in key generating force positions, in order
to achieve success in positions of leadership at successively higher levels. The primary positions that develop this level
of expertise, in sequence, are platoon leader, company commander, S3/XO, battalion command, and garrison/brigade/
regimental command. The goal is to ensure that every Infantry officer is given the opportunity to serve in each of these
key leadership assignments (based on their individual manner of performance at each preceding level). While opera-
tional realities and the limited number of positions will prevent the branch from providing every officer the opportunity
to command at the battalion and brigade level, the goal remains to provide every Infantry officer a variety of
leadership, command and developmental assignments at each grade to develop and use their skills as combined arms
warriors. Those officers who do not command at the battalion level will continue to provide critical support to the
Army.
   b. Infantry Branch life-cycle. Figure 9–1 shows how Infantry Branch time lines, military and additional training, key
and developmental assignments and self-development fit together to support the Infantry Branch goal of growing agile
and adaptive leaders.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             61

                                      Figure 9–1. The AA Infantry Developmental Model
9–6. Requirements, authorizations and inventory
   a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for all Infantry Branch officers. To do this, the field
grade inventory must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support
branch/functional area generalist positions, and to provide majors with the opportunity to serve key assignment. The
branch’s goal is to afford every major 24 months S3/XO time.
   b. OPMS implementation. The number of authorized Infantry billets, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions
are made, and actions to implement them are taken. Officers who desire more information on Infantry Branch
authorizations or inventory, by grade, are encouraged to contact their AHRC Branch assignment officer.
9–7. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for Infantry
   a. Structure. The majority of assignment opportunities in the operating force will reside within the Heavy, Infantry,
and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams. As an officer progresses in rank, there are significantly greater opportunities to
serve within the generating force.
   b. Acquire. Infantry officers are accessed through USMA, ROTC and OCS. Officers are accessed into Infantry based
on their branch preference and the needs of the Army. Infantry is a recipient branch under the current system of branch
detailing. Infantry receives officers from the combat support and service support arms to fill lieutenant authorizations.
Branch detailed officers return to their commissioning branch upon their selection to captain and assignment to their
branch transition course.
   c. Distribute. The goal of Infantry Branch is to provide a variety of assignments to Infantry officers that will
develop their skills, broaden their experience base and prepare them for higher levels of responsibility and service to
the Army. The priority is on developing a depth of experience in Infantry operations while concurrently developing a
depth of experience in JIIM organizations and combined arms warfare. They will also be provided the opportunity to
serve in key generating force assignments in order to fully develop their knowledge of how the Army operates.
Officers may also rotate between CONUS and OCONUS assignments. Officers will have more time to gain the
62                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

requisite skills in their branch and their branch/functional area generalist assignments. Infantry officers are rotated
between assignments to ensure they develop the full range of skills necessary to perform as senior leaders.
   d. Deploy. Infantry officers remain the Army’s principle warfighters. Whether assigned to the operating or generat-
ing force, all Infantry officers must be prepared to deploy on short notice anywhere in the world to lead Soldiers.
Infantry officers may deploy with their units or as individuals to deter potential adversaries, protect national interests,
or conduct humanitarian and peace keeping missions. Infantry Branch officers must prepare themselves and their
Families for this most challenging life-cycle function.
   e. Sustain. Infantry combat skills are maintained through institutional training, assignments in warfighting units, and
self-development.
   (1) Promotion. Field grade officers designated to remain in Infantry and in the Maneuver, Fires and Effects
functional category will compete for promotion only within this functional category. If an Infantry officer is designated
to one of the two other functional categories, he will no longer compete against Infantry officers for promotion.
   (2) Command. Infantry Branch commanders will continue to be centrally selected (CSL) for command at the
battalion and brigade level. These commands are organized into four command categories: operations, strategic support,
recruiting and training and installation. Officers have the option of selecting the category or categories in which they
desire to compete for command, while declining competition in other categories. The results of the command selection
process are announced in the CSL.
   (3) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER (DA Form 67–9) requires the rater and senior rater to recommend a
functional category for all Army competitive captains through lieutenant colonels. When recommending a functional
designation for rated officers, rating officials will consider the whole person with factors such as: demonstrated
performance, educational background, technical or unique expertise, military experience or training and personal
preference of the officer. Functional category recommendations of raters and senior raters on the OER will be an
important factor taken into consideration during the Functional Designation Process.
   f. Develop. Infantry officers are developed through a logical progression of operating and generating force assign-
ments. The focus of Infantry officer professional development is on the attainment and utilization of warfighting skills,
and the utilization of those skills to support the critical doctrine, organization, training, material systems, leader
development, personnel and facility (DOTMLPF) development missions of the branch. The goal is to professionally
develop officers to employ firepower and maneuver skills in support of combined arms and joint operations. Develop-
ment also occurs through the Army school system; all officers selected for major should complete some form of ILE
education, and all officers selected for colonel should complete senior service college.
   g. Separate. The Infantry Branch has no unique separation processes.
9–8. Infantry Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development.
   (1) Reserve Component (RC) Infantry officer development objectives and qualifications parallel those planned for
their Active Duty counterparts, with limited exceptions. The increase in advanced technology weaponry and the
lethality of modern weapon systems requires that RC officers train at the appropriate level. This is necessary in order to
acquire those skills required for commanding, training and managing RC organizations for peacetime operation, as well
as mobilization. The RC officer must realize that a large portion of his education and training will be accomplished on
his own time, in accordance with his unit duty assignments. A variety of correspondence courses are available as well
as a full range of schools that he may attend as a resident student. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation of
Infantry tactical and technical expertise through assignments in their branch before specializing in a specific area/skill.
   (2) The RC Infantry officer serves the same role and mission as his AA counterpart. The unique nature of his role as
a "citizen Soldier" will pose a challenge to his professional development program. However, RC officer professional
development is expected to mirror AA officer development patterns as closely as possible, except as noted below. The
two primary exceptions are: RC officers tend to spend more time in key leadership positions and RC officers have
increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. Refer to chapter 7 for a detailed description of
RC officer career management and development.
   b. Branch development. Even though Reserve Component officer development is challenged by geographical
considerations and time constraints, each officer should strive for Infantry assignments and educational opportunities
that yield the same developmental opportunities as their Active Army counterparts.
   (1) Introduction. Reserve Component (ARNG and USAR) officers must also meet certain standards in terms of
schooling and operational assignments to be considered fully qualified in the Infantry Branch at each grade. Due to
geographical, time and civilian employment constraints, RC Infantry officers may find it difficult to serve in the
required operational assignments required at each grade in order to remain fully qualified as an Infantry officer.
Nevertheless, RC Infantry officers are expected to complete the educational requirements discussed below and to
aggressively seek out the operational assignments to remain proficient in the branch.
   (2) Lieutenant. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop the
requisite Infantry Branch skills, knowledge and attributes. The focus of the officer at this stage of his career is on
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                              63

development of Infantry tactical and technical warfighting skills and the utilization of these skills in an operational
assignment.
   (a) Education. The Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC) and Infantry Basic Officer Leader Course (I–BOLC) must
be completed during this phase. I–BOLC provides the Infantry lieutenant the basic skills necessary to function as an
infantry platoon leader. RC Infantry lieutenants may attend Ranger School, Infantry Mortar Platoon Officer Course,
Airborne School, or any number of unit specific functional courses. In addition to the Lieutenants Professional Military
Education (PME), all officers who have not earned a baccalaureate degree must complete their mandatory civilian
education requirements. Officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university to qualify
for promotion to captain.
   (b) Assignments. Officers should seek and be assigned to leadership positions in troop units whenever possible. The
critical assignment during this phase is serving as a rifle platoon leader in a brigade combat team. The typical Infantry
lieutenant will be assigned as a rifle platoon leader or staff officer in an infantry battalion upon completion of the basic
course. Other typical assignments for lieutenants are battalion specialty platoon leader (recon, weapons, or mortar),
company executive officer, battalion liaison officer (LNO), S3 air or logistics officer (S4). An Infantry officer may also
serve in a staff position after promotion to captain, but prior to attendance at the Maneuver Captain Career Course
(MC3).
   (c) Self-development. Self-development during this phase should focus on infantry tactical fundamentals, troop
leading procedures, leadership skills, organizational maintenance, resupply operations, basic administrative operations
and other branch technical proficiency skills.
   (d) Desired experience. Each Infantry lieutenant must complete all BOLC phases, successfully serve in an operating
force platoon leader assignment, then supplement his technical and tactical abilities through assignment to a specialty
platoon or staff position. The goal is to develop lieutenants with an understanding of Infantry maneuver tactics at the
platoon level.
   (3) RC captain.
   (a) Formal training. Mandatory education during this phase is completion of the Maneuver Captain Career Course
(MC3) which is a prerequisite for promotion to major. MC3 can be completed through attendance at the resident course
or the RC course (MC3–DL) that has a distance learning phase and a two-week resident phase. Officers branch
transferring are encouraged to see DA Pam 351–4 for military education requirements and procedures to apply for
MC3 constructive credit.
   (b) Assignments. Assignments in a company, battalion or brigade organization should follow a progressive order.
The command of a unit is the essence of leadership development at this stage of an officer’s career. Units fill company
command positions with officers who have demonstrated the potential for and the desire to command Soldiers. Most
command tours are 36 months long with the tour length set by the higher commander and should be preceded by
attendance at the company level pre-command course. The number of company command positions may not afford
every officer to have the opportunity to command at the captain level. Command can be of traditional modification
tables of organization and equipment (MTOE) line units or tables of distribution and allowances (TDA) units. Some
officers may receive more than one command opportunity, but those cases are rare. Battalion staff experience is also
desired during this period, but the focus should be to command a unit.
   (c) Typical duty assignments. Officers should aggressively seek Infantry company command. Following successful
company command, officers can be assigned to similar types of non-troop assignments as AA officers. In addition, they
may participate in the IMA and Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) programs.
   (d) Functional area training. The RC officers are awarded a functional area based upon the needs of the Army, the
officer’s geographic location, individual experience, education and training. Functional area assignments offer the
Infantry officer flexibility and the opportunity for additional assignments in both the ARNG and USAR. Officers who
received a functional area designation while on Active Duty may continue to serve in that functional area or may
request award of a different functional area based upon the availability of such assignments and the needs of the Army.
Functional area designators are awarded at the officer’s request once all prerequisites for award of the functional area
have been met.
   (4) RC major. Promotion to major normally occurs between the 12th and 14th year of commissioned service.
Promotion prior to consideration by the Department of the Army mandatory promotion board (position vacancy
promotion) is possible. Selection for major is based on performance and potential for further service in positions of
greater responsibility. These qualities are measured by the officer’s assignment history, level of branch development
achieved and the relative standing of the officer to his peers as indicated in the officer evaluation report (OER).
   (a) Formal training. Officers should complete ILE but must complete ILE common core to be promoted to
lieutenant colonel. Officers can complete the requirements for ILE in numerous ways: CGSC (resident or nonresident),
Sister Service resident CGSC or Associate Logistics Executive Development Course (ALEDC).
   (b) Assignments. The key assignment during this phase is service as a battalion S3 or XO, or brigade S3. An
Infantry major should serve for a minimum of 24 months in the key position of S3/XO. There is no substitute for time
spent as an S3/XO in preparing the Infantry major for battalion command and for expanding his knowledge of
combined arms maneuver warfare. Developmental assignments on brigade/division staffs (non-S3/XO positions), Joint
64                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

Forces Headquarters (JFHQ); Army Reserve Commands (ARCOM); General Officer Commands (GOCOMS); or major
USAR Command (MUSARC) staff positions is also desired to develop the officer for positions of greater responsibili-
ty. Duty in progressively challenging assignments is an essential ingredient in the career development of officers prior
to promotion to lieutenant colonel. Officers may participate in the AGR Program. The IRR and IMA programs for
majors offer many unique opportunities for training and development. The IMA program provides the Infantry officer
an opportunity to train in the position he will occupy upon mobilization.
   (5) The RC lieutenant colonel. The promotion board considers the RC major for promotion to lieutenant colonel at
the 16th year of commissioned service. Promotion prior to consideration by the Department of the Army mandatory
promotion board (below the zone promotion) is possible. Duty in progressively challenging assignments is an essential
ingredient in the career development of officers and subsequent promotion to lieutenant colonel.
   (a) Formal training. The RC lieutenant colonel must complete ILE common core prior to promotion to colonel.
Selectees for battalion command attend the appropriate branch-specific pre-command course (IPCC). Qualified Infantry
lieutenant colonels may apply for the U.S. Army War College or other Senior Service Colleges (resident or
correspondence).
   (b) Assignments. The key assignment for lieutenant colonels is as a battalion/squadron commander of an MTOE or
TDA unit for 36 months (plus or minus 12 months). While every Infantry officer will not command at the battalion
level, the goal of Infantry officer professional development is to provide every Infantry officer the assignments,
institutional training and experience to prepare him for command at this level. The Infantry officers selected for
command will remain competitive for promotion to colonel and brigade command. Developmental assignments
include: brigade DCO/XO; division primary staff; various JFHQ, ARCOM, GOCOMS; or MUSARC staff positions.
He may also participate in the AGR, IRR, or IMA programs.
   (6) The RC colonel.
   (a) Formal training. Although no mandatory education requirements (other than PCC for command selectees) exist
during this phase, officers are encouraged to complete senior service college (resident or nonresident).
   (b) Assignments. The key assignment for an RC colonel is brigade/regiment command for 36 months (plus or minus
12 months). Developmental assignments include AGR program participation and various senior duty positions at the
division, JFHQ, RSC, GOCOM, MUSARC levels, and HQDA and joint staff assignments.
   c. Life-cycle development model. The Reserve Component life-cycle development model for Infantry officers is
shown at figure 9–2.

Armor Branch
10–1. Unique features of the Armor Branch
   a. Unique purpose of the Armor Branch. The Armor Branch encompasses Armor or combined arms organizations
that close with and destroy the enemy using fire, maneuver and shock effect; and Cavalry and reconnaissance
organizations that perform reconnaissance, provide security and engage in the full spectrum of combat operations.
   b. The way ahead. The Army Transformation and the contemporary operating environment will significantly affect
how the Armor Branch trains, assigns and develops officers. While the focus of the Armor Branch has always been the
development of combined arms warriors, the Army’s ongoing transformation institutionalizes this concept through the
transition to combined arms formations. This will drive an increased focus on mounted maneuver operations for
company grade officers, in transition to a combined and joint operational focus for field grade officers whose expertise
includes the application of maneuver, fires and effects in the Joint Operational Battlespace. The development of Armor
officers will also focus on the development of agile and adaptive officers and multiskilled leaders who collectively
embody knowledge of operations in a JIIM environment. The assignment of Armor officers will continue to be made
based on (1) the needs of the Army, (2) the professional development needs of the officer and (3) the officer’s
preference. While the Human Resources Command will make every effort to synchronize the three priorities, the needs
of the Army and the professional development needs of the officer must continue to take precedence over individual
preference.
   c. Unique functions performed by the Armor Branch. Armor officers fulfill their mission by commanding, directing
and controlling mounted maneuver, combined arms organizations; providing expertise on the employment of combined
arms forces at all staff levels; and developing the doctrine, organizations, training, materiel and leaders necessary to
support the mounted maneuver mission. The initial focus of Armor officers is the development of the core technical
66                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

and tactical Armor, Cavalry, and reconnaissance skills. Following the initial focus on Armor and Cavalry skills
development, Armor officers begin to develop a broader focus on mounted maneuver, combined arms and joint warfare
as they progress through their careers.
   d. Unique features of work in the Armor branch. The Armor branch currently has three areas of concentration
(AOCs) and three skill identifiers. Detailed descriptions of the AOCs and skill identifiers listed below can be found in
DA Pam 611–21.
   (1) Armor officer, general (19A). These officers perform in staff positions requiring skills involving general Armor,
Cavalry and Reconnaissance practical experience. These officers should possess appropriate technical and tactical
institutional Armor School training in both tank and Cavalry/scout weapons systems and have developed tactical
expertise in mounted combined arms warfare.
   (2) Armor (19B). These officers perform in command or staff positions in mounted maneuver units with tanks or
mobile gun systems (MGS).
   (3) Cavalry (19C). These officers perform in command or staff positions in Cavalry and Reconnaissance organiza-
tions. All Cavalry officers must complete either the Army Reconnaissance Course or the Cavalry Leader Course prior
to serving in a 19C coded position.
   (4) Skill identifiers associated with Armor AOCs:
   (a) M1A2 Abrams Tank (3J)
   (b) M1A1 Abrams Tank (3M)
   (c) M2/M3 Bradley CFV/IFV (3X)
   (d) Stryker/MGS (8R). The DCS, G–1 has not approved the Stryker SI, but project it will be finalized by publication
date of this pamphlet.
   e. Branch detail. Armor Branch participates in the branch detailing of officers into Armor for development and
growth at the grade of lieutenant. Officers detailed Armor (branch code 19) will lose their Armor designation once they
reach their branch detail expiration date and they have been re-assigned into their new branch.
   f. Branch eligibility. The Armor Branch is closed to female officers under the Secretary of Defense direct ground
combat rule. Male officers of other branches who desire a branch transfer to Armor should submit a request in
accordance with AR 614–100, chapter 4.
10–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Competencies and actions common to all. Armor officers are valued for their skills as leaders, trainers and
planners: skills which are acquired and perfected through realistic training, professional military education and service
in the most demanding positions Armor Branch offers. The Armor Branch values both critical warfighting operational
force assignments and the generating force assignments. The goal of the branch is to provide each officer with a series
of leadership, staff and functional assignments; institutional training; and self-development opportunities in order to
develop combined arms warriors with well rounded backgrounds and an understanding of JIIM operations.
   b. Unique skills. Armor officers should display consistently outstanding performance across a wide variety of
MTOE warfighting and TDA training and staff positions. Armor officers should demonstrate excellence in their
warfighting skills; technical proficiency; a well developed understanding of mounted joint and combined arms warfare;
and the ability to lead, train, motivate and care for Soldiers.
10–3. Officer developmental assignments
   a. Lieutenant. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop the requisite
Armor branch skills, knowledge and attributes. The focus of the Armor lieutenant is on the development of Armor and
Cavalry tactical and technical warfighting skills and the utilization of these skills in an operational assignment.
   (1) Education. The Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC) must be completed during this phase. BOLC provides the
Armor lieutenant the baseline skills necessary to function as an Armor or Cavalry platoon leader, including an
overview of Armor and Cavalry tactics and techniques. , Armor platoon leaders will receive assignment oriented
training (AOT) following BOLC to prepare them for their specific assignments as tank or cavalry/reconnaissance
platoon leaders. These courses include, but are not limited to, Ranger School, Battalion Maintenance Officer Course
(BMOC) (through distance learning), Infantry Mortar Platoon Officer Course, Airborne School, Mechanized Leader’s
Course (MLC), SBCT Leaders Course, MSG Commander’s Course, Stryker Operations and Maintenance Course,
Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leader’s Course (RSLC), Tank Commander’s Course (TC2) and Army Reconnais-
sance Course (ARC). ARC is required for all lieutenants assigned to a Cavalry or Reconnaissance platoon regardless of
the platform the unit utilizes. The goal is to synchronize the lieutenant’s training in order to minimize the delay
between courses and get the lieutenant to his unit of assignment in the shortest time possible. The requisite AOT for
the Armor lieutenant based on his initial assignment is:
   (a) IBCT. Prior to assignment to an IBCT Reconnaissance Platoon, the Armor lieutenant must attend the Army
Reconnaissance Course (ARC). Armor officers assigned to an IBCT Airborne brigade must attend airborne school
enroute to their assignment. The Armor lieutenant may also attend Ranger School and/or other functional training
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             67

courses based upon availability and the needs of the unit. If the dates for ARC and any other functional training
conflict, ARC will be given priority.
   (b) SBCT. Prior to assignment to an SBCT the Armor lieutenant must attend the Army Reconnaissance Course
(ARC), and one or more of the following: SBCT Leader’s Course, MGS Leader’s Course or the Stryker Operations and
Maintenance Course dependent on his initial assignment. The Armor lieutenant may also attend Ranger School and/or
other functional training courses based upon availability and the needs of the unit. If the dates for ARC and any other
functional training conflict, ARC will be given priority.
   (c) HBCT. The Armor lieutenant must attend either ARC or TC2 prior to assignment to an HBCT. Direct
coordination will be made between the Armor BOLC proponent, AHRC, and the gaining HBCT to determine the
appropriate assignment oriented training based on his initial assignment within the HBCT. The Armor lieutenant may
also attend Ranger School and/or other functional training based on availability and the needs of the unit. If the dates
for ARC and any other functional training conflict, ARC will be given priority.
   (d) ACR. The Armor lieutenant assigned to an ACR must attend ARC prior to assignment. Additionally, a number
of lieutenants will be trained in TC2 to fill ACR tank platoon leader positions. The lieutenant may also attend Ranger
School and/or other functional training based on availability and the needs of the units. If the dates of ARC and any
functional training conflict, ARC will be given priority.
   (e) BFSB. Every Armor lieutenant assigned to a BFSB must attend ARC and the Reconnaissance and Surveillance
Leaders Course (RSLC) prior to assignment. The lieutenant may also attend Ranger School and/or other functional
training based on availability and the needs of the unit. If the dates for ARC and any other functional training conflict,
ARC will be given priority.
   (2) Assignments. The critical assignment during this phase is serving as a platoon leader in a TOE operational unit.
Historically, all qualified Armor lieutenants have had the opportunity to serve as Armor, Cavalry, or Reconnaissance
platoon leaders.
   (a) The typical Armor lieutenant will be assigned as a platoon leader or staff officer in a reconnaissance or
combined arms organization upon completion of BOLC and requisite functional training. The goal of the branch is to
assign the lieutenant to a TOE organization as his initial assignment.
   (b) However, a limited number of Armor lieutenants will serve as TRADOC training company executive officers or
staff officers for up to 12 months and then be assigned to a TOE unit. Armor lieutenants that have completed a
minimum of 24 months in a TOE unit can be assigned as a TRADOC training company executive officer or staff
officer.
   (c) Other typical assignments for lieutenants are battalion or squadron special platoon leader (scout or mortar),
company or troop executive officer, or battalion/squadron staff officer. An Armor officer may also serve in a staff
position after promotion to captain, but prior to attendance at the Maneuver Captain Career Course (MC3).
   (3) Self-development. Self-development during this phase should focus on tank and Cavalry tactical fundamentals,
troop leading procedures, leadership skills, tank gunnery, organizational maintenance, resupply operations, basic
administrative operations and other branch technical proficiency skills.
   (4) Desired experience. Each Armor lieutenant must complete all BOLC phases, successfully serve in an operational
TOE platoon leader assignment, then supplement his technical and tactical abilities through assignment to a specialty
platoon or staff position. The goal is to develop lieutenants with an understanding of mounted maneuver tactics at the
platoon level. A limited number of Armor lieutenants will also serve in generating force assignments prior to attending
MC3.
   b. Captain. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop mounted
maneuver officers who have exhibited leadership skills as a company commander and staff officer in an operational
unit, and who have rounded out their knowledge through successfully completing one or more assignments in the
generating force. Armor captains who have served in both operational and generating force positions have honed their
tactical skills and expanded their capabilities through their functional assignment. The Armor Branch wants to develop
captains with operational expertise and who are prepared to provide significant contributions to the generating force.
   (1) Education. Completion of a branch CCC is mandatory during this period. The majority of Armor officers will
attend the Maneuver Captain Career Course (MC3) branch training, while a select few will attend other branch CCCs.
Officers assigned to a Cavalry organization after completion of CCC must attend the Cavalry Leader Course if they did
not attend the Army Reconnaissance Course as a lieutenant. Officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree prior to
attending the Captain Career Course. Officers not holding a degree can complete through the degree completion
program (DCP) in accordance with AR 621–1, chapter 4. The Armor captain should coordinate the DCP with the
Armor Junior Captain Career Manager.
   (2) Assignments. Developmental assignments during this phase are a combination of operational company/troop
command and service as a primary staff officer. Armor officers may serve on operational or generating force unit staffs
at the brigade/regiment and battalion/squadron level prior to command.
   (a) Most Armor officers will be assigned to a brigade combat team/regiment immediately following completion of
the Career Course.
   (b) A few select Armor captains will serve their company command and staff assignments initially or subsequently
68                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

in a TRADOC TDA organization. These officers will be given the highest consideration for follow-on MTOE
assignments to compete for MTOE company command. This program increases operational command opportunity and
ensures the integration of officers with operational experience into the Armor Center to support the critical DOTMLPF
mission.
   (c) A limited number of Armor captains will be assigned to a TDA command following a BCT assignment.
   (d) Upon completion of company command, a full spectrum of assignments is possible. The purpose of these
assignments is to meet critical Army requirements, further develop the officer’s knowledge base and provide him a
more well-rounded professional experience. Every Armor captain should serve in a broadening assignment following
company command. The Armor Branch goal is to grow an inventory of officers who are tactically and technically
proficient and have expanded their skills in a generating force assignment. Examples of these assignments are
identified below in alphabetic order:
   1. AA/RC training support brigade trainer and staff
   2. ACOM and higher-level DA staff
   3. Army Sponsored Fellowships and Scholarships
   4. CTC trainer or observer/controller
   5. Doctrine developer
   6. Multinational and Coalition Trainer and Staff Officer
   7. Other combat arms or branch generalist positions.
   8. Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) Assistant Professor of Military Science
   9. Service school instructor or small group instructor
   10. TDA staff
   11. Training developer
   12. U.S. Army Recruiting Company Command and Staff
   13. USMA faculty and staff
   14. Self-development. During this phase, Armor officers must hone their leadership, tactical and technical skills,
develop a mastery of training management, and concentrate on those critical tasks required to accomplish their wartime
mission while winning on the battlefield. The officer should also begin to develop a more thorough understanding of
combined arms operations in a joint environment. Armor captains should consider beginning work on a master’s
degree.
   15. Desired experience. The key developmental assignment for an Armor captain is successful assignment as a
company/troop commander. There is no substitute for operational company/troop command for developing an Armor
officer’s leadership and tactical skills, and preparing him for future leadership assignments at successively higher levels
of responsibility. The goal is to provide each Armor captain 18 months (+/- six months) company command time;
however, the key is the quality of the experience rather than time. Armor captains should also expand their tactical and
technical capabilities through assignment as a battalion/squadron staff officer prior to re-assignment out of the brigade/
regiment.
   a. Armor captains should strive to command in a 19Z/11Z/02B coded command if possible.
   b. Armor captains may serve as company commanders in non-traditional commands in order to meet Army
requirements.
   c. A limited number of Armor captains may also serve on Transition Teams in Iraq or Afghanistan. Service on a
transition team, combined with 12 months of company command will potentially provide the quality of experience to
consider an officer complete with their key developmental assignment as an Armor captain.
   16. A limited number of officers may choose to opt-in to a Functional Designation Board (FDB) after 3 years of
service. The 4 year FDB selects a limited number of captains to fill requirements at the grade of captain in select
functional areas. This board is not mandatory and officers must choose to compete. Available functional Areas are
based on the needs of the Army.
   17. Functional Designation Board (FDB). All Armor officers will undergo a FDB at their seven year mark. This
HQDA board will decide in which of the 3 Functional Categories each officer is best suited to serve. Decisions are
based on the needs of the Army, the officer’s preference, rater and senior rater’s recommendations, and the officer’s
skills and training. The three functional categories are: Maneuver, Fires and Effects (MFE); Operations Support; and
Force Sustainment. After the FDB board convenes, each officer will be assigned a Branch or functional area within a
functional category. Officers who are selected to serve outside of Armor Branch will be managed by their respective
Branch or FA Career Manager. Officers who remain in Armor Branch will be managed by Armor Branch until
selection for colonel, when they will be managed by the Army Senior Leader Development Office. Armor officers who
remain in MF&E will receive both branch (19Z) and branch generalist (O1A/O2A) assignments. A limited number of
officers may also serve an internship or assignment in a functional area, intergovernmental or interagency organization.
   c. Majors. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to expand the officer’s
mounted maneuver tactical and technical experience and continue to develop him as a combined arms warrior and
leader with a comprehensive understanding of combined arms warfare in a joint and expeditionary environment.
                                              DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            69

Additionally, through a series of operational staff and generating force functional assignments, the Armor major
continues to increase his contribution to the institutional Army and his understanding of how the Army operates. The
key is to provide the Armor major with the tools that prepare him for future battalion command and for increasingly
complex generating force assignments.
   (1) Education. Military education required during this phase is completion of Intermediate Level Education (ILE)
through completion of the CGSC or sister service equivalent. ILE is divided into two phases. Phase 1 is a 14-week
common core training block of instruction. Phase 2 is the AOWC, which is the field grade credentialing course that is
required for all Armor officers. Officers may also compete to be selected for the School of Advanced Military Studies
(SAMS), following AOWC. Those selected must serve a utilization tour as a corps or division plans/assistant DCS,
G–3/5/7 staff officer.
   (2) Assignments. Key developmental assignments during this phase are:
   (a) Battalion/Squadron S3/XO.
   (b) Brigade/Regiment S3/XO.
   (c) Transition Team S3/XO. A limited number of Armor majors will serve on transition teams. The Armor Branch
goal, dependent on the officer’s preference, is to provide these officers a follow on assignment as a battalion/brigade
S3/XO. The purpose of these assignments is to provide the Armor major the requisite skills to prepare him for future
operational and generating force assignments of increasing responsibility and for command. While our goal is to
provide a minimum of 24 months combined time in these positions, the key is the quality of the assignment vice time
in position.
   (d) Division Chief of Plans (SAMS Utilization). The Division Chief of Plans position is considered a key develop-
mental experience for the SAMS graduate Armor officer when served in conjunction with at least 12 months service in
a battalion/squadron or brigade/regimental S3/XO position. Experience at the brigade/regimental level and below is
absolutely essential for the professional growth of the Armor officer and necessary for success at future levels of
command.
   (e) Every Armor officer should have sufficient experience and participate in a capstone event in these KD
assignments in order to develop an understanding of mounted and combined arms operations. There is no substitute for
preparing an Armor officer for future command and for building his mounted maneuver and combined arms skills. The
Armor major may further expand his tactical and technical skills by serving in staff assignments at Division level and
higher.
   (3) Armor majors will also meet the Army’s mission requirements and build on their institutional skills through
varied generating force, JIIM assignments. Examples of Armor major assignments beyond key developmental positions
are provided below in alphabetic order:
   (a) AA/RC S3/XO
   (b) Advisor positions for foreign schools
   (c) Army Command (ACOM) staff (CONUS and OCONUS)
   (d) Army sponsored fellowships and scholarships
   (e) Brigade, division or corps staff
   (f) CTC trainer or staff officer
   (g) DA staff officer
   (h) Doctrine Developer
   (i) Joint Staff officer
   (j) Multinational and Coalition Trainer and Staff Officer
   (k) ROTC assistant professor of military science (APMS)
   (l) Service school instructor, staff and faculty
   (m) Training Developer
   (n) United States Military Academy (USMA) faculty and staff
   (4) Self-development. Armor majors are expected to continue self-development efforts to build intellectual capital,
strategic perspective and hone operational skills. Armor majors will be required to develop and use a diverse set of
skills as they move between combined arms leadership positions in TOE and TDA organizations as well as functional
Armor, branch immaterial and JIIM assignments.
   (5) Desired experience. At this stage of the officer’s career, the Armor major must hone his skills in the planning
and execution of combined arms/joint warfare and to develop expertise in the JIIM operational environment. While the
goal is to provide every Armor major a minimum of 18–24 months combined time in the critical assignments, quality
of the assignment rather than time is the critical factor.
   (6) Additional factors.
   (a) The goal of the branch is to develop an inventory of field grade officers who embody a collective knowledge of
JIIM experience. While not every officer will receive an assignment in a qualifying joint assignment or serve a
fellowship in a JIIM agency, the goal is to provide the maximum opportunity for Armor majors to receive this
70                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

opportunity. The Armor Branch’s ability to meet this goal will be dependent on Army demands and position/fellowship
availability.
   (b) Armor majors may be credited for joint service either through assignment to a qualifying Joint Duty Assignment
List (JDAL) position or through the point system based on qualifying joint service.
   (c) A limited number of Armor field grade officers may be assigned to positions currently coded as functional area
positions. A number of functional area field grade positions were coded as open to assignment by non-FA officers. The
goal is to expand position access, especially for JIIM positions. Armor majors may be assigned to Armor Branch,
branch/combat arms generalist (01A, 02A, 02B) or functional area positions coded for access by branch officers.
   d. Lieutenant colonel. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is demonstrated
excellence in tactical skills, technical proficiency and the ability to lead, train, motivate and care for Soldiers in both
the staff and command environments. An Armor officer’s opportunity to serve in the operational force will decrease as
he increases in rank and the percentage of generating force positions increases. The officer’s previous assignments
prepare him for his expanded role in the generating force positions of increasing responsibility.
   (1) Education. Lieutenant colonels selected for command complete a pre-command course (PCC) and may be
selected for Senior Service College following command.
   (2) Assignments. Officers selected for lieutenant colonel in Armor should seek assignments of greater responsibility
in branch and branch generalist positions. The objective in lieutenant colonel assignments is greater contribution to the
branch and the Army. It is important in this phase of an Armor officer’s career that he serves in an assignment that
further develops his joint combined arms skill set and improves warfighting skills. The most critical assignment for
Armor lieutenant colonels in the Maneuver, Fires and Effects functional category is battalion level command. Armor
lieutenant colonels selected for command will normally serve two to three years in command at battalion level. Armor
officers are selected for CSL commands in four command categories: Operations, Strategic Support, Training and
Recruiting, and Installation. Typical duty assignments for lieutenant colonels are listed in alphabetic order below. Note
that assignment opportunity for some Armor lieutenant colonel positions will be limited to former battalion
commanders.
   (a) UAEE Battalion Command or Staff
   (b) ACOM staff
   (c) Battalion/Squadron/Transition Team Command
   (d) BCTP O/T
   (e) Brigade or regiment XO, and Deputy BCT Commander
   (f) CTC task force trainer
   (g) Division-level officer under DCS, G–3/5/7 (NOTE: This may migrate to a colonel assignment)
   (h) Division or corps staff
   (i) HQDA or joint staff, NATO Staff, Combatant Commands staff
   (j) RC support
   (k) ROTC PMS
   (l) Service branch school staff and instructors
   (m) TSB Battalion Commander
   (n) XO/S3 positions in an AA/RC training support brigade
   (3) Self-development. During this phase of an Armor officer’s career, self-development takes the form of self-
assessment, off-duty civil schooling and perfecting mentoring and managerial skills. The officer should also continue to
hone his combined arms warfighting skills and his understanding of the joint operational environment.
   (4) Desired experience. The goal of Armor Branch development is to prepare every officer for command of a
combined arms battalion, cavalry/reconnaissance squadron, TDA training battalion, transition team or other institutional
command at the lieutenant colonel level. While not every officer will command, and Armor lieutenant colonels will
provide exceptional contributions to the Army in the generating force, the focus remains the development of officers
imbued with technical and tactical knowledge of the joint, combined arms, mounted maneuver warfare and the
application of maneuver, fires and effects on the battlefield. The critical assignment for an Armor lieutenant colonel is
command. While the typical command tour has historically been 24 months, due to ongoing operational deployments
and unit transitions, command tours may range from less than 24 months to greater than 36 months in length.
   e. Colonel. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is sustainment of warfight-
ing, training and staff skill, along with utilization of leadership, managerial and executive talents. The majority of
strategic level leaders in the Army are colonels. Colonels are expected to be multiskilled leaders — strategic and
creative thinkers; builders of leaders and teams; competent full spectrum warfighters; skilled in governance, statesman-
ship, and diplomacy; and understand cultural context and work effectively across it.
   (1) Education. Historically, the majority of officers selected for promotion to colonel are selected to attend Senior
Service College.
   (2) Assignments. Armor colonels contribute to the Army by serving in crucial assignments in branch and generalist
positions. The critical task during this phase is to fully develop the broad skills and competencies required of a
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                              71

multiskilled leader, while maintaining branch/maneuver competency (warfighting skills). Officers should make maxi-
mum use of their talents. Armor colonels will make full use of their broad maneuver, fires, and effects and JIIM
experience, managerial skills and executive talents to meet the needs of the Army. A critical assignment for an Armor
colonel in the Maneuver, Fires and Effects functional category is selection for brigade or regimental command. Armor
officers selected for brigade level command will serve in the same four command CSL categories as lieutenant
colonels, garrison command tour lengths are 24 months but can be extended to 36 months. Critical assignments for
colonels include:
   (a) Brigade, regiment, or garrison command
   (b) CTC operations group commander/chief of staff
   (c) Department director, U.S. Army Armor Center
   (d) Division or corps chief of staff
   (e) Division, Corps or Field Army assistant chief of staff for DCS, G–3/5/7
   (f) Executive officer to a general officer
   (g) HQDA or Joint Staff
   (h) TRADOC Capabilities Manager
   (3) Self-development. Armor colonels must maintain their branch skills and keep current on all changes that affect
the Soldiers they command and/or manage. JIIM assignments are important during this phase.
   (4) Desired experience. The primary goal at this stage is to fully use the experience and knowledge gained in a
position where the officer can provide a significant contribution to the operational and generating force. The critical
assignment for an Armor colonel is brigade level command. No other position provides the Armor officer the
opportunity to fully use his depth of experience in joint and combined arms warfare and to capitalize on his functional
generating force assignments in service to the Army. However, only a limited number of Armor officers will have the
opportunity to command. Those officers not selected for command will continue to provide exceptional service in
generating force and JIIM assignments of increasing responsibility. These officers also provide the critical bridge
between the operational and generating force, and serve as the advocate of commanders in key staff elements.
   f. Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational assignments. The development of Armor officers will
also focus on the development of agile and adaptive officers and multiskilled leaders who collectively embody
knowledge of JIIM organizations. Armor officers will be considered for a billet on the JDAL based on the needs of the
Army, professional development needs of the officer and availability of a joint assignment. Armor officers and units
will continue to be called on to participate in joint operations around the world. The JIIM experience, developed
through sequential assignments, will provide the broad perspective necessary to be successful now and in the future.
10–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
   a. Preferences. The professional development goal of Armor branch is to produce and sustain highly qualified
officers who are tactically and operationally oriented to lead Soldiers and command units in combat and perform other
assigned missions. Assignments in combined arms organizations will be made to develop the officer’s overall ability to
achieve that goal. The officer’s assignments will be based on the needs of the Army, the officer’s professional
development needs and the officer’s preference. While Armor Branch, Human Resources Command, makes every
effort to support individual officer’s assignment preferences, the needs of the Army and the officer’s professional
development needs must take priority.
   b. Precedence. Certain assignments in Armor branch will occur in a precedence sequence. Other assignments to
include professional military training are not constrained, but if possible should occur in sequence. Command positions
will have precedence over staff positions. These positions develop an officer’s ability to command at various levels
throughout a career. For example, before an officer can be a battalion/squadron S3, he will have had a successful
company/troop command. The preferred sequence for a major for professional development is education, battalion/
squadron XO/S3 or brigade/regiment XO/S3, followed by a JIIM, branch/functional area generalist or division/brigade
staff officer assignment, however operational requirements will require that some officers gain their battalion/squadron
XO/S3 or brigade/regiment XO/S3 prior to attending ILE.
10–5. Duration of officer life-cycle assignments
   a. Key Armor branch positions. The Armor Branch officer will serve in several key developmental positions as they
progress through their career in order to develop a joint and expeditionary mindset, tactical and technical expertise in
combined arms warfare, a firm grounding in Armor and Cavalry operations, and knowledge of JIIM organizations.
There is no substitute in the Armor Branch for service with troops in key leadership positions. The goal of the Armor
officer professional development model is to provide the Armor officer a series of operational staff and leadership
positions, supplemented by opportunities to round out their knowledge in key generating force positions, in order to
achieve success in positions of leadership at successively higher levels. The primary positions that develop this level of
expertise, in sequence, are platoon leader, company/troop commander, S3/XO. The goal is to ensure that every Armor
officer is given the opportunity to serve in each of these key leadership assignments. While operational realities and the
limited number of positions will prevent the branch from providing every officer the opportunity to command at the
72                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

battalion and brigade level, the goal remains to prepare every Armor officer for command. Those officers who do not
command at the battalion level will continue to provide critical support to the Army in key generating force positions.
Their role will remain to ensure that generating force organizations continue to maintain focus on their critical role in
supporting the warfight. Armor officers, schooled in combined arms warfare and the application of maneuver, fires and
effects in Joint operations, will serve as the critical link between the operational and generating force.
   b. Armor branch life-cycle. Figure 10–1 shows how Armor branch time lines, military and additional training, key
developmental assignments and self-development fit together to support the Armor Branch goal of growing future
combined arms warriors. The Armor Branch developmental goals directly support the goal of the Army Transformation
to grow a campaign qualify Army with joint and expeditionary capabilities.
                                     Figure 10–1. The AA Armor Developmental Model
10–6. Requirements, authorizations and inventory
   a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for all Armor branch officers. To do this the field
grade inventory must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support
branch/functional area generalist positions, and to provide majors with the opportunity to serve in the critical develop-
mental assignment; S3/XO. The branch’s goal is to provide every major a minimum of two years S3/XO time while
stabilized for three years.
   b. OPMS implementation. The number of authorized Armor billets, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions
are made, and actions to implement them are taken. Officers, who desire more information on Armor branch
authorizations or inventory, by grade, are encouraged to contact their AHRC OPMD assignment officer.
10–7. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for Armor
   a. Structure. The primary operational assignments for Armor officers based on Army Transformation, will include
combined arms battalions and reconnaissance squadrons in brigade combat teams, armored cavalry squadrons, and
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             73

reconnaissance squadrons in battlefield surveillance brigades. Armor officers may also serve in critical developmental
assignments in TDA organizations.
   b. Acquire. Armor officers are accessed through USMA, ROTC and OCS. Officers are accessed into Armor based
on their branch preference and the needs of the Army. Armor is a recipient branch under the current system of branch
detailing. Armor receives officers from the combat support and service support arms to fill lieutenant authorizations.
Branch detailed officers return to their commissioning branch upon their selection to captain and assignment to their
branch transition course. It is imperative that branch detail officers not attend follow-on schools (such as Airborne or
Ranger) after the Armor BOLC; they should report directly to their unit of assignment. This provides the officer with
the required time to develop as a platoon leader in combat arms before transitioning to his commissioning branch.
   c. Distribute. The goal of the Armor Branch is to provide every Armor officer a variety of leadership, staff and
functional assignments at each grade to develop and use their craft as combined arms warriors. The priority is on
developing a depth of experience in Armor and Cavalry operations while concurrently developing a depth of experi-
ence in JIIM organizations and combined arms warfare. They will also be provided the opportunity to serve in key
generating force assignments in order to fully develop their knowledge of how the Army runs and to provide
opportunities to support the warfighting Army through key staff and functional assignments. Officers may also rotate
between CONUS and OCONUS assignments. Officers will have more time to gain the requisite skills in their branch
and their branch/functional area generalist assignments. Armor officers are rotated between assignments to ensure they
develop the full range of skills necessary to perform as senior leaders.
   d. Deploy. Armor branch officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA
organizations, all Armor officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict.
Armor officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests; or
as individuals to support joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping
missions. Armor branch officers must prepare themselves and their Families for this most challenging life-cycle
function.
   e. Sustain. Armor combat skills are maintained through institutional training and assignments in warfighting units.
   (1) Promotion. Armor branch field grade officers designated to remain in Armor and the Maneuver, Fires and
Effects functional category will compete for promotion only within their functional category. If an Armor officer is
designated to one of the two other functional categories, he will no longer compete with Armor officers for promotion.
   (2) Command. Armor branch commanders will continue to be centrally selected for command at the battalion and
brigade level. These commands are organized into four command categories: operations, strategic support, recruiting
and training and installation. Officers have the option of selecting the category or categories in which they desire to
compete for command, while declining competition in other categories. The results of the command selection process
are announced in the CSL.
   (3) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER (DA Form 67–9) requires the rater and senior rater to recommend a
functional category for all Army competitive captains through lieutenant colonels. When recommending functional
categories for rated officers, rating officials will consider the whole person with factors such as: demonstrated
performance, educational background, technical or unique expertise, military experience or training and personal
preference of the officer. Functional category recommendations of raters and senior raters on the OER will be an
important factor taken into consideration during the Functional Category Designation Process.
   f. Develop. Armor officers are developed through a logical progression of TOE assignments, institutional training
and staff/TDA assignments. The focus of Armor officer professional development is on the attainment and utilization
of warfighting skills, and the utilization of those skills to support the critical doctrine, organization, training, material
systems, leader development, DOTMLPF development missions of the branch. The goal is to professionally develop
officers to employ firepower and maneuver skills in support of combined arms and joint operations. Development
occurs through the Army school system; all officers selected for major should complete some form of ILE education,
and all officers selected for colonel should complete senior service college.
   g. Separate. Armor branch has no unique separation processes.
10–8. Armor Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. Reserve Component (RC) Armor officer development objectives and qualifications
parallel those planned for their Active duty counterparts, with limited exceptions. The increase in advanced technology
weaponry and the lethality of modern weapon systems requires that RC officers train at the appropriate level. This is
necessary in order to acquire those skills required for commanding, training and managing RC organizations for
peacetime operation, as well as mobilization. The RC officer must realize that a large portion of his education and
training will be accomplished on his own time, in accordance with his unit duty assignments. A variety of correspond-
ence courses are available as well as a full range of schools that he may attend as a resident student. Junior officers
must develop a strong foundation of Armor tactical and technical expertise through assignments in their branch before
specializing in a specific area/skill.
   (1) Role. The RC Armor officer serves the same role and mission as his AA counterpart. The unique nature of his
74                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

role as a "citizen Soldier" will pose a challenge to his professional development program. However, RC officer
professional development is expected to mirror AA officer development patterns as closely as possible, except as noted
below. The two primary exceptions are: RC officers tend to spend more time in key leadership positions and RC
officers have increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. In order to meet professional
development objectives, the RC officer may need to rotate between ARNG and USAR troop program units (TPU), the
IRR, and IMA assignments to reach his professional development objectives. Refer to chapter 7 for a detailed
description of RC officer career management and development.
   (2) RC lieutenant. Upon commissioning, each officer is assigned a career branch in which the emphasis for training
and development occurs during the officers first seven to eight years.
   (a) Education. Mandatory military education during this phase is completion of the resident Basic Officer Leader
Course, which should be completed within 12 months (not later than 18 months) of commissioning and is a
prerequisite for promotion to 1st lieutenant. Officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or
university to qualify for promotion to captain.
   (b) Initial assignments. Officers should seek and be assigned to leadership positions in troop units whenever
possible. This duty provides the officer an understanding of operations and military life that will build a solid
foundation for future service. Every attempt will be made to assign junior officers to troop units. While assigned at the
company level, officers should seek a variety of assignments, which will enhance their future performance as a
commander.
   (3) RC captain.
   (a) Formal training. Mandatory education during this phase is completion of the Maneuver Captain Career Course
(MC3) which is a prerequisite for promotion to major. MC3 can be completed through attendance at the resident course
or the RC course (MC3–RC) that has multiple Web-based phases along with two two-week resident phases completing
the C3 and CAX requirements. A percentage of AR officers elect to attend the Infantry Captain Career Course
(Resident or RC course) in lieu of MC3/MC3 DL. Officers branch transferring are encouraged to see DA Pam 351–4
for military education requirements and procedures to apply for MC3 constructive credit.
   (b) Assignments. Assignments in a company, battalion or brigade organization should follow a progressive order.
The command of a unit is the essence of leadership development at this stage of an officer’s career. Units fill company
command positions with officers who have demonstrated the potential for and the desire to command Soldiers. Most
command tours are 18–24 months long with the tour length set by the higher commander and should be preceded by
attendance at the company level pre-command course. The number of company command positions may not afford
every officer to have the opportunity to command at the captain level. Command can be of traditional MTOE line units
or tables of distribution and allowances (TDA) units. Some officers may receive more than one command opportunity,
but those cases are rare. Battalion staff experience is also desired during this period, but the focus should be to
command a unit.
   (c) Typical duty assignments. Officers should aggressively seek Armor, Cavalry, reconnaissance or Mechanized
Infantry company/troop command. Following successful company/troop command, officers can be assigned to similar
types of non-troop assignments as AA officers. In addition, they may participate in the IMA and AGR programs.
   (d) Functional area training. RC officers are awarded a functional area based upon the needs of the Army, the
officer’s geographic location, individual experience, education and training. Functional area assignments offer the
Armor officer flexibility and the opportunity for additional assignments in both the ARNG and USAR. Officers who
received a functional area while on Active Duty may continue to serve in that functional area or may request award of
a different functional area based upon the availability of such assignments and the needs of the Army. Functional area
designators are awarded at the officer’s request once all prerequisites for award of the functional area have been met.
   (4) RC major. Promotion to major normally occurs at the tenth year of commissioned service. Promotion prior to
consideration by the Department of the Army mandatory promotion board (position vacancy promotion) is possible.
Selection for major is based on performance and potential for further service in positions of greater responsibility.
These qualities are measured by the officer’s assignment history, branch development achieved and the relative
standing of the officer to his peers as indicated in the officer evaluation report (OER).
   (a) Formal training. Officers should complete ILE. The RC major must complete ILE common core as a prerequisite
for promotion to lieutenant colonel. Officers can complete the requirements for ILE in numerous ways: CGSC (resident
or nonresident), Sister Service resident CGSC or ALEDC.
   (b) Assignments. The critical assignment during this phase is service as a battalion/squadron S3 or XO, or brigade/
regimental S3. Also, duty on brigade/division staff and Joint Forces Headquarters (JFHQ) or ARCOM, GOCOM,
MUSARC is desired. RC Armor majors may typically serve in similar assignments as AA officers and should continue
to gain staff experience at division level and higher. Successful assignments in positions such as battalion executive
officer (XO) and operations officers (S–3) best prepares officers for the rigors of battalion/squadron command. Officers
desiring to remain competitive for battalion command should endeavor to serve in such positions. Duty in progressively
challenging assignments is an essential ingredient in the career development of officers prior to promotion to lieutenant
colonel. Officers may participate in the AGR Program. Armor positions in RC units are actively sought and highly
competitive. An officer should seek to remain in a unit if at all possible. An officer may choose to become a member
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                              75

of the IRR or the IMA programs. The IRR and IMA programs for majors offer many unique opportunities for training
and development. The IMA program provides the Armor officer an opportunity to train in the position he will occupy
upon mobilization.
   (5) RC lieutenant colonel. The promotion board considers the RC major for promotion to lieutenant colonel at the
16th year of commissioned service. Promotion prior to consideration by the Department of the Army mandatory
promotion board (below the zone promotion) is possible. Duty in progressively challenging assignments is an essential
ingredient in the career development of officers and subsequent promotion to lieutenant colonel. Generally, these
positions are in the MTOE or TDA environment as staff officers in battalions, brigades or JFHQ. Highly qualified
officers in this phase may be selected to command a battalion or squadron. Other assignments include: brigade/
regimental XO; division primary staff; various Joint Forces Headquarters (JFHQ); Army Reserve Commands (AR-
COM); General Officer Commands (GOCOMS); or major USAR Commands (MUSARC) staff positions. He may also
participate in the AGR, IRR, or IMA programs.
   (a) Formal training. The RC lieutenant colonel must complete ILE common core prior to promotion to colonel.
Selectees for battalion command attend the Armor Pre-Command Course. Qualified Armor lieutenant colonels may
apply for the U.S. Army War College or other Senior Service Colleges (resident or correspondence).
   (b) Assignments. Highly qualified RC lieutenant colonels may be selected to command a battalion, squadron or
Armor TASS battalion. Other typical assignments include the following: brigade or regimental XO; division primary
staff, various Joint Forces Headquarters (JFHQ), U.S. Army Reserve Regional Support Command (RSC), General
Officer Command (GOCOM), and major U.S. Army Reserve Command (MUSARC) staff positions; or HQDA level
and joint staff assignments. RC lieutenant colonels may participate in the AGR, IRR or IMA programs
   (6) RC colonel.
   (a) Formal training. Although no mandatory education requirements (other than PCC for command selectees) exist
during this phase, officers are encouraged to complete senior service college (resident or nonresident).
   (b) Assignments. Highly qualified colonels may be selected to command a heavy brigade combat team, Stryker
brigade combat team or infantry brigade combat team. Other typical assignments include AGR program participation
and various senior duty positions at the division, JFHQ, RSC, GOCOM, MUSARC levels, and HQDA and joint staff
assignments.
   b. Branch development. Even though Reserve Component officer development is challenged by geographical
considerations and time constraints, each officer should strive for Armor assignments and educational opportunities that
yield the same developmental opportunities as their Active Army counterparts.
   (1) Introduction. Reserve Component (ARNG and USAR) officers must also meet certain standards in terms of
schooling and operational assignments to be considered fully qualified in the Armor Branch at each grade. Due to
geographical, time and civilian employment constraints, RC Armor officers may find it difficult to serve in the required
operational assignments required at each grade in order to remain fully qualified as an Armor officer. Nevertheless, RC
Armor officers are expected to complete the educational requirements discussed below and to aggressively seek out the
operational assignments to remain proficient in the branch.
   (2) Lieutenant. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is to develop the
requisite Armor branch skills, knowledge and attributes. The focus of the officer at this stage of his career is on
development of Armor and Cavalry tactical and technical warfighting skills and the utilization of these skills in an
operational assignment.
   (a) Education. The Basic Officer Leader Course must be completed during this phase. BOLC provides the Armor
lieutenant the basic skills necessary to function as a tank platoon leader and an overview of Cavalry tactics and
techniques. Prior to assignment to a Cavalry Platoon, the Armor lieutenant may attend the Scout Leader Course. In
addition, the Armor lieutenant may attend Ranger School, Battalion Maintenance Officer Course (through distance
learning), Infantry Mortar Platoon Officer Course, or Airborne School. Additional training following BOLC is prima-
rily dependent on the lieutenant’s unit of assignment.
   (b) Assignments. The critical assignment during this phase is serving as a platoon leader in a brigade combat team.
Historically, all qualified Armor lieutenants have had the opportunity to serve as Armor, Cavalry, or Reconnaissance
platoon leaders. The typical Armor lieutenant will be assigned as a platoon leader or staff officer in a reconnaissance or
combined arms organization upon completion of the basic course. Other typical assignments for lieutenants are
battalion or squadron special platoon leader (support, scout or mortar), company or troop executive officer, battalion or
squadron liaison officer (LNO), S3 air or logistics officer (S4) and battalion or squadron maintenance officer (BMO/
SMO). An Armor officer may also serve in a staff position after promotion to captain, but prior to attendance at the
MC3.
   (c) Self-development. Self-development during this phase should focus on tank and cavalry tactical fundamentals,
troop leading procedures, leadership skills, tank gunnery, organizational maintenance, resupply operations, basic
administrative operations and other branch technical proficiency skills.
   (d) Desired experience. Each Armor lieutenant must complete all BOLC phases, successfully serve in an operational
TOE platoon leader assignment, then supplement his technical and tactical abilities through assignment to a specialty
76                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

platoon or staff position. The goal is to develop lieutenants with an understanding of mounted maneuver tactics at the
platoon level.
   (3) RC captain. The desired experience for the Armor branch captain is:
   (a) Completion of Maneuver Captain Career Course (MC3). (See DA Pam 351–4, for military education require-
ments based on the type of officer basic course completed and for constructive credit application procedures.)
   (b) RC officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree to qualify for promotion to captain.
   (c) Successful command of an Armor or mechanized infantry company or troop. The goal is for each Reserve
Component captain to serve a minimum of 36 months company/troop command time (plus or minus 12 months).
However, the key is quality of the experience rather than time in command.
   (4) RC major. The goals for RC Armor major professional development are:
   (a) Service in a TOE or TDA battalion or squadron, or as a brigade S3. The goal is for each Armor major to serve a
minimum of 24 months. There is no substitute for time spent as an S3/XO in preparing the Armor major for battalion/
squadron command and for expanding his knowledge of mounted maneuver warfare.
   (b) Supplement their S3/XO experience with assignments in key duty positions in Armor or mechanized units. This
includes service in primary staff positions at the battalion, brigade, or regiment levels; and continues to gain staff
experience at the division and higher levels. RC majors may participate in the AGR or IMA programs.
   (c) Enrollment in ILE prior to 18 years time in service. At least ILE common core must be completed for promotion
to lieutenant colonel.
   (5) RC lieutenant colonel. The desired professional development experiences for the Armor lieutenant colonel are:
   (a) Completion of ILE, minimum common core. Command combined arms battalion or squadron or TDA battalion
or squadron for 36 months (plus or minus 12 months). While every Armor officer will not command at the battalion
level, the goal of Armor officer professional development is to provide every Armor officer the assignments, institu-
tional training and experience to prepare him for command at this level. The Armor officers selected for command will
remain competitive for promotion to colonel and brigade command.
   (b) Service in key duty positions such as a brigade or regiment XO, or service in division primary staff or JFHQ,
RSC, GOCOM and MUSARC staff positions; or in HQDA and joint staff assignments. RC lieutenant colonels may
participate in the AGR or IMA programs.
   (c) May be selected to attend a Senior Service College or Army War College Corresponding Studies Course.
   (6) RC colonel. The professional development goals for Armor colonels are:
   (a) Command of a brigade combat team for 36 months (plus or minus 12 months).
   (b) Service in various duty positions at the division, JFHQ, RSC, GOCOM and MUSARC levels; or in HQDA and
joint staff assignments. Colonels may participate in the AGR or IMA program.
   (c) May be selected to attend a Senior Service College or Army War College Corresponding Studies Course.
   c. Life-cycle development model. The Reserve Component life-cycle development model for Armor officers is
shown at figure 10–2.

Aviation Branch
11–1. Unique features of the Aviation Branch
   a. Unique purpose of the Aviation Branch Army Aviation is a Combat Arms Branch that operates at theater and
below echelons throughout full spectrum operations. The mission of the Aviation Branch is to find, fix, and destroy the
enemy through fire and maneuver, and to provide combat support and combat service support in coordinated operations
as an integral member of the combined arms team. Aviation officers lead missions characterized as combat, combat
support, and combat service support, with assignments to Attack, Cavalry, Air Assault, Special Operations, General
Support, Air Traffic Services, Unmanned Aircraft System, Maintenance, and Military Intelligence units. As military
professionals, each Aviation officer must embody the Army Values and the warrior ethos by being tactically and
technically proficient in the doctrinal and organizational foundations of the Aviation Branch, as well as the other
combat arms branches, in order to effectively plan, execute, command and control aviation forces as a key member of
the combined arms team.
   b. The way ahead.
   (1) Previous philosophies encouraged officers to secure the “right” jobs in order to achieve “branch qualification”
instead of attaining quality experience in each job. This philosophy is no longer applicable. Every officer should
endeavor to apply the warrior ethos to every job and every facet of their development. Success does not depend on the
number or type of positions held, but rather on the skills attained and the quality of duty performance in every
assignment. Previously accepted standards regarding personnel management and branch qualification no longer apply.
The officer’s breadth and depth of experience are the metrics that accurately reflect an officers potential for promotion
and opportunity to serve in positions of increasing responsibility. Officers should explore opportunities to serve in JIIM
assignments throughout their careers as a way to expand their overall knowledge base and increase their ability to lead
78                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

in the Joint Environment. Officers should concentrate their efforts on attaining and honing a broad skill-set by holding
key developmental positions that allow them to explore various aspects of their professional abilities.
   (2) Force Stabilization manning practices and policies are the cornerstone of a modular future force with a Joint
Expeditionary mindset. Army Aviation’s approach to Force Stabilization will mirror that of the rest of the Army. Refer
to para 1–9 of this publication for a detailed explanation and description of force stabilization and career development.
   c. Unique features of work in Army Aviation. Aviation officers employ aviation and ground units in support of land,
sea, joint and coalition operations. Aviation officers fight in all environmental conditions anywhere in the world. They
learn how to employ aviation assets through a rigorous series of schools and assignments. They must know the doctrine
and organization of aviation units as well as other combat and combat support arms units to effectively serve as part of
the joint combined arms team.
   d. Aviation officer tasks The most unique feature of Aviation officers is the fact that they are all aviators and must
develop technical proficiency in their aviator skills as well as function as unit leaders. They must first master the
weapons platform before they master the organization. It is in the Army’s best interest to retain these officers in
operational flying positions as long as possible to gain experience and competency in technical and tactical skills. For
this reason, Congress changed the Aviation Career Incentive Act (ACIA) in 1989 to require that aviators serve their
initial utilization tours in Aviation career fields.
   (1) Aviation Branch officer.
   (a) Areas of concentration (AOC).
   1. Aviation, General (15A). This code identifies positions for Aviation lieutenants and captains who have not yet
completed a CCC. This AOC identifies aviation officers from accession through the Basic Officer Leader Course
(BOLC), the Initial Entry Rotary Wing (IERW) Course, and through graduation of a CCC.
   2. Aviation, Combined Arms Operations (15B). Officers in this AOC are graduates of a branch CCC. They lead
sections and platoons, command companies, battalions and brigades, and serve as staff officers in battalion and higher
echelon units. As staff officers, they plan, direct and control aviation units in concert with other members of the
combined arms team. Aviation Combined Arms Operations officers lead, command, serve as staff officers and perform
critical functions in the operating force (MTOE) units.
   3. Aviation, All-Source Intelligence (15C/35). All-Source Intelligence Aviators will be qualified both as Aviation
and Military Intelligence officers. Branch code 35 (Military Intelligence) is assigned to Aviation officers upon
successful completion of the Military Intelligence Officer Tactician course (MIOTC) and the Military Intelligence
Captain Career Course (MICCC). These aviators are qualified and encouraged to alternate between Aviation and
Military Intelligence assignments. Officers in this AOC typically lead platoons and command companies within Aerial
Exploitation Battalions (AEB) engaged in the employment of Special Equipment Mission Aircraft (SEMA) in support
of tactical and strategic intelligence information collection. Officers that serve in AEBs must have successfully
completed the Fixed Wing Multi-Engine Qualification Course (FWMEQC) and SEMA course to attain the appropriate
SI (RC–12 Aircraft) for the unit of assignment or completed EO/RC–7 Aircraft Qualification Course. These officers
also serve as staff officers in battalion or higher echelon units. They serve as S–2s and All-Source Intelligence officers
who oversee the total intelligence cycle and intelligence and electronic warfare operations for the division, corps and
echelons above corps intelligence requirements. These officers also direct and control the training, safety, administra-
tion, communication, supply, maintenance, transportation and force protection activities of SEMA units. All-Source
Intelligence Aviators gain critical experience by performing a wide variety of critical and high-risk duties at each grade
for a total of at least 18 months (plus or minus 6 months). In addition to leading platoons, commanding companies and
battalions, employing Special Electronic Mission Aircraft (SEMA) in support of tactical, operational and strategic
intelligence missions, these aviators can perform duties as staff officers in aviation units as well as have the ability to
be assigned in any 35D position. Officers selected for AOC 15C/35 (All-Source Intelligence Officer) attend the
MIOTC and the Military Intelligence Captain Career Course. The AOC 15C officers attend the 20-week MIOTC/
MICCC and receive training as a 35 (All-Source Intelligence Officer). They attend the FWMEQC before or after the
MICCC with appropriate follow-on Aircraft specific training. Officers that do not attend the FWMEQC will be
designated as 15B35.
   4. Aviation Logistics (15D). The area of concentration 15D has been deleted (see para 14–3c(1)(c)). Officers
desiring to pursue a maintenance focused career should make every effort to attend the Aviation Maintenance Leaders
Course (AMLC) and the Aviation Maintenance Managers Course (AMMC) prior to taking command.
   (b) Skill identifiers. Skill identifiers (SI) help to further refine the assignment process by designation of aircraft
qualification or other specialty skill. When combined with an AOC, they become career management fields (CMFs),
which personnel managers use in the assignment process. See DA Pam 611–21 table 4–1 for a complete list of
identifiers.
   (c) Other Aviation participation programs. Aviation officers may participate in the following voluntary programs, if
qualified:
   1. Army Special Operations Aviation, ARSOA.
   2. Army Astronaut Program. (Contact Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC–IC–T))
   3. Degree Completion Program (see AR 621–1, chap 5).
                                              DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            79

   4. Army Fellowships and Scholarships (see AR 621–7).
   5. The Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP), also known as School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS)
(apply during ILE attendance).
   6. Advanced civilian schooling (ACS) (also see AR 621–1, chap 3).
   7. United States Military Academy (USMA) Instructor Program (also see AR 621–1, chap 3).
   8. Training with industry. The TWI program provides officers the opportunity to train with selected civilian
companies to gain knowledge of industrial procedures, policies and technologies (see AR 621–1, chap 6).
   9. Experimental Test Pilot Training Program. This is an intense eleven-month course at the Naval Test Pilot School,
Patuxent River, MD. Branch commissioned officers will transfer to the Army Acquisition Corps for the remainder of
their career. Applicants must be active component rated aviators in the rank of captain and have an academic
background that includes the completion of college math and hard-science courses with above average grades. (Contact
DA AHRC (AHRC–OPE–V))
   (2) Aviation warrant officer (AWO). Aviation warrant officers are adaptive technical experts, leaders, trainers, and
advisors. Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, they plan, administer,
manage, maintain, and operate in support of the full range of Army, Joint, Combined, and Coalition operations.
Personifies the warrior ethos in all aspects, from warfighting, to training, maintaining, and managing combat systems.
The fully qualified Aviation warrant officer advances in different Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) through

transport missions. Pilots and commands fixed-wing aircraft under tactical and non-tactical conditions. Responsible for
transporting passengers, mail or cargo for military purposes while operating aircraft during all types of meteorological
conditions during day and night. When appropriately equipped, performs military intelligence and aerial radio relay
missions. These officers must maintain aircrew training manual (ATM) requirements in appropriate aircraft.
   e. Women in Army Aviation. All Aviation AOCs and most Aviation skills are open to women. Female aviators have
career opportunities equal to those of their male counterparts except for positions with a direct combat probability code
(DCPC) of P1. This restricts females from assignments in Special Operations Aviation (SOA). This restriction is based
on the mission profile of these aircraft. Women aviators accessed into Aviation branch before 28 April 1993 are not
required to transition into scout/attack aircraft but may volunteer to compete for scout/attack aircraft transition training
and assignments in attack units. Women accessed into Aviation branch after 28 April 1993 are considered eligible to
fill aviation training and assignment needs.
11–2. Characteristics required of Aviation officers
   a. Unique attributes. The warrior ethos must be at the heart of every Army Soldier. It is the warrior ethos that
transforms an aviator into an Air Warrior. Aviation officers must be proactive leaders who do not hesitate to tackle any
challenge and get into the fight. The warrior ethos embodies personal courage, commitment to duty, and loyalty to unit.
Army Values also form the very identity of the Army. They are nonnegotiable and apply to every aviator at all times
and in all situations. The seven values that guide all leaders and the rest of the Army are Loyalty, Duty, Respect,
Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage. Leaders must believe in them, model them in personal
actions, and teach others to accept them. Officers require a demonstrated mastery of branch, functional area(s), or MOS
specific skills, and grounding in these seven values to successfully lead Soldiers in the 21st century.
   b. Unique skills. Army Aviators are immersed in an increasingly complex battlefield environment. The network-
centric C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) environ-
ment demands intellectually agile leaders, who can see, comprehend, make accurate decisions and clearly communicate
them during the full spectrum of aviation operations in all environments.
   c. Unique actions. As defined in FM 6–22, “Leadership is influencing people — by providing purpose, direction,
and motivation — while operating to accomplish the mission and improving the organization.” Leadership is crucially
important in Aviation organizations. Due to the small size of Aviation units and the considerable lethality of their
weapons systems, poor leadership can quickly result in catastrophic loss of life and equipment. Aviation leaders must
be multiskilled, creative, and imbued with the Army Values and the warrior ethos so that they can be more agile,
adaptive, self aware and lifelong learners ready to provide positive leadership daily. Aviation Branch wants men and
women who consider themselves leaders, are excited to continuously learn and hone their leadership skills and are
prepared to operate as part of the full spectrum JIIM team.
11–3. Aviation Branch Active Army officer
   a. Officer qualification and development. See the AA development model figure 11–1. The three domains of leader
development — Professional Military Education (institutional training), Operational assignments and Self-development
— define and engage a continuous cycle of education, training, selection, experience, assessment, feedback, reinforce-
ment and evaluation which helps to encourage officer development throughout career progression.
   (1) Professional Military Education. The institutional Army (schools and training centers) is the foundation for
lifelong learning.
   (2) Operational assignments. Upon completion of most institutional training, leaders are ideally assigned to opera-
tional assignments. This operational experience provides them the opportunity to use, hone and build on what they
learned through the formal education process. Experience gained through on-the-job training in a variety of challenging
assignments and additional duties prepares officers to lead and train Soldiers in garrison and ultimately in combat. The
officer’s breadth and depth of experience are the metrics that accurately reflect potential for promotion and service in
positions of increased responsibility. Assignments that increase an officers overall technical and tactical knowledge and
improve their understanding of combined and JIIM operations will also help to broaden the skill sets that will make
them more effective combat leaders.
   (3) Self-development. Leaders must commit to a lifetime of professional and personal growth in order to stay at the
cutting edge of their profession. Every officer is ultimately responsible for his or her self-development.
   b. Lieutenant. Lieutenants must meet the requirements outlined in AR 611–110 for entry into the Aviation Branch.
   (1) Professional Military Education. All newly commissioned Aviation lieutenants attend BOLC III and IERW
training at the United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE), Fort Rucker, AL. Training is conducted
in three phases. Phase I is the aviation specific phase of BOLC. Phase II is Initial Entry Rotary Wing training,
conducted under the Flight School XXI model. Phase III is the completion of BOLC, which combines the student’s
recently acquired Aviation skills with company level tactics and combined arms training. Phases I and III include
training on general military subjects such as leadership, weapons, combined arms operations, physical training and
fieldcraft training. Students will also complete Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) and Dunker Training
during Phase I. IERW, or flight school, consists of aeromedical factors, basic flight, aerodynamics, meteorology,
instrument flight and combat skills training. Training is conducted from the preflight through the primary and
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                               81

instrument qualification phases in the TH–67 aircraft. Basic combat skills are then trained in an advanced aircraft, such
as the AH–64D Longbow Apache, UH–60L/M Blackhawk and CH–47D/F Chinook. When an officer completes all
phases of BOLC and flight training, they are awarded the Basic Army Aviator Badge. Due to the time intensive initial
training requirements of Flight School XXI and Aviation’s compressed career timeline, follow-on schooling en route to
their next assignment (for example, Airborne, Air Assault, Ranger, and Cavalry Leaders Course) will only be approved
by exception.
   (2) Operational assignments. Junior officers initially assigned to a CONUS installation will be stabilized at their first
installation for an extended period of time that allows for branch advancement to the rank of captain. This initial
extended tour may include hardship tours or attendance at leader development schools (TDY or PCS) but in each case
the officer should return to their Stabilization installation. See chapter 1–9. Lieutenants should serve at the platoon and
company level to gain troop leading and flight experience. The officer will concentrate on planning and executing the
tactics, techniques and procedures specific to their weapons platform and unit mission. The single-most important
assignment consideration for personnel managers and commanders is ensuring that the new lieutenant is assigned to a
job which will allow the officer adequate opportunity to develop flight experience and troop leading skills. Lieutenants
should serve 18–24 months in a platoon leader position. Due to the length of flight school, this may overlap into the
officer’s first year as a captain. Promotions will not automatically alter positions. Promotion from lieutenant to captain
while still serving in an Operational assignment such as Platoon Leader will not be a negative consideration when
determining the officer’s future potential for promotion. The overall goal is for an officer to gain as much flight and
leadership experience as possible prior to moving to another operational assignment.
   (3) Self-development. All officers should be afforded every opportunity to achieve a total of 500 flight hours and
qualification as a pilot-in-command (PC) prior to attendance of the AVCCC or CCC equivalent. A lieutenant’s focus
should be to refine troop leading, aviator, tactical, logistic (maintenance and supply), force protection (risk manage-
ment) and administrative skills. The key milestone in a lieutenant’s development should be attaining PC status. In
doing so, lieutenants will acquire much needed technical and tactical experience, which will serve them well in future
assignments. For example, Company Commanders are expected to set the standard for other pilots within their
company. Being a PC allows that commander to be in-the-fight and to direct critical assets where needed. Lieutenants
should also strive to obtain key training experiences that enhance normal garrison training, including but not limited to:
Combat Training Center (CTC) rotations, joint and combined exercise deployments, and worldwide contingency
operations. To successfully compete for promotion to captain, an officer must possess a thorough knowledge of
aviation tactics and principles and have obtained a baccalaureate degree. Officers may take advantage of pre-
commissioning educational incentives such as incurring an additional three year ADSO in exchange for the opportunity
to pursue a master’s degree later in their careers. Officers should contact AHRC prior to branch selection for program
details.
   c. Captain. A captain must successfully complete a branch Captain Career Course.
   (1) Professional Military Education.
   (a) Captain Career Course. Captains must earn a baccalaureate degree prior to attending a CCC. Additionally, in
accordance with Vice Chief of Staff Army guidance, officers should have flown at least 500 hours and earned Pilot in
Command status for their particular airframe before they are allowed to attend a CCC. Officers will attend a branch
CCC between their fifth and eighth year of commissioned service. Aviation officers may attend other branch’s CCC.
The branch phase of the Aviation Captain Career Course (AVCCC) is 21 weeks. It prepares officers to serve as
combined arms experts, company commanders, battalion/brigade staff officers, and Brigade Aviation Element (BAE)
officers assigned and organic to the ground Brigade Combat Team (BCT). The AVCCC meets established prerequisites
for Total Operational Flying Duty Credit (TOFDC) assignments. Aviators earn one month of TOFDC for each month
spent at AVCCC. Aviators attending another branch Captain Career Course do not earn TOFDC.
   (b) Military Intelligence Captain Career Course. Officers selected for AOC 15C/35 (All-Source Intelligence Officer)
attend the Military Intelligence Officer Transition Course (MIOTC) if they did not attend Military Intelligence BOLC.
The AOC 15C officers attend the 20-week MICCC and receive training as a 35 (All-Source Intelligence Officer). They
attend the FWMEQC before or after the MICCC with appropriate follow-on Aircraft specific training. Officers that do
not attend the FWMEQC will be designated as 15B35.
   (c) Aviation Maintenance. With a Battalion and or Brigade Commander’s approval, officers may request attendance
at the Aviation Maintenance Leader’s Course (AMLC) and the Aviation Maintenance Management Course (MMC).
They can also request to continue their military education by attending the Maintenance Test Pilot (MTP) course.
Aviation Maintenance officers will serve in Aviation Support Battalions (ASB) as production control officers or
platoon leaders in Maintenance or Shops platoons in the Aviation Support Company (ASC). They can also work as
Battalion and Brigade S4/logistics officers, as well as command Aviation Maintenance Companies (AMC). Additional
opportunities exist for selected personnel at Army Material Command (AMC) depots and in Aviation Classification and
Repair Activity Depots (AVCRADs). An Aviation maintenance officer can serve as a commander or staff officer at
battalion or higher-level units, to include Army Depots, ACOM/ASCC logistics offices, the Army Staff (ARSTAF) and
Joint Staffs. As staff officers, they must plan and direct aviation logistics operations in situations ranging from low to
high intensity conflicts. Commissioned Aviation Maintenance officers work closely with the Warrant Officer Aviation
Maintenance Officer to manage the maintenance, removal, installation, modification, overhaul and repair of aircraft
82                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

equipment systems and subsystems. These subsystems range from engines to airframes, instruments, rotor systems,
powertrain, armament, avionics, electrical and fuel systems. These officers develop procedures for aircraft maintenance,
and also direct the issuance and disposal of aircraft, the requisitioning, receipt, inspection, storage, distribution and
disposal of aircraft supplies, repair parts and equipment. They must understand both air and ground logistics systems in
order to be effective. Aviation Maintenance officers are excellent candidates for the Experimental Test Pilot Training
program. Officers wishing to pursue a maintenance focused career path should focus on key developmental jobs that
will add to their overall maintenance experience and depth of knowledge.
   (2) Operational assignments. Captains are utilized as the senior leader at the company level. Their primary goal is to
successfully command a TOE/TDA company/detachment or Aviation Maintenance Company for 18–24 months.
Captains can hold platoon leader positions in units authorized captains as platoon leaders. These units include the
Aviation Support Company (ASC) and ARSOA units. Captains also fill key staff positions at the battalion and brigade
level, in addition to positions within the Brigade Aviation Element (BAE), Air Defense Airspace Management
(ADAM) Cell, CTC/OC positions and SGI/Instructor positions at the Proponent and USMA. Even when assigned to
staff positions, captains should continue to hone their direct leadership skills, build flight experience, and achieve/
maintain pilot in command status.
   (3) Self-development. Captains should gain an in-depth understanding of aviation brigade operations, combined
arms operations, aircraft maintenance and Army Airspace Command and Control (A2C2). Aviation captains should
dedicate time to a professional reading program to gain a historical perspective on solutions to tactical and leader
challenges. Captains should strive for the same qualitative leadership building experiences as during their lieutenant
years: Combat Training Center rotations; joint and combined exercises, and deployment on real-world contingency
operations. Performing the challenges at the captain/Commander level will greatly enhance the officer’s tactical and
technical skills, as well as build critical flight experience. Captains should strive to meet the requirements for award of
the Senior Aviator Badge by the time they are promoted to major. Captains should broaden their understanding of war-
fighting through extension courses and independent study. Commanders should maintain healthy officer professional
development programs within their units.
   (a) Aviation captains can request to attend the Joint Air-Ground Operations School (AGOS) at Hurlbert Field, FL,
or the Cavalry Leaders Course at Fort Knox, KY. If attendance at AGOS is desired, the three-week Joint Air Tasking
Order Process Course (JATOPS) located at Hurlbert Field, FL is recommended for officers who are required to
understand and apply airspace command and control and the application of the Air Tasking Order. The two-week Joint
Firepower Control Course (JFCC) at Nellis AFB, Nevada, is more suited to an understanding of the application of joint
fire support systems.
   (b) Officers may receive ACS/EGSP participation if career timeline permits or if necessary for a functional area or
special assignment (for example, Army Acquisition Corps, Foreign Area Officer or USMA instructor). See chap
3–5b(4) for specifics.
   (c) Functional Designation Board (FDB). Functional Designation Boards meet to consider officers in their seventh
year of service for designation into other functional areas or Branches. Officers will submit their top three choices at
the seven year mark. Officers receive a new career manager upon selection by the FDB for a different branch or
functional area. Only a limited number of Aviators will be given a functional area or branch outside of Aviation,
usually based on specific aviation skill requirements in select FAs. Aviation officers will not participate in the Army’s
4 Year Functional Designation Boards.
   (d) An aviator migrating out of Maneuver, Fires and Effect functional category will serve in their new functional
category for the remainder of their career. Unless an officer has met their initial twelve year Aviation Career Incentive
Pay (ACIP) gate, migration out of Maneuver, Fires and Effects (with the exception of functional area (FA) 51,
Acquisition) will result in termination of ACIP, as these officers will no longer be managed or assigned against
aviation operational assignments. Therefore, repetitive operational flying assignments through the grade of captain are
critical in order for officers to make their first ACIP gate. If an aviator has not met their first ACIP gate, they will lose
ACIP beyond the 12th year of aviation service unless they are assigned to aviation operational positions. HQDA
waivers are possible for this situation, but highly unlikely for those aviators who FD out of Branch 15 or FA 51 (Army
Acquisition Corps). Aviators who remain in MF&E will continue to serve in operational aviation assignments. See
additional sections in this pamphlet and AR 611–110 for a complete description of each FD and associated skills.
   (e) FD Board appeals and branch transfers. If an officer does not receive their desired functional designation during
their seven year board, they may request a FD appeal within 180 days of the results being released by HQDA. U.S.
Army Human Resources Command conducts an appeal board every quarter. If an officer is outside of the 180 day FD
appeals time frame, then they can request a branch transfer into a FD. This is only after their four-year and seven-year
boards and after the 180 days appeals time frame.
   (4) Army Acquisition Corps (AAC). Between the 7th and 8th year of service select officers are accessed into the
AAC by a HQDA selection board. Aviators accessed into AAC do not compete for Aviation battalion or brigade
commands. Instead, they compete for lieutenant colonel and colonel level product, project and program manager
positions. Officers accessed into the AAC are re-designated with functional area (FA 51). Accession into FA 51 is
based on the same criteria as mentioned above (officer preference, Army needs, training and background, and officer
                                               DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                              83

skills). Again, Aviation Branch will only assess enough aviators into the AAC to meet Army Aviation Acquisition
requirements.
   (5) Army Special Operations Aviation. Officers who are interested in joining the Army Special Operations Aviation
(ARSOA), 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), should begin early in their lieutenant years to
accumulate as much flight experience as possible. The ARSOA recruiters focus their recruiting efforts on experienced
captains with solid leadership and flight experience. Interested captains should pursue company command as soon as
possible following the Captain Career Course.
   d. Major. Majors will complete the Intermediate Level Education (ILE) course, a sister-service institution (Navy,
Marine or Air), the Joint Army Warfighting School (JAWS) or Schools in Other Nations (SON) before they enter the
primary zone of consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
   (1) Professional Military Education. Following ILE, some officers are selected to attend the School of Advanced
Military Studies (SAMS). Those officers selected for the SAMS must serve an initial utilization tour as a plans/
assistant officer for DCS, G–3/5/7 on Division or Corps staffs.
   (2) Operational assignments. Majors should serve in one of the following assignments for 18–24 months: BAE,
ADAM Cell, Battalion Staff (AA/RC and Active Duty) or major level command of a TOE/TDA aviation unit such as
an Aviation Support Company (ASC) which requires completion of the Maintenance Leaders Course (AMLC) and the
Aviation Maintenance Managers Course (AMMC) and ARSOA units. Individuals selected and assigned as a BAE or
ADAM Cell staff officer will serve in positions organic to the Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), as the aviation subject
matter expert for the BCT Commander. They will provide the critical linkage with the BCT’s supporting Combat
Aviation Brigade (CAB) to facilitate the most efficient tactical employment of aviation assets in the BCT’s maneuver
battlespace. Serving in a similar position at a higher level also satisfies this intent. Aviation majors serve in TOE and
TDA units and other assignments to include but not limited to: Observer Controller/ Evaluator (OC/E) at a Combat
Training Center, RC advisor, USAREC staff, USMA faculty and staff, service school instructors, ARSTAF, joint staff
and branch/functional area generalist positions. Majors should seek key developmental assignments that assist them in
promotion and create the qualities of a fully multifunctional, expeditionary officer, either in the Aviation Branch or in a
functional area. Majors should seek a field grade joint duty assignment once tactical and technical experiences have
been attained.
   (3) Self-development. Majors should focus self-developmental efforts on acquiring expertise in organizational
leadership techniques, operations at Division level and above, and aviation logistical support operations. Their self-
development must focus on JIIM and combined arms operations. This can be accomplished through correspondence
courses or institutional training. Majors should devote time to a professional reading program. Officers may take
advantage of the Expanded Graduate School Program and attend advanced civilian schooling (ACS) if the follow-on
assignment requires an advanced degree. Many Advanced Degree Programs are available in order for officers to obtain
a graduate degree. Aviation majors will likely serve in operational flying positions after being away from the cockpit
for some time due to schooling and required staff positions. Therefore, their self-development should also be focused
on refreshing themselves with new aviation technologies in the cockpit. They should set the example for the younger
generation of officers by continuing to place a strong emphasis on their technical and tactical aviation proficiency.
Aviation majors in BR15 should strive to attain the Master Aviator Badge by the time they are promoted to lieutenant
colonel.
   e. Lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels should serve in an Aviation coded position for 12–24 months.
   (1) Professional Military Education. No specific military education requirements exist for lieutenant colonels. A
HQDA board determines selection for resident SSC or the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course.
Officers selected for CSL battalion command will attend the Army’s pre-command course at Fort Leavenworth, KS,
and the Aviation PCC at Fort Rucker, AL. Select TDA battalion command designees may also be slated for attendance
at the TRADOC PCC at Fort Jackson, SC. Battalion command designees who have special courts martial convening
authority will attend the Senior Officers Legal Orientation Course (SOLO) at Charlottesville, VA. A master’s degree is
strongly recommended, but is not required for promotion.
   (2) Operational assignments. Lieutenant colonels who successfully complete a CSL battalion level command may
remain competitive for brigade command and enjoy a higher potential for promotion to colonel and SSC selection.
Commands on the CSL are organized into four functional categories: Operations, Strategic Support, Recruiting and
Training, and Installation. Officers must complete the Aviation Maintenance Leaders Course (AMLC) and the Aviation
Maintenance Managers Course (AMMC) to Command an Aviation Support Battalion (ASB). Officers have the option
of selecting the category or categories in which they desire to compete for command, while declining competition in
other categories. The following assignments are not necessarily coded as Aviation, however they are considered key
developmental assignments: Lieutenant colonel positions at the Combat Training Centers, brigade/regiment/group XO,
division primary staff, corps assistant for DCS, G–3/5/7 or DCS, G–4, deputy assistant for DCS, G–3/5/7 or DCS, G–4,
operations officer for DCS, G–3/5/7, assistant plans officer for DCS, G–3/5/7, ROTC or recruiting duty, ACOM/
ASCC/DRU staff, ARSTAF, joint staffs, and selected AA/RC assignments. Performance in demanding assignments is a
prime consideration for promotion and school selection boards. Lieutenant colonels should also seek a joint duty
assignment. A field grade joint duty assignment is required for promotion to brigadier general.
84                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   (3) Self-development. Officers should continue to build warfighting, joint, expeditionary and functional area
expertise.
   f. Colonel. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is sustainment of warfight-
ing, training and staff skill, along with utilization of leadership, managerial and executive talents. The majority of
strategic level leaders in the Army are colonels. Colonels are expected to be multiskilled leaders — strategic and
creative thinkers; builders of leaders and teams; competent full spectrum warfighters; skilled in governance, statesman-
ship, and diplomacy; and understand cultural context and work effectively across it.
   (1) Aviation colonels are assigned by the Army’s Senior Leader Development Office. Colonels should serve 12-18
months in an Aviation assignment coded at the grade of colonel.
   (2) Professional Military Education. Although no specific mandatory military education requirement exists for
colonels, the primary professional development goal is completion of SSC. Resident or nonresident attendance at a
Senior Service College (SSC) also identifies those officers with exceptional promotion potential for service in positions
of increased responsibility. An HQDA board determines who attends the resident course and participates in the U.S.
Army War College Distance Education Course. Officers selected for CSL Brigade Command will attend the Army’s
PCC at Fort Leavenworth, KS; and the Aviation PCC at Fort Rucker, AL. Brigade Command selectees may also attend
the Senior Officers Legal Orientation Course (SOLO) at Charlottesville, VA. Officers selected as TSMs will attend the
Combat Developers Course at Fort Lee, VA and the Project Manager’s ACAT III Course (commonly known as the
PM’s Survival Course) at Fort Belvoir, VA. The ACAT III Course has several prerequisites. Officers selected for TSM
billets should contact their OPMD assignment officer to discuss requirements. After PCS arrival at Fort Rucker, TSMs
will also attend the Aviation PCC.
   (3) Operational assignments. The following example assignments, some not necessarily coded as Aviation are also
developmentally key: Joint Duty, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE) Chief of
Staff (Former Brigade Commander position); Corps-level officer for DCS, G–3/5/7 or Deputy Chief of Staff; Deputy
Assistant Commandant; Director of Training Development and Doctrine (DOTD); Director of Combat Developments
(DCD); Director of Evaluation and Standardization (DES); Director of Simulations (DOS); Director of Aviation
Proponency; colonel positions at the Combat Training Centers (CTCs); Aviation Center Logistics Command; USALLS;
ARSTAF, ACOM/ASCC/DRU staff, and Joint Staffs; and selected AA/RC assignments. HQDA centralized selection
boards for brigade level command select a small percentage of officers. Successful brigade level command marks
officers as qualified for increased responsibility at the highest levels in the Army and DOD. Commands filled by
officers on the CSL are organized into four functional categories: Operations, Strategic Support, Recruiting and
Training, and Installation.
   (4) Self-development. Self-development goals should focus on perfecting organizational level leadership skills, joint
and coalition operations, and theater level operations. An advanced degree is not required but is strongly recommended.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             85

   (2) Assignment Oriented Training (AOT) is the key element in development of a fully capable senior 151A.
Examples of AOT are: The Safety Officer Course (SOC), aircraft armament and Army logistics courses (Retail Supply
and Management Course, Logistics Management Development Course, Support Operations Course, Contracting Officer
Representative Course (COR) Logistics Assistance Representative (LAR) University at Corpus Christi Army Depot and
the Army Maintenance Manager’s Course). These courses should be scheduled to coincide with professional develop-
ment courses and or PCS. WO1s are no longer required to attend a MTP course prior to attending the Aviation

ful completion of USNTPS, Experimental Test Pilots will serve a minimum of 24 months in an Experimental Test Pilot
utilization tour.
11–5. Aviation Branch Reserve Component officer
   a. General career development. Reserve Component (RC) Aviation officer development objectives and qualifica-
tions parallel those planned for their Active Army counterparts.
   b. Development opportunities. The nature of the RC Soldier’s role as a “citizen Soldier” poses a unique challenge
for professional development. The RC officers are expected to follow AA officer development patterns as closely as
possible, except that RC officers have increased time windows to complete mandatory professional educational
requirements. Civilian career opportunities, military promotions and educational opportunities may force RC officers to
transfer between Army National Guard (ARNG) M–Day Units, United States Army Reserve (USAR) TPUs, Individual
Ready Reserve (IRR), IMA Program, and the Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) Programs. These transfers are often
hindered by geographical considerations, as well as a limited number of positions to serve with troops in leadership and
staff positions. Additionally, there may be occasions when NG officers will be transferred to the IRR or Army Reserve
officers to the trainees, transients, holdees, and students (TTHS) account while they complete mandatory educational
requirements. Such transfers are usually temporary and should not be seen as impacting negatively on the officer’s
career. The success of the RC officer is not measured by length of service in any one component or control group, but
by the officer’s breadth and depth of experience which are the metrics that accurately reflect an officers potential to
serve in positions of increasing responsibility. Officers should focus on job performance, as there are many paths that
define a successful career within the Aviation Branch.
   (1) Formal training. As RC officers simultaneously advance both civilian and military careers, they have less
available time than their AA counterparts to achieve the same military professional education levels. To minimize this
problem, RC courses are specifically tailored to reduce the resident instruction time. This cannot be accomplished with
graduate flight training courses.
   (2) Assignments. The Adjutants General of the 50 States, 3 U.S. Territories, and the District of Columbia (DC)
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           93

primarily manage officers in the ARNG. The Human Resource Command-St. Louis and the United States Army
Reserve Command manage officers in the Army Reserve.
   (3) Professional development through the military schooling system. The Aviation RC officer plays an important
role in the Aviation Branch mission. RC officers normally develop through one area of concentration (AOC) and in
one FA. However, a lack of suitable positions in a geographic area may lead to some RC officers becoming qualified
in multiple AOCs or FAs. The RC officers must attain educational levels commensurate with their grade and
assignment, using resident and nonresident instruction options. RC officers have increased windows to complete
military education requirements. (For further guidance on RC career progression, see chap 7.)
   (4) RC lieutenant. Lieutenants must meet the requirements outlined in AR 611–110 for entry into the Aviation
Branch.
   (a) Professional Military Education. RC officers commissioned into the Aviation Branch attend BOLC and IERW
with their AA counterparts. RC officers must have completed this training by their 2nd year of commissioned service.
   (b) Operational assignments. Lieutenants should serve as a section/platoon leader in an Aviation assignment. A
lieutenant normally serves at company level to gain troop leading and flight experience.
   (c) Self-development. Lieutenants focus on gaining and refining troop leading, aviator, joint and combined arms
tactics, logistics and administrative skills. Effective 1 October 1995, a baccalaureate degree from an accredited
institution is required for promotion to captain or higher.
   (5) RC captain.
   (a) Professional Military Education. Captains must complete a CCC. Options are as follows: CCCAC (Captain
Career Course AA curriculum), CCC–RC (RC curriculum), or the four-phase CCC-USAR.
   (b) Operational assignments. The officer should serve in one of the following branch developmental positions for 18
to 36 months; Successful company/detachment command of a TOE/TDA unit or successful tour as a platoon leader in
platoons that authorize captains as platoon leaders. These include intermediate and higher level maintenance (ASC)
units. As a captain, RC Aviation officers should aggressively seek a company command. They also serve as staff
officers at the Battalion and Group/Brigade levels.
   (c) Self-development. Captains should broaden their understanding of war fighting through extension courses and
independent study. Captains should gain an in-depth understanding of Joint and combined arms operations.
   (6) RC major. To achieve branch leadership developmental standards at this level, majors must have enrolled in the
Intermediate Level Education (ILE) course prior to 18 years time in service. They must have completed 50 percent of
ILE to be eligible for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
   (a) Professional Military Education. Most RC officers will complete the ILE common core via TASS or an
upgraded Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) program. Some RC officers will continue to attend the ILE in
residence at Fort Leavenworth, some will depart upon completion of the Core Course and others will remain for the
Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course (AWOC).
   (b) Operational assignments. RC Aviation majors serve as company commanders, and in staff assignments. These
staff positions are at the Battalion, Group, Brigade, HQDA or Joint Staff levels. Some majors also serve as instructors
or staff at Reserve Forces Service Schools. Officers should serve in one of the following branch developmental
positions for 18 to 36 months; Battalion Executive Officer or S3, Battalion Support Operations Officer, Brigade S3,
Successful major level (04) command of a TOE/TDA aviation unit, Branch Chief at an Army National Guard Aviation
Training Site (AATS), Aviation Branch coded (15) or branch/functional area generalist positions at the HQDA or Joint
Staff levels, Group or Brigade primary staff (S1, S2 or S4), Aviation Branch coded (15) or branch/function in a
generalist position at Joint, ARCOM or GOCOM staff levels, Reserve Forces service school instructor or staff,
Aviation staff officer at the ACOM/ASCC/DRU level, and Brigade Aviation Element (BAE).
   (c) Self-development. Self-development efforts should focus on becoming an expert in all aspects of aviation
support operations, including joint and combined arms operations. These objectives can be accomplished through
correspondence courses or institutional training. Majors should also devote time to a professional reading program to
broaden their Joint and combined arms operations perspectives.
   (7) RC lieutenant colonel. In order to qualify for promotion to colonel, RC officers must have completed ILE.
   (a) Operational assignments. RC lieutenant colonels should seek a battalion level command. Upon successful
completion of a command, RC Aviation lieutenant colonels serve in staff positions at group/brigade, major subordinate
commands, U.S. Army Reserve General Officer Command (GOCOM), or Joint Staff levels. Some RC officers may
also serve as Reserve Forces Service School instructors or staff. Officers should serve in one of the following branch
developmental positions for 18 to 36 months; Successful command of a TOE/TDA aviation battalion or equivalent
sized aviation unit, completion of a resident or nonresident ILE, Aviation Branch coded (15) or branch/functional area
generalist positions at the ACOM/ASCC/DRU, GOCOM or Joint Staff levels, Group or Brigade Staff, Division or
Branch Chief, USAAWC, USARC, NGB, or USAALS, AGR Title 10/Title 32 position at USAAWC or USAALS (in a
lieutenant colonel level position), Deputy Commander of an Army National Guard Aviation Training Site (AATS),
   (b) Self-development. Self-development goals should be to continue building Joint war-fighting expertise. An
advanced degree is preferred but optional unless required for a specific assignment.
   (8) RC colonel.
94                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   (a) Professional Military Education. Completion of SSC by resident or correspondence course is a primary profes-
sional development goal.
   (b) Operational assignments. Some, but not all, RC officers serve as group or brigade commanders. Most serve in
staff positions requiring their Aviation experience at the GOCOM or Joint Staff levels. Aviation RC colonels should
serve in one of the following branch developmental positions for 18 to 36 months: Successful command of a TOE/
TDA Aviation Group or Brigade; Completion of a resident or nonresident SSC; USAAWC; Army or Joint Level Staff;
Aviation Branch coded (15) or branch/functional area generalist positions at the major Subordinate Commands;
GOCOM or Joint Staff levels, AGR Title 10/Title 32 positions at USAAWC or USAALS (in a colonel level position);
Command of an Army National Guard Aviation Training Site (AATS); Division Chief of Aviation and Safety Division;
National Guard Bureau (NGB); and State Army Aviation Officer (SAAO).
   (c) Self-development. Self-development goals should continue to build on war fighting expertise. An advanced
degree is preferred but optional unless required for a specific assignment.
   c. Life-cycle development model. The RC life-cycle development model is shown at figure 11–6, below.
                                 Figure 11–6. The RC Aviation Branch Developmental Model
11–6. Aviation Reserve Component warrant officer
   a. Preferences. Reserve Component Aviation warrant officer (AWO) development objectives and qualifications
basically parallel those planned for their AA counterparts.
   b. Precedence. As with the RC commissioned officer, the RC warrant officer’s role as a “citizen Soldier” also poses
a unique challenge for professional development. RC warrant officers are expected to follow AA WO Development
patterns as closely as possible. RC warrant officers also have increased windows to complete mandatory educational
requirements.
   (1) Formal training. As “citizen Soldiers,” RC warrant officers simultaneously advance civilian and military careers.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           95

To minimize this impact, the USAAWC and the Warrant Officer Career Center (WOCC) have developed RC courses
specifically tailored to reduce the resident instructional time.
   (2) Critical Life Cycle assignments. RC AWOs are managed in the same manner as the RC commissioned officer.
   c. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory. RC AWOs must attain educational levels commensurate with their
grade and assignment, using resident and nonresident instruction options. RC warrant officers also have increased
windows to complete military education requirements. As Aviation Branch aircraft systems increase in complexity and
capability, a corresponding increase occurs in tactical employment capabilities. The need for AWOs who are highly
competent in operations, maintenance, safety, training and tactical employment of complex aircraft systems is critical to
the success of the Aviation Branch.
   (1) Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) qualification and development
   (a) WO1. After completing the WOCS, WO1s attend their IERW Course and WOBC. The WO1 appointments are
contingent upon successfully completing WOBC. These officers are basic level, technically and tactically focused
officers who perform the primary duties of leaders and operators. They provide direction, guidance, resources,
assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. WO1s primarily support levels of
operations from team through battalion, requiring interaction with all Soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide
leader development, mentorship, and counsel to enlisted Soldiers and NCOs. WO1s should focus their efforts in
becoming technically and tactically competent in the aircraft and achieving Pilot in Command status. Typical company
level additional duties include ALSE, and Armament officers
   (b) CW2. The CW2s are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and
position. The CW2s will complete the TRADOC mandated common core prerequisites for the Aviation Warrant
Officer Advanced Course (AWOAC) prior to becoming eligible for promotion to CW3. The CW2s serve as intermedi-
ate level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager,
maintainer, sustainer, and advisor. The CW2s provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision
necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. They primarily support levels of operations from team through
battalion, requiring interaction with all Soldier cohorts and primary staff. They provide leader development, mentor-
ship, advice, and counsel to NCOs and other officers. The RC AWOs have the option of resident or Distance Learning
(DL) training. The purpose of the AWOAC is to refresh and enhance common skills and leadership, update technical
and tactical training, and provide doctrinal changes and additional training as prescribed by the branch proponent. All
training is based on future needs and requirements. Upon reaching the rank of CW2, warrant officers should be certain
of what career track they desire to enter. The CW2s should concentrate on attaining Pilot in Command status, complete
career track training courses for Safety Officer, Instructor Pilot, Maintenance Officer, or Tactical Operations Officer,
and annual completion of all Aircrew Training Program (ATP) requirements towards attaining the Senior Army Aviator
badge. Typical company level assignments include; Pilot in Command, ALSE, Armament, Aviation Safety Officer,
Instructor Pilot, Maintenance Test Pilot, Experimental Test Pilot, and Tactical Operations Officer.
   (c) CW3. The CW3s serve as advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of
technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, and advisor. The CW3s provide direction, guidance,
resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. They primarily support levels
of operations from Troop/Company through Battalion, requiring interaction with all Soldier cohorts and primary staff.
They provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs and other officers. CW3s serve as senior
technical advisors to the company commander.
   (d) CW4. The CW4s are senior level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical
leader, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator and advisor. CW4s assigned to CW5 positions will attend their MOS
WOSSC prior to assignment. These officers serve at the field grade level as commanders and staff. They provide
direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for subordinates to perform their duties. The
CW4s primarily support battalion, brigade, division, corps, and echelons above corps operations. They provide leader
development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to NCOs and other officers. The CW4s serve as the senior technical
advisors to the battalion/squadron level commander. The RC CW4s not selected for CW5 may continue to serve in the
troop program unit unless otherwise prohibited by a retention board. Active Guard Reserve (AGR) CW5s will attend
the AA training.
   (e) CW5. These most senior aviation officers serve as commanders and staff. CW5s are master-level technical and
tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, manager, integrator, advisor, or any other particular
duty prescribed by branch. They provide direction, guidance, resources, assistance, and supervision necessary for
subordinates to perform their duties. These officers primarily support brigade, division, corps, echelons above corps,
and major command operations. They provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and counsel to other officers.
CW5s have special WO leadership and representation responsibilities within their respective commands.
   (2) Professional development. Aviation warrant officers are adaptive technical experts, leaders, trainers, and advi-
sors. Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, they plan, administer, manage,
maintain, and operate in support of the full range of Army, Joint, Combined, and Coalition operations. Warrant officers
are teachers, war-fighters, and developers of specialized teams of Soldiers. Throughout their career warrant officers
96                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

should continue their self-development, to include the pursuit of a specialty related graduate degree and/or advanced
industry certification programs. The following are the professional development goals for warrant officers:
   (a) Complete an associate’s degree in a MOS related degree program and/or an MOS related certification program
by eligibility for promotion to CW3.
   (b) Complete a baccalaureate degree in an MOS related degree program and/or an advanced certification program by
eligibility for promotion to CW4.
   (c) Complete a graduate degree in an MOS related degree program and/or a second advanced certification program
by eligibility for promotion to CW5. Aviation Reserve Component warrant officer MOS’s align with the Active Army
warrant officer MOSs. (See career development models figures 11–2, 11–3, 11–4, and 11–5.)
Chapter 12
Field Artillery Branch
12–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. The mission of the Field Artillery is to integrate and deliver lethal and non-lethal fires to enable joint
and maneuver commanders to dominate their operational environment across the spectrum of operations. To accom-
plish this unique mission the Field Artillery synchronizes and integrates Army fire support assets, multiple Joint assets
(Air Force, Navy, and Marine), Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational assets to effect the target(s) at the
designated place and time to ensure our enemies are overwhelmed by lethal and/or non-lethal firepower. The Field
Artillery combines the devastating effects of its own cannon, rocket, missile and acquisition systems with numerous
fire support assets across a variety of Combat Arms and Joint Services to maximize the fires that are brought to bear on
enemies of the United States.
   b. Proponent Information. The Field Artillery Proponency Office (FAPO) contact information: official mail can be
sent to Field Artillery Proponency Office, 1210 NW Schimmelpfenning Road, Suite 172, Fort Sill, OK 73503.
Telephone contact information is DSN 639–5220 or commercial (580) 442–5220.
   c. Functions.
   (1) Field Artillery officers are assigned directly to Army maneuver units (Infantry, Armor, Aviation, Ranger, Special
Forces) and to a variety of key positions in divisions and higher headquarters (to include Joint and Multinational
elements) to perform their unique and critical fires integration mission. Field Artillery officers plan, coordinate,
integrate, synchronize, and employ lethal and non-lethal assets and systems in support of Joint and combined arms
operations. These systems include air support, naval surface fires, attack aviation, mortars, electronic warfare, computer
network attack and information operations, space-based systems and Field Artillery target acquisition and weapon
systems.
   (2) Field Artillery officers plan and integrate information operations and electronic attack providing multifaceted or
alternative means to accomplish stated missions, sometimes eliminating the need to use lethal fires. This integration is
yet another unique mission Field Artillery officers engage in using a variety of assets from organic systems to more
complex national capabilities.
   (3) Field Artillerymen are experts in the application of both lethal and non-lethal fires, the component delivering the
munitions, the method of delivery, and they are proficient in all forms of operations: offense, defense, stability and
civil support. Artillerymen must fully understand maneuver operations to ensure synchronized, relevant and integrated
effects that enable success in an ever-changing operating environment. The future of the Field Artillery involves
mastery of synchronizing and integrating all sources of fires and effects, both lethal and non-lethal, in a global setting.
12–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all FA officers. All Field Artillery officers are warriors who must possess the moral
and intellectual and interpersonal characteristics that will enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders
capable of operating in joint, interagency, intergovernmental, multinational (JIIM) environments across the 21st century
spectrum of conflict. They must be grounded in Army Values and the warrior ethos and able to leverage capabilities
beyond just those found in the Army. Further explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0 and in
chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of the Field Artillery officers. Field Artillery officers advise commanders on how to
obtain the effects they desire with the systems available. Field Artillery officers also command Field Artillery firing
assets and systems and execute fires based on the commander’s intent.
   (1) Field Artillery officers must be subject matter experts in Field Artillery systems and in the integration of Joint
Fires to support Land/Maneuver Commanders. This knowledge includes practical experience in tactics, Combined
Arms Operations, Joint Operations, target acquisition and direct and indirect weapon systems. Officers gain this
knowledge through a logical sequence of continuous education, training and experience. Field Artillery officers must
possess and continually improve basic computer literacy skills as Field Artillery digitization and automation systems
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             97

increase in capabilities. Individual officers sustain knowledge through institutional training and education, duty in
operational assignments and continuous self-development.
   (2) Field Artillery officers must be talented, flexible and adaptive team players with the keen ability to work
together with other branches, services and people of all nations. They must be strong leaders, skilled in fire support
tactics, techniques and procedures, as well as all types of maneuver and support operations. The goal of all Field
Artillery officers is to gain an in-depth understanding (as the officer’s experience base broadens) of how to best employ
lethal and non-lethal assets in support of combined arms and JIIM operations. A Field Artillery officer must possess
the following skills:
   (a) Leader competency. Field Artillery officers must first and foremost be competent leaders as well as professional
Field Artillerymen.
   (b) Tactical skills referring to a clear understanding of war fighting tasks and missions.
   (c) Technical skills reflecting competence with specific duty requirements, equipment capabilities, and missions.
   (d) Interpersonal skills and confidence in communicating with people.
   (e) Decision-making and execution skills enabling mission accomplishment through adaptive and flexible thought
processes and proactive and innovative actions.
   (f) Conceptual skills enabling the understanding of new ideas and information.
   (g) Mental toughness is displayed by overcoming adversity. Self-discipline, initiative, judgment, confidence, intelli-
gence and fairness are key attributes a Field Artillery officer must possess.
   (h) Physical readiness and perseverance are required of Field Artillery officers as they may be selected to serve in a
variety of physically demanding roles in Field Artillery units and in positions as fire support officers in Ranger, Special
Forces, Infantry or Armor units. All Field Artillery officers lead through personal example and physical fitness is an
integral part of overall health fitness, stamina, military bearing and professional bearing. Physical fitness is a decisive
advantage in combat. All Field Artillery officers will strive for optimum physical fitness levels.
   c. Unique attributes. The Field Artillery requires dynamic, competent, well-trained leaders at all levels who
understand how other combat arms fight in order to effectively integrate Joint Lethal and non-Lethal Fires. Field
Artillery officers must possess the following attributes:
   (1) Leader attributes. Due to the Field Artillery’s dynamic and challenging mission, Field Artillery officers must be
mentally, physically and emotionally tough.
   (2) Possess Terrain sense. The ability to quickly "visualize" terrain is more than viewing the terrain and knowing the
range capability of weapon systems. It is the ability to visualize the battlefield and know how to optimize weapon
systems and the application of fires on that terrain. This includes understanding the military ramifications of urban
environments and complex terrain in regards to fire support.
   (3) A passion for precision. Field Artillery officers must be known for their attention to detail ensuring every fire
mission is on time and on target - nothing less is acceptable. Field Artillery officers control devastating firepower that
can and will annihilate anyone or anything at the point of impact. It is critically important that every call for fire a
Field Artillery officer initiates impacts at the exact time and exact place designated. Field Artillery officers must
maintain a passion for precision to ensure every request for fire is executed to exacting standards from target location,
to firing data computation, to weapon system munitions delivery.
   (4) Tenacity. An imaginative, driving intensity to complete a mission with available or procured assets. This
intensity represents the warrior spirit with an attitude to continuously accomplish all missions, with the highest priority
of supporting the combined arms commander and his Soldiers with relevant and responsive fires.
   (5) Audacity. The willingness to take reasonable risks to achieve an objective or goal. Display self-confidence in
word and action inspiring others to perform at high levels.
   (6) Physical confidence and health. A sense of physical well-being that enhances self-image. The ability to
participate in regular, rigorous and demanding physical activity; not just athletic ability.
   (7) Practiced, practical judgment. The ability to distinguish the vital from the petty, the immediate from casual and
truth from deception.
   (8) Discipline. Artillerymen must have strong self-discipline, unit discipline and institutional discipline. This disci-
pline leads to precision in execution, sustaining a keen attention to detail and sustaining the highest standards of
performance and accuracy with an end result of placing the right fires at the right place at the right time. This
discipline promotes trust and confidence in our ability to bring fires to bear in close combat - the single most important
mission of those we support in war.
   (9) Joint and Expeditionary mindset. All Field Artillery officers must possess a willingness to take the fight to the
enemies of our nation at the time and place of our choosing. This means Field Artillerymen must be ready to apply
Fire Support anywhere in the world, in either long or short duration requirements, and do so in a flexible and adaptive
manner. This application of Fire Support will include Joint, Coalition/Multinational and potentially Interagency or
Intergovernmental assets that will have to be synchronized and synergized to win our nation’s wars. Field Artillery
officers must gain in-depth knowledge in the discipline of Fire Support as well as learning the nuances of JIIM
planning. This life-long learning effort starts prior to commissioning and continues throughout the officer’s entire
98                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

career. The study of foreign cultures, language skills learned in college, numerous professional development opportuni-
ties provided throughout an Army career, and formal schooling (both military and civilian) are just a few of the
opportunities that will assist an officer in developing an Expeditionary mindset.
   d. Unique attributes of Fire Support officers. Fire Supporters must possess a combination of delivery system skills
and a passion to impose their will on the enemy with the application of both lethal and non-lethal fire support. Great
Fire Support officers are a unique blend of the best attributes of a Field Artilleryman and an Infantryman. Fire
Supporters must be "street fighters" with a rugged determination to close with and kill the enemy with a bayonet if
necessary... but also carry the ability to bring out the "big stick" for the maneuver force - which is the capability to
muster more firepower, in any weather, any time, any place, than is available in any Infantry or Armor force - the
devastating fires of the Field Artillery. The Fire Supporter must advise the maneuver force on what the Field Artillery
can do - and then do it with uncompromising exactness and determination.
   e. Unique features of Service in the Field Artillery Branch. Field Artillery officers are assigned directly to Army
maneuver units (Infantry, Armor, Aviation, Ranger, Special Forces) and to a variety of key positions in divisions and
higher headquarters (to include Joint and Multinational elements) to perform their unique and critical fires integration
mission. The following is a brief description of the nature of service that sets Field Artillery officers in operational
units apart from officers in other Branches or Functional Categories. Foremost, Field Artillery officers are Soldiers and
Combat Arms leaders. They work at every level of command and staff and perform the following functions/tasks:
   (1) Lead and command Field Artillery combat units and other type units at platoon, battery, battalion and brigade
levels.
   (2) Coordinate the fire support and targeting process in rapidly moving JIIM operations.
   (3) Create and formulate doctrine, organizations and equipment to accomplish the fire support mission worldwide.
   (4) Teach Field Artillery and fire support skills at service schools and Combat Training Centers.
   (5) Lead in positions requiring general combat skills such as staff officers in military headquarters and activities
requiring combat arms expertise.
   (6) Instruct at pre-commissioning programs, service schools and service colleges.
   (7) Train and advise the total Army Field Artillery force.
12–3. Officer development
   a. Officer Development Model. The OPMS officer development model is shifting away from a model that described
specific gates or assignments that an officer must serve in to progress successfully, to a model that focuses more on the
quality and range of experience. It describes that officers should seek training and assignments outside one’s normal
branch or functional area and develop skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. The revised model depicts initial
entry officers gaining branch technical and tactical skills in order to develop warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in battery/company level assignments. It highlights the need to gain JIIM experience, and to
continue self-development through civilian and military education. It defines the need for officers to develop expedi-
tionary competencies, such as regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy and statesmanship
as examples.
   b. Field Artillery officer development model. Field Artillery officer assignment patterns will vary depending on the
needs of the Army, professional development requirements, the type of manning system used in the unit where the
officer is assigned, and individual officer preferences. To fully understand officer career development patterns an
officer must first understand the Army’s Officer Development model is focused more on quality and range of
experience, rather than on specific gates or assignments required to progress as described in the previous paragraph.
   (1) Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for branch officers remaining in the Maneuver, Fires,
and Effects functional category. This requires developing an optimized field grade inventory in order to meet branch
authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support branch/FA generalist positions, and to provide majors with a
minimum of two years of key branch developmental time.
   (2) OPMS. Officers wanting more information on branch authorizations or inventory, by grade, are encouraged to
contact the branch proponency office or their AHRC assignment officer.
   c. Key life-cycle initiatives. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for Field Artillery Branch life-cycle function highlights
associated with OPMS are as follows:
   (1) Structure. The structure of Field Artillery organizations is transforming to become more agile, lethal, and
relevant based on new equipment capabilities and emerging global threats.
   (2) Acquire. Officers will continue to be accessed through USMA, ROTC, OCS, and WOCS. Accessions are based
on officer preference and the needs of the Army. The branch will also remain a recipient of branch detail officers from
other branches.
   (3) Distribute. Officers will be assigned to stabilized installation assignments under ARFORGEN.
   (4) Stabilized installation assignments. The majority of officers assigned to stabilized installations will be initial
entry from Field Artillery BOLC III. These officers will be initially assigned to an installation for approximately 36
months. During this time, the officer will complete their platoon leader and lieutenant years. They will then proceed to
the CCC and in most cases will return to a unit beginning the ARFORGEN cycle, where they will have an opportunity
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                                99

to serve in a key developmental position. The officers will gain tactical and operational experience that will benefit
them and the Army in future positions.
   (5) Deploy. Field Artillery officers are warriors who must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. All Field Artillery officers must remain fully deployable to accomplish missions across the full
spectrum of conflict whether assigned to operating force units with high levels of readiness or to a fixed site generating
force unit. The Global War on Terrorism makes it critically important that all Field Artillery officers are ready, willing,
and able to deploy on short notice to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests. This also includes
support to joint and multinational operations such as humanitarian missions, peacekeeping missions, stability opera-
tions, and civil support operations. Field Artillery officers must fully prepare themselves and their Families for this
important challenge.
   (6) Sustain. OPMS programs remain effective.
   (a) Promotion. Functional category based promotion boards remain viable. majors and above will compete for
promotion within their functional category.
   (b) Command. Lieutenant colonel and colonel level commanders will be listed on the CSL.
   (7) OER. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS. Captains, lieutenants, WO1s,
and CW2s have no senior rater block check (ACOM/COM/BCOM) on their OERs. These same officers will receive
counseling from their raters using DA Form 67–9–1. Current OER early masking remains in effect.
   (8) Develop. Officer development will occur through a sequence of progressive assignments in operating force units
and in generating force units. The goal is to professionally develop officers across a broad spectrum of operations that
can expertly employ fire support skills in support of Joint and combined arms operations that validate the doctrine,
training, and material development missions of the branch.
   (9) Separate. The officer separation process remains unchanged.
   d. Field Artillery lieutenant development.
   (1) Education.
   (a) After commissioning, Field Artillery officers will attend the Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC) II, a six-week
program focused on small-unit leadership experience, platoon leader skills and troop-leading procedures. BOLC II is
required for all branch officers after commissioning and precedes BOLC III. BOLC II is taught at two locations, Fort
Benning and Fort Sill. Field Artillery lieutenants will attend either of the two BOLC II locations.
   (b) FA BOLC III is a 15-week, 4-day course, that focuses on training Field Artillery lieutenants those skills required
of a competent, combat-ready company fires officer (or fire support officer), firing platoon leader and fire direction
officer.
   (c) While at FA BOLC III, lieutenants are encouraged to participate in the Ranger Indoctrination Program. This
program prepares officers to attend Ranger School by providing additional physical training and skills training related
to Ranger School. Officers who successfully complete this program will normally attend Ranger and Airborne School
after BOLC III. Ranger School is particularly beneficial to those officers desiring Fire Support positions in light
infantry, air assault, airborne, Ranger, or Special Forces units. However, all officers are encouraged to attend Ranger
School regardless of assignment, as it provides an excellent foundation in small unit tactics as well as being a
tremendous leadership experience that improves competence and confidence.
   (d) After graduation from BOLCIII, officers being assigned to Mechanized units with the Paladin and Bradley fire
integration support team (BFIST) Systems should be afforded the opportunity to attend the Paladin/BFIST Command-
er’s Course. This course is designed to familiarize lieutenants for assignments as Platoon Leaders, Fire Direction
Officers, and Fire Support Officers in Mechanized Units and will provide the officer specialized technical and tactical
knowledge necessary to maintain, operate and deploy the BFIST and M109A6 Paladin at section, platoon and battery
level. Perform crew level maintenance on the BFIST and Paladin. Supervise the maintenance and operation of the
Automatic Fire Control System and equipment associated with the BFIST.
   (e) Educational requirements. Before promotion to captain, a lieutenant must obtain a baccalaureate degree from an
accredited college or university. The officer can go before the captain’s promotion board and become promotable
without a degree, however, he must complete the degree before the actual captain promotion pin-on date and before
attending the CCC.
   (2) Assignment. After BOLC III, lieutenants can expect to be assigned to a tactical firing battalion at the battery
level for approximately 36 months, potentially in a stabilized or ARFORGEN unit in order to gain leadership
experience and to enhance technical and tactical competence and confidence. Ideally, lieutenants will experience duty
at the firing battery level as platoon leaders, XOs, or fire direction officers and then serve in company fire support
officer positions. Officers initially assigned to generating force units (also known as TDA units) will have an
opportunity for assignment to operating force units to gain experience and further develop tactical Field Artillery
specific skills.
   (a) Key developmental assignments. The KD assignments as a lieutenant are platoon leader, fire direction officer
and company fire support officer. Lieutenants should seek one or more of these key assignments as they are valuable
experiences in both leadership and fire support expertise. However, success in any of the following Field Artillery
100                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

Branch developmental assignments listed below (or combination of assignments) will provide excellent opportunities
for career development and future consideration for promotion to the rank of captain:
   1. Company fire support officer.
   2. Firing platoon leader.
   3. Fire direction officer.
   4. Battery XO.
   5. Battery operations officer.
   6. Support platoon leader.
   7. Other equivalent assignments as platoon leaders or key staff officers.
   (b) Self-development. Self-development during this phase should focus on tactical maneuver fundamentals, troop
leading procedures, leadership skills, organizational maintenance, resupply and logistics operations, basic administrative
operations, fundamentals of training management and other Field Artillery technical proficiency skills.
   (c) Desired experience. Professional development as a lieutenant should focus on developing platoon level leader-
ship skills, mastering basic Field Artillery technical and tactical competencies, and developing combined arms fire
support integration skills and competencies. Lieutenants should strive to have a working knowledge of close air support
operations (CAS).
   e. Field artillery captain development.
   (1) Education.
   (a) Field Artillery Captain Career Course (FACCC). It is desirable for Field Artillery officers to attend the FACCC
as soon as practical after promotion to captain, or as soon as possible after completing four years of AFCS and prior to
the seventh year of Federal commissioned service. Field commanders, in coordination with the U.S. Army Human
Resources Command (AHRC), will determine the best time for school attendance based on the needs of the Army, the
continued professional development requirements of the officer, and the officer’s individual preferences. The FACCC
consists of approximately 24 weeks of branch specific technical and tactical training with integrated common core
instruction. This training prepares officers to command at battery level, perform fire support coordination as a battalion
level fire support officer, and work as a key staff officer in a battalion or brigade. Selected captains may have an
opportunity to attend one of the other MF&E Career Courses, such as the Maneuver Career Course (MCCC). This
cross training option benefits officers of both branches. Selection is competitive and slots are generally reserved for
officers with strong performance in previous assignments.
   (b) Assignment Oriented Training (AOT). Captains will normally not be assigned to positions outside of an
operational unit until they have had the opportunity to obtain branch development goals that may include battery
command and battalion fire support officer experiences.
   1. Based on the officer’s CCC follow-on assignment, FA captains may have the opportunity to attend specialized
training that equips them with skill sets that may be required at the gaining unit. AOT courses could include any of the
following: Joint Fire Power Course, Joint Fires Observer Course, Operational Electronic Warfare Course, the Fire
Support Coordinator (FSCOORD) course.
   2. It is crucial that Field Commanders understand that by investing in additional training for their in-bound Field
Artillery officer, they will be gaining a trained officer who will immediately enhance the effectiveness of their unit.
Additional AOT will be approved for officers if seats are available and the gaining unit’s training/deployment time line
supports.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. The KD assignments for a Field Artillery captain include battery command and
battalion level Fire Support officer. Battery command provides the single most valuable leadership experience a captain
can obtain in troop leading and small unit operations. The battalion fire support officer assignment at the maneuver
battalion provides the most challenging assignments available in the discipline of fire support coordination and
integration with maneuver forces. These assignments provide a very credible developmental experience in the core skill
sets required of fire support coordinators, future Field Artillery battalion level commanders, and key field grade staff
officers. Captains should seek challenging assignments.
   (a) The goal of the Field Artillery Branch is to provide a battery command opportunity for all captains displaying
the competence required of a commander. However, battery command selection will remain competitive. Commanding
is a privilege, not a right. Field commanders will determine and select Field Artillery officers exhibiting the necessary
skills and experience to lead Soldiers as a battery commander. Officers who do not have a command opportunity will
be provided other branch developmental opportunities in other challenging positions that potentially lead to promotion.
Assignment as a battalion fire support officer, battalion fire direction officer, battalion assistant S3, or as a battalion
primary staff officer are some examples of superb career developmental assignments in addition to battery command.
   (b) Battery command length will vary based on mission requirements and can range between 12 and 18 months.
Field commanders will determine battery command length based on mission requirements. However, the goal for
battery command duration is 18 months.
   (c) A very small percentage of captains may have a second command opportunity. Second command opportunities
are usually reserved for commands that tend to present a unique and more diverse challenge (where the unit and
Soldiers would benefit significantly by having a commander with previous command experience). Additionally,
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            101

commanders of generating force units who display future potential as a battalion commander will be given the highest
consideration for a second command opportunity in an operating force unit. Second commands remain a viable,
although limited, option to provide a varied and relevant leadership experience that benefits the officer and the unit.
The goal is for those commanding twice to complete the two commands within 24 months in order to preserve their
professional time lines and meet other Army requirements.
   (d) Duty as a battalion fire support officer is very demanding, and highly rewarding. Captains should aggressively
prepare for and seek assignments as battalion fire support officers. Fire support officers are assigned directly to
maneuver organizations, which include Ranger, Infantry, Armor, Aviation, and other maneuver type forces. Battalion
fire support officers work directly for maneuver commanders in maneuver organizations. The battlefield insights and
perspectives gained while working directly in maneuver formations benefit these Field Artillerymen throughout their
entire careers. Captains should fill these billets prior to command. After battery command, CPTs can expect to move
on to broadening assignments in other organizations.
   (e) Former battery commanders make excellent choices to fill Special Forces Battalion fire support officer assign-
ments, as their battery command experience provides a unique perspective and understanding of the fires delivery
process. Former battery commanders bring tremendous credibility to these critical fires positions by providing an
experienced and knowledgeable leader to advise and support these unique formations.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments.
   (a) General. A wide variety of interesting and challenging assignments are available to Field Artillery captains after
the career course. The majority of captains will be assigned to Field Artillery cannon or rocket battalions or to fire
support positions within maneuver battalions (Ranger, Infantry, Armor, and Aviation). Special Forces Battalion FSOs
are selected from post-battery command officers. A small number of officers will be assigned to force generating units
to ensure the training base has quality officers to lead and command training units and initial entry training Soldiers.
   (b) Branch developmental assignments for captains, overall, are designed to allow commanders wide latitude in
tailoring the type, number, and order of assignments based on the developmental needs of the officer, the operational
needs of the unit, the availability of developmental duty positions within the command, and the overall needs of the
Army. Success in the assignments listed below (or combination of assignments) will provide opportunities for career
development and future consideration for promotion to the rank of major (which will be primarily based on perform-
ance in one or more of the following positions):
   1. Battery command.*
   2. Battalion fire support officer.*
   3. Fires battalion assistant S3.
   4. Fires battalion fire direction officer (FDO).
   5. Fires brigade operations.
   6. Primary staff officers at battalion and higher levels.
   7. Transition Team member.
   8. Special JIIM assignments.
   9. Other career developing captain equivalent assignments. (Note * KD assignment.)
   (c) Although the focus of career development for captains is to become competent in fire support operations, it
remains critically important to develop officers with a joint and expeditionary mindset and experience base. Therefore,
as early in an officer’s career as possible, assignments that broaden the experience base, and perspective of officers, as
they relate to joint operations and coalition warfare, will benefit both the Army and the officer. Captains that have
gained the necessary branch specific experiences should seek assignments and/or schooling that provide unique JIIM
perspectives and experiences. A balance of breadth of experience versus depth of understanding in a particular field
must be considered and will vary based on the needs of the Army.
   (d) All captains should aggressively seek challenging tactical assignments that provide the best developmental and
broadening opportunities and experiences to develop them as Field Artillery officers and leaders of the Army in the
future. Seeking these demanding jobs and succeeding at them will provide the best opportunities for professional
growth and development, and future opportunity. In most cases, offices will be assigned positions based on the needs
of the Army at all levels, including the immediate commander. In all cases, the most important measure of an officer’s
success is how well he/she performs in the position he/she is assigned.
   (e) Clearly, an officer’s overall "career success" is based on the goals and objectives established by each individual
officer and not by Field Artillery assignment policies. There is no one set prescriptive career path that every officer
must follow to be successful.
   (f) Small Group Leader (SGL) and observer/controller evaluator (O/CE) are important additional broadening oppor-
tunities. Training, mentoring, and guiding our future leaders is of the utmost importance to the Field Artillery. Our
most experienced and best leaders must become the trainers and mentors of our next generation of officers and
Soldiers. Therefore, it is important to highlight the SGL and observer/controller evaluators (O/CE) assignments
considered so critical to the overall success of the Field Artillery. The SGL positions are important instructor
assignments at Fort Sill (mainly for instruction related to the Field Artillery CCC) and in other key billets throughout
the Army. The O/CE positions are challenging subject matter expert (SME) assignments at the CTCs (NTC, Joint
102                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

Readiness Training Center (JRTC), JMRC, BCTP). These superb assignments are nominative (officer files are re-
viewed in a competitive selection process). Officers with the right credentials and experience are nominated and
offered these challenging assignments that will further improve their technical, tactical, and leadership skills. Therefore,
these assignments are considered career enhancing because only the best officers are asked to fill them. Additionally,
the personal satisfaction of mentoring and developing young leaders provides these select officers a very worthwhile
and gratifying experience. The SGLs and O/CEs truly become SMEs, and their experience and opinions are shared
across the Field Artillery. All officers should seek out these challenging and rewarding assignments.
   (g) Other critical developmental and broadening assignments include:
   1. Instructor positions (USMA faculty, ROTC, other branch and Service school instructors).
   2. Other branch/FA generalist positions (that is, Recruiting command staff, Active Army/RC positions, or other RC
duty).
   3. Other special assignments in JIIM positions.
   4. Other nominative assignments (that is, aide-de-camp and internships).
   (h) Self-development. Captains should continue to gain an in-depth understanding of combined arms operations and
become proficient in fires and fire support tasks. These tasks provide the foundation of knowledge required to
effectively serve in the branch as a leader at the battery and battalion level. Captains must gain a working knowledge
of command principles, battalion level staff operations, and combined arms and fire support operations. As a captain
develops, they should also seek to broaden their perspectives in JIIM assignments due to the nature of the expedition-
ary forces and the likelihood of future coalition warfare. Captains should also dedicate time to professional reading to
gain a historical perspective on tactical and leadership challenges.
   (i) Desired experience. Field Artillery captains should have an in-depth knowledge of synchronizing and integrating
fires at the maneuver battalion level and successfully commanded Soldiers at the company/battery level. It is also
desirable to have exposure to experiences outside the Field Artillery core branch that has given them a wider range of
knowledge and skills that augment their understanding of the full spectrum of Army missions and expands the officer’s
awareness of other governmental agencies, units or environments.
   (j) Functional Designation Board (FDB). At the 4th and 7th year, an officer’s record goes before a FDB. This board,
comprised of senior officers, will decide where the officer is best suited to serve in one of three functional categories;
MF&E, operations support, or force sustainment.
   1. The majority of Field Artillery captains will be designated to remain in the MF&E functional category and the
fires grouping based on requirements. The U.S. Army AHRC, Field Artillery Branch, will manage assignments for
Field Artillery captains in the fires group. Field Artillery officers remaining in the fires group will be assigned to
branch and branch/FA generalist assignments.
   2. Field Artillery captains, based on skills and experience, may request other than the MF&E functional category.
Selection to assignment outside of the MF&E functional category is competitively based on the specific requirements
for the desired category (number of officers required, education, experience, and so on). Qualification standards and
assignments for captains designated into one of the other functional categories will be managed by the assignment
officers for those categories and groupings.
   3. Officers will compete for promotion to major and higher within their designated functional category (MF&E for
those staying within the Field Artillery).
   f. Field Artillery major development.
   (1) General. The particular assignments a major is selected for and his level of success in those assignments sets the
conditions for promotion opportunities to lieutenant colonel and possible selection to battalion command. Field
Artillery battalion commanders are selected from a DA CSL by a board of senior officers. This board selects the best-
qualified officers based on performance in tough and challenging assignments that provide the experience necessary for
successful command of a combat arms battalion. The board looks for demonstrated success in a very competitive
selection process.
   (2) In many cases, the “branch developmental experience” at the major level does not necessarily equate to
“battalion command selection.” Majors and newly promoted lieutenant colonels desiring to command a battalion must
aggressively seek the tough jobs and obtain additional assignments and experience in line with the type of battalion
they desire to command. Those officers desiring to command a fires battalion in a BCT, for example, must fully
understand how to integrate and synchronize fires in combined arms operations, and also possess a strong knowledge
of Field Artillery tactics and logistics. Assignments as a BCT FSCOORD for majors, fire support OC at a CTC, fires
battalion or fires brigade S3, and/or XO, are some examples of the key developmental experiences critically important
to gain the necessary expertise and leadership and experience to command successfully. The assignments required for
selection as a battalion commander may go beyond those required for normal “branch officer development.” Command
selection remains very competitive and the opportunity to command is a privilege, not a right. However, professional
success in today’s Army does not require selection as a battalion commander. Many consider promotion to lieutenant
colonel success. In either case, each individual officer defines personal career success and need’s to work to meet the
goals they establish. Raters and senior raters will discuss career progression, key developmental assignments, and
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             103

professional developments goals that are realistic and obtainable for all officers. The Field Artillery Branch will assist
in supporting the career of any officer that emulates the Army Values; there are many paths to success.
   (3) Education.
   (a) Leader development at the rank of major is designed to prepare officers for command of fires battalions and to
enhance fire support coordination knowledge and skills. Majors will serve in a variety of key and developmental
positions in fires battalions, BDEs, and at other levels throughout the Army.
   (b) Military education required during this phase is completion of ILE, of which all Army competitive category
officers will have the opportunity to attend. The ILE is required prior to 15th year of commissioned service. The ILE
course is designed to develop leaders who will train and fight at the operational and tactical levels of war. This course
prepares officers for duty as field grade commanders and staff officers, principally at division and corps levels.
Successful completion of ILE results in credit for MEL ILE and JPME Phase I. Officers may also compete for
selection for the School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS), following AOWC. Those selected to attend SAMS
must serve a utilization tour as a corps or division plans or operations/assistant DCS, G–3/5/7 staff officer. Officers
serving or slated to serve in fires and effects coordination cells from Fires and Aviation brigades up to Joint Task
Force/Combatant Command level should attend the Fire Support Coordinators Course and Joint Operational Fires and
Effects Course (JOFEC).
   (c) Majors should continue self-development and lifelong learning efforts to become an expert in all aspects of fire
support coordination to include Joint and multinational operations. Self-development could include correspondence
courses, civilian education, and institutional training. Officers should also devote time to a professional reading
program to broaden their warfighting perspective.
   (4) KD assignments for Field Artillery majors. Assignments for majors may vary in sequence; however, every major
will be afforded the opportunity to obtain competency through key and developmental assignments.
   (a) The goal of the Field Artillery Branch is to provide majors the opportunity to serve for 12-24 months in KD
positions (XO, S3, BCT DFSCOORD, division, and higher HQ AFSCOORD) and/or branch developmental positions.
Commanders are provided wide latitude in tailoring the order of these developmental assignments based on the
developmental needs of the officer, the operational needs of the unit, and the availability of developmental jobs versus
the number of officers requiring experience. S3, XO. To ensure future potential battalion commanders are given a
strong experience base in the operation of a fires battalion, key assignments include serving as a S3 or XO in a fires
battalion, fires brigade, or in a comparable organization (tactical or training command). To ensure experience in fire
support expertise, majors also need to obtain experience in fire support coordination assignments as well: deputy fire
support coordinator (DFSCOORD) at brigade level, assistant fire support coordinator (AFSCOORD) at division or
higher HQ. Both Field Artillery operational experience and critical fire support/operations developmental assignments
are important to ensure potential battalion commanders and future battlefield staff officers remain well versed across
the spectrum of Field Artillery and the Army. A strong performance in those key and developmental positions is a clear
indicator of future potential for service as a battalion commander.
   (b) Transition Team (TT) and Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT). The tasks associated with transition from
direct combat to stability operations and recovery will be a significant part of our full spectrum engagement for the
foreseeable future. Our ability to train and operate effectively with indigenous forces will be a key element of 21st
century land power. The Soldiers that serve on transition teams are developing exactly the type of knowledge, skills
and abilities that are vital for our Army in order to be effective in an era of persistent conflict. The Army leadership
has declared that the officers that lead and serve on these Transition Teams be given the credit they deserve. As a
result the major’s position on military transition teams, special police transition teams, boarder teams, provincial
reconstruction teams or other names are considered “key developmental” positions for the branch. Any officer serving
in one of these positions will be considered as having served in a key developmental position within the branch/
functional area he/she serves and will not preclude the officer from further assignments to KD positions specific to the
officer’s branch. Therefore, Field Artillery majors who serve 12 months or more on a TT or PRT will be afforded the
option to serve an additional 12/24 months in a Field Artillery KD position. See MILPER MSG 08–168 and 08–175
for specifics.
   (5) Developmental and broadening assignments. Most Field Artillery majors will continue to serve in Field Artillery
positions at division and corps or in force generating units (TDA organizations) after completing tactical level
developmental assignments at the battalion, brigade and higher levels. Other typical developmental assignments
include—
   (a) Div/Corps/EAC Assistant Fires and Effects Coordinator
   (b) Operations Officer Fire and Effects Coordination Cell or Effects Coordination Cell
   (c) Operations Officer of Battlefield Coordination Detachment
   (d) Brigade Assistant S3
   (e) Field Artillery Intelligence Officer (FAIO)
   (f) Army sponsored fellowships and scholarships.
   (g) JIIM/DOD or Army Staff positions.
   (h) Duty at a Combat Training Center.
104                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   (i) RC support.
   (j) Echelons above corps staff.
   (k) ACOM staff.
   (l) General Staff College ILE faculty and staff.
   (m) Branch/FA generalist positions
   (n) Active Army/RC S3/XO.
   (o) Doctrine/Training developer.
   (p) Service school instructor.
   (q) USMA faculty and staff.
   (r) ROTC assistant professor of military science (APMS).
   (s) Multi-national and coalition trainer and staff officer.
   (t) SGL O/CE. Training, mentoring and guiding our future leaders, our most important asset, is of the utmost
importance to the Field Artillery Branch. Our most experienced and best leaders must become the trainers and mentors
of our next generation of officers and Soldiers. The SGL positions are important instructor assignments at Fort Sill
(mainly for instruction related to Field Artillery CCC) and in several other key billets throughout the Army. The O/CE
positions are challenging subject matter expert (SME) assignments at the CTCs (NTC, JRTC, JMRC). These superb
assignments are nominative (officer files are reviewed in a competitive selection process). Therefore, these assignments
are considered career enhancing because only the best officers are asked to fill them.
   (6) Self-development. Majors should continue self-development and lifelong learning efforts to become an expert in
all aspects of fire support coordination to include Joint and multinational operations and acquiring expertise in
organizational leadership techniques. Self-development should include correspondence courses, civilian education, and
institutional training. Officers should also devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their war fighting
perspective.
   (7) Desired experience.
   (a) At this stage of the officer’s career, the Field Artillery major should seek positions to develop his/her skills in
the planning and execution of Field Artillery operations and the integration and synchronization of fires required to
support the maneuver commander. KD experience in a Field Artillery organization, duty as a fire support coordinator at
the BCT and higher level, or service on a TT is very desirable. A competent, capable and knowledgeable Field
Artillery major must have a mix of career developmental opportunities and experience. Officers must have a diverse
and flexible career path in order to create the skill sets required to maintain a very professional, dynamic and
successful branch and officer corps.
   (b) The need for expeditionary type experiences, to include JIIM assignments, is essential to the experience base and
career development of all field grade officers. Although the Field Artillery aspect of career development for majors is
focused on the development of expertise in fire support coordination, it remains critically important to develop officers
with a Joint and expeditionary mindset and experience base as well. Assignments will be offered to either broaden the
experience base and perspective of officers in the area of JIIM or to develop more in-depth expertise required to ensure
success in specific operations or areas. In either case, these assignments will significantly enhance an officer’s
development as well as providing the Army with more effective subject matter experts. Majors should seek assign-
ments and schooling providing unique JIIM perspectives and experiences. JIIM staff positions or assignments embed-
ded with sister Services all provide superb experience.
   (c) There may be limited instances where a major does not have an opportunity for assignment in a KD position
(S3/XO or D/AFSCOORD). This could happen based on timing, the need for specific subject matter expertise job
availability, command decisions, or for numerous other legitimate reasons. In these instances, several other branch
developmental jobs and experiences will support an officer’s career advancement and consideration for promotion, as
long as the officer’s overall duty performance and his overall demonstrated potential warrant it. The goal of the Field
Artillery is to provide a key developmental assignment opportunity to all qualified officers; however, selection to these
positions will remain somewhat competitive. All majors should strive for assignment to at least one key branch
developmental assignment.
   g. Lieutenant colonel development. Officers selected for lieutenant colonel in the Field Artillery should seek
assignments of greater responsibility in both artillery and non-artillery positions. The most critical assignment for Field
Artillery lieutenant colonels in the MF&E functional category is battalion level command. Those Field Artillery
lieutenant colonels selected for command will normally serve two years in command at battalion level or one year as
the Commander, Transition Team. Field Artillery officers are selected for CSL commands in four command categories;
Operations, Strategic Support, Installations, and Recruiting & Training.
   (1) Education. Lieutenant colonels selected for command complete a Pre-command Course and may be selected for
Senior Service College following command. Officers selected for joint assignments must complete JPME training.
Officers serving or slated to serve in fires and effects coordination cells from Fires and Aviation brigades up to Joint
Task Force/Combatant Command level should attend the Joint Operational Fires and Effects Course (JOFEC).
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Key developmental assignments for Field Artillery lieutenant colonels include
the following:
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            105

   (a) CSL battalion level command.
   (b) Commander, Transition Team. The AHRC will award CSL credit for lieutenant colonels who have served in
specifically designated transition team (team chief) positions that have direct leadership responsibility for a team. The
CSA approved creating a new CSL subcategory called “combat arms (O2A) operations” and team chief positions will
be renamed “Commander, Transition Team”. These positions will now fall under the operations category on the MF&E
CSL board and was effective on the FY10 CSL board, September 2008. See MILPER MSG 08–168 for specific
details.
   (c) BCT FSCOORD, division or higher HQ deputy fire support coordinators, fires brigade deputy commanders and
operations officers, and a variety of other key staff officer positions. FA Branch does not typically fill the BCT
lieutenant colonel FSCOORD position based on inventory; however, in the event this position is filled with a lieutenant
colonel, they will receive key developmental time.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments.
   (a) Corps/division staff.
   (b) JIIM/DOD or Army Staff positions.
   (c) Service school staff.
   (d) Active Army/RC training support team chief/commander.
   (e) Division-level, DCS, G–3/5/7 (Note: normally a former battalion commander).
   (f) Division or corps staff.
   (g) Service branch school staff and instructors.
   (h) HQDA or Joint Staff, NATO staff, combatant commands staff.
   (i) TSB battalion commander.
   (j) XO/S3 positions in an Active Army/RC training support brigade.
   (k) RC support.
   (l) ROTC PMS.
   (m) ACOM staff.
   (n) Senior fire support OC at one of the CTCs.
   (o) BCTP O/T.
   (4) Self-development. Lieutenant colonels not selected for resident SSC should enroll in nonresident SSC education.
Other self-development includes a self assessment, civilian schooling, and mastering mentoring and managerial skills.
The officer should continue the development of fire warfighting and fire support skills and their understanding of the
Joint and Combined operational environment.
   (5) Desired experience. The well experienced Field Artillery lieutenant colonel will have a variety of duty assign-
ments as a fire supporter and/or commander in operationally deployed units. They will also have served in force
generating organizations, Army Staff, and/or in JIIM organizations. The manner of performance in any duty position is
crucial to selection for promotion to colonel.
   h. Colonel development.
   (1) General. Field Artillery colonels are expected to be strategic and creative thinkers; builders of leaders and teams;
competent full spectrum warfighters and fire supporters; skilled in governance, statesmanship, and diplomacy; and
understand cultural context and work effectively across it. They influence policy with in the Army and the Department
of Defense.
   (2) Education. The majority of officers selected for promotion to colonel will be selected to attend SSC. Those not
CSL selected should enroll in the nonresident SSC course. Those selected to command will also attend a Pre-command
Course. Command selectees may also attend the SOLO at Charlottesville, VA. Officers serving as TCMs may attend
the Combat Developers Course.
   (3) Key developmental assignments.
   (a) Colonel level command (that is, command of a fires brigade, command of a BCT, training brigade, or other
brigade level commands to include operational or generating force units and garrisons).
   (b) Selection for a designated key billet, Commander, battlefield coordination detachment (BCD).
   (4) Developmental and broadening assignments.
   (a) CTC operations group commander/chief of staff.
   (b) TRADOC capabilities manager.
   (c) Division or corps chief of staff.
   (d) Division, corps, or field Army Assistant Chief of Staff, DCS, G–3/5/7.
   (e) XO to a general officer.
   (f) Department Director, U.S. Army Fires Center of Excellence.
   (g) HQDA or Joint Staff.
   (h) Deputy commanders.
   (i) Chief of Staff, DCS, G–3/5/7 or other key division, corps, division,
106                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   (j) FSCOORD at the division/corps or at other higher echelons.
   (k) JIIM/DOD or other Army Staff key positions.
   (5) Self-development. Field Artillery colonels must maintain their branch skills and keep current on all changes that
affect the Soldiers they command and/or manage. JIIM assignments are important during this phase
   (6) Desired experience. The well experienced Field Artillery colonel will have a variety of duty assignments as a
fire supporter and commanders in operationally deployed units, experience in force generating organizations, served on
the Army Staff, and in JIIM organizations. Colonel’s knowledge and experience will provide a significant contribution
to the Army and the DOD.
12–4. Warrant officer development.
   a. Unique knowledge and skills of a Field Artillery warrant officer. The Field Artillery WO provides assistance and
advice to the commander and staff on all matters relative to the employment of Field Artillery target acquisition, fire
support assets and the Army’s targeting methodology. They serve as target acquisition platoon leaders, counterfire
officers, targeting officers, and Field Artillery intelligence officers (FAIO) integrating lethal and non-lethal fire support
from battalion levels through Joint Force headquarters levels.
   b. Attributes. Field Artillery warrant officers must possess the same attributes of an FA officer as well as a high
degree of technical and tactical knowledge of Field Artillery sensors, their employment and the Army’s targeting
process. They are accessed from all Field Artillery enlisted MOSs as well as infantry mortar crewmember (11C),
Cavalry Scouts (19D), Patriot Fire Control Enhanced Operators (14E), Air and Missile Defense Crewmembers (14S/R)
and carry forward the competencies learned on the respective systems. Continuous education, training, experience and
self-development enhance the Field Artillery warrant officer’s technical expertise.
   c. Roles and functions. Field Artillery warrant officers provide many of the same functions as the Field Artillery
officers except command of tactical units. Field Artillery warrant officers perform the following functions/tasks:
   (1) Lead Field Artillery target acquisition platoons.
   (2) Assist in managing Field Artillery target acquisition and collection assets employment at the Field Artillery
battalion, brigade and division level.
   (3) Develop subject matter expertise in Information Operations and Electronic Attack, in support of the targeting
process
   (4) Provide technical and tactical expertise in the coordination of the targeting process in combined arms or JIIM
operations
   (5) Teach Field Artillery target acquisition asset employment and targeting skills at service schools and Combat
Training Centers.
   d. WO1 development.
   (1) Education.
   (a) Upon selection to become a warrant officer, all non-commissioned officers will complete Warrant Officer
Candidate School. Phase 1 of WOCS is a distant learning (DL) course. There is only one Phase 1 dL class scheduled,
covering the entire training year. Once you have been enrolled in ATRRS for Course 911–09W (DL), you will access
the training at https://wocc.learn.army.mil by logging in with your AKO username and password. Phase II is a four-
week resident course at Fort Rucker, Alabama. After graduation from WOCS and appointment to WO1, each officer
will attend the Fort Sill eight month WOBC.
   (b) The purpose of the FA WOBC is to certify warrant officers as technically and tactically competent to serve as
warrant officers in the Field Artillery. The WOBC is the first major test a newly appointed FA warrant officer must
pass to continue serving in the Army as a FA warrant officer.
   (2) Assignments. After WOBC, WO1s are to be assigned as target acquisition platoon leaders.
   (3) Self-development. Self-development during this phase should focus on the integration of target acquisition
assets, sensor management, organizational maintenance, and leadership skills.
   (4) Desired experience. A high degree of comprehension and technical competence in Field Artillery systems,
Intelligence collection assets, and architecture specific functions are desired.
   e. CW2 development.
   (1) Education. CW2s should attend assignment oriented training to increase their knowledge in joint targeting or a
special skill area such as Electronic Warfare or Information Operations. Completion of an associate’s degree is a
recommended goal prior to becoming eligible for promotion to CW3.
   (2) Assignments. CW2s are normally assigned as a target analyst, target/ew integration officer, or assistant counter-
fire officer.
   (3) Self-development. CW2s will need to gain knowledge and experience in information operations and electronic
warfare. Paragraph i, below, shows a list of recommended assignment oriented training.
   (4) Desired experience. While a CW2, the focus should be on acquiring and refining the technical knowledge and
tactical experience to effectively conduct targeting operations, integration of TA sensors, and counterfire ops within the
BCT’s area of operations.
                                              DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             107

   f. CW3 development.
   (1) Education. The Warrant Officer Advanced Course (WOAC) focuses on advanced technical training and common
leader development subjects designed to prepare officers for assignment in Senior Targeting level positions. The
residential course consists of nine weeks of advanced technical and tactical training in the targeting process at the
division, corps, Joint task force, or ASCC. The WOAC should be completed by the one year time in grade point as a
CW3. The WOAC must be completed for promotion to CW4. Completion of a baccalaureate degree is a recommended
goal prior to becoming eligible for promotion to CW4.
   (2) Assignments. The CW3s will be assigned as BCT targeting officers, Fires Brigade counterfire officers, and
division FAIOs. Select WOs in the grade of CW3 can also expect to receive assignments consistent with the needs of
the Army, such as the following:
   (a) CTC observer controller/evaluator (OC/E).
   (b) BCTP observer controller.
   (c) Service school instructors.
   (d) Combat developers.
   (e) Training/doctrine developers.
   (f) Assignment to SOCOM community, ranger regiment, Special Forces Groups.
   (3) Self-development. Assignment-oriented training will be focused towards future positions that enhance the
officer’s duty performance.
   (4) Desired experience. CW3s will have served as a BCT level targeting officer prior to serving as a division, or
corps targeting officer/FAIO.
   g. CW4 development.
   (1) Education. The Warrant Officer Staff Course (WOSC) is four week professional development course with a two
week distant learning taught at the Warrant Officer Career Center (WOCC), Fort Rucker, AL.
   (2) Assignments. CW4s will serve as FAIOs and targeting officers in positions at division, corps, and higher
echelons or in generating force organizations. Select CW4s can also expect to receive assignments consistent with the
needs of the Army, such as, the following:
   (a) Targeting officer in the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

   (c) Combat developer.
   (d) Training/doctrine developer.
   (e) Test officer (Army Evaluation Test Force)
   (f) Program manager.
   (g) Branch manager.
   (3) Self-development. CW4s should continue self-development efforts to enhance expertise in all aspects of target
acquisition asset employment and targeting to include Joint and combined operations utilizing assignment oriented
training. CW4s should devote time to obtaining a graduate level degree. CW4s should attend WOSC by the 1 year TIG
point as a CW4. WOs must attend WOSC for promotion to CW5.
   (4) Desired experience. CW4s should have targeting experience at the BCT and Division Level prior to being
assigned to the Battlefield Coordination Detachment (BCD).
   h. CW5 development.
   (1) Education. The Warrant Officer Senior Staff Course is a two-week course with a two week distant learning
attended by the Army’s most senior warrant officers taught by the WOCC at Fort Rucker, AL. The WOSSC can be
attended after 1 year TIG to CW4 and should be completed by 1 year TIG CW5.
   (2) Assignments. CW5s will serve as targeting officers in positions at corps and higher echelons or in force
generating organizations. Select CW5s can also expect to receive assignments consistent with the needs of the Army,
such as, the following:

ing to include Joint and combined operations.
   (4) Desired experience. CW5s should have targeting experience at all levels and have maintained master proficiency
throughout their careers.
   i. Assignment Oriented Training. All FA WOs need to continue to seek assignment oriented training to maintain
expertise in all aspects of joint targeting and special skill areas. Assignment Oriented Training includes the following
courses:

12–5. Field Artillery Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. RC units comprise approximately 50 percent of the Field Artillery units in
America’s Army. All Field Artillery units in the RC are in the ARNG. The overwhelming majority of positions in the
RC correspond to those positions in the MF&E functional category under OPMS. Field Artillery RC officer careers are
spent predominantly in tactical units. RC officers should optimize their time in developmental fire support and
operational Field Artillery positions.
   b. Branch developmental opportunities. RC Field Artillery officers should strive to adhere, as nearly as possible, to
the standards and professional development patterns in individual training, operational assignments, and self-develop-
ment as their Active Duty counterparts. RC officers should build a solid foundation in leadership, fire support skills,
and Field Artillery unit operations to successfully serve in the branch. Ideally this occurs through a variety of
assignments as fire support officers at all levels, in artillery units, on staffs, and in support units where Field Artillery
expertise is needed. Because of geographic location or other considerations, RC Field Artillery officers may not have
the opportunity to serve in as many Field Artillery and fire support positions as Active Duty officers. However, this is
offset by longevity in positions that are available in tactical units in their geographic area.
   (1) RC career development. To meet career development requirements, a RC Field Artillery officer must have the
following:
   (a) Completed at least 60 hours of college credit to receive a commission.
   (b) Completed the BOLC II and Field Artillery BOLC III courses with in 2 years of commissioning for an officer to
be eligible for promotion, a mobilization asset, and remain in the Army Reserve and ARNG.
   (c) Completed Field Artillery CCC, either the active or RC course (resident or nonresident). BOLC II graduates of
other branches transferring to the Field Artillery are encouraged to attend a pre-course or take advantage of home
station training prior to enrolling in the Field Artillery CCC.
   (d) Successfully commanded a battery level unit for 24 months (plus or minus 12 months) or served as one or more
of the following for 24 months (plus or minus 12 months): battalion fire support officer, battalion fire control/direction
officer, or assistant operations officer at battalion or fires brigade/division artillery. Ideally, an officer will serve in a
position through at least two annual training periods.
   (2) RC field grade officer standards.
   (a) RC major. Majors must have completed common core ILE to be competitive for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
To be best qualified, majors should seek KD duty positions as battalion XO, operations officer, brigade deputy fire
support coordinator, assistant fire support coordinator at various levels (division, Corps, BCD, and so on), or as
assistant brigade level operations officer. Optimally majors should spend 24 to 36 months in one of these positions.
   (b) RC lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels must have completed ILE common core to be competitive for
promotion to colonel. To be best qualified, lieutenant colonels should seek duty positions as battalion commanders, as
various FSCOORDs support (at the lieutenant colonel level), and as brigade level XOs or operations officers.
Optimally, lieutenant colonels should spend 24 to 36 months in one of these positions.
   (c) RC colonel. Colonels serve as brigade level commanders (Fires BDEs and BCT) , and in a variety of important
staff positions to include the deputy assistant commandant at the Field Artillery School, Division and Corps effects
coordinators, Regional Training Institute commanders, and in a variety of branch/FA generalist positions at brigade
level and above or staff positions at state or national level.
   (d) RC selection board. Lieutenant colonels and colonels are selected for SSC by a RC selection board.
   (3) Battalion or brigade command. To be ready for Field Artillery battalion or brigade command, RC officers must
meet the appropriate educational requirements for the grade and position. Attendance at the Field Artillery PCC is also
recommended prior to assumption of command.
   (4) Continuing development. Officers desiring consideration for key positions in RC artillery units should aggres-
sively pursue positions that develop essential war fighting leader skills. Officers should continue self-development
efforts to become an expert in all aspects of fire support coordination to include Joint and multinational operations.
Self-development should include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training. Officers should
devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their war fighting perspective.
   (5) Branch transfers. RC Field Artillery officers may have to branch transfer during the course of their careers due
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                               109

to lack of positions in their geographic area. When an officer transfers into Field Artillery, completion of either the
Field Artillery BOLC III or the CCC and minimum time in a key position is required before branch qualification is
complete. Commanders will consider the officer’s experience level in recommending which qualification course is
required. Commanders should closely manage branch transfer officers and assign them to a qualifying position
concurrent with enrollment in the Field Artillery BOLC III or the CCC or after completion of the course. Officers
should not normally be assigned to a qualifying position prior to enrolling in or completing Field Artillery BOLC III or
the CCC.

Air Defense Artillery Branch
13–1. Introduction.
   a. Purpose. Army ADA organizations provide the Army and the Joint Forces with a capability to defend against a
wide array of hostile aerial and missile threats while ensuring a modular and expeditionary force able to meet future
Joint Force requirements. Combat-proven ADA weapons platforms (shooters) and early warning systems (sensors)
provide the Army and the Joint Forces with a technologically advanced, fully digitized capability that enables detection
and engagement of air and missile threats much earlier, at greater distances, and with increased lethality while at the
same time reducing the risk to friendly forces. ADA organizations are ideally suited for frequent support to JIIM
operations and their employment can achieve strategic, operational, and/or tactical advantage on the battlefield. In
concert with the entire Army, ADA organizations are rapidly transforming to remain “relevant and ready.” In addition
to changes to ADA force structure and battle command, the introduction of air defense-airspace management (ADAM)
cells at brigade combat teams (BCTs) and the establishment of the Ground-Based Mid-Course Defense (GMD) Brigade
provide growth and add challenging assignment opportunities. For example, global missile defense and space opera-
tions are closely aligned with ADA missions and functions and new weapon systems such as the Medium Extended Air
Defense System (MEADS), Surface-Launched Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (SLAMRAAM), Theater
High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, and Extended Air Defense System (EADS) will likely enter the Army
inventory in the near future, as will a host of early warning/detection devices (sensors) including the Joint Land Attack
Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor (JLENS), MEADS sensors, Multi-Mission Radar (MMR), Forward-
Based X–Band Transportable (FBXT) radar, and THAAD radar.

   (1) DA unit missions vary based on system capabilities:
   (a) Avengers are currently assigned to air and missile defense (AMD) units supporting maneuver elements and
provide a gun/missile capability. Integration with infantry, armor, artillery, aviation, and logistics elements are critical
to the success of these systems on the battlefield.
   (b) Sentinel radars and the forward area air defense (FAAD) command, control, communications, computers, and
intelligence (C4I) digital communications architecture provide early warning, detection, and identification of enemy
aircraft, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), remotely piloted vehicles (RPVs), and cruise missiles.
   (c) The Patriot missile system is designed to defeat a wide variety of air and missile threats. Normally supporting
joint and multinational operational echelons, Patriot is capable of countering the growing theater ballistic missile threat.
   (2) The Way Ahead. As the Army transforms, many units will develop into modular “plug and fight” organizations
such as Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) and Combat Aviation Brigades. In synchronization with the Army’s transfor-
mation, robust ADAM cells will form at each of these organizations to coordinate and plan for the employment of air
defense forces onto the battlefield. Targeting, airspace command and control (C2), and early warning are common
functions performed by officers assigned to these cells. Composite ADA battalions consisting of Patriot, Avenger, and
Sentinel systems are generally tasked as required to support these Army modular organizations. The ADA transforma-
tion includes the introduction of a host of new missile and early warning systems. The intent is to make future air
defense systems more lethal, mobile, flexible, and deployable. Improvements in interoperability with JIIM forces are
continuous and will serve the Army well in all expeditionary endeavors. In summary, the Army’s transformation has
expanded the role of air defenders on the battlefield and has led the way for increased participation in the planning and
execution of air defense operations in a broad variety of Army and JIIM operations.
   (3) Unique features of work in ADA. The descriptions below provide a general overview of the nature of work
specific to ADA officers and warrant officers based on organizational design. The term ADA officer(s) refers to both
commissioned and warrant officers assigned to Branch code 14 or the 14-series military occupational specialty.
Although the nature of some work is similar at company-level grades, not all assignment functions and requirements
are interchangeable. Specific career path information is provided throughout this document.
   (a) Assignments to MTOE units provide opportunities to command, control, and direct ADA organizations at
detachment, platoon, battery, battalion, and brigade levels. Staff assignments are also characteristic of MTOE assign-
ments. These skills are essential to professional development and expansion of experience in personnel matters (S–1),
intelligence (S–2), training and operations (S–3), and supply and logistics (S–4).
   (b) Assignments in table of distribution and allowances (TDA) organizations provide opportunities similar to those
stated above, but lend themselves more to equipment training and platform instruction for new recruits and officers.
   (c) Assignments to ADAM cells across the modular force provide opportunities for officers to serve as staff planners
and coordinators for a wide variety of missions at multiple echelons. By design, these organizations can and will
operate along joint lines and are expeditionary in nature. Additional schooling provided by the U.S. Army Air Defense
Artillery School (USAADASCH) prepares ADA officers to serve in these critical assignments.
   (4) ADA officer tasks. The information below provides a broad outline of an ADA officer’s mission essential task
list:
   (a) Serve as Soldiers first and maintain empathy and the warrior ethos.
   (b) Integrate (plan and employ) ADA forces into Army or JIIM organizations to defeat third-dimension threats.
   (c) Plan Army airspace command and control (AC2) and targeting as part of an Army or JIIM team.
   (d) Provide early warning of air and missile threats to Army and/or JIIM forces.
   (e) Serve as ADA advisors to U.S., allied, and coalition forces.
   (5) ADA assignment opportunities other than MTOE.
   (a) Develop, review, and evaluate doctrine and training for all ADA organizations.
   (b) Train, develop, and evaluate ADA skills at Combat Training Centers (CTCs).
   (c) Serve in positions requiring specific as well as general technical and tactical skills, such as staff officers in
organizations and activities requiring ADA expertise (includes JIIM and Army staffs).
   (d) Serve as instructors at pre-commissioning programs and service schools.
   (e) Serve as ADA advisors to the ARNG and the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) component organizations.
13–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. General. Army officers must be warriors who can effectively apply the four core dimensions of leadership:
values, attributes, skills and actions. The four core leadership dimensions provide the basis for what a leader must be,
know and do. The values and attributes set the basis for the character of the leader — what a leader must be. The skills
developed by leaders establish his or her competence — what a leader must know. The actions that leaders conduct and
execute constitute leadership — what a leader must do. The leadership framework describes a leader of character and
competence who acts to achieve results across the spectrum of operations, from total war to stability and support
operations, disaster relief, or realistic training operations.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of an ADA officer. ADA officers are:
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             113

   (1) Premier warfighters who maintain the warrior ethos at all times.
   (2) Joint and expeditionary minded.
   (3) Worldwide deployable, motivated, disciplined, and physically fit.
   (4) Grounded in Army Core Values.
   (5) Intellectually capable of understanding and operating the Army’s most technical and sophisticated digitized
equipment.
   (6) Guided by the four dimensions of leadership: values, attributes, skills, and actions (for additional discussion of
these leadership dimensions, see FM 6–22). Leaders who consistently display competencies that enable them to adapt
to the full spectrum of operations that comprise today’s contemporary operating environment (peacetime, disaster
relief, contingency operations, and war).
   c. Unique attributes. All officers must be physically and mentally fit, maintain and display confidence and self-
control, remain decisive under pressure, and adhere to published standards and regulations.
   d. Unique skills. Competence: Technical and tactical. ADA officers must be technically and tactically proficient on a
wide variety of mission-unique equipment and systems. In the most generic sense, ADA officers must be capable of
employing systems in tactical, operational, and/or strategic environments, training Soldiers and units to perform their
wartime missions, and developing plans as part of an Army or JIIM team. Meaningful operational assignments and
self-development are critical elements of lifelong learning necessary to maintain the professional knowledge, judgment,
and warfighting expertise needed to accomplish all tasks and functions required during ADA operations.
   e. Conceptual. ADA officers must possess the ability to perform critical and creative thinking and moral reasoning
while clearly communicating information across a wide spectrum of operations.
   f. Unique actions. Leadership:
   (1) Decision-making. ADA officers must be capable of rapidly assessing complex situations and making split-
second decisions while operating under stress and in austere field conditions. Sound judgment, logical reasoning, and
wise use of resources are critical to mission success.
   (2) Planning and executing. ADA officers must be able to conduct ADA operations with Army and JIIM forces,
meet mission standards, take care of people and resources, and develop detailed and executable plans that are feasible,
acceptable, and suitable.
13–3. Officer development.
   a. Officer Development Model. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will enable them to
develop into agile and adaptive leaders for the 21st century. These leaders must be: competent in their core
proficiencies, broad enough to operate across the spectrum of conflict, able to operate in JIIM environments and
leverage other capabilities in achieving their objective, culturally astute and able to use this awareness and understand-
ing to conduct operations innovatively, courageous enough to see and exploit opportunities in the challenges and
complexities of the objective environment, and grounded in Army Values and warrior ethos. Further explanation of
these characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0 and chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Air Defense Artillery officer development. The ADA branch provides diverse assignment opportunities that allow
for numerous career developmental paths. The branch’s professional development goal is to produce and sustain highly
qualified tactically and operationally oriented officers to lead ADA forces in combat and to accomplish a host of other
mission-essential tasks.
   c. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for ADA branch officers remaining in the Maneuver,
Fires and Effects functional category. This requires optimizing the company and field grade inventory to meet branch
authorizations, providing sufficient flexibility to support branch or multifunctional positions and providing optimal time
in key developmental assignments while stabilizing the force.
   d. OPMS. Army Transformation has led to an increase in air defense authorizations for CPTs through COLs so for
more information contact ADA assignments officers at AHRC.
   (1) Structure. Inactivation of select divisional ADA battalions has forced changes in the manner in which ADA will
fight and support maneuver elements. ADA officers will man robust ADAM cells across the modular force to plan and
support maneuver unit operations. Although ADA divisional battalions are no longer in the division structure, ADA
composite battalions remain at corps and ADA brigade organizations. The Army’s push to modularity will drive
ADA’s future structure. In addition, growth in the branch will occur with the introduction of multiple AADACs, RC to
AA conversion, and the establishment of the GMD system. Warrant officers will have new opportunities to serve in
tactical controller positions normally held by lieutenants and as tactical director and ADAFCO positions normally held
by captains. This is not a shift in responsibilities as lieutenants and captains will also continue in these positions, but
this will enable lieutenants to focus on honing/developing troop-leading skills while adding continuity and experience
to the TCO, TD, and ADAFCO positions.
   (2) Acquisition. Officers will continue to be accessed through USMA, ROTC, and the Officer Candidate School
(OCS). Warrants will continue to be recruited from the Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) Corps. Both officer and
warrant officer accessions are based on preference, qualifications, and needs of the Army. The branch will also remain
a donor branch for detailed officers from other combat support/combat service support branches.
114                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   (3) Officer distribution. Officers will be provided assignment opportunities to develop the skills and experience base
necessary for service at the next higher grade. The sequencing and timing of assignments is driven by Army priorities.
The Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) and Army Transformation are currently the driving forces behind the
distribution of officers. Force stabilization will also continue to influence officer distribution.
   (4) Deployment. ADA officers are warfighters who must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to warfighter-centric units or training organizations, readiness is imperative to
the success of the mission. ADA officers must prepare themselves and their Families for planned and no-notice
deployments. In today’s fast-paced and uncertain operating environment, Families must be ready for multiple deploy-
ments of unknown duration.
   (5) Sustainment. Officer Personnel Management System:
   (a) Promotion. Skills, experience, duty performance, and adherence to branch requirements are all factors that
influence promotion; promotion rates will be determined by Army needs and the Defense Officer Personnel Manage-
ment Act goals.
   (b) Command. Commands at battalion and brigade level are organized into four functional categories: operations,
strategic support, recruiting and training, and installation. Officers have the option to compete for selection to the
desired command category and can decline other categories without prejudice. Officers who are selected for command
may submit operational and personal deferment requests. Since the command CSL process may change, officers should
contact ADA assignments officers at Human Resources Command to receive the latest information. The results of the
command selection process are announced in the CSL. (Note: This sub-paragraph is not applicable to WOs.)
   (c) Officer Evaluation Report (OER). The OER will reinforce the link between officer development and the Officer
Personnel Management System. At the captain level, the rater together with the senior rater will make a recommenda-
tion concerning the officer’s functional category. The WO evaluation report remains unchanged.
   (d) Development. Officer development should occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in
tactical, training, and staff assignments, institutional education, and self-development. The goal is to professionally
develop officers to expertly perform ADA mission essential task list-related functions during joint and combined arms
operations.
   (e) Separation. The officer separation process remains unchanged.
   e. Lieutenant development.
   (1) Education. The lieutenant attends the ADA Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC) Phase III (proponent institu-
tional training) right after completing BOLC II.
   (2) Key developmental (KD) assignments. Lieutenants are assigned to platoon leader positions in a pure Patriot/
Patriot/Avenger composite or maneuver ADA battalion (Avenger). As platoon leaders, these lieutenants will gain
valuable experience and training that will be the “cornerstone” of their career development.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Additional developmental duty positions for seasoned platoon
leaders include battery tactical control officer (TCO), executive officer (XO), battalion staff officer, liaison officer
(LNO), and aide-de-camp.
   (4) Self-development. By law, officers must obtain a baccalaureate degree before promotion to captain. A self-
development program that enhances professional development through lifelong learning must also begin at the grade of
lieutenant.
   (5) Desired experience. The focus of effort during the lieutenant years is to acquire, reinforce, and hone troop-
leading, technical, tactical, logistics, and administrative skills. Inculcation of the warrior ethos and Army Core Values
are essential to the character development of these young officers. Prior to promotion to captain (CPT), officers must
possess an in-depth knowledge of ADA and combined arms operations gained through experience in MTOE warfight-
ing units.
   f. Captain development.
   (1) Education. Officers generally attend the CCC at their fourth year of service, which currently corresponds with
promotion to CPT. Select ADA officers may have an opportunity to attend the resident phase of another combat arms
branch CCC or the U.S. Marine Corps Expeditionary Warfare School. These schools are extremely competitive and
provide increased benefits to the Army and the officer.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Captains must aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience that
will prepare them for duties at the grade of major (MAJ). The following are considered key developmental assignments
for ADA captains:
   (a) ADA battery command (exceptions may include command of another combat arms battery or company).
   (b) HHB commander of an active component ADA organization.
   (c) HHC commander of an active component non-ADA organization.
   (d) Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS)/FBX–T detachment commander.
   (e) Brigade Air Defense Artillery Fire Control Officer (ADAFCO).
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Completion of CCC and a minimum of 12 months in one of the
above positions will fully qualify captains for promotion to major; the optimal time line will provide an 18–36 month
                                              DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                          115

experience. Officers will not suffer prejudice toward promotion or assignment consideration as a result of not having
commanded at the battery/company level. Some captains may also be assigned to either branch-specific or generalist
assignments, allowing them to develop a wider perspective of the Army or other services. The following are some
possible examples of branch-specific/generalist assignments for captains:
   (a) CTC observer/controller (O/C).
   (b) Small group instructor (SGI).
   (c) ADA battalion/brigade staff officer.
   (d) ADAM cell officer-in-charge (OIC) within a Multifunctional Brigade including Aviation, Fires, and BFSB.
   (e) GMD brigade staff officer.
   (f) Battalion or brigade tactical director (TD).
   (g) Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) staff.
   (h) Multinational Transition Team Trainer/Advisor
   (i) Battlefield Coordination Detachment (BCD) staff officer.
   (j) Army/Army Command (ACOM)/Army Space (ARSPACE) staff.
   (k) Other branch developmental positions (for example, ADA doctrine or combat developer in the Directorate of
Combat Developments (DCD); Directorate of Training, Doctrine, and Leader Development (DOTD–LD); Office of the
Chief, Air Defense Artillery (OCADA)); U.S. Army Human Resources Command (AHRC) positions; The Army Test
and Evaluation Command (ATEC); U.S. Army Recruiting Command (USAREC) staff/command positions; AA/Reserve
Component (RC) positions; advanced civil schooling (based on Army requirements); Reserve Officer Training Corps
(ROTC) instructor; United States Military Academy (USMA) instructor or tactical officer; Foreign Service exchange
officer or Foreign Service school exchange officer; JIIM assignments; fellowship/internship positions; aide-de-camp.
   (4) Self-development. All captains must exercise continuous self-development to fully master all aspects of ADA
operations including JIIM operations. Self-development initiatives may include (among others) on-line/correspondence
courses, civilian education, professional reading programs, and other institutional training to broaden their warfighting
perspective. Officers are eligible for functional designation at both their fourth and seventh years of service. The formal
designation of functional areas is based on the needs of the Army, officer preference, military experience, and civilian
schooling. Several functional areas provide advanced civil schooling, which may be granted upon selection to the
functional area (subject to change).
   (5) Desired experience. Developmental assignments, both branch-specific and generalist, will provide ADA captains
with exposure to the Army and in some cases JIIM organizations. The captains must master troop leading skills and
fully understand operations at battery, battalion, and brigade levels. At this stage in their career development, ADA
captains must recognize how the Army functions and fights.
   g. Major development.
   (1) Education. At the 7th year, an HQDA-level board considers Army requirements and each officer’s skills,
experience, and preferences before assigning each officer to a branch or functional area in one of three functional
categories. ADA is in the Fires grouping of the Maneuver, Fires, and Effects functional category. Officers selected to
remain in the ADA basic branch (functionally designated) must successfully complete Intermediate Level Education
(ILE) to be competitive for promotion to lieutenant colonel (LTC). The ILE is critical at this point in an ADA officer’s
career. This quality education for all field grade officers prepares them for success in their next ten years of service.
Upon completion of ILE, ADA majors must continue to aggressively prepare for and seek the skills and experience
that will prepare them for promotion to LTC.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. The following are considered key developmental assignments for ADA majors:
   (a) ADAM Cell OIC
   (b) Battalion/Brigade S–3 or XO of an AA ADA organization
   (c) Battalion/Brigade S–3 or XO of a special troops battalion or another active component combat arms unit
   (d) Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC) Deputy Chief of Operations
   (e) AAMDC Deputy Chief of Plans
   (f) AAMDC Air Defense Artillery Fire Control Officer (ADAFCO)
   (g) Multinational Transition Team Trainer/Advisor: The tasks associated with transition from direct combat to
stability operations and recovery will be a significant part of our full spectrum engagement for the foreseeable future.
Our ability to train and operate effectively with indigenous forces will be a key element of 21st century land power.
The Soldiers that serve on transition teams are developing exactly the type of knowledge, skills and abilities that are
vital for our Army in order to be effective in an era of persistent conflict. The Army leadership has declared that the
officers who lead and serve on these Transition Teams be given the credit they deserve. As a result the major’s position
on military transition teams, special police transition teams, boarder teams, provincial reconstruction teams or other
names are considered “key developmental” positions for the branch. Any officer serving in one of these positions will
be considered as having served in a key developmental position within the branch/functional area he/she serves and
will not preclude the officer from further assignments to KD positions specific to the officer’s branch. Therefore, ADA
116                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

majors who serve 12 months or more on a TT or PRT will be afforded the option to serve an additional 12/24 months
in an ADA KD position. See MILPER MSG 08–168 and 08–175 for specifics.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Completion of ILE and a minimum of 12 months in a key
developmental assignment will fully qualify majors for promotion to LTC. The optimal time line provides officers with
the opportunity to serve in one or more of the above listed positions for at least 18–36 months. Officers will not suffer
prejudice toward promotion or assignment consideration as a result of not having served as an ADA battalion or
brigade S–3/XO. Some ADA majors may be assigned to either branch-specific or generalist assignments allowing them
to develop a wider perspective of the Army or other services. The following are some possible examples of branch-
specific/generalist assignments for majors:
   (a) CTC senior O/C
   (b) ADA brigade staff officer
   (c) USAADASCH/ILE faculty and staff
   (d) Brigade/division/corps staff
   (e) GMD Brigade/ARSPACE/SMDC staff
   (f) DOD/JIIM/Army/ACOM staff
   (g) Battlefield Coordination Detachment (BCD) staff officer
   (h) Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) positions
   (i) Service school instructor
   (j) AA/RC positions
   (k) Other branch or multifunctional positions
   1. Inspector General
   2. Fellowship/Internship positions
   3. ROTC/USMA instructor
   4. DCD/DOTD–LD/OCADA/ATEC/U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Futures/Army Staff
DCS, G–8 (Force Development (FD)) and U.S. Army Human Resources Command (AHRC) positions.
   (4) Self-development. All majors must exercise continuous self-development to fully master all aspects of ADA
operations, including JIIM operations. Self-development initiatives may include (among others) on-line/correspondence
courses, civilian education, professional reading programs, and other institutional training to broaden their warfighting
perspective. As stated earlier, skills and experience will drive an officer’s career path and future assignments. See
Figure 13–1.
   (5) Desired experience. At this career stage an ADA major must hone his skills in the planning and execution of
ADA TTPs and develop expertise in the JIIM operational environment. While 12 months is the minimum standard, an
officer should serve for as long as possible in key developmental assignments, with the general rule being a minimum
of two for a total of 24–36 months
   h. Lieutenant colonel development.
   (1) Education. Officers selected for LTC must seek assignments of greater responsibility in branch positions. ADA
LTCs must successfully complete a recognized Army Senior Service College (SSC) curriculum to be competitive for
promotion to colonel. SSC is critical at this point in an ADA officer’s career as it continues to prepare them for future
success in the next stages of their Army service.
   (2) KD assignments. Upon completion of SSC ADA lieutenant colonels must continue to aggressively prepare for
and seek the skills and experience that will prepare them for promotion to COL. The objective in LTC assignments is
to give ADA officers the opportunity to make a greater contribution to the branch and the Army. Key developmental
assignments for LTCs include the following:
   (a) Centralized Selection List (CSL) battalion-level command.
   (b) Transition Team Commander. Lieutenant colonels who have served in specifically designated transition team

13–5. Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. The RC career development model for ADA will essentially mirror that of AA
officers/WOs, except that assignments will not be limited to one component or control group within a component.
Figures 13–3 (officers) and 13–4 (WOs) delineate the mandatory time line for promotion to the next higher grade. In
certain cases, an RC officer can be promoted to the next higher grade after meeting minimum time in grade
requirements. The ADA officer should count on being dual branched to facilitate career progression. In addition, an
ADA officer will most likely be required to branch transfer to another basic branch due to limited geographical and
upward mobility positions; however, these officers should remain proficient.
   b. Role. The ADA Reserve Component officers/WOs serve in most of the same roles and missions as their AA
counterparts. The unique nature of the RC Soldier’s role as a “citizen Soldier” poses a challenge for professional
development; however, RC officers/WOs are expected to follow AA development patterns as closely as possible. RC
officers/WOs have increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. To meet professional develop-
ment objectives, RC officers/WOs must be willing to rotate between ARNG and USAR Troop Program Units,
Individual Ready Reserves, the Individual Mobilization Augmentee Program, and other AA and RC programs.
Geographical considerations necessitate these transfers, as well as the need to provide as many officers/WOs as
possible, the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions. Additionally, there may be occasions
when RC officers/WOs will be transferred to the Individual Ready Reserves while they complete mandatory education
requirements. Such transfers will be temporary and should not be seen as impacting negatively on the officer’s/WO’s
career. The success of an RC officer/WO is not measured by the length of service in any one component or control
group, but by the officer’s/WO’s breadth of experience, duty performance, and adherence to branch requirements.
(Note: figures 13–1, 13–2, 13–3, and 13–4 illustrate the typical AA and RC officer and WO careers from accession to
separation.)
   c. WO assignments. WOs, as the branch’s technical experts, are considered certified upon successful completion of
the WOBC and remain so throughout their WO career (140X specialty code denotes a position that can be filled by
either a 140A or 140E, currently only approved for GMD positions).
   d. RC officer qualification and development. The career development model is at figure 13–3, below.
   (1) Lieutenant (years one through six). RC officers must complete a minimum of 90 hours of college/university
credits to receive a commission. ADA BOLC III is the starting point for newly accessed RC ADA officers. RC ADA
officers should complete the resident initial leadership instruction by the eighteenth month for ARNG officers (the
second year for USAR officers), or prior to the end of the third year for OCS graduates and direct appointees. Officers
should seek to serve in more than one unit position during this phase, allowing for maximum exposure to the
diversified functions within an ADA unit. Typical ADA lieutenant assignments include TCO, platoon leader, battery
XO, battery maintenance officer, and battalion staff officer. Officers are encouraged to actively participate in profes-
sional reading programs and continue correspondence studies. Officers must earn a baccalaureate degree from an
accredited college/university to qualify for promotion to captain.
   (2) CPT (years 7 through 13). ADA officers must complete the resident CCC in the AA or RC curriculum. The RC
CCC program is divided into four phases of instruction that is to be completed within a 13-month time frame. The
course includes two phases of distance learning (dL) includes nonresident instruction and two phases of 2 weeks of
Active Duty in residence at USAADASCH. During this phase, all officers are highly encouraged to pursue a specialty
related undergraduate or graduate degree. RC ADA officers should aggressively seek opportunities to command an
ADA battery for a minimum tour of two years (optimally three years). RC ADA command opportunities are only
available in ARNG units. Typical assignments for captains include battery command; TASS/RTI tactical officer;
battalion, brigade, division, state area command, or USAR regional support command (RSC) staff officer; battalion
liaison officer; CTC O/C; and multifunctional billets. Officers may select a functional area designation between the
seventh and tenth years of service. The designation of functional areas should be based upon the needs of the Army,
geographical considerations, and officer preference. Functional area assignments are useful for bypassing temporary
roadblocks to career progression in the ADA branch due to geographical constraints or position availability; however,
122                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

RC ADA officers should endeavor to return to an ADA assignment as soon as practicable. A limited number of
qualified officers will be accessed into the Army Acquisition Corps.
   (3) Major (years 14 through 21). During this phase, officers should enroll in and complete Common Core ILE and
pursue a specialty-related graduate degree. ADA officers should seek further development in ADA assignments during
this phase. Branch standard assignments include (but are not limited to) battalion/brigade/division Continental United
States Army (CONUSA) staff officer, battalion/brigade XO/S–3, ADAM Cell OIC, CTC O/C, TASS/RTI battalion
tactical officers, and ROTC instructor duty.
   (4) LTC (years 21 through 26). During this phase, officers should seek professional military education at the SSC
level. Officers may seek assignments to senior command and staff positions. Additionally, many assignments in both
HQDA and joint staffs are available in the Individual Mobilization Augmentee Program for RC officers. The LTCs
with 3 years time in grade must complete ILE to qualify for assignment to any principal staff position at brigade or
higher levels of command. If transferring from another branch and designated to command at the battalion level, RC
officers must have attended a transition course and pre-command course under the auspices of USAADASCH. (Note:
Exceptional officers selected to command an ADA battalion — minimum two-year, optimum 3-year tour — may also
be selected for resident SSC or the Army War College Distance/Distributive Education Course.) Branch standard
assignments include (but are not limited to) battalion commander, TASS/RTI commanders, brigade XO, brigade XO/
S–3/operations officer, division staff officer; and CONUSA/JIIM/HQDA-level staff assignment. RC ADA command
opportunities are only available in ARNG units.
   (5) Colonel (years 26 through 30). Assignments during this phase should provide for maximum utilization skills in
ADA or functional area. Assignment standards include RTI/garrison commander, brigade deputy commander, division/
corps staff officer, and training support/combat division chiefs of staff. Senior staff assignments include (but are not
limited to) positions at National Guard Bureau Headquarters, U.S. Army Reserve Command, and on CONUSA/JIIM/
HQDA staffs. If transferring from another branch and designated to a COL-level command, officers must have attended
a transition course and pre-command course under the auspices of USAADASCH. (Note: Exceptional officers selected
to command an ADA brigade — minimum two years, optimum three years — may also be selected for resident SSC or
the Army War College Distance/Distributive Education Course.)

Engineer Branch
14–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose/mission of the Engineer Regiment. The Regiment provides the Army and the nation with officers
(commissioned, warrant, and non-commissioned) trained and experienced in providing operational and technical
engineer support across the full spectrum of conflict. Engineer officers perform full spectrum missions in war and
peace and are known for their expertise in combat, general, and geospatial engineering as well as the planning, design,
construction and environmental aspects of facilities and infrastructure.
   b. Proponent information. The proponent for the Engineer Regiment is the U.S. Army Engineer School, Fort
Leonard Wood, MO. Contact information for all agencies and directorates of the Engineer School can be found on the
public Web page at: http://www.wood.army.mil/usaes/. From this Web site, those individuals with a valid Army
Knowledge Online account can find more refined information on the Engineer School Knowledge Network. Support
for proponent functions is provided to the Commandant of the U.S. Army Engineer School by the Commanding
General, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Washington, DC and the Commander, Installation Management Command,
Alexandria, VA.
   c. Functions.
   (1) The Engineer Regiment. The Engineer Regiment represents the Army’s engineer capabilities in both the
Operational Army and the Generating Force. The Engineer Regiment consists of all Active Army, National Guard and
Army Reserve engineer organizations (as well as the DOD civilians and affiliated contractors and agencies within the
civilian community) with a diverse range of capabilities that are all focused toward supporting the Army and its
mission.
   (2) The Active Army. The active component of the Engineer Regiment consists of the U.S. Army Corps of
                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           127

Engineers (USACE), Active Army military engineer units within combatant and Army commands, and individual
officers, NCOs and civilians working inside non-engineer organizations including maneuver enhancement brigades,
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), Directors of Public Works and Housing in Installation Management
Command and the Deputy Garrison Commanders for Transformation (DGC–T).
   (3) The Reserve Component. The RC of the Engineer Regiment consists of the Army Reserve and the National
Guard and constitutes more than three fourths of Army engineer forces. The Reserve Component of the Engineer
Regiment includes a wide range of specialized units and capabilities. The Regiment is joint in its integration
capabilities and supports the planning, preparation, execution, and assessment of joint operations by complementing
and augmenting Navy SEABEE units, Air Force REDHORSE and PRIME BEEF units, and Host Nation engineer
capabilities. The Regiment is experienced at interagency support and leveraging nonmilitary and nongovernmental
engineer assets to support mission accomplishment.
   (4) The Engineer Branch. The Engineer Branch includes both the human resource managers in the Army Human
Resources Command and the Engineer Branch proponent, the United States Army Engineer School (USAES), under
TRADOC. Together these components generate and manage the centerpiece of those forces conducting engineer
operations: Engineer Soldiers. The Branch trains, educates, and manages Engineer Soldiers in a variety of military
occupational specialties. The mission of the USAES is to execute training, leader development education, and
personnel proponency while advocating to the Maneuver Support Center (MANSCEN) Engineer priorities in doctrine,
organizations, materiel, and facilities.
   (5) The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The USACE is the Army’s Direct Reporting Unit assigned
responsibility to execute Army and DOD military construction, real estate acquisition, development of the nation’s
infrastructure and management of water resources through the Civil Works Program. The USACE serves the Armed
Forces and the Nation by providing vital engineering services and capabilities, as a public service, across the full
spectrum of operations — from peace to war — in support of national interests. Most of USACE’s assets are part of
the Generating Force (see FM 1–01), but selected elements are a part of the Operational Army. Other USACE services
include wetlands and waterway management, environmental restoration, and disaster relief support operations. With its
subordinate divisions, districts, laboratories and centers, USACE provides a broad range of engineering support to the
military departments, federal agencies, state governments, local authorities, and foreign partners.
   (6) The Engineer Regiment executes maneuver, fires and effects; operations support;and force sustainment missions
which encompass military, geospatial and civil engineering and related planning, organization, training, operation, and
development. With the publication of FM 3–0 and the increased demand for stability operations, engineer requirements
across the full spectrum of operations have increased. Engineers provide support to Army and Joint maneuver
commanders and staffs at all levels, installations, and the nation at the tactical, operational and strategic levels. By its
very nature the Engineer Regiment is broad with many diverse developmental opportunities. Missions include but are
not limited to: mobility, countermobility, survivability, general engineering, geospatial engineering, support to battle
command, intelligence, maneuver support, emergency management in support of Federal agencies, management and
control of military construction programs for the Army and other Federal agencies, water and flood control, natural
resource development, environmental restoration, civil works, maintenance and repair of utilities equipment, mainte-
nance support to medical hospitals, installation of fixed or mobile power plants, interior and exterior repair of facilities
to include carpentry, masonry, plumbing and electrical equipment, interface between the engineering and intelligence
communities for planning and execution of geospatial-intelligence (GEOINT) and management of GEOINT operations.
14–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for the 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army
Values and the warrior ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the full
spectrum of conflict. All officers must be physically and mentally fit, maintain and display self-control, remain calm
under pressure, and adhere to published standards and regulations. They must be able to operate in JIIM environments
and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving their objectives. Our officers must be culturally astute and able
to use their awareness and understanding to conduct operations innovatively and courageously to exploit opportunities
in the challenges and complexities of the operational environment. Army officers must be premier warfighters who
possess the warrior ethos and effectively apply the four core dimensions of leadership: values, attributes, skills, and
actions. (For additional discussion of these leadership dimensions, see FM 6–22). The four core leadership dimensions
provide the basis for what an engineer leader must be, know, and do. The Army Values and attributes set the basis for
the character of the leader — what a leader must be. The Soldier’s Creed and skills developed by leaders establish his
or her competence — what a leader must know. The actions that leaders conduct and execute constitute leadership —
what a leader must do. This leadership framework describes a leader of character and competence who acts to achieve
excellence across the full spectrum of military operations. Further explanation of these characteristics can be referenced
in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of an Engineer officer. The Engineer Regiment requires officers who are well
grounded in engineer doctrine and posses strong Army Values, leader attributes, and leader skills. Additionally,
because of the technical nature of many engineer assignments, officers are required to continuously update their
128                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

education and professional certifications. Engineer officers who have an undergraduate engineering degree should seek
to become licensed as a Professional Engineer (P.E.) and obtain a master’s degree in engineering or a related technical
field. Those Engineer officers without an undergraduate engineering degree should seek to obtain a master’s degree in
an engineering related discipline and professional certification relevant to the Engineer mission, such as Project
Management Professional (PMP), Certified Construction Manager (CCM), Certified Facility Manager (CFM) or,
Geographic Information Systems Professional (GISP). To add the best value possible to the Army and the Nation,
Engineer officers must be lifelong learners who are experts in the technical and tactical domains across the full
spectrum of engineering.
14–3. Officer development
   a. Officer Development Model. The Officer Development Model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain engineer technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience. During these company grade assignments, officers gain critical tactical understanding that
engineers are part of the joint and combined arms team and technical experience in general and geospatial engineering
and construction management.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the Army’s Officer Development Model highlights the need to gain JIIM
experience and exposure. The breadth of tactical and technical assignments within the Engineer Regiment ensures that
Officers are provided with JIIM Developmental and Broadening opportunities at installations and in contingency
environments to achieve increasing levels of technical competency expected by field and garrison commanders.
   (3) Functional designation at the 4th or 7th year develops functional competencies inside or outside of the Engineer
Regiment.
   (4) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education as well as professional societies and
associations, is necessary for Engineer officers to become technically competent in combat, general, and geospatial
engineering and construction management, as well as joint and expeditionary operations. While the Army provides
support, Engineer officers must be self motivated to achieve lifelong learning.
   (5) The paragraphs below represent a career guide by defining those professional development opportunities
available at each rank that prepare the Engineer officer for further service at the next higher rank. It presumes a heavy
focus on tactical/maneuver support operations for company grade officers, in transition to a combined/Joint operational
focus coupled with varied technical requirements for senior company grade and field grade officers. A constant theme
throughout the career guide is the increased use of the self-development domain to produce technically and tactically
competent leaders for the Army.
   b. Lieutenant development.
   (1) Education. Engineer lieutenants are required to graduate from Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC) II to ensure
a strong foundation in officer common core/leadership training. After graduating from BOLC II, lieutenants must
attend and graduate from Engineer BOLC III which ensures a strong foundation in military Engineer specific training.
It is this strong foundation that allows for continued leader development in the operational and self-development
domains. Follow-on specialized Engineer and non-Engineer tactical training such as Sapper, Ranger, Airborne, Explo-
sive Ordnance Clearance Agent, and others is encouraged to support company grade assignments.
   (2) Assignment.
   (a) Key developmental (12-24 months) assignment as a Platoon Leader (Engineer or Specialty) should be held for a
minimum of 12 months.
   (b) Developmental/broadening. The following assignments for lieutenants are examples of developmental/broaden-
ing opportunities. A mix of these assignments and others like them provides company grade officers with technical
experience and the opportunity to lead, train, and support small units. This provides the foundation critical to continued
growth as an Engineer officer.
   1. Company XO
   2. Battalion Staff Officer
   3. Task Force Engineer
   4. Aide de Camp
   5. USACE Project Engineer
   (3) Self-development. Numerous opportunities exist for self-development at the lieutenant level. For those lieuten-
ants without a bachelor’s degree, planning for degree completion is critical. Opportunities exist for lieutenants to
become full-time students and also to attend online and off duty courses. Officers who have a bachelor of science
degree from an Accreditation Board of Engineering Technology (ABET) accredited institution are highly encouraged to
take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam to prepare for licensure later in their career. Completion of online
courses through Army Knowledge Online Distributive Learning, Defense Acquisition University, or learning a foreign
language through Rosetta Stone is encouraged.
   (4) Desired experience. Engineer lieutenants must acquire and master troop leading procedures, platoon and com-
pany operations, basic maintenance and logistical concepts, and administrative requirements inherent to platoons and
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             129

companies. Each Engineer lieutenant must also embody the Army’s warrior ethos and Values so that they can lead and
train Soldiers to win our Nation’s wars.
   c. Captain development.
   (1) Education. After selection for promotion to captain, Engineer officers will attend the Engineer Captain Career
Course (ECCC). It is highly encouraged for captains to attend ECCC prior to command. Options exist to attend other
branch’s Captain Career Courses for those officers desiring to do so. Engineer captains are also encouraged to pursue
specialized engineer training in project management, construction management, geospatial engineering and facilities
management, as well as tactical training such as Sapper, Ranger, Airborne, and Explosive Ordnance Clearance Agent
schools.
   (2) Assignment.
   (a) Key developmental (12-24 months). The following assignments are critical for Engineer captains: Company/
Detachment Command (Engineer or Branch Immaterial)
   (b) Developmental/broadening: The following assignments ensure that Engineer captains further develop the techni-
cal and tactical competencies and broaden their experience base necessary to succeed at the field grade level and
beyond. Most of these assignments will be available for captains after successful completion of a key developmental
assignment:
   1. USACE Project Officer
   2. Advanced civilian schooling
   3. Small Group Instructor
   4. Joint/ASCC/HQDA/ACOM Staff
   5. Observer/Controller CTC
   6. AA/RC (Engineer)
   7. Transition Team
   8. USMA Instructor/TAC
   9. Training with Industry
   10. Aide de Camp
   11. Exchange Officer
   12. Instructor/Writer (Engineer)
   13. JIIM assignment
   14. Doctrine/Training Developer
   15. Battalion/Brigade Staff
   16. ROTC APMS
   17. Recruiting Command
   18. Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT)
   19. USACE Field Force Engineering (FEST A/M)
   (3) Self-development. Numerous opportunities exist for self-development at the captain level. In accordance with 10
USC 12205, a baccalaureate degree from an accredited educational institution is required for promotion to the grade of
captain. Engineer officers who plan to make the Army a career beyond company grade should obtain a graduate degree
prior to promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel. To assist with this goal, numerous opportunities exist at the captain
level to obtain advanced degrees. The advanced civilian schooling option is a fully-funded program that supports
advanced degree requirements for certain branches and functional areas. Many universities award constructive credits
for military courses, which can facilitate earning an advanced degree at an accelerated pace. Additionally, an officer
can obtain an advanced degree at his/her own expense off duty. A full explanation and eligibility requirements for
these programs are contained in AR 621–1. Further assistance provided to Engineer officers includes the University of
Missouri Science and Technology degree options offered during ECCC. For those officers with undergraduate en-
gineering degrees, the master’s degree should either be in the field of engineering or a related technical discipline. For
those officers without an undergraduate engineering degree, obtaining a master’s degree in Geospatial Engineering/
Geographic Information Systems, Business Administration, Operations Research, Management, Architecture, or a
related technical discipline will provide the officer with skills necessary for higher level command and staff positions.
Captains who have passed the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam should actively begin preparation for the Profes-
sional Engineer Exam. Completing Project Management/Program Management and Geographic Information Systems
certifications as well as online courses through Army Knowledge Online Distributive Learning or Defense Acquisition
University is also encouraged.
   (4) Desired experience. Engineer captains must successfully complete a 12-18 month key developmental assignment
and should strive to complete a developmental/broadening assignment prior to promotion to major.
   d. Major development.
   (1) Education. After selection for promotion to major, Engineer officers will attend the Army’s Intermediate Level
Education (ILE). It is highly encouraged for majors to attend ILE prior to a key developmental assignment. Successful
completion of ILE qualifies the officer in Joint Professional Military Education at the level of JPME 1. For the most
130                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

competitive majors, additional educational opportunities following ILE exist, including degree programs at the School
of Advanced Military Studies. To prepare field grade officers for future, potential JIIM assignments, it is recommended
that majors attend the Joint Engineer Operations Course (JEOC).
     (2) Assignment.
     (a) Key developmental (12-24). The following assignments are critical for Engineer majors:
     1. Battalion S3/XO (Engineer and other)

     9. SBCT Engineer
     10. Division TAC Engineer Officer
     11. Geospatial Planning Cell Operations Officer/XO
     12. Transition Team/Provincial Reconstruction Team (TT/PRT)
     (b) Developmental/broadening. The following assignments are important to the broadening of Engineer majors by
allowing them to provide an engineer perspective in JIIM and other non-engineer organizations as well as to learn
about other functional areas of the Army. Some of these assignments will be available for majors after successful
completion of a key developmental assignment while others will be available before completion of a key developmen-
tal assignment. Time line management between the individual officer and the Engineer branch will be critical to ensure
the officer is placed into the correct position given Army requirements:
     1. Joint/ASCC/HQDA/ACOM Staff
     2. Small Group Instructor
     3. Observer/Controller (CTC)
     4. USACE Staff Officer
     5. USMA Instructor/TAC
     6. Aide de Camp
     7. Training with Industry
     8. Exchange Officer

     13. Director of Public Works
     14. IMCOM assignment
     15. USACE Deputy District Commander
     16. Field Force Engineering Team (FEST A/M)
     (3) Self-development. Engineer majors must continue refining and building upon their technical competence using
self-development. At this point in their careers, all Engineer officers are highly encouraged to have an M.S. degree
either in engineering or a related technical discipline. Officers with undergraduate engineering degrees who passed the
FE exam are encouraged at this point of their careers to complete professional engineering licensure. Officers without
an undergraduate engineering degree are encouraged to pursue and obtain professional certifications such as Project
Management Professional (PMP), GISP, Certified Construction Manager (CCM) or Certified Facility Manager (CFM).
To differentiate Officers by technical discipline, Engineers at the Field Grade level should maximize the use of DA
Pam 611–21’s Army recognized skill identifiers (SI) and project development skill identifiers (PDSI). Engineer majors
should consider using increased participation in professional organizations to stay current in emerging technologies and
ideas.
     (4) Desired experience. Engineer majors must successfully complete a key developmental assignment for 12-18
months. Engineer majors should also serve in a developmental/broadening assignment to further develop the technical
and tactical competencies and broaden their experience base necessary to succeed at the lieutenant colonel and colonel
levels.
     e. Lieutenant colonel development.
     (1) Education. After selection for promotion to lieutenant colonel, Engineer officers may be selected by a HQDA
board to complete resident Senior Service College instruction. Those not selected by the HQDA board should consider
1 Army modularity and linkage at the BCT level to the Engineer Modular Force makes this a critical assignment. The preference is for this position to be
filled with a senior major who has already served in a KD assignment for at least 12 months.
                                                      DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                                                131

completing the nonresident AWC distance education course. The Joint Engineer Operations Course provides lieutenant
colonels with a knowledge base of Joint operations needed at this grade and is highly encouraged. Engineer lieutenant
colonels centrally selected for battalion level command will attend the Army, Branch, and functional pre-command
courses.
   (2) Assignment.
   (a) Key developmental. All Engineer promotable majors and lieutenant colonels are eligible to compete for lieuten-
ant colonel level command during the Command Selection Board. Selection is based primarily on the officer’s overall
performance, demonstrated potential to lead larger organizations, experience, and qualifications. A centralized selection
board will select officers in a given category based on HQDA guidance. The AHRC will slate officers to specific units
within the categories. Officers being considered for command are allowed to select the categories in which they desire
to compete. The HQDA CSL designates commands into four functional categories:
   1. Operations. This includes TOE engineer battalions throughout the Army as well as brigade troops battalions
(BTBs) and brigade special troops battalions (BSTBs) within transformed BCTs. The majority of engineer lieutenant
colonel commands are in this category. Reflecting a new change in accordance with MILPER Message 08–168,
lieutenant colonel TT & PRT Commands will be CSL designated under Operations.
   2. Strategic support. Lieutenant colonel USACE engineer district commands are in this category.
   3. Recruiting and training. TRADOC engineer battalions are in this category as well as branch immaterial USAREC
battalion commands.
   4. Installation. Branch immaterial garrison commands are in this category. Engineer officers compete with all
officers considered in this category.
   (b) Developmental/broadening. The objective of lieutenant colonel assignments is for officers to continue to provide
a valuable contribution to the Regiment, the Army, and our nation based on their unique experiences and qualifications.
Officers desiring to contribute in the tactical arena have numerous opportunities on staffs at all levels. Officers desiring
to contribute in the technical arena have numerous opportunities in USACE and IMCOM. The following developmen-
tal/broadening assignments enhance the officer’s technical and tactical competencies in a wide range of skill sets and
offer operational and strategic value to the Army.
   1. Division Engineer
   2. BDE/MEB XO or DCO
   3. SR O/C at CTCs
   4. Corps Engineer (EN) Staff
   5. USACE Staff
   6. JIIM assignment
   7. IMCOM assignment
   8. Commander; GPC
   9. ROTC PMS
   10. AA/RC Support
   11. TRADOC/School Staff
   12. DGC–T
   13. USACE Deputy District Commander
   14. Joint/ASCC/HQDA/ACOM Staff
   (3) Self-development. Engineer lieutenant colonels must continue refining and building upon their technical compe-
tence using self-development. At this point in their careers, all Engineer officers are highly encouraged to have an M.S.
degree either in engineering or a related technical discipline. Officers with undergraduate engineering degrees who
passed the FE exam are encouraged at this point of their careers to complete professional engineering licensure.
Officers without an undergraduate engineering degree are encouraged to pursue and obtain professional certifications
such as Project Management Professional (PMP), GISP, Certified Construction Manager (CCM) or Certified Facility
Manager (CFM). Other areas where Engineer lieutenant colonels may consider certification and credentialing are
related to geospatial and environmental engineering, contracting, lean six sigma, and other strategic planning and
management disciplines. To remain current in emerging technologies and ideas, Engineer lieutenant colonels should be
active contributors to professional organizations.
   (4) Desired experience. Engineer lieutenant colonels are subject matter experts within any organization to which
they are assigned. A wide variety of assignments ensures a tactical and technical expert that is comfortable in all levels
of warfare (tactical, operational, and strategic).
   f. Colonel development. The professional development objective for this phase of an officer’s career is joint
qualification, sustainment of warfighting, training, and staff skill, along with the provisions of senior, seasoned
leadership, management, and executive talents. The majority of strategic-level leaders in the Army are colonels.
Colonels are expected to be multiskilled leaders; strategic and creative thinkers; builders of leaders and teams;
132                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

competent full spectrum warfighters; skilled in governance, statesmanship, and diplomacy; and understand cultural
context and work effectively across all domains.
   (1) Education. After selection for promotion to colonel, Engineer officers should complete Senior Service College
(SSC), either resident or nonresident. Opportunities for educational fellowships are also available and can grant MEL
SSC accreditation in lieu of attendance at an SSC. All colonels should pursue joint qualification, which consists of two
parts: an education component and an experience component. The education requirement is met by completing the 10-
week Joint Professional Military Education II (JPME II) course or by resident SSC attendance at any of the service
War Colleges. The education requirement for joint qualification is not waiverable. The experience requirement is met
by serving an assignment in a joint billet for a prescribed period of time (usually 22 months, but less for combat and
hardship assignments). Officers can apply for experience-based credit in lieu of assignment, but must demonstrate
significant interaction with joint and/or interagency actors/organizations. Colonels interested in experience-based credit
should work closely with their Human Resource Manager at the Senior Leader Development Office to ensure
compliance with the most current waiver rules and request format. Engineer colonels centrally selected for brigade
level command will attend the Army, Branch, and functional pre-command courses.
   (2) Assignment.
   (a) Key developmental. Selection for colonel-level command is extremely competitive. Engineer promotable lieuten-
ant colonels and colonels with less than 27 years of active Federal commissioned service are eligible to compete for
colonel-level command during the Command Selection Board. Selection is based primarily on the officer’s overall
performance, demonstrated potential to lead larger organizations, experience, and qualifications. A centralized selection
board will select officers in a given category based on HQDA guidance. The AHRC will slate officers to specific units
within the categories. Officers being considered for command are allowed to select the categories in which they desire
to compete. The HQDA CSL designates commands into four functional categories:
   1. Operations. This includes TOE engineer brigades throughout the Army as well as brigade combat teams and the
maneuver enhancement brigades.
   2. Strategic support. Colonel USACE engineer districts are in this category.
   3. Recruiting and training. TRADOC engineer brigades are in this category as well as branch immaterial USAREC
brigade commands.
   4. Installation. Branch immaterial garrison commands are in this category. Engineer officers compete with all
officers considered in this category.
   (b) Developmental/broadening. The objective of colonel assignments is for officers to continue to provide strategic
value to the Regiment, the Army, and our nation based on their unique experiences and qualifications. Assignments
include organizations and duties beyond those discussed in earlier sections. The spectrum of possible assignments is
broad and is characterized as highly responsible, important and requiring mature, skilled, and well-rounded officers.
The following assignments ensure that Engineer colonels further develop the broad range of competencies they have
obtained to best provide strategic value to the Army and the nation:
   1. USAES Directors
   2. USACE Director
   3. HQDA/OCE Director
   4. MANSCEN Staff
   5. ROTC PMS
   6. COCOM Staff
   7. JIIM assignment
   8. DGC–T
   9. Exchange Officer
   10. Joint/ASCC/HQDA/ACOM Staff
   11. NGA assignment
   12. Corps Engineer
   13. IMCOM assignment
   14. OSD Staff assignment
   (3) Self-development. Engineer colonels must continue refining and building upon their technical competence using
self-development. To remain current in emerging technologies and ideas, Engineer colonels should hold leadership
positions and be chief contributors within professional organizations.
   (4) Desired experience. Engineer colonels are subject matter experts within any organization to which they are
assigned.

14–4. Warrant officer development
   a. Unique functions, knowledge and skills of the Engineer warrant officer. The Army warrant officer is an adaptive
technical expert, leader, trainer, and advisor. Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and
education, the warrant officer administers, manages, maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment
across the full spectrum of Engineer operations. They support a wide range of Engineer and Army missions throughout
their career. Warrant officers in the Army are accessed with specific levels of technical ability. They refine their
technical expertise and develop their leadership and management skills through tiered progressive assignment and
education. The following are specific characteristics and responsibilities of the separate, successive warrant officer
grades.
   (1) Warrant officer one/chief warrant officer two. A warrant officer one is an officer appointed by warrant with the
requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position given by the Secretary of the Army. Chief warrant officers
two and above are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as
given by the President of the United States. The primary focus of warrant officers one and chief warrant officers two is
becoming proficient and working on those systems linked directly to their AOC/MOS. As they become experts on the
systems they operate and maintain, their focus migrates to integrating their systems with other branch systems.

14–5. Engineer Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. The Engineer RC officer plays an important role in the Engineer Regiment and in
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The wartime effectiveness of the Engineer Regiment is dependent upon the quality
of the Engineer officers in USAR and ARNG units, as well as the IRR. Additionally, the quantity and quality of
training that RC Engineer officers receive prior to mobilization dictates to a large extent their wartime effectiveness.
RC Engineer officer development, in general, should parallel that of their Active Army counterparts. Company grade
officers must develop a strong foundation through assignments in their branch before specialization begins. Even
though RC Engineer officers are limited by geographical and positional considerations, they should strive for assign-
ments in engineer units and maneuver enhancement brigades that yield the same developmental and competitive
opportunities as their Active Army counterparts. Company grade officers must develop a strong foundation through
assignments in their branch before specialization begins. There may not be a sufficient number of positions within a
geographic area to allocate Engineer assignments. Therefore, planned rotation into progressively challenging engineer
positions by RC commands is essential to producing the best-qualified and trained Engineer officer. To meet profes-
sional developmental objectives in the Army Reserve, Engineer officers must be willing work with their Personnel
Management Officer (PMO) Team to rotate between TPUs, the IRR, the IMA program, Drilling Individual Mobilized
Augmentee (DIMA), Joint Reserve Units (JRU), the IRR–Augmentee (IRR–A) program, Active Guard Reserve (AGR)
programs, and even apply for short Active Duty tours. National Guard engineer officers should contact their state
officer manager or their senior branch officer to ensure they can meet their professional development objectives. These
transfers are necessitated by geographical considerations, as well as the need to provide as many officers as possible
the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions, or to complete professional military education
(PME) requirements. Transfers within a component will normally be temporary, and should not be seen as impacting
negatively on an officer’s career. The success of an RC engineer officer is not measured by length of Service in any
one component or control group, but by the officer’s breadth of experience, assignments, duty performance, training,
and adherence to branch requirements. Officers may elect to apply for a functional area beginning at the rank of
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           139

captain. Engineer officers in the IRR may find assignments in TPUs, Individual Augmentee (IMA), and DIMA
positions in Active Army organizations, installations or HQDA agencies, tours of Active Duty in Support of Adminis-
trative Support (ADOS), Contingency Operations in Support of Administrative Support (CO–ADOS) annual training
(AT) or temporary tour on Active Duty (TTAD). Assignments in the IRR can also be used for completing PME
requirements. When IRR engineers are mobilized they are expected to complete Engineer Officer Refresher course in
residence before deploying.
   b. Life-cycle development model. RC officer professional development requirements are normally satisfied by
attendance at military schools combined with planned, progressive assignments in engineer units or positions and
continuous self-development. To be considered a qualified engineer officer at each grade, the length of Service in a
given position is not the focus; the key is the assignment diversity and sufficient time served during each assignment to
develop Engineer competence. The following standards should be met:
   (1) Lieutenant development
   (a) Education. RC Engineer lieutenants must successfully complete Engineer BOLC III by the end of the second
year (USAR) or 18 months (ARNG) of commissioned Service. They must also obtain a baccalaureate degree from an
accredited college or university. This is required for promotion to captain.
   (b) Assignment. RC Engineer lieutenants will serve in leadership and Engineer staff positions at the company and
battalion level for a minimum of 18–24 months.
   (c) Self-development. Officers who have a bachelor of science degree from an ABET accredited institution are
highly encouraged to take the Fundamentals of Engineering exam to prepare for licensure later in their career.
Completion of online courses through Army Knowledge Online Distributive Learning or Defense Acquisition Univer-
sity is encouraged. Additionally, these officers should actively participate in professional reading programs and
continued corresponding studies.
   (2) Captain development
   (a) Education. The RC Engineer captains must successfully complete the Engineer Captain Career Course through
either the RC or residence courses.
   (b) Assignment. RC Engineer captains will serve in at least one primary Engineer staff assignment for no less than
24 months, and additionally should serve as an Engineer Company Commander. Additional developmental assignments
that will increase the basic warfighting competency of the officer should be sought if available.
   (c) Self-development. For those officers with an undergraduate engineering degree, beginning a master of science
degree in the field of engineering or some other technical discipline is encouraged. For those officers without an
undergraduate engineering degree, a master of science degree in Business Administration, Operations Research,
Management, or some other technical discipline will provide the officer with skills for higher level command and staff
positions. Captains who are certified on the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam should actively begin preparation for
the Professional Engineer Exam. Completing Project Management/Program Management certifications as well as online
courses through Army Knowledge Online Distributive Learning or Defense Acquisition University is encouraged.
   (3) Major development
   (a) Education. RC Engineer majors will successfully complete at least ILE common core through RC DL, RC IDT,
or residence courses.
   (b) Assignment. RC Engineer majors will serve as an Engineer Primary Staff Officer at the Battalion or Brigade
level for no less than 24 months. Other jobs may include Director of Public Works (DPW), CFMO, and Division
Engineer.
   (c) Self-development. Officers should obtain a master’s degree from an accredited college or university, preferably
in an engineering discipline if the officer has an undergraduate engineering degree. Obtaining either a Professional
Engineer license if a degreed engineer, or other professional certification if not a degreed engineer, such as the Project
Management Professional (PMP), Certified Construction Manager (CCM) or Certified Facility Manager (CFM) is
highly encouraged. To differentiate Engineers by technical discipline, officers at the field grade level should maximize
the use of DA Pam 611–21’s Army recognized skill identifiers (SI) and project development skill identifiers (PDSI).
Engineer majors should consider using increased participation in professional organizations to stay current in emerging
technologies and ideas. RC majors should also consider enrolling in the Joint Engineer Operations Course.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel development
   (a) Education. RC Engineer lieutenant colonels must complete ILE common core for promotion to colonel. They are
encouraged to attend either the resident SSC or complete the nonresident AWC.
   (b) Assignment. RC Engineer lieutenant colonels will serve a minimum of 24 months in at least one Engineer
Primary Staff Officer billet at the Brigade or higher level. The most competitive and highly qualified RC Engineer
lieutenant colonels will have the opportunity to compete for RC Engineer Battalion Command selection. Other jobs
may include DPW, CFMO, and Division Engineer.
   (c) Self-development. Engineer lieutenant colonels must continue refining and building upon their technical compe-
tence through continuous self-development. At this point in their careers, all Engineer officers are highly encouraged to
have an M.S. degree either in engineering or a related technical discipline. Officers with undergraduate engineering
degrees who passed the FE exam are encouraged at this point of their careers to complete professional engineering
140                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

licensure. Officers without an undergraduate engineering degree are encouraged to pursue and obtain professional
certifications such as Project Management Professional (PMP), GISP, Certified Construction Manager (CCM) or
Certified Facility Manager (CFM). Other areas where Engineer lieutenant colonels may consider certification and
credentialing are related to geospatial and environmental engineering, contracting, lean six sigma, and other strategic
planning and management disciplines. To remain current in emerging technologies and ideas, RC Engineer lieutenant
colonels should be active contributors to professional organizations.
   (5) Colonel development
   (a) Education. RC Engineer colonels should successfully complete the resident or nonresident SSC or senior military
fellowship.
   (b) Assignment. RC Engineer colonels will serve a minimum of 12 months in a colonel-level Senior Staff Officer
position. They should strive for command selection to an Engineer Brigade or Maneuver Enhancement Brigade (MEB).
   (c) Self-development. RC Engineer colonels must continue refining and building upon their technical competence
through continuous self-development. To remain current in emerging technologies and innovative concepts, Engineer
colonels should hold leadership positions and be chief contributors within professional organizations.

Chemical Branch
15–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose of the Chemical Branch. The Chemical branch is a combat support branch aligned under the Maneuver
Support functional group in the MFE functional category, and is focused primarily on warfighting operations and
training that supports all aspects of combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD): nonproliferation, counter
proliferation, and consequence management. The Chemical Corps is focused on operations and training in support of
chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) defense; CBRN vulnerability assessment; biological and chemi-
cal arms control verification; obscurant and flame munitions employment technology and management; chemical
weapons storage and demilitarization; WMD force protection programs; CBRN foreign and domestic consequence
management; CBRN military support to civil authorities. Additional functions include scientific, developmental, and
material management activities for these programs. The branch provides the Army with a highly trained corps of
CBRN experts to advise commanders and staffs at all levels in the Department of Defense (DOD). Officers assigned to
the Chemical branch carry branch code 74.
   b. Proponent information. The branch proponent is the Commandant, U.S. Army Chemical, Biological, Radiological
and Nuclear School (USACBRNS), Fort Leonard Wood, MO, phone (573) 563–7691, e-mail: leon.
usacbrnsdotmlpf@conus.army.mil.
   c. Unique functions performed by the Chemical Branch. CBRN officers plan, employ and coordinate CBRN defense
systems from platoon level through corps and joint task forces in support of joint and combined arms operations. These
systems include CBRN agent reconnaissance systems, biological agent detection systems, smoke and obscurants
systems, flame weapons, thermobaric devices and munitions, CBRN decontamination systems and other CBRN hazard
detection and warning systems. CBRN officers coordinate assets and efforts for WMD force protection programs,
consequence management, and CBRN military support to civil authorities. They also conduct technical escort, CBRN
hazard characterization, monitoring, disablement, and elimination support operations; provide WMD and CBRN
incident emergency response; contingency support operations to combatant commanders and lead federal agencies;
provide site remediation and restoration support operations for DOD. CBRN officers work at all levels of command to
advise and provide protection from the full range of toxic hazards. CBRN officers are generally the sole subject matter
experts on CBRN defense operations within their organization. CBRN Soldiers and units are recognized for their
unique mission capabilities that include expertise in: CBRN vulnerability analysis; multi-spectral obscuration; sensitive
site exploitation; CBRN reconnaissance; CBRN decontamination; WMD force protection; and combating WMD, which
includes nonproliferation, counter proliferation, and consequence management. These traits make CBRN Soldiers and
units invaluable in supporting both foreign and domestic contingency operations. Additionally, CBRN officers perform
the following functions and tasks:
   (1) Command and lead CBRN defense and obscuration units from platoon to brigade, to include the Special Forces
chemical reconnaissance detachments.
   (2) Command chemical weapons storage and demilitarization activities/installations and ammunition manufacturing
and storage activities/installations.
   (3) Command and supervise environmental activities.
   (4) Serve as CBRN staff officers in tactical through strategic national level organizations including Army staffs from
battalion through Army level and in OSD, joint, other federal departments, and combatant command staffs. As staff
officers, CBRN officers will conduct CBRN vulnerability assessments; plan, conduct, and supervise CBRN defense
training and operations; evaluate CBRN technical and tactical intelligence data; develop plans for employing and
conducting obscurant operations, flame field expedient and thermobaric operations; plan CBRN reconnaissance,
detection, and decontamination operations, and plan and coordinate WMD elimination/sensitive site exploitation
operations.
   (5) Develop requirements, organizational structure, doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures for CBRN, obscura-
tion, flame, and thermobaric capabilities.
   (6) Serve as CBRN advisors to U.S. Army Reserve and Army National Guard organizations.
   (7) Support WMD force protection and CBRN military support to civil authorities. Advise civil, federal, state, and
international agencies in WMD force protection and response to incidents involving CBRN materials.
15–2. Officer characteristics required.
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army Values
and the warrior ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the spectrum of
conflict. They must be able to operate in JIIM environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving
their objectives. Our officers must be culturally astute and able to use their awareness and understanding to conduct
operations innovatively and courageously to exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the operational
environment. They must be dynamic, competent warfighters who can effectively apply the character attributes and core
142                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

leader competencies required of contemporary leaders. Further explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in
FM 3–0 and chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique skills.
   (1) Decision making skills. CBRN officers often work in an environment where time available for problem analysis
is limited but where sound and timely decisions are urgent. Information gained in this environment will vary in its
completeness and ambiguity. An ability to operate under stress, make decisions, and act under a variety of conditions is
critical to success.
   (2) Tactical and technical skills. CBRN officers must be technically proficient with branch and mission-unique
equipment, tools, and systems. CBRN mission success requires the proper balance between technical skills and the
ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactical skills at the right moment. These skills must be gained and
developed through repetitive operational and institutional assignments and continuous professional study and self-
development. CBRN officers must not only know their own unique branch skills, tactics, techniques, procedures, and
specialized equipment; but they must also know the uniqueness of the units to which they are assigned or are
supporting.
   c. Unique knowledge.
   (1) Officers must possess expert knowledge of Chemical branch requirements, combined arms, CBRN unit support,
and coordination principles. This knowledge includes practical experience in tactics, combined arms operations, and the
employment of all assets available to the Chemical branch, as well as general knowledge of JIIM operations and how
the Chemical Corps supports each of them. Officers gain this knowledge through a logical sequence of continuous
education, training, and experience sustained through mentoring. Individual officers sustain knowledge through institu-
tional training and education, experience gained in operational assignments, and continuous self-development.
   (2) Serving as staff and faculty at the USACBRNS allows officers with recent troop and CBRN staff assignments to
share their field experience with the school and students. In turn, officers from the school return to the field with an
updated knowledge of doctrinal, training, organizational, leadership, and materiel developments. With such an ex-
change of knowledge and experience between the field and the USACBRNS, these officers ensure that the Chemical
Corps, sister services, and the Army are fully prepared to fight and win on the increasingly complex battlefields
associated with the COE.
   d. Unique attributes.
   (1) Personal attributes. CBRN officers must know and routinely execute drills and operate within established
standard operating procedures (SOPs). Officers must be physically fit, flexible, agile, adaptable, and values-based if
they, as warfighters, are to lead CBRN Soldiers effectively across the full range of military operations.
   (2) Multifunctionality. CBRN officers initially will perform duties that are branch oriented; however, as the officer
becomes more familiar with systems and their specialty, he or she can expect to be called upon for a wide range of
duties including those providing JIIM exposure. Officers must develop and use a diverse set of skills as they move
between branch Table of Organization and Equipment (TOE) and Table of Distribution and Allowance (TDA)
leadership positions and as they serve in branch/generalist assignments. CBRN officers must be able to design and lead
CBRN organizations and personnel that enable the warfighter to retain the highest levels of combat power.
   (3) Situational awareness of the battle space. The ability to quickly judge terrain, weather effects, friendly capabili-
ties, and threat capabilities is vital. This transcends viewing the terrain, analyzing the weather, and knowing the range
capability of threat weapon systems and our weapon systems. It is the ability to visualize the battle space and know
how terrain and weather impact threat employment of CBRN weapons and how to optimize CBRN defense systems in
a multidimensional battle space.
15–3. Critical officer developmental assignments.
   a. CBRN officer career development. CBRN officers develop in the MFE functional category. A CBRN officer
should expect, over the span of a 20 to 30 year career, to be assigned to a variety of units and organizations and
developmental assignments. An officer will serve in several troop assignments in CBRN and other units from platoon
to Army level; Combat Training Centers (CTCs); TRADOC service schools; chemical weapons storage and
demilitarization; DA, DOD, field operating agency, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), interagency, joint and
combatant command staff positions; and Active Army assistance to the Reserve Component (AA/RC) positions. Key
developmental assignments for each grade are listed below. Some assignments by their very nature offer greater
opportunity to gain knowledge and experience. These positions impact the Army and the CBRN mission over the
longer term and are especially challenging. Officers should seek one or more of these assignments at each level of their
career. (See figure 15–1 for an Active Army career development model and figure 15–2 for a Reserve Component
career development model.) Regardless of the assignment, individual success is ultimately tied to performance.
   (1) Lieutenant.
   (a) Education. Newly commissioned officers will attend the CBRN Basic Officer Leader Course Phase III (CBRN
BOLC) at the USACBRNS at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. CBRN BOLC emphasizes leadership, tactics, combined
arms operations, maintenance, supply and physical fitness. Additional areas of concentration include CBRN decon-
tamination, obscuration operations, hazardous materials (HAZMAT), radiological operations, chemical and biological
                                               DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                         143

warfare agents, and CBRN reconnaissance operations. CBRN lieutenants also undergo training with actual toxic
chemical agents, biological stimulants and radioactive sources in the Chemical Defense Training Facility. Upon
graduation lieutenants are DOD certified at the HAZMAT technician level, prepared to lead platoons, and serve as
battalion CBRN officers. Lieutenants have the opportunity after BOLC to attend Airborne and other schools if their
follow-on duty assignment requires that specific training. Ranger training is authorized for officers with a projected
assignment to the 75th Ranger Regiment.
   (b) Assignment. BOLC graduates should expect to serve in a variety of positions ranging from battalion level
assistant S3/CBRN officer to CBRN company positions that will develop critical leadership and Chemical branch
skills. Typical duty positions include battalion/squadron staff officer, platoon leader (obscuration, decontamination,
CBRN reconnaissance, or Biological Integrated and Detection System (BIDS)), and company executive officer. These
positions build a solid foundation that is the bedrock for the remainder of the officer’s career.
   (c) Self-development. Officers who have not completed an undergraduate degree must do so during this point in
their careers. The Degree Completion Program (DCP) enables selected commissioned officers to complete degree
requirements at accredited civilian colleges and universities as a resident full-time student. Officers interested in the
DCP must submit applications through their chain of command to the CDR, AHRC–Alexandria, Chemical Branch,
OPMD, AHRC–OPB–CM, 200 Stovall St., Alexandria, VA 22332–0414 not later than five months prior to the
requested DCP start date.
   (d) Desired experience. The focus during the lieutenant years is to acquire and refine leadership and branch related
coordination, logistics, and administrative skills. Inculcation of the warrior ethos and Army core values is essential in
the development of young officers. CBRN lieutenants should also become proficient in both common core and branch
tasks. Before promotion to captain, officers should possess an in-depth knowledge of combined arms operations as well
as knowledge of CBRN defense operations in combined arms organizations. Experiences on a contingency deployment
or other real-world operational mission are invaluable in preparing lieutenants for detachment/company level command
in an expeditionary Army.
   (2) Captain.
   (a) Education. Officers will attend the CBRN Captain Career Course at about the third year of service to prepare for
detachment/company level command and duties in brigade or higher-level staff positions. Officers have another
opportunity to attend Airborne and other military schools en route from the career course to their next assignment,
providing their next duty assignment requires the training. Officers are strongly encouraged to participate in a master’s
degree program offering enrollment while attending the career course. If not already certified, captains will receive
HAZMAT level certification as part of the Captain Career Course.
   (b) Key developmental assignments.
   1. Following attendance at the CCC, captains should expect to serve as a CBRN officer in a Brigade Combat Team.
In this position, the officer has a major impact on the CBRN preparedness of that unit.
   2. Command is highly desirable for professional development in the Chemical Corps. CBRN company command
opportunities are few and, as a result, are highly competitive. Therefore, many CBRN officers strive for branch
generalist company commands, such as, battalion and brigade HHCs. Captains should aggressively prepare for and seek
detachment/company level command.
   (c) Developmental and broadening assignments. Officers who have served at least 24 months in a branch coded
position, preferably to include company command, can be assigned to positions that round out leadership and technical
proficiency listed below:
   1. Brigade level primary staff officer.
   2. Technical escort battalion company commander or team leader.
   3. CBRN BOLC/CCC small group instructor at the USACBRNS.
   4. OC/Es at one of the Army’s CTCs.
   5. Branch/generalist positions (for example, USAREC, Reserve Officers Training Course (ROTC) instructor, USMA
faculty and staff, or AA/RC duty). (For more detail, see para 15–3d.)
   6. Other nominative assignments (for example, JCS/DOD interns).
   7. Functional area (FA) positions.
   8. Advanced civilian schooling (ACS). (Based on FA, Chemical branch, or overall Army requirements.)
   (d) Self-development. An officer should dedicate time to complete the Chemical Corps Professional Reading
Program to gain a historical perspective on tactical, strategic and leadership challenges of interest to Chemical Corps
Soldiers.
   (e) Desired experience. Officers will declare a functional category and go through a Functional Designation Board
(FDB) at either their fourth or seventh year of service. This board will decide the functional area (FA) and which of the
3 functional categories each officer is best suited to serve. The three functional categories are MFE, Operations Support
(OS), and FS. The formal designation is based upon the needs of the Army, officer preference, military experience and
civilian schooling. A limited number of officers will be accessed into the Army Acquisition Corps upon completion of
detachment/company command. Captains should continue to gain an in-depth understanding of combined arms opera-
tions and become proficient in all captain level common core and branch tasks for CBRN officers. These tasks provide
144                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

the foundation of CBRN operations and leadership required to effectively serve in the branch at increasing levels of
responsibility. Captains require a working knowledge of command principles, battalion and brigade level staff opera-
tions, and combined arms and CBRN operations at the battalion to brigade levels.
   (3) Major.
   (a) Education. The CBRN officers who remain in the MFE functional category will serve in branch, functional
group (maneuver support), or branch/functional area generalist assignments. Their primary professional development
objective is to continue to strengthen Chemical Corps tactical skills and leadership; at this level officers begin to attain
JIIM experience and exposure. Majors will attend the resident Intermediate Level Education (ILE) common core and
Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course (AOWC); successful completion qualifies for the award of Joint
Professional Military Education I (JPME I). NOTE: Completion of ILE is required prior to 15th year of commissioned
service.
   (b) Key developmental assignments. CBRN majors should aggressively seek one of the following assignments:
   1. Battalion/brigade XO or S3.
   2. XO/S3 positions in other than Chemical battalions.
   3. Major level unit commander.
   4. Brigade primary staff officer.
   5. Tactical CBRN operations officer.
   6. Special Forces group or separate brigade or regiment CBRN officer.
   7. Department of the Army or joint staff officer.
   8. CTC OC/Es.
   9. Transition Teams (TT) and Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT).
   10. School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) will be considered “key developmental” after completion of
utilization tour.
   11. Operations Officer (01C coded position) in Maneuver Enhancement Brigade (MEB).
   (c) Developmental and broadening assignments. Other developmental assignments include: branch chief at the
USACBRNS; Army, Corps or ACOM/ASCC/DRU/combatant command staff; Command and Staff College faculty and
staff; service school instructor; duty with chemical/biological arms control/verification activities, or AA/RC support. In
addition, 01C coded position in a MEB (LNO Tm), Division (Div Plans), Corps (Assistant Chief of Staff, Civil Affairs,
Plans, Future Ops, Current Ops), and Theater Army (Protection Cell) are considered developmental assignments.
Majors will also serve in other branch/generalist positions such as ROTC or USMA faculty and staff and Inspector
General positions.
   (d) Self-development. Majors should continue self-development efforts to become experts in all aspects of the
Chemical Corps and Joint and multinational operations. Self-development should include correspondence courses (such
as the Defense Strategy Course) and civilian education. Officers should devote time to a professional reading program
to broaden their warfighting perspective. Officers should strive to complete a master’s degree or equivalent at this point
in their career.
   (e) Desired experience. For requirements at this grade, majors should have completed multiple developmental
assignments as a captain, assignments as a major in Chemical branch coded positions for at least 24 months, and ILE.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel.
   (a) Education. Selection for Senior Service College (SSC) is extremely competitive. Officers are selected to either
attend SSC in residency or to complete SSC through the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course. A
HQDA board centrally selects both of these courses. Self-development objectives should continue to build warfighting
and branch technical expertise as well as support the officer’s functional area when applicable. Officers selected for
lieutenant colonel in the MFE functional category should seek assignments of greater responsibility in the branch,
functional group, and branch/functional area generalist positions. The objective for lieutenant colonel assignments is to
seek positions that provide greater contributions to the branch and the Army that continue to develop overall JIIM
skills.
   (b) Key-developmental assignments. The two pinnacle assignments for CBRN lieutenant colonels are Battalion
Commander and Division CBRN Officer. A SAMS assignment is considered Key developmental after completion of
utilization tour. CBRN lieutenant colonels are centrally selected by a Department of the Army board to serve as
commanders of CBRN battalions, brigade special troops battalions, training battalions, ammunition plants, Chemical
facilities, depots, base support battalions, all 01C coded positions (MEB, Division), garrisons and recruiting battalions.
Commands are typically 24 months in length. CBRN lieutenant colonels are chosen to serve as Division CBRN
Officers by the Chief of Chemical at the USACBRNS. Division CBRN Officer assignments are typically 24 months for
CONUS and Korea, and 36 months for Germany.
   (c) Developmental and broadening assignments. Desirable developmental assignments for CBRN lieutenant colonels
include:
   1. Brigade XO/S3.
   2. Corps, ACOM/ASCC/DRU, HQDA, OSD or Joint Staff Officer.
                                              DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            145

   3. ROTC Professor of Military Science.
   4. Duty with chemical/biological arms control/verification activities.
   (d) Other challenging positions include duty at field operating agencies and division chief at the USACBRNS.
   (e) AHRC will award CSL credit for lieutenant colonels serving in specifically designated TT Team Chief positions
that have direct leadership responsibility for a team.
   (f) Desired experience. For requirements at this rank, lieutenant colonels should have successfully completed
requirements as a major as well as assignments as a lieutenant colonel in Chemical branch coded positions for at least
23 months.
   (5) Colonel.
   (a) The primary objective for this grade is optimal application of a colonel’s tactical and technical capabilities and
executive and leadership skills in those positions that best support the OSD, unified combatant command, and
multinational force requirements.
   (b) CBRN colonels are assigned to command and senior staff positions in a wide variety of branch and branch/
functional area generalist positions.
   (c) Key developmental assignments. The following assignments are considered key developmental for CBRN
colonels:
   1. Colonel level command.
   2. All 01C coded positions in MEB, Corps and Theater Army.
   3. Assistant Commandant, USACBRNS.
   4. Corps or Army CBRN officer.
   5. ACOM/ASCC/DRU, HQDA, OSD, or Joint Staff (division chief level).
   6. Army, ACOM/ASCC/DRU or combatant command CBRN officer.
   (d) Desired experience. For requirements at this rank, colonels should have successfully completed requirements as
a lieutenant colonel as well as assignments for colonels in Chemical branch positions for at least 12 months.
   b. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Officers above the rank of lieutenant can expect to serve in
branch/functional area generalist assignments that may or may not be directly related to the Chemical branch. In the
past, CBRN officers have rarely filled these positions based on the availability of CBRN officers. As the inventory of
CBRN officers dictates, the opportunity to serve in positions such as ROTC instructor, recruiting command, and
Inspector General may be available.
   c. Joint assignments. Field grade CBRN officers can expect to be considered for joint duty assignments worldwide.
After assignment to key developmental positions, majors and lieutenant colonels should aggressively seek opportunities
for joint qualification. Joint experience is important to the Army and professionally develops officers for advancement
into senior leadership positions. At this point in their career, officers should be working toward JPME II qualification.
   d. Other assignments. Chemical branch officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated
above. These other assignments may include White House/Congressional fellowships, National Security Council duty,
United Nations duty, and Chemical branch representative at Allied service schools. The spectrum of possible assign-
ments is large. These assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and important, requiring mature, skilled,
and well-grounded officers. Officers should continue to broaden their experiences by also serving in JIIM assignments
as well as functional group assignments (Maneuver Support).
   e. Army Acquisition Corps. Qualified CBRN officers may request accession into the AAC. An annual AAC
accession board selects a small number of CBRN officers following successful completion of command. These officers
are managed as AAC (FA 51) officers and work strictly within the acquisition arena in the Force Sustainment
functional category for the rest of their careers. An AAC officer’s career development is focused toward serving as a
program manager or as a commander of an acquisition command. Throughout their acquisition career, they continue as
members of the Chemical Corps Regiment. This link between the Chemical Corps and AAC should be strong so that
the best possible CBRN-related equipment and systems are developed and procured.
   f. Advanced civilian schooling. Some Chemical Corps positions require advanced degrees. An advanced degree can
provide additional opportunities for select assignments. The Corps annually sends officers to graduate school to obtain
advanced science degrees in disciplines, such as chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, and environmental engineer-
ing. Selection is strongly tied to the manner of performance, undergraduate GPA, GRE scores, and the individual
officer’s career time line. Officers incur a service obligation of three years for each year of school in accordance with
AR 350–100. Upon graduation, officers will serve a follow-on utilization tour in a validated position for two or three
years. (Further details on ACS can be found in AR 621–1.)
   g. Additional military schooling. Officers have additional opportunities to become proficient in several areas that
provide additional skill identifiers. Some of these programs and courses are Explosive Ordnance Disposal, CBRN
Reconnaissance and Surveillance Unit Leaders Course/L1, Technical Escort/L3, BIDS, Fox Reconnaissance Vehicle/
L5, Stryker NBC Reconnaissance Vehicle/L6, and CBRN Responder/R1.
   h. Branch detail officers. The following applies to branch officers who are detailed:
   (1) Under the branch detail program, some Adjutant General, Signal, Finance, Military Police, Transportation,
146                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

Military Intelligence, Ordnance, and Quartermaster Corps officers are detailed to recipient branches from three to five
years. As a recipient branch, the Chemical Corps receives officers each year from donor branches to fill its lieutenant
authorizations. See AR 614–100, chapter 3 for specific details on the Branch Detail Program.
   (2) Lieutenants detailed to the Chemical Corps follow the same career development path as basic branch CBRN
lieutenants. They can expect opportunities to serve at the battalion level as an assistant S3/CBRN officer and in platoon
leader and executive officer positions at the company level. These officer development opportunities are the foundation
for successful careers in every branch of the Army. At the end of the detail period, officers revert to their basic branch.
These officers normally attend a transition course sponsored by their basic branch before serving subsequent assign-
ments. (See chapter 3 for additional information concerning the branch detail program.)
                                     Figure 15–1. The AA Chemical Developmental Model
15–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
   a. Preferences. The Chemical branch has diverse assignment opportunities that allow for numerous career develop-
ment paths. The professional development goal of Chemical branch officers is to produce and sustain highly qualified
technically, tactically, and operationally oriented officers to lead the Chemical branch in combat, and on other assigned
missions. Assignments in the Chemical branch that provide experiences on a contingency deployment or other real-
world operational mission are particularly important in developing leaders in an expeditionary Army. Requirements for
individuals in the Joint Domicile program are listed in AR 614–100. Requirements for the Exceptional Family Member
Program are listed in AR 608–75. All Family concerns for individuals in these programs will be considered by
assignment officers to support these individuals.
   b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility
on the sequence of assignments. Typically, Chemical branch officers should seek assignments in the following order:
CBRN BOLC, battalion staff (as an assistant S3/CBRN officer), platoon leader, Captain Career Course, BCT staff,
detachment/company command, post-command assignment, battalion S3 or XO or brigade S3 (as a major), ILE, JIIM
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            147

assignments, HQDA staff assignment, troop assignment (as a lieutenant colonel) such as battalion level command,
division CBRN officer, Senior Service College, JIIM assignments, HQDA staff assignment and troop assignment (as a
colonel) such as brigade level command, and Corps or Army CBRN officer.
15–5. Duration of critical officer life-cycle assignments.
   a. Key CBRN positions. At the company grade level, because of the wide variety of assignments, no one quantitative
standard will define success. The most important objective for the CBRN officer is to become versatile and proficient
in the full range of CBRN operations. Captains should strive to serve as a company or detachment commander for a
minimum of 12 months, with a goal of 18 months. Majors should seek to serve in an S3 and/or XO position for 12 to
24 months. Selected lieutenant colonels and colonels will serve 2 years in battalion and brigade commands. Colonels
selected for garrison command have command tours of 2 years in length, with an option of a third year.
   b. Chemical branch life-cycle. Figure 15–1 displays a Chemical branch life-cycle with typical developmental
assignments.
15–6. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
   a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for CBRN officers. To do this the field grade
inventory must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support branch/
generalist positions, and to provide majors the opportunity to serve as a battalion S3/XO while attempting to stabilize
for 3 years.
   b. OPMS implementation. The numbers of authorized CBRN billets, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions
are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring additional information on Chemical branch
authorizations or inventory are encouraged to contact the Personnel Proponency Office at the USACBRNS or the U.S.
Army Human Resources Command (AHRC-Alexandria) Chemical branch assignment officer.
15–7. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for Chemical Corps
   a. Structure. The Army will make changes to the structure of CBRN organizations through the Total Army Analysis
(TAA) process. Other minor changes are possible due to the iterative nature of the restructuring and recoding process.
   b. Acquire. Officers will continue to be accessed into the Chemical branch through the United States Military
Academy, Reserve Officer Training Corps, and Officer Candidate School. Accessions are based on the needs of the
Army and officer preference. Because of the lack of branch-specific civil schooling and opportunities for relevant
experience, there will be few opportunities for direct commissioning in the Chemical branch.
   c. Distribute. Chemical branch officers will continue to rotate between TOE and TDA units in CONUS and
OCONUS with a goal of longer assignments at one station.
   (1) Stabilized installation assignments. Officers assigned to installations with ample professional development
opportunities may be stabilized for extended periods. Some company grade officers may be offered the opportunity to
attend CCC, and return to their initial installation.
   (2) Life-cycle units. Officers at all levels assigned to life-cycled units, which are generally the Stryker Brigade
Combat Teams (SBCTs) and Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), will remain in the unit for a minimum of 3 years. Branch
detailed officers will remain in their detail branch until after completion of the assignment to the BCT. Note: Army
Force Generation (ARFORGEN) Focused Manning (AFM) will replace life-cycled manning until the Army returns to a
boots on ground (BOG) dwell ratio of 1:2. The 17 Brigade Combat Teams currently under life-cycled manning will
complete their life-cycle during the next scheduled RESET Phase 2 period, at which time they will transition to AFM
(See chapter 1, para 1–9a).
   (3) Cyclic units. The majority of the installations will be managed on a cyclic manning system. Replacements will
be sent to these units and installations periodically to maintain readiness of the units. Tour lengths and developmental
positions opportunities can vary. Branch detail officers will remain on standard branch detail time lines.
   d. Deploy. Chemical Corps officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to deployable TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA
organizations, all Chemical Corps officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the range of military
operations. CBRN officers may deploy at any time with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national
interests or as individuals to support joint and multinational operations other than war, such as humanitarian and peace
keeping missions. Chemical Corps officers must prepare themselves and their Families for this most challenging life-
cycle function.
   e. Sustain.
   (1) Promotion. Chemical branch officers will compete for promotion only within the Maneuver, Fires and Effects
functional category. Knowledge, skills, experience, duty performance and adherence to branch requirements are all
factors that influence promotion. Promotion rates will be determined by Army needs/The Defense Officer Personnel
Management Act (DOPMA) goals.
   (2) Command. Chemical branch commanders will continue to be centrally selected for battalion and brigade level
command. Most CBRN officer command opportunities are in the MFE category. Commands are located in four
148                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

functional categories: Operations, Strategic Support, Recruiting and Training, and Installation. Officers have the option
of selecting the category or categories in which they desire to compete for command, while declining competition in
other categories. The results of the command selection process are announced in the Centralized Selection List (CSL).
NOTE: The CG, AHRC, approved the inclusion of CBRN Officers in the 02A (CBT Arms Generalist) CSL Installation
Command Category on 7 Oct, 2008.
   (3) Officer evaluation report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS. Starting
with captain, the rater will recommend the rated officer for the functional category which best suits his or her abilities
and interests.
   f. Develop. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in
TOE units with troops, staff/TDA assignments, and institutional training assignments. Self-development continues to be
an essential component of officer development. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly employ
CBRN and obscuration assets and have knowledge of maneuver skills in support of combined, joint, and multinational/
coalition operations. Development occurs through the Army and joint school systems as well. Other officer develop-
ment areas include ACS to support the needs of the Army and individual preferences.
   g. Separate. The officer separation process remains unchanged.
15–8. Chemical Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. Reserve Component CBRN officer development objectives basically parallel those
planned for their Active Army counterparts. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation through assignments in
their branch before specialization begins. The U.S. Army RC CBRN officer plays a vital role in the Chemical Corps
combat support mission. The RC comprises the majority of all CBRN units and more than half of the personnel
associated with the Chemical Corps force structure. Therefore, interaction and interoperability between the all Compo-
nents is essential. Reserve officers commissioned into the Chemical Corps are designated branch code 74 (Chemical)
by the Commander, U.S. Army Human Resources Command (AHRC-St. Louis). See chapter 7 for guidance on RC
officer development.
   b. Branch developmental opportunities.
   (1) The RC CBRN officers should strive for CBRN assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as
their Active Army counterparts, while understanding that career progression may often be constrained by the
geographic dispersion of units and positions. Therefore, planned rotation into progressively challenging CBRN posi-
tions by RC commands is essential to producing the best-qualified CBRN officer.
   (a) To meet professional development objectives in the Army Reserve, CBRN officers must be willing to rotate
between TPUs, the IRR, and the IMA, Army Reserve Element (ARE), and the Active Guard Reserve (AGR) programs.
   (b) Professional development objectives in the Army National Guard differ from the AR in that ARNG officers
rotate between TPUs normally within their own states. The ARNG officers also have an opportunity to apply for and
serve in Military Technician Programs (MilTec) and the Title 32 or Title 10 AGR programs.
   (c) These transfers between programs are necessitated by geographical considerations, the need to provide as many
officers as possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions, or to complete Professional
Military Education (PME) requirements. Such transfers will normally be temporary, and should not be seen as
impacting negatively on the officer’s career. The success of an RC CBRN officer is not measured by length of service
in any one component or control group, but the officer’s breadth of experience, duty performance, and adherence to
branch development goals. Officers may elect to apply for a functional area beginning at the rank of captain. AGR
officers will be boarded and assigned a career field designation as a senior captain or junior major. For additional
guidance on RC Officer development, see chapter 7.
   (2) The CBRN officers in the IRR may find assignments in reinforcement units (RTU), IMA positions in AA
organizations, installations, or HQDA agencies, as well as tours of Active Duty for Special Work (ADSW), Annual
Training (AT), or Temporary Tour on Active Duty (TTAD). Assignment in the IRR can also be used for completing
PME requirements.
   (3) Typical assignments could include the following:
   (a) Positions in CBRN TPUs or CBRN positions in non-CBRN units.
   (b) IMA program which provides officers the opportunity to train in the positions they will occupy upon
mobilization.
   (c) Counterpart Training Program.
   (d) Positions in AREs.
   (e) The AGR tours where AGR officers serve full-time in support of either the ARNG or AR. Officers receive
similar benefits as Active Army officers, including the opportunity for retirement after 20 years of Active Federal
Service.
   c. Life-cycle development model. Professional development requirements are normally satisfied by attendance at
military schools combined with planned, progressive assignments in CBRN units or positions. The Reserve Component
life-cycle development model for CBRN officers is shown in figure 15–2, below. In order for a CBRN officer to
achieve the desired branch experience at each grade, the length of service in a given position is not the focus; the key
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            149

is assignment diversity and sufficient time served during each assignment to develop branch competence. The
following paragraphs describe how company and field grade RC officers may gain and maintain Chemical branch
experience throughout a career. The desired goal for CBRN officer assignments is at least one assignment in a
Chemical branch coded position for a total of 24 months at the company grade level and at least two assignments in a
Chemical branch coded position for a total of 48 months at the field grade level. Officers should pursue the following
experiences:
   (1) Lieutenant.
   (a) Newly commissioned officers branched Chemical will attend the CBRN Basic Officer Leader Course Phase III
(CBRN BOLC) at the U.S. Army Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear School (USACBRNS), Fort Leonard
Wood (FLW), Missouri. CBRN BOLC prepares lieutenants to lead platoons and serve as battalion Chemical officers.
During CBRN BOLC, Chemical lieutenants also undergo instruction with actual toxic Chemical agents, biological
simulants and radioactive sources in the Chemical Defense Training Facility. AR lieutenants must complete CBRN
BOLC by the end of their second year of commissioned service. The ARNG officers must report to CBRN BOLC by
the end of 18 months commissioned service or request waiver from NGB.
   (b) A baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university is required for promotion to captain.
   (c) Officers should seek assignments as platoon leaders, company XOs, or battalion assistant S3s/CBRN officers.
These positions build a strong foundation for subsequent development as a CBRN officer.
   (d) Lieutenants should also become proficient in common core tasks.
   (2) Captains.
   (a) All officers should complete a Captain Career Course, preferably the resident CBRN Captain Career Course at
Fort Leonard Wood, MO.
   (b) Officers who have completed the CBRN BOLC or other branch basic BOLC III and are unable to attend the
resident CBRN Captain Career Course may receive credit by attending the Reserve Component CBRN Captain Career
Course that consists of a combination of distance learning course work and resident training at the USACBRNS.
   (c) Officers should seek assignments or experience equivalent to brigade/group level CBRN officer or other brigade
level staff positions. Company command is highly desirable for continued professional development. The Survey Team
leader on a Weapons of Mass Destruct - Civil Support Team (WMD–CST) is a very desirable developmental
assignment in the National Guard.
   (d) The CBRN captain should continue to become proficient in common core tasks. An officer should also dedicate
time to complete the Chemical Corps Professional Reading Program to gain a historical perspective on tactical,
technical, strategic, and leadership challenges of interest to Chemical Corps Soldiers.
   (e) The desired goal for CBRN officer assignments at the company grade level is at least one assignment in a
Chemical branch coded position for a total of 24 months.
   (3) Major.
   (a) The key requirement for development and progression at this grade is enrollment in and completion of
Intermediate Level Education (ILE) Common Core Curriculum.
   (b) Field grade officer development paths reflect a greater variety of assignment possibilities. Developmental
positions for majors include maneuver enhancement brigades (MEB), sustainment brigade, armored cavalry regiment,
or group CBRN officer; battalion XO and S3; and division or other major command level staff positions.
   (c) The CBRN majors should continue self-development efforts to become experts in all aspects of the Chemical
Corps, joint and multinational operations, as well as in a functional area when applicable. Time should be devoted to a
professional reading program to broaden the warfighting perspective.
   (d) Majors should strive to obtain a master’s degree from an accredited college or university, but it is not a
requirement for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
   (e) The RC CBRN Officers should apply for and if selected participate in AR Additional Professional Development
Opportunities, such as the Reserve Component National Security Course (RCNSC) or the Defense Strategy Course
(DSC).
   (4) Lieutenant colonel.
   (a) ILE Common Core is mandatory for promotion to lieutenant colonel. NOTE: RC majors must complete ILE
common core (CC) for promotion to lieutenant colonel (See chapter 7).
   (b) Lieutenant colonels that have not developed a breadth of experience as a CBRN officer at this point in their
career may do so through completion of the Senior Leader Qualification Course, sponsored by the USACBRNS. This
course is designed to fill in CBRN professional development gaps and refresh skills diminished by the passage of time.
   (c) Developmental positions include lieutenant colonel level staff positions, CBRN or other battalion level com-
mands, Regional Support Command Staff positions, and Operational and Functional Command staff positions. In the
National Guard, state Joint Force Headquarters staff positions and division CBRN officer positions are available and
desirable. Self-development objectives should continue to build warfighting and technical expertise and support the
officer’s functional area when applicable.
   (d) Assumption of CBRN position duties at the lieutenant colonel level with no prior CBRN training or experience
150                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

is discouraged. Fully successful performance generally requires the skills and instincts developed over time by practice
of the CBRN segment of the military art. (See chapter 7 for a detailed description of Reserve Component career
management and development.)
   (e) The RC officers should compete for selection at resident/nonresident Senior Service College.
   (5) Colonel.
   (a) Colonels who have not developed a breadth of experience as a CBRN officer at this point in their careers may
do so by completing the Senior Leader Qualification Course, sponsored by the U.S. Army Chemical School. Note: RC
lieutenant colonels must complete ILE CC for promotion to COL (See chapter 7).
   (b) The CBRN positions available at this grade include colonel level commands, Deputy CBRN brigade command-
er, Deputy Assistant Commandant-USACBRNS, NGB, USARC, DA and Joint Staff.
   (c) Assumption of CBRN position duties at the colonel level with no prior CBRN training or experience is
discouraged. Successful performance generally requires the skills and instincts developed over time by practice of the
CBRN segment of the military art. (See chapter 7 for a detailed description of Reserve Component career management
and development.)

Military Police Branch
16–1. Unique features of the Military Police Branch
   a. Unique purpose of the Military Police Branch. The MP Corps officers contribute to operational success by
leading military police in missions supporting full spectrum operations including offense, defense, stability and civil
support operations. These missions span the entire spectrum of conflict from stable peace to major combat operations
consisting of lethal or nonlethal engagement against threat forces. The MP Corps’ diverse capabilities are fully
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           151

integrated at every level and mission within the operating environment (OE). MP officers are developed to meet the
challenges and demands inherent in full spectrum operations. MP officers must understand: campaign plan execution;
cultural, ethnic, political, tribal, religious and ideological factors; and the dimensions of war (measured in maturity,
timing, infrastructure, and civil authority) that cross through all military police functions. MP officer experiences and
competencies at each progressive level of operations (tactical, operational, and strategic) are inherent in developing
leaders within the MP Corps. The MP Corps has five functions: Maneuver and Mobility Support Operations (MMSO),
Internment/Resettlement (I/R) Operations, Area Security (AS) Operations, Law & Order (L&O) Operations, and Police
Intelligence Operations (PIO). These functions are further defined in paragraph b, below, but introduced here:
   (1) MMSO assists in expediting the battlefield movement of combat forces, support units, and resources.
   (2) The I/R operations involve the evacuation, internment, and detention of enemy prisoners of war, high-risk
detainees, U.S. military prisoners, and dislocated civilians.
   (3) The AS operations help protect the force and local populace by providing security for critical sites, assets, and
high-risk personnel, and through the execution of aggressive anti-terrorism and protection measures.
   (4) The L&O operations provide for the stability and order within a given area of operation through the conduct of
law enforcement, criminal investigations, border and customs enforcement, support to dislocated civilian operations and
HN policing. Additionally, LE operations form the core branch competency of every MP officer; these skills are used
extensively in training and professionalizing indigenous security/police forces. During peacetime, military police
provide security to Army facilities and resources by providing law enforcement and confinement services. The conduct
of law enforcement on Army installations and facilities develops and enhances skill sets needed to conduct contingency
missions.
   (5) The PIO is critical to supporting, enhancing, and contributing to the common operating picture and situational
understanding of the maneuver commander. Criminal activity is many times inextricably linked to the capabilities of
enemy forces. The PIO ensures that intelligence developed during the conduct of the other MP functions is provided to
the overall intelligence effort. In peace, PIO provides collection and analysis of police information pertaining to the
criminal threat affecting military communities to the provost marshal (PM), garrison commander and senior mission
commander. PIO provides situational awareness and visualization across the operating environment and is essential to
the success of Army protection programs and efforts.
   b. Unique functions performed by the MP branch. Military police perform five critical functions, which support the
full spectrum of military operations in all environments. These functions and supporting actions are performed during
joint, interagency, and multinational (JIM) operations as well as during operations exclusive to the Army:
   (1) Maneuver and Mobility Support Operations. The MMSO function involves numerous measures and actions
necessary to support the commander’s freedom of movement in his area of responsibility (AOR) and the freedom of
movement in unassigned areas within the area of operation. Military police expedite the forward and lateral movement
of combat resources and ensure forces, supplies, and equipment are available to the maneuver commander when and
where they are needed. MP forces maintain the security and viability of the strategic and tactical lines of communica-
tion (LOC) to ensure the commander can deploy and employ his forces to ensure mission success. Military police also
support the commander and help expedite tactical movements by operating traffic control points (TCP), defiles, or
mobile patrols; emplacing temporary route signs on main supply routes (MSRs) or alternate supply routes (ASRs), or
conducting a reconnaissance for bypassed or additional routes. As part of the MMSO function, military police support
river-crossing operations, breaching operations, and passage of lines. They also provide straggler control, dislocated-
civilian operations, and MSR regulation and enforcement. In offense, defense and stability operations, military police
coordinate HN support to the extent necessary or available to ensure the unimpeded movement of all logistical assets
and maneuver forces.
   (2) Area security (AS) operations. Military police perform the AS function to protect the force and as an economy
of force mission freeing maneuver units to conduct their assigned combat missions. Providing critical area security,
military police play a key role in supporting forces in contiguous and non-contiguous areas of operation. Military
Police are also a vital force that locates, delays, and defeats enemy attempts to disrupt or demoralize military
operations throughout the area of operation (AO) to include mobility corridors and assigned areas of operations.
Military Police mobility, weapons systems and communication makes it possible to detect threats with aggressive and
quickly coordinated/synchronized patrolling in the AO, to include MSRs, key terrain, and other critical assets. Organic
communication enables military police to advise the appropriate headquarters, bases, base clusters, and moving units of
impending enemy activity. With their organic firepower, military police are capable of engaging in decisive combat
operations against a Level I threat and Level II forces either alone or augmented by other forces. Military Police are
also capable of delaying a Level III threat until the commitment of the Tactical Combat Force (TCF). Military Police
countermeasures may include implementing vulnerability assessments, developing procedures to detect terrorist, insur-
gents or enemy SOF actions before they occur, hardening likely targets, and conducting offensive operations to destroy
the enemy. Military police use checkpoints and roadblocks to control the movement of vehicles, personnel, materiel,
and prevent actions that may aid the enemy. Military police provide combat power to protect command and control
headquarters, critical sites and equipment, and services essential for mission success. They provide the maneuver
commander with a light, mobile fighting force that can shoot, move, and communicate against any threat. Major sub-
tasks associated with AS are base defense, response force operations, and critical site and asset security. The U.S.
152                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) conducts personal vulnerability assessments on designated high-
risk personnel (HRP) and, as required by regulations, provides personal security for designated DOD executives and
other key officials. Further, in conjunction with AS operations, USACIDC performs logistical security analyses and
vulnerability assessments on key areas. The analysis is provided to the appropriate commander to assist in minimizing
and reducing exposure to criminal threats.
   (3) Law & Order operations. The L&O operations consist of those measures necessary to enforce laws, restore
order, reconstitute indigenous police/civil forces forces, conduct investigations, and control populations. L&O opera-
tions include performing L&O, conducting criminal investigations and collecting police information. Nesting the PIO
function, military police analyze police intelligence and develop and disseminate criminal intelligence. Military police
L&O capabilities support military operations across the full spectrum by facilitating freedom of action and protection
of the force. The focus of L&O operations during defensive operations is on physical security, access control, and
antiterrorism. Stability operations lead to an environment which, in cooperation with a legitimate government, the other
instruments of national power can predominate. A criminal threat can have adverse impacts on military operations and
requires the commander to minimize that threat to forces, resources and operations: military police provide L&O
expertise specifically trained to identify and combat the criminal threat. The activities of L&O operations provide a
lawful and orderly environment for the commander. The MP Corps has created specialized skill sets such as CID
special agents, MP investigators (MPI), I/R specialists and other technical experts that enhance the success of military
L&O operations. Because of the broad scope of capabilities, jurisdiction and authority, uniformed enforcement of
military and federal laws and regulations can be applied in both tactical and non-tactical environments. Military Police
and USACIDC L&O functional capabilities are force multipliers that enhance protection of the force across the full
range of military operations through timely, thorough and unbiased investigations. In support of full-spectrum opera-
tions, military police provide agile, adaptive support to offense, defense, civil support and stability operations. Skills
developed in L&O patrol operations and contact with the populace in peace contributes directly to mission success
when operating at any point along the spectrum of conflict.
   (4) Internment/Resettlement (I/R) operations. Military police shelter, sustain, guard, protect and account for enemy
combatants to include lawful enemy combatants (enemy prisoner of war) and unlawful enemy combatants as well as
civilian internees (CI), U.S. military prisoners, dislocated civilians (DC), and high-risk detainees (HRD). Military
police provide trained and equipped forces to support I/R missions during Army and JIM operations. Working in
conjunction with other Army and HN assets, military police assist and direct civilians away from ongoing military
operations and ensure the rapid and safe evacuation of enemy combatants, civilian internees, DCs and HRD to
designated holding areas. In stability operations, military police work closely with JIM agencies/organizations and
indigenous assets to reestablish and train police infrastructure.
   (5) Police Intelligence Operations (PIO). PIO provides situational understanding and visualization across the operat-
ing environment and greatly enhances the success of Army protection programs. PIO provides relevant intelligence to
deter, detect, detain, or defeat threats against U.S. or protected persons, materiel, and information. PIO occurs in both
tactical and non-tactical environments through a network of law enforcement, security, and intelligence organizations.
PIO collects, analyzes, fuses, and reports information and intelligence regarding threat/criminal groups for evaluation,
assessment, targeting, and interdiction. PIO involves the evaluation of all available elements of intelligence including
human imagery, signal, measurements, and criminal intelligence, and so forth. PIO is the integrating function that
develops intelligence to meet specific requirements and is conducted in conjunction with all other Military Police
functions.
   c. Unique features of work in the MP branch. MP officers work at all levels of command and staff, providing daily
interaction with JIM law enforcement organizations participating in joint task forces (JTFs) and multinational force
missions. Additionally, MPs participate in a broad spectrum of protection and contingency operations ranging from
security assistance missions to combat operations. MP Soldiers frequently deploy as the contingency force in support of
U.S. policy objectives. MP Soldiers and units are recognized for their unique mission capabilities. These capabilities
include, but are not limited to, expertise in dealing with the demands of cross-cultural operations; universal acceptabil-
ity as a force focused on security and safety; and the ability to apply interpersonal communication skills in conflict
resolution using minimum force techniques enhanced through practical experience gained during post, camp, and
station L&O mission execution. These traits make military police units invaluable in supporting contingency and
nation-building assistance operations. Additionally, MP officers will:
   (1) Command and control MP and CID units and organizations.
   (2) Provide MP coordination and liaison at all Army, Joint, and Allied levels as appropriate.
   (3) Develop doctrine, organizations and equipment for future MP missions.
   (4) Serve as instructors at various pre-commissioning programs, service schools, and service colleges.
   (5) Serve as MP advisors and commanders to USAR and ARNG organizations.
16–2. Officer characteristics required
The MP branch requires officers who are skilled in leadership at all levels; knowledgeable in MP tactics, techniques,
and procedures; possess strong Army Values, leader attributes and leader skills; can quickly adapt to changing
dynamics when dealing with people and encountering complex situations; and fully understand the key leadership
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           153

actions that must be taken to ensure success. Additionally, there are branch-unique skills, knowledge, and attributes that
require professional development.
   a. Unique skills. MP officers must possess skill proficiency related to the individual and associated collective tasks
that are part of the five MP functions. This includes not only knowledge of the tasks, but the ability to execute them
under a variety of conditions and at progressive levels of command responsibility. MP officers must be versatile leaders
as they deal with complexity in both peace and war where decisions are always critical and high impact, from saving
lives, to conducting combat operations, to enforcing laws in a manner that will be upheld under court scrutiny.
   (1) Decision-making skills. MP officers often work in an environment where time available for problem analysis is
seriously constrained; and sound, timely decisions are urgent. Available information in this environment will vary in its
completeness and ambiguity. The ability to operate under stress, develop viable courses of action, make decisions, and
accomplish the mission, regardless of constraints is critical to an MP officer’s success.
   (2) Human dimension skills. MP officers must develop skills that allow them to deal effectively with various cross-
cultural, ethnic and human dimensional attitudes encountered in the majority of MP-related activities. A thorough
understanding of these attitudes and emotions is critical to MP success. MP officers deal with a broad range of
domestic and international issues that require application of the core human values of fairness, patience, and compas-
sion. Therefore, an effective grasp of the human dimension is pivotal in managing situations of stress or conflict, and in
the proper use of conflict resolution or deterrence.
   (3) Leadership skills. Effective leadership is the overarching trait required of all MP officers. It summarizes the
Army’s seven core values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage. Leaders
inspire Soldiers with the will to win and provide purpose, direction and motivation in all operational environments. MP
officers are expected to study the profession, becoming both tactically and technically proficient. Equally important,
however, they must continually demonstrate strong character and high ethical standards in order to infuse these traits
into their units and Soldiers. Lastly, MP leaders must take responsibility for their decisions, be loyal to superiors and
subordinates, inspire and direct assigned resources toward a purposeful end, and provide a vision that focuses and
anticipates the future. The MP officer must constantly refine these skills if he or she is to successfully lead MP
Soldiers.
   b. Unique knowledge. Army and MP professional development programs produce versatile and competent Soldiers
and leaders. The unique aspects of MP knowledge include the development of special qualifications needed to perform
such duties as provost marshal, security officer, physical security officer, corrections, and criminal investigations. To be
successful, MP officers must possess a high degree of technical knowledge about how the Army, as well as the MP
Corps, functions, and laws and regulations at local, state, federal, and international levels. Knowledge of the Army
should include general knowledge of combined arms; joint, interagency, and multinational (JIM) operations; and how
the MP Corps supports each of them. Branch officers must maintain a proper balance between technical skills and the
ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactics, techniques and procedures at the right time and place. These
abilities can only be gained and developed through repetitive operational assignments and continuous professional
study and self-development. MP officers must have the ability to operate independently and articulate the capabilities
of MP Soldiers to others across the full spectrum of military operations.
   c. Unique attributes. The skills and knowledge needed to function as an MP officer supplement core attributes
required of all Army officers. Army officers are expected to maintain the technical proficiency and flexibility necessary
to perform any branch related mission. However, the nature of the five MP functions often demands that MP officers
possess certain attributes unique to the MP Corps. The most critical of these unique requirements are:
   (1) Personal attributes. MP officers must possess exceptionally high moral and ethical values. The MP mission is to
enforce laws, directives, and punitive regulations. This demands that the standards of the MP officer be above
reproach. The diversity of MP functions, particularly those associated with collecting, analyzing and disseminating
information also require MP officers to continually seek self-improvement across a wide range of skills, from computer
applications to interpersonal communications. Finally, MP officers must also recognize the critical importance of
physical fitness and personal bearing if they, as warfighters, are to lead MP Soldiers effectively across the full range of
MP functions.
   (2) Professional attributes. MP officers must demonstrate professional attributes that reinforce MP Corps values and
traditions. Skill proficiency, dedication, teamwork and flexibility, coupled with fairness and respect for others, highlight
the essential traits demanded of every MP Soldier, regardless of rank. These professional attributes form the basis for
the trusts that the Army has placed in the MP Corps and is reflected in the mission to impartially enforce the law.
   (3) Multi-functionality. As MP branch officers progress in their careers, they can expect their assignments to
become increasingly diverse. Initially, officers will perform duties related to their branch. Eventually, as the officer
becomes more familiar with his or her specialty and the Army, he or she can expect to be called upon to perform a
wide range of military duties. This may include serving in various leadership positions, as well as serving in branch/
functionally aligned generalist assignments. MP officers may perform duty outside the branch working JIM opportuni-
ties utilizing their unique skills. Some MP officers may perform in a joint billet as an expert in protection, inter-
governmental or interagency working at the DEA or FBI in countering terrorism (Joint Terrorism Task Forces) or
multifunctional such as Secretary of General Staff, Office Chief of Legislative Liaison, and so forth.
154                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

16–3. Officer developmental assignments
   a. Branch officer key development. MP officers are a part of the Maneuver, Fires, and Effects functional category.
This is an environment which places great emphasis on leading Soldiers. For company grade officers, the focus is on
the platoon leader, company or detachment command, brigade combat team (BCT) staffs, MP brigade and battalion
staffs and PM operations officers as key and developmental assignments. In the field grade ranks, the focus is on
critical troop-related duty positions such as battalion S–3, battalion XO, brigade S–3, Division Deputy Provost Marshal
(PM), I/R unit staff, installation PM, or MP-coded division staff positions in the command posts, Provost or Deputy
Provost Marshal of an installation, Stryker Brigade Combat Team PM, and battalion and brigade command. Other
professional development assignments include instructor duty at the MP School or one of the senior leadership
institutions, for example, CGSC, USMA, and so forth, and service on Joint/DOD/Army/ACOM, ASCC, or DRU staffs.
Additionally, assignment to a transition team within the operational theater as a major has been designated as key
developmental. SAMS utilization tours are “developmental” (not key) assignments, only accomplished after an MP
officer attends ILE, completes 12-24 months in MP major KD positions such as BN or BDE S3/XO or Deputy
Division PM, and then subsequently attends SAMS. Regardless of the duty position, individual success is ultimately
and inseparably tied to performance.
   (1) Lieutenant.
   (a) Education. The MP lieutenant’s first objective is to complete the Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC) (Phases
I–III). BOLC emphasizes leadership, tactics, training operations, maintenance, supply and physical training. Additional
areas of concentration include MP L&O operations, communication skills, personnel administration, drivers training,
and weapons training. Graduates of BOLC III possess the technical and tactical skills, physical fitness, and leadership
qualities required to successfully lead a platoon. They are familiar with the five functions of the MP Corps and are
trained on the most critical tasks required of a platoon leader. These officers demonstrate a thorough understanding of
and willingness to live by the Army Values and a firm grasp of the attributes, skills and actions that form the
foundation of a competent and confident leader. Following BOLC III, selected officers may attend specialized courses,
such as the Interservice Nonlethal Individual Weapons Instructors Course (INIWIC), Special Reaction Team (SRT),
Anti-terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) Program Manager (designed for those engaged in AT/FP at brigade level
organizations or higher), and Airborne, Air Assault or Ranger School, to support follow-on assignment requirements
and to complement professional development. Key MP schools include Physical Security, Criminal Antiterrorism and
Police Intelligence Management, and SRT.
   (b) Assignment. The second objective is a branch assignment with troops. Consistent with Army requirements,
lieutenants can expect an initial assignment as a platoon leader in an MP company. Platoon leader is a critical
developmental assignment. All lieutenants should serve a minimum of 12-18 months as a platoon leader. While serving
as a platoon leader, lieutenants should develop a comprehensive understanding of Army operations and military life
that will provide a solid foundation for assuming the challenge of company command. Beyond a platoon leader
assignment, lieutenants should take advantage of opportunities to broaden their technical, tactical and leadership skills
in company XO or staff officer positions at battalion or brigade level (MP or BCT) or within an installation Provost
Marshal office. Participation in a combat or contingency deployment or other real-world operational mission is
especially valuable in preparing lieutenants for company or detachment command in today’s expeditionary Army.
   (c) Self-development. Platoon leaders should seek to observe/intern with a local police agency (40 hours, ideally)
and/or jail/corrections agency. Additionally, officers who have not completed an undergraduate degree must do so at
this point in their careers. The Degree Completion Program (DCP) allows selected officers to complete baccalaureate
degrees at their own expense while still drawing full pay and allowances at their current rank as full-time students at
accredited colleges or universities. Officers are required to have a baccalaureate degree from an accredited university
prior to promotion to captain. Time allotted for degree completion is normally limited to 12 months. Officers interested
in the DCP must submit applications through their chain of command to the Maneuver, Fires and Effects Division,
Officer Personnel Management Directorate, ATTN: AHRC–OPB–L, 200 Stovall St., Alexandria, VA, 22332–0414, not
later than five months prior to the requested DCP start date.
   (2) Captain.
   (a) Education. Officers are eligible to attend the MP Captain Career Course (MPCCC) between their third and
eighth year of commissioned service. This course prepares officers to command at the company or detachment level
and to serve in MP staff positions. The MPCCC trains officers to successfully function as staff officers and ensures that
officers possess the technical, tactical, and leadership skills required to successfully lead companies. Graduates of
MPCCC will have a firm grasp of the attributes, skills, and knowledge that form the foundation of competent and
confident leaders.
   (b) Key developmental assignments. Command of an MP unit (company or detachment) provides invaluable
leadership experience for an MP captain. Captains who have not commanded an MP unit will be assigned, if possible,
to locations that provide an opportunity for command for a minimum of 12-18 months. Command of a MTOE or
selected table of distribution and allowances (TDA) units are considered equivalent assignments. Because of current
and projected strengths and the number of available companies, MP company grade officers should not expect more
than one assignment to a command or other key and developmental position. Some captains may be offered a second
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           155

command at the U.S. Army MP School (USAMPS), USACIDC Protective Services Unit, BSTB or BCT HHC, or U.S.
Army Recruiting Command.
   (c) Developmental and broadening assignments. MP captains should continue developing their technical and tactical
skills. Maximum hands-on experience in a variety of MP leadership positions should be sought during this phase (CID,
I/R, PM, Div Staff, CS Units). Other valuable assignments for MP captains include transition team member, staff
officer positions at the battalion or brigade level, small group leader (SGL) or staff officer at USAMPS, Provost
Marshal (PM) operations officer at the installation or Army Command (ACOM), Army Service Component Command
(ASCC) or Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) level. Captains should seek out installation PM operations officer positions
when available. Attendance at branch-specific functional training courses is recommended, depending on timing and
opportunity. Opportunities exist to attend the following courses: Law Enforcement Senior Leaders (LESL) course, AT
Level II Program manager course, Criminal Antiterrorism and Police Intelligence Management, and Physical Security.
   (d) Captains are also eligible for nominative or generalist jobs, such as USMA faculty and staff, Cadet Command,
Recruiting Command or Reserve Component. Assignment to one of these career opportunities is discussed between the
Soldier and the AHRC branch assignment manager, and will be confirmed based on the professional development
needs of the officer and Army requirements.
   (e) Officers will declare a functional area designation at either their 4th or 7th year of service. (Officers may request
consideration for select functional areas at the 4th year of service; the 7-year functional designation board considers all
officer files for all functional areas.)
   (f) Project Warrior. A small number of captains may participate in Project Warrior, a program designed to spread
the expertise developed by Combat Training Center (CTC) observer/controllers (O/C) to the rest of the MP Corps.
After 12 to 24 months at a CTC, Project Warrior officers are assigned to the MP School as SGLs to provide additional
combined arms tactical experience to MP instruction and allow CTC lessons learned to be incorporated into the
training base.
   (g) Self-development. Though not a requirement for promotion, officers are encouraged to obtain a master’s degree
from an accredited college or university. A number of opportunities exist for highly qualified MP officers to participate
in fully funded and partially funded graduate civilian education. Degrees should focus in Criminology, Criminal
Justice, Criminal Psychology, Sociology, Emergency Management, Urban Planning and Development and Forensic
Science. A background in any of these degrees will better prepare future MP Officers for leadership in Law
Enforcement (LE) corrections, installation security and Forensics. Two fully funded programs exist, the MP Branch
advanced civilian schooling (ACS) program and the Army’s EGSP. These programs are generally focused for officers
in their eighth to twelfth year. MP Branch focuses ACS allocations in disciplines such as corrections or security
management. The goal of the EGSP, offered post-commissioning to officers with high potential, is development of
broader skills such as language, regional knowledge, diplomacy, governance, and so forth. Officers selected to
participate in a fully funded civilian training or education program will be assigned to a follow-on utilization tour
within an MP unit that best utilizes their degree (that is, Corrections Master to the United States Disciplinary Barracks
or a like unit). MP officers may attend a partially funded cooperative degree program while attending the MPCCC.
   (h) Attendance at the FBI National Academy (FBINA) is offered to high potential, Active Duty MP captains and
majors who have completed a baccalaureate degree and the MPCCC, and have successfully commanded. Subjects
taught during the nine-week course include: forensic science, criminal law, behavioral science, and management
applications. Upon graduation officers will be assigned to a follow-on utilization tour that best utilizes the skills learned
at the FBINA.
   (i) Captains should intern (usually one to three months) at mid-sized police departments and/or corrections agencies.
Internships will allow for officers to gain critical law enforcement practical experience as well as corrections
experience.
   (3) Major.
   (a) Education. Intermediate level education (ILE) for majors is essential for their professional development. It is
Army policy that all officers will be given the opportunity to attend in a resident status. In addition, officers should
continue to pursue other professional development goals to include completing a graduate level degree if their job
requirements permit. The three-month ILE Common Core Course will be delivered in residence at Fort Leavenworth
for most basic branch officers and Reserve Component (RC) officers, and a complement of sister service and
international officers. Immediately following the common core course, AA basic branch officers attend a seven-month
AOWC at Fort Leavenworth, focused on planning and executing full spectrum operations at the tactical and operational
levels. RC officers may attend through TASS, which has classrooms located in the Continental United States (CONUS)
and overseas, or can take the common core via an Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) course. Officers completing
the ILE Common Core Course and AOWC are Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) I qualified. History,
leadership, and joint instruction receive heavy emphasis throughout the curriculum. Simulations are used extensively to
drive the learning, and officers have multiple opportunities to practice their warfighting competencies and skills. Other
valuable qualifications include language skills and proficiency.
   (b) Key developmental assignments. Key developmental assignments include MP battalion S–3 or XO, MP brigade
S–3 or XO, CID group S3, deputy division PM, installation deputy PM (when authorized major or higher), brigade/
156                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

division MP Planner, Regional Corrections Facility (RCF)/CID Field Office commander (when authorized a major)
SBCT PM, and transition team operations officer.
   (c) Developmental and broadening assignments. MP majors should perform duty in strategic staff positions (that is,
HQDA, USAMPS, ACOM, ASCC or DRU staff) and maneuver unit staffs (that is, Corps, Division, BCT), and acquire
institutional experience to include I/R and CID experience. Other typical assignments include corps staff, ACOM,
ASCC, DRU/Joint/DOD/Army staff, ILE faculty and staff, USMA faculty and staff, USACIDC, Inspector General,
service school instructor, or Reserve Component (RC) support. Majors can also serve in other branch/generalist
positions. A very small number of officers are selected for the School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS). SAMS
utilization tours are “developmental” (not key) assignments only accomplished after an MP officer attends ILE,
completes 12–24 months in MP major KD positions, and then subsequently attends SAMS.
   (d) Assignments after promotion to major will be closely managed by AHRC. MP Branch is responsible for branch
assignments and generalist assignments.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel.
   (a) Lieutenant colonels are encouraged to continue their individual professional development by completing the
Senior Service College program. Selection for the resident phase and the U.S. Army War College Distance Education
Course continue to be done by a HQDA central selection board. Lieutenant colonels should consider attending the
LESL course early for added value to PM duties.
   (b) Key developmental assignments. MP lieutenant colonels can expect assignment to senior staff positions where
they will be employed in a wide variety of operational or key branch/generalist positions or Protection Functionally
aligned positions. Key and developmental assignments include division PM, installation PM (when authorized a
lieutenant colonel), MP battalion commander, MP brigade or MEB S–3 or XO, MP or MEB deputy brigade command-
er, MP School staff, or transition team commander. A HQDA central selection board will select a limited number of
officers for battalion command and key billet positions. Selection rates for command vary because of the number of
commands available and the size of the year group under consideration.
   (c) Developmental and broadening assignments. The MP lieutenant colonels can also be assigned to JIM/DOD/
Army/ACOM, ASCC, DRU staff assignments, Reserve Officers Training Corps or Reserve Component support and
should seek JIM assignments and internships with appropriate state and federal law enforcement/corrections agencies.
   (5) Colonel.
   (a) The primary objective during this phase of an officer’s career is to maximize use of his or her technical and
tactical capabilities, leader and management skills and other executive skills in positions of senior responsibility. A
wide variety of critical positions are available, to include Corps, ACOM, ASCC or DRU PM, service school director,
and JIM/DOD/Army staff assignments.
   (b) A HQDA centralized board will select a limited number of officers for brigade command and key billets.
Selection rates for command vary because of the number of commands available and the size of the year group under
consideration.
   (6) Branch, functionally aligned (Protection) and area generalist assignments. Officers above the rank of lieutenant
can expect to serve in generalist assignments, such as ROTC, Active Army and Reserve Component (AA/RC) liaison,
U.S. Army Recruiting, USMA faculty and staff, and Inspector General, which may or may not be directly related to the
MP branch but are important to the Army.
   b. Joint assignments. MP officers can expect to be considered for joint duty assignments worldwide. After assign-
ment to key and developmental positions, majors and lieutenant colonels should aggressively seek opportunities for
joint qualification. Joint experience is important to the Army and is essential to individual officers for their advance-
ment into senior leadership positions. An officer on the Active Duty list may not be appointed to the grade of O7
unless the officer has completed a full tour of duty (36 months) in a joint duty assignment (JDA). Although the
Assistant Secretary of Defense (FMP) may waive that JDA requirement on a case-by-case basis for scientific and
technical qualifications for MP officers, officers receiving scientific and technical waivers must serve continuously in
the specialized field or serve in a JDA before reassignment to a nonscientific and technical position. (See the National
Defense Authorization Act of 2007 for further information).
   c. Other assignments. MP branch officers may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated
above. These other assignments may include White House Fellowships, duty with the National Security Council, Joint
Chiefs of Staff Internship, or the United Nations, as well as MP branch representatives at Allied service schools. The
spectrum of possible assignments is large, and these assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and
important, requiring mature, skilled officers. MP officers should broaden their assignments by serving in positions in
JIM opportunities and seeking functionally aligned assignments within the Protection Warfighting Function (WFF):
MP, CM, and EN.
   d. Warrant officer MOS qualification, professional development and assignments. The only warrant officer military
occupational specialty (MOS) in the MP Corps is MOS 311A, CID Special Agent. The USACIDC is a Direct
Reporting Unit to the Secretary of the Army (SecArmy). Currently, the Commander of USACIDC is also assigned the
position of Provost Marshal General. Should the duties be separated at a later time, the subsequent commander of
USACIDC would not report to the PMG, but to SecArmy. USACIDC provides a full range of criminal investigative
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           157

services and support to commanders and directors at all levels, in tactical and garrison environments worldwide.
USACIDC plans, coordinates, and directs criminal investigations, crime prevention surveys, and personal security
operations, and collects, analyzes and disseminates criminal intelligence in support of criminal investigation, crime
prevention, and force protection.
   (1) CID Special Agents:
   (a) Investigate felony and other significant crimes of interest to the Army as defined by military regulations and
Federal law.
   (b) Plan, organize, conduct, and supervise overt and covert investigations.
   (c) Examine and process crime scenes.
   (d) Collect, preserve, and evaluate physical evidence for scientific examination by laboratories and use in judicial
proceedings.
   (e) Obtain and execute arrest warrants, search warrants, and DOD Inspector General subpoenas.
   (f) Conduct raids and task force operations.
   (g) Interview victims and witnesses, interrogate suspects and subjects, and obtain written statements under oath.
   (h) Develop, coordinate, and control the activities of informants.
   (i) Represent the Army’s interest in joint investigations conducted with the DOD, the Department of Justice, and
various federal, state, local, and foreign investigative agencies.
   (j) Testify before an assortment of disciplinary and administrative boards, at courts martial, in Federal District
Courts, and before other judiciary tribunals.
   (k) Write, review, and approve technical investigative reports.
   (l) Recommend crime prevention measures to commanders.
   (m) Conduct personal security vulnerability assessments for designated senior Army officials.
   (n) Provide personal security for designated DOD executives, visiting foreign officials, and other key officials.
   (o) Conduct hostage negotiations as members of Crisis Management Teams.
   (p) Supervise investigative case management and overall investigative operations.
   (q) Provide technical guidance and direction to subordinate investigative units.
   (r) Collect, analyze and disseminate criminal intelligence to commanders in support of their force protection efforts.
   (s) Develop, conduct, and supervise student instruction in criminal investigative methods and techniques.
   (t) Professional military education includes, but is not limited to, Child Abuse Prevention and Investigation Tech-
niques, Hostage Negotiations, Advanced Crime Scenes, WMD investigator, Criminal Antiterrorism and Police Intelli-
gence Management, fraud, and computer crime courses.
   (2) Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) qualification and development.
   (a) MOS qualification. At all warrant officer grades, CID Special Agents must be U.S. citizens and qualify for a
security clearance of Top Secret. The qualifications outlined in paragraph 2–2b of AR 195–3 must be met and the
Commander, USACIDC, must accredit CID Special Agents.
   1. Basic level MOS qualification (WO1). In addition to the general MOS qualifications, CID special agents must
complete the WOCS and the MP WOBC. This course emphasizes the necessary skills to become a team chief that
include leadership, investigative and technical skills, and physical training.
   2. Advanced level MOS qualification (CW2/CW3). Continuation of the CID special agent career path provides for
completion of the MP Warrant Officer Advance Course (WOAC). This course emphasizes the necessary skills to be a
special agent-in-charge, battalion, group, brigade, and major command operations officers and focuses on broad
managerial skill sets required to manage geographically separated and remote organizational assets. This course
provides specific technical and tactical training required at the mid-level supervisory echelon.
   3. Senior-level MOS qualification (CW4). Each selection to higher grade provides for additional training require-
ments. The CID Special Agents are required to complete the Warrant Officer Staff Course (WOSC), which is a branch-
immaterial course provided to all Army warrant officers of this grade. This course provides specific training that
focuses on the ability to work in senior advisory or supervisory positions and to perform Army staff operations
functions.
   4. Master level MOS qualification (CW5). The CID special agents, who acquire the master level for warrant
officers, must complete the WOSSC, which is a branch-immaterial course provided to all Army warrant officers of this
grade. Warrant officers at this skill level receive specific training that focuses on senior level staff skills, leadership,
mentorship, and organizational operations at the strategic level.
   (b) Professional development.
   1. Warrant officer 1 (WO1).
   a. The primary performance objective for the new MP warrant officer (WO1) special agent (SA) is a leadership role
within a CID unit. Consistent with Army requirements, the WO1 SA can expect an initial assignment as an assistant
CID team chief at a large installation or as a team chief at a small installation. Each WO1 can also expect to be the
senior member of a two-person tactical, deployable investigative team. Each WO1 should continue to develop a
comprehensive understanding of investigative techniques, tactics, and procedures. Each WO1 should develop an
158                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

understanding of CID and Army operations that will provide a solid foundation for assuming duties as a detachment
commander/special agent-in-charge.
   b. The WO1 must have experience as an enlisted CID Special Agent (MOS 31D) and have graduated from WOCS.
The new warrant officer’s first objective is to complete WOBC. Following WOBC, selected WO1s may attend
specialized courses, such as Airborne or Air Assault School, Hostage Negotiation School, or Protective Services
Training to support follow-on assignment requirements and to continue professional development needs.
   c. Warrant officers who obtained a waiver and have not completed an undergraduate degree should continue to work
towards that goal. Qualification for selection as a warrant officer candidate in MOS 311A requires a waiver for any
applicant who has not already earned a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university.
   2. Chief warrant officer 2 (CW2).
   a. CW2 special agents (SA) will continue to fill junior leadership roles within a CID unit. The primary performance
objective as a CW2 will be a successful tour as a Team Chief. The CW2 SAs can expect to continue to be the senior
member of a two-person tactical, deployable investigative team. Senior CW2 SAs may also be designated the leader of
an eight special agent, deployable investigative detachment.
   b. The CW2s should continue developing as leaders and investigators. They should seek functional training and
operational assignments that enhance specific leadership and investigative skills. Examples of training opportunities
include the FBINA, Canadian Police Academy, and advanced training in specific investigative skills that focus on
advanced investigative techniques, such as drug suppression, economic crime, protective services, interviews and
interrogations, forensics, and police intelligence operations or criminal intelligence management. Assignments such as
personal security officer (PSO) and operations staff officer at a CID Battalion or Brigade are available. Assignments as
criminal intelligence (police intelligence) operations officers within Maneuver Enhancement Brigades (MEB) are also
available. A limited number of opportunities exist for highly qualified CW2s to participate in fully funded advanced
civil schooling as forensic science officers, or for training and utilization as a polygraph examiner. Staff and specialty
training and assignments should normally only be considered after a successful tour as a team chief. Assignments for a
very select few superior CW2s, as an instructor at the U.S. Army Military Police School (USAMPS) are available.
CW2s must complete the Action Officers Development Course prior to attending the Warrant Officer Advanced
Course. Every CW2 eligible for selection to chief warrant officer 3 (CW3) is expected to have completed undergradu-
ate studies and have earned a baccalaureate degree.
   3. Chief warrant officer 3 (CW3).
   a. The primary performance objective for the CW3 is a successful tour as a special agent-in-charge (SAC). Any
CW3 who has not served as a SAC should be selected for a SAC position, based on the availability of that position and
the needs of the Army. Other duties include staff and specialty positions, such as personal security officer, Police
Intelligence Operations officer, Battalion, Group, Brigade, or USACIDC staff officer, MP School Instructor, and
polygraph examiner.
   b. Not later than one year after promotion to CW3, the warrant officer special agent should complete WOAC. This
course must be completed prior to promotion to CW4. CW3s should continue to seek functional training and
operational assignments that enhance specific leadership and investigative skills. They remain eligible for training
opportunities like the FBINA, Canadian Police Academy, and advanced training in specific investigative skills, such as
forensic science officers. Those selected for duties as a SAC will be eligible to attend the annual SAC training course.
assignments as police intelligence operations officers within Maneuver Enhancement Brigades are also available.
Assignments to the USAMPS Directorate of Training as branch chiefs are also available. A limited number of
opportunities remain for highly qualified CW3s to participate in fully funded advanced civil schooling such as forensic
science officers, training, and utilization as a polygraph examiner, or as a computer crimes investigator. In addition,
CW3s should continue to pursue other professional development goals to include work towards a graduate level degree.
Regardless of the duty position, individual success is ultimately and inseparably tied to performance.
   4. Chief warrant officer 4 (CW4).
   a. The primary performance objective for the CW4 is a successful tour as a CID Battalion Operations officer or a
large CID Detachment commander. Field Investigative Unit operations officer, Police Intelligence operations officer,
and Protective Service Unit operations officer are additional critical CW4 assignments. CW4s can expect assignments
to senior staff or supervisory positions where they will be employed in a variety of operational or instructional
positions.
   b. Not later than one year after promotion to CW4, he or she should complete WOSC. This course must be
completed prior to promotion to CW5. In addition, CW4 should continue to pursue other professional development
goals to include completing a graduate level degree. The CW4s should be given consideration for technical operational
assignments in environments for exposure and experience.
   5. Chief warrant officer 5 (CW5).
   a. The primary objective in utilizing the CW5 is to maximize his or her technical and tactical capabilities, leadership
and management skills, and other executive skills in positions of the highest responsibility in the warrant officer ranks.
Critical positions include Battalion Operations Officer, Group Operations Officer, Senior Special Agent on the
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           159

Inspector General Team, and USACIDC Chief of Investigative Operations and Policy & Command Chief WO Advisor
to the CG, CID and, Regimental Chief Warrant Officer of the MP Corps Regiment.
   b. The CID SA selected for promotion to CW5 will be scheduled to attend the WOSSC. CW5s should complete a
graduate level degree if they have not already done so. CW5s must be given consideration for technical operational
assignments in JIM environments for exposure and experience for a minimum of six months. Designees for Regimental
Chief Warrant Officer of the MP Corps Regiment will be required to complete the Army Force Management Course.
16–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
   a. MP Corps Branch officer preferences and precedence.
   (1) Preferences. The MP branch has diverse assignment opportunities that allow for numerous career development
paths for commissioned officers. The goal of the professional development of MP branch officers is to produce and
sustain highly qualified, tactically and operationally oriented officers to lead MP Soldiers during wartime, contingency,
and other assigned missions. Assignments in the MP Corps will develop the officer’s ability to achieve that goal.
Requests from officers for assignments that do not contribute to achieving that goal will likely be rejected. MP field
grade officers should look at opportunities to perform as a strategic leader on a Joint Staff.
   (2) Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility
on the sequence of assignments. Typically, MP branch officers should seek the following assignments: MP BOLC,
platoon leader, staff officer in an MP battalion or brigade, installation PM operations officer; MPCCC, company or
detachment command, battalion, brigade or division staff, nominative assignments, JIM opportunities, ILE, battalion
S–3 or XO or brigade S–3 (as a major), battalion command, Division PM, Installation PM, SSC, brigade command,
and ACOM, ASCC or DRU PM.
   b. MP warrant officer CID special agent preferences and precedence.
   (1) Preferences. The MP warrant officer has diverse assignment opportunities, which allow for numerous career
development paths. The goal of the professional development of MP warrant officers is to produce and sustain highly
qualified and tactically and operationally oriented warrant officers to lead CID special agents and other Soldiers during
wartime and on other assigned investigative missions in tactical and garrison environments for the joint and expedition-
ary Army force. Assignment within the MP Corps and the USACIDC will develop the warrant officer’s ability to
achieve that goal. Requests from warrant officers for assignments which do not contribute to achieving that goal will
likely be rejected.
   (2) Precedence. Assignment to developmental leadership positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility
on the sequence of assignments. Typically, MP warrant officers should seek assignments and training in the following
order: Warrant Officer Candidate School, MP Warrant Officer Basic Course, CID Team Chief, Special Agent-in-
Charge of a small CID office, MP Warrant Officer Advanced Course, Special Agent-in-Charge of a large CID office or
CID detachment commander, MP School instructor, Battalion/Group investigative staff officer, MP Warrant Officer
Staff Course, battalion operations officer, USACIDC investigative staff officer, MP School Division Chief, Warrant
Officer Senior Staff Course, group or USACIDC level investigative operations officer, Command Chief Warrant
Officer Advisor to the CG of USACIDC, and Regimental Warrant Officer of the MP Corps Regiment.
   c. MP branch officer assignments. MP officers should use the chart at figure 16-1 to determine key and develop-
mental positions throughout their careers.
160                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

                                 Figure 16–1. The AA Military Police Developmental Model
  d. Requirements. Officers should meet certain standards in terms of schooling, operational assignments, and manner
of performance within the MP Corps at each rank. Meeting these standards ensures that the officer has acquired the
skills, knowledge and attributes to remain proficient in the MP Corps at that rank. With this proficiency, the officer is
qualified for promotion/retention in the branch. These standards for schooling and operational assignments best prepare
an officer for command or positions of greater responsibility in the branch. All MP branch officers should seek the
opportunity to perform in key and developmental assignments at each rank/grade.
  e. Company grade key and developmental assignments. Because of the wide variety of MP missions and units, no
one quantitative standard will define success. The most important objective for MP Corps company grade officers is to
have served in leadership positions (preferably Platoon Leader and Company Commander). Platoon Leader and
Company Command positions are critical in that they ensure the MP officer is able to lead, train and care for Soldiers.
Additionally, the MP officer must be well rounded in the basic techniques needed to execute wartime missions.
Company grade officers should complete the following requirements within the MP Corps.
  (1) Lieutenant. As an MP lieutenant, the officer must complete MP BOLC and one assignment as a platoon leader.
Lieutenants should serve as platoon leaders for a minimum of 12 months, with a goal of 18–24 months.
  (2) Captain. As an MP captain, the officer must meet the following requirements:
  (a) Complete the MP Captain Career Course. Officers who are branch transferred after successful completion of any
branch CCC will be considered to have met this educational prerequisite.
  (b) Captains should serve as a company or detachment commander for a minimum of 12 months, with a goal of
18–24 months.
  (3) Major. As an MP major, the officer should meet the following requirements:
  (a) Complete ILE.
  (b) Serve a minimum of 12 months, with a goal of 18–24 months, as a battalion or brigade S–3 or XO, deputy
division PM, SBCT PM, RCF/CID Field Office commander (when authorized a major), Installation Deputy PM,
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           161

branch-related position on joint/DOD/Army ACOM, ASCC, or DRU or multinational staffs, instructor at a branch
service school, transition team member, or in any MP branch position that is coded at the rank of major or above.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel. As an MP lieutenant colonel, the officer should serve a minimum of 12 months, with a goal
of 18–24 months, as a battalion commander, division provost marshal, installation Provost Marshal (when authorized a
lieutenant colonel), brigade S–3 or XO, deputy brigade commander, transition team commander, branch related
position on joint/DOD/Army/ACOM, ASCC, or DRU or multinational staffs, or in any MP branch position which is
coded at the rank of lieutenant colonel or above. If selected by a HQDA board, MP lieutenant colonels should
complete resident or nonresident SSC.
   (5) Colonel. As an MP Corps colonel, the officer should serve a minimum of 12 months, with a goal of 18-24
months, in any one of the positions listed below that is coded at the rank of colonel in the MP Branch:
   (a) Brigade commander.
   (b) Branch-related positions on joint/DOD/Army/ACOM, ASCC, or DRU or multinational staffs; ACOM, ASCC, or
DRU or corps PM; or senior director at USAMPS or other service schools.
   (c) Staff or faculty position at an ILE-equivalent service school or USMA.
   (d) Division chief or higher position on joint/DOD/Army/ACOM, ASCC, DRU or interagency, staff.
   (e) Garrison commander or installation chief of staff.
   (f) Nominative or specialized position outside DOD.
   (g) MP Warrant officer CID special agent assignments.
   (h) Figure 16–2 displays an MP branch time line with key and developmental positions for warrant officers.
Additionally, it identifies those positions that serve as key and developmental jobs for MP warrant officers.

162                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

16–5. Requirements, authorizations and inventory
The number of authorized MP billets, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions are made, and actions to
implement them are taken. The goal of the MP Corps is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for MP officers while
providing an agile, adaptive, and ready force to execute all assigned missions. To do this, the field grade inventory
must be optimized in order to meet branch authorizations, to provide sufficient flexibility to support branch/functional
area generalist positions, and to provide majors with up to two years of key and developmental position time. Officers
desiring more information on MP branch authorizations or inventory, by grade, are encouraged to contact the USAMPS
Personnel Proponency Office or AHRC MP Branch assignment officer.
16–6. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for MP Corps
   a. Structure. Any changes to the authorizations of MP units will be based on the restructuring and recoding.
Additional changes may result due to the iterative nature of the restructuring and recoding process.
   b. Acquire. The majority of commissioned officers in the MP Corps are accessed directly from ROTC and USMA
and, to a lesser extent, OCS. All officers should meet the physical and aptitude requirements specified in AR 40–501.
Designation of the MP Corps as an initial branch is regulated by HQDA through the various commissioning sources.
The remainder of commissioned officers in the MP Corps are acquired through in-service branch transfers. Accession
via branch transfer is directed by HQDA and may be voluntary or involuntary based upon the needs of the Army.
Officers of other branches who desire a transfer to the MP Corps may submit a written request for branch transfer in
accordance with AR 614–100.
   c. Distribute. MP branch officers will continue to rotate between Operating Force and Generating Force units in
CONUS and OCONUS with a goal of longer assignments at one station (consistent with Army Force Stabilization
policies; see AR 600–35). Officers should have more time to gain the requisite skills in their branch and their branch/
functional area generalist assignments. In particular, majors should receive more key and developmental position time
and increased stability. Maneuver, Fires, and Effects functional category MP officers will work either in branch or
branch/functional area generalist positions.
   (1) Officers assigned to installations with ample professional opportunities may be stabilized at that installation for
extended periods. Additionally, some company grade officers may be offered the opportunity to attend the MPCCC and
return to their initial unit of assignment.       Individual timelines are affected by Army, MP and ARFORGEN
requirements.
   (2) Life-cycle Managed (LM) units. Consistent with Army focus on force stabilization (see AR 600–35), officers at
all levels assigned to LM units (generally SBCT/IBCT/HBCT) will remain in the unit for a minimum of three years.
   (3) Cyclic units. The majority of installations will be managed on a cyclic manning system. Replacements will be
sent to these units and installations periodically to maintain readiness of the units. Tour lengths and developmental
position opportunities can vary.
   d. Train & Develop. Today’s MP officer is confronted by two diverse and complex challenges. First, the officer
should lead and train Soldiers who can achieve tactical success; protect and expedite the movement of critical
resources; evacuate, process and intern enemy prisoners of war; and support law enforcement operations. Second, in
the garrison environment the officer manages technical planning and supervision in the areas of law enforcement, crime
prevention, criminal investigations, anti-terrorism, physical security, and corrections. To master the skills required to
meet these challenges, MP officers selected for major must complete ILE. Officers selected for colonel should
complete SSC if selected by a HQDA board. Professional development can also occur through TASS via select self-
development courses.
   e. Deploy. MP branch officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Whether assigned to Operating Force (MTOE) units or Generating Force (fixed site TDA)
organizations, all MP officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. MP
officers may deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests; or as
individuals to support joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping
missions. MP branch officers must prepare themselves and their Families for this most challenging experience.
   f. Sustain.
   (1) Promotion. MP branch officers will compete for promotion only within the Maneuver, Fires, and Effects
functional category.
   (2) Command. Senior MP branch officers will continue to be centrally selected for command. Command opportuni-
ties for Military Police Corps officers are included within the Operations, Strategic, Recruiting and Training, and
Installation categories. MP commands generally fall within four groups: Combat Support, Internment/Resettlement,
Criminal Investigation, and Law Enforcement. The results of the command selection process are announced in the
Centralized Selection List.
   (3) Officer evaluation report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS starting
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            163

with captain, the rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the functional category which best suits his
or her abilities and interests.
   g. Transition. The separation process for MP officers remains unchanged.
   h. Compensate. Pay and benefits are handled through DCS, G–1, with special recruiting or retention benefits staffed
through the Office of the Provost Marshal General.
16–7. Military Police Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. MP officers in the Reserve Component play a vital role in the total force structure
during peace as well as mobilization. More than 61percent of requirements in the MP Corps are in the RC, and certain
specialized organizations such as internment/resettlement units exist almost entirely within the USAR and ARNG. To
fulfill its wartime mission, the MP Corps must rely on extensive interaction with the RC. Wartime effectiveness will
depend to a large extent on the quality and level of training RC MP officers receive. The RC MP officers serve the
same roles and missions as their Active Army counterparts.
   b. Reserve Component officer qualifications and development. To meet professional development objectives, RC
officers should rotate among TPUs (USAR) or M–Day units (ARNG), IRR, and IMA assignments. Those interested in
serving the National Guard or Army Reserve on a full-time basis may apply for entry into the Active Guard Reserve
(AGR) program. Officers selected for the AGR program may elect to complete an Active Duty career in support of
either the National Guard or Army Reserve. RC officers are assigned to positions in MTOE and TDA organizations;
however, the vast majority of positions are in MTOE units. Their duties and responsibilities will be fundamentally the
same as their AA counterparts, with the exception of those personnel management, administrative and operational
requirements unique to the National Guard and Army Reserve. All RC MP assignments are open to both male and
female officers.
   (1) The RC MP officer has a challenging and complex mission. The officer should lead and train Soldiers who can
achieve tactical success. He or she must be tactically and technically proficient and capable of executing the five MP
functions of area security, maneuver and mobility support, law & order, internment/resettlement operations, and police
intelligence operations. Additionally, the ARNG MP officer plays a major role in preparing for and providing
assistance to their state during natural disasters, sensitive public activities, consequence management events, and civil
disturbances. A requirement for proficiency in both battlefield operations and peacetime MP skills usually means a
wide variety of educational opportunities and challenging assignments for the MP officer.
   (2) The majority of RC officers appointed for assignment in the MP Corps come from ROTC, federal and state OCS
programs. All officers meet the prerequisites specified in AR 135–100 for appointment in the RC of the Army. HQDA
and area commanders regulate appointment to the MP Corps as an initial branch. Additional requirements for
appointment of ARNG officers are listed in NGR 600–100.
   (3) Positions in all MP skills are available to RC officers. National Guard warrant officers federal recognition and
related personnel actions are found in NGR 600–101. The qualifications and professional development for RC CID
Special Agents are in paragraph 18–3.
   c. Development Model. There are five phases of professional development for RC MP Corps officers. (See fig 16–3,
below.) These phases are related to military rank and depict broadly based goals and career opportunities at each rank
so that an officer may expand capabilities and optimize performance. These objectives are flexible since the actual
course of an officer’s professional development and utilization will be influenced by RC requirements and the officer’s
strengths, experiences, performance and desires.
   d. Professional development objectives for RC officers by grade.
   (1) Lieutenant.
   (a) The MP lieutenant’s first objective is to complete MP BOLC. Lieutenants appointed without concurrent Active
Duty should complete MP BOLC within 24 months of the date of appointment. This course emphasizes leadership,
tactics, training operations, maintenance, supply, and physical training. Additional areas of study include MP opera-
tions, law, communication skills, personnel administration, drivers training, and weapons training. Graduates of MP
BOLC possess the technical and tactical skills, physical fitness, and leadership qualities of the MP Corps and are
trained on the most critical tasks required of a platoon leader. These officers demonstrate a thorough understanding of
and willingness to live by the Army Values and a firm grasp of the attributes, skills, and actions that form the
foundation of a competent and confident leader. Following MP BOLC, selected officers may attend such specialized
courses as Airborne and Air Assault to support their follow-on assignment.
   (b) The second objective is a branch material assignment with troops. Consistent with Army requirements, RC MP
lieutenants can expect an initial assignment as a platoon leader for a minimum of 12 months (with a goal of 18-24
months). This will ensure lieutenants develop a comprehensive understanding of Army operations and military life that
will provide a solid foundation for assuming the challenge of company or detachment command. Lieutenants should
seek leadership positions and every opportunity to broaden technical, tactical and leadership skills in support of the MP
combat and peacetime missions. Some assignments may also be with a battalion or brigade headquarters staff. Nearly
all are with CS or I/R organizations.
164                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   (c) The RC MP lieutenants are eligible for promotion to captain when they meet the service and educational
requirements contained in chapter 7.
   (2) Captain.
   (a) The RC officers of the MP Corps in the rank of first lieutenant or higher who have completed an officer BOLC
are eligible to attend the MP Captain Career Course (MPCCC). The MPCCC may be taken in residence at the MP
School or an RC officer may complete the MPCCC–RC, which consists of five phases in combination of distance
learning (DL) and resident training, and is designed for the RC officer to complete each resident phase in an annual
training period. This course is sequential; therefore, the student must complete each phase before moving to the next.
The exception is Phase One, TRADOC Captain Career Course Common Core, which must be completed prior to
graduation from MPCCC–RC. Phases Two and Four are dL and Phases Three and Five are resident phases. The DL
portions are taken on-line with instructor-to-student and student-to-student interaction capability either in asynchronous
or synchronous mode through the MANSCEN’s Life Long Learning Center. Each DL phase prepares the officer to
successfully complete each resident phase. The culminating event of MPCCC–RC is the Joint Warfighter Exercise
(Phase Five). MP, CM, and EN captains participate in this exercise, taking everything they have learned and effectively
applying it throughout the exercise. The phases, coupled with the resident phases, allow instructors to keep the course
material current and compliant with the operating environment (OE). MPCCC–RC prepares officers to command at the
company or detachment level and to successfully function as a staff officer and ensure that the officers possess the
technical, tactical, leadership, and physical fitness skills required to lead successfully a company or detachment.
   (b) The most critical leadership position for an MP captain to hold is commander of a company or detachment for a
minimum of 12 months (with a goal of 18–24 months). Officers should seek maximum hands-on experience in a
variety of MP leadership positions as captains. RC captains should actively pursue assignments in both TPU/M-day
units and as IMAs to broaden their professional experience and enhance opportunities for training and education.
captains can expect to serve in a broad range of command and staff assignments, including a variety of generalist
opportunities. MP captains should continuously strive to develop their technical and tactical skills in preparation for a
field grade assignment.
   (c) The RC captains are required to complete CCC to be considered for promotion to major. RC captains who are
serving in an active status and meet educational, performance and service requirements may be selected for promotion
by a centralized mandatory board or by a unit board convened to fill vacancies.
   (3) Major.
   (a) The primary professional development objective of an RC MP Corps major is to continue to strengthen MP
skills. Key and developmental assignments at this rank are battalion or brigade S–3 or XO, or deputy division/RRC PM
for a minimum of 12 months (with a goal of 18–24 months).
   (b) The needs of the service increasingly dictate that an officer serve in positions away from troops. Key and
developmental positions at this rank include observer/controller in an exercise division in support of unit training and
readiness; instructor/staff officer in an institutional training division in support of the TASS; and staff officer at a
continental U.S. Army (CONUSA) or regional readiness command (RRC) headquarters.
   (c) Regardless of their career track, MP majors should ensure they attend ILE. RC officers not on Active Duty
should apply to attend an ILE course. RC officers are required to complete ILE common core to be considered for
promotion to lieutenant colonel, timely completion is key to remaining competitive.
   (d) The RC majors who are serving in an active status and meet educational and service requirements may be
selected for promotion by a centralized mandatory board or by a unit board convened to fill position vacancies based
on status. Majors not selected for promotion after consideration by two consecutive mandatory boards are not retained
beyond 20 years of commissioned service unless selectively continued.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel.
   (a) Lieutenant colonels can expect assignments to senior staff positions where they will be employed in a variety of
branch and generalist positions in units, training centers and headquarters elements. Division PM, brigade S–3 or XO,
or deputy brigade commander are key assignments during this phase.
   (b) At this phase, officers may be selected for battalion command or its equivalent, as identified by their JFHQ or
RRC–Designated Positions List. Only a very small percentage of eligible officers will actually have an opportunity for
battalion command because of the limited number of command positions available. RC officers not selected for
battalion command should seek out positions of increased responsibility that capitalize on skills. Promotion to colonel
without battalion command is possible based on the overall strength of the officers’ file.
   (c) Lieutenant colonels are required to complete ILE common core to be considered for promotion to the rank of
colonel. RC lieutenant colonels are encouraged to complete SSC, if selected by the ARNG and the USAR boards.
Standards for the selection process can be found in AR 350–1, paragraph 3–8c.
   (d) The RC lieutenant colonels are eligible for selection to colonel upon completion of the requisite service
requirements listed in chapter 7. Lieutenant colonels remain eligible for promotion to colonel as long as they continue
to serve in an active status and meet the selection criteria.
   (5) Colonel.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             165

   (a) The primary objective for this phase is maximum use of the officer’s technical and tactical capabilities and his or
her managerial and executive skills in positions of senior responsibility.
   (b) Colonels are encouraged to complete SSC. Both the ARNG and USAR conduct SSC selection boards, and
standards for the process can be found in AR 350–1, paragraph 3–8c(b).
   (c) Only a very small percentage of eligible officers will actually have an opportunity for brigade or equivalent
command because of the limited number of command positions available. RC officers not selected for brigade
command should seek out positions of increased responsibility that capitalize on skills. Promotion to brigadier general
without brigade command is possible based on the overall strength of the officers’ file.

Chapter 17
Special Forces Branch
17–1. Unique features of the Special Forces Branch
   a. Unique purpose of the Special Forces Branch. The mission of the SF Branch is to conduct special operations
across the full range of military operations in any operational environment in war, peace, or contingencies. SF expand
the range of available options in a variety of scenarios where the commitment of conventional military forces is not
feasible or appropriate. They provide military capabilities not available elsewhere in the armed forces. They are the
only force specially selected, trained, and equipped to conduct unconventional warfare. SF operations are inherently
joint and often multinational or interagency in nature. These operations also focus on the operational and strategic
levels. SF are language trained, culturally astute, and regionally oriented. SF frequently conduct their operations by,
with, or through surrogate forces.
   b. Unique functions performed by the SF Branch. The SF Branch is a MFE functional category formerly known as
Combat Arms. As representatives of the United States in foreign countries, SF often serve as trainers as well as
166                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

Soldiers. In war, SF provide unique combined, joint, or unilateral capabilities to the combatant commander. They
interact closely with and live under the same conditions as the indigenous people. They conduct peacetime operations
and promote regional stability in areas where conventional forces normally do not operate. Their continuous forward
presence assists in creating the conditions necessary for stable development, thereby reducing the risk of armed
conflict.
   c. Unique features of work in the SF Branch. The U.S. Army organizes, trains, and equips SF to perform their core
tasks of unconventional warfare, foreign internal defense (FID), direct action (DA), special reconnaissance (SR),
counterterrorism (CT), counterproliferation (CP), and support to information operations (IO). Through the conduct of
these seven core tasks, SF support the accomplishment of United States Special Operations Command’s (USSOCOM’s)
specified special operations forces (SOF) core tasks. SF missions are dynamic. They constantly evolve in response to
political-military considerations, technology, and other considerations.
   d. SF seven core tasks.
   (1) Unconventional warfare SF define Unconventional warfare as operations conducted by, with, or through irregu-
lar forces in support of a resistance movement, an insurgency, or conventional operations. Personnel can conduct
Unconventional warfare operations across the range of conflict against regular and irregular forces. These forces may
or may not be state-sponsored entities. Field Manual (FM) 3–05.201, Special Forces Unconventional Warfare Opera-
tions, contains detailed information on unconventional warfare (UW).
   (2) FID–FID is participation by civilian and military agencies of a government in any of the action programs taken
by another government or other designated organization to free and protect its society from subversion, lawlessness,
and insurgency. FM 3–05.202 and Joint Publication (JP) 3–05 contain detailed information on FID.
   (3) DA–DA operations are short-duration strikes and other small-scale offensive actions conducted as a special
operation in hostile, denied, or politically sensitive environments that employ specialized military capabilities to seize,
destroy, capture, exploit, recover, or damage designated targets. DA differs from conventional offensive actions in the
level of physical and political risk, operational techniques, and the degree of discriminate and precise use of force to
achieve specific objectives. FM 3–05.203, (C) (U), contains detailed information on DA.
   (4) SR–SR operations are reconnaissance and surveillance actions conducted as a special operation in hostile,
denied, or politically sensitive environments to collect or verify information of strategic or operational significance,
employing military capabilities not normally found in conventional forces. These actions provide an added capability
for commanders and supplement other conventional reconnaissance and surveillance actions. FM 3–05.204, (C) (U),
contains detailed information on SR.
   (5) CT–CT is the full range of operations that include the offensive measures taken to prevent, deter, preempt, and
respond to terrorism. There are three categories of CT operations: hostage rescue, recovery of sensitive material from
terrorist organizations, and attacks against terrorist infrastructure.
   (6) CP–CP of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) is a specialized mission assigned to designated SOF. SF
participation in CP is through the conduct of unconventional warfare, SR, and DA. Special Forces operational
detachments (SFODs) designated in national and theater contingency plans to participate in CP may be specially task-
organized, trained, and equipped.
   (7) IO–SF supports the IO core capabilities of electronic warfare, computer network operations, Psychological
Operations, military deception, and operations security, in concert with specified supporting and related capabilities, to
affect or defend information and information systems and to influence decision making (FM 3–13, Information
Operations: Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).
   e. SF officer roles.
   (1) SF officers plan, coordinate, direct, and participate in SF units performing the above core tasks in all operational
environments. An SF captain commands a Special Forces Operational Detachment A (SFODA). The SFODA is a
flexible and highly trained unit, which includes (in addition to the commander) 1 SF warrant officer and 10 SF
noncommissioned officers (NCOs). The NCOs hold one or more of the following specialties: operations, intelligence,
weapons, communications, engineering, or medical. The successful SFODA must be adept at accomplishing a wide
range of requirements including training management, logistical planning, resource management, training plan develop-
ment for foreign forces, and negotiating and working with foreign and U.S. government agencies and country teams.
SF officers that successfully command an SFODA may later command larger SF units. They serve on upper echelon
SF, Army and joint special operations task force (JSOTF) staffs, as SOF observer-controllers at Combat Training
Centers, in special mission units (SMUs), and in interagency assignments. They also serve as special operations staff
officers at various higher-level conventional Army and joint staffs as well as serving on the staff and faculty of the
U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS).
   (2) SF warrant officers (180A) are combat leaders and staff officers. They are experienced subject matter experts in
unconventional warfare, as well as operations and intelligence fusion, for planning and execution at all levels across the
operational continuum. They are responsible for the integration of emerging technologies. They advise commanders on
all aspects of special operations. The warrant officer one (WO1), chief warrant officer two (CW2), or a selected chief
warrant officer three (CW3) serves on the SFODA as the assistant detachment commander or commander in his
absence. The CW3 through chief warrant officer five (CW5) SF warrant officers serve as staff operations warrant
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            167

officers within the SF group as well as at higher commands within SF, Army SOF, and joint SOF staffs. They may
lead task-organized SOF elements as directed. They serve as senior warrant officer advisors (SWOAs) to the com-
mander for all warrant officer matters and other interests as directed. Select CW5s serve as the Command Chief
Warrant Officer (CCWO) for the Commander, United States Army Special Forces Command (Airborne) (USASFC(A)
or SWOA to the SF group and United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) commanders as an
integral part of the commander’s personal staff.
   (3) 17–2. Officer and warrant officer characteristics required
   f. Unique skills.
   (1) SF officers will—
   (a) Be proficient infantry tactical commanders and experts in the SF seven core tasks and SF operations.
   (b) Be tactically and technically proficient in the skills required of an SFODA.
   (c) Have an aptitude for learning a foreign language. They must sustain foreign language proficiency throughout
their careers. This is an essential skill and is critical for all SF officers. During the 18A Special Forces Detachment
Officer Qualification Course (SFDOQC), officers who do not already meet language requirements receive extensive
foreign language and cultural training. All officers must successfully meet the current USAJFKSWCS published
language course standard requirements before graduating and joining an SF group.
   (d) Be qualified military parachutists, with a goal of attaining a senior parachutist rating by promotion to major.
   (2) SF warrant officers will—
   (a) Be proficient in the SF seven core tasks, intelligence operations, and tactical skills.
   (b) Be familiar with all the technical skills of an SFODA.
   (c) Have an aptitude for learning a foreign language. They must sustain foreign language proficiency throughout
their careers. This is an essential skill and is critical for all SF officers.
   (d) Be qualified military parachutists, with a goal of attaining a senior parachutist rating by promotion to CW3.
   g. Unique knowledge.
   (1) SF officers and warrant officers require an in-depth knowledge of at least one region of the world and
proficiency in at least one of the region’s languages.
   (2) Officers must complete the SFDOQC. This provides officers with entry-level knowledge of SF operations. As
they develop, officers gain a broader understanding of SF tactics, techniques, and procedures; the special operations
targeting and mission planning process; the special operations support and sustainment process; and the joint, multina-
tional, and interagency aspects of special operations.
   (3) SF officers and warrant officers must have unique knowledge of specialized infiltration and exfiltration tech-
niques. The SF Branch is the proponent of many of these techniques.
   h. Unique attributes. SF officers and warrant officers will—
   (1) Be physically fit.
   (2) Have unquestioned personal integrity and moral courage.
   (3) Be self-reliant team players who can function as leaders independently or in tightly knit small groups.
   (4) Have the cognitive resilience and mental dexterity to act autonomously under extreme stress and be able to
inspire others to perform effectively in highly stressful environments.
   (5) Be an adaptive thinker who is able to thrive in complex and ambiguous situations.
   (6) Be mentally flexible and willing to experiment and innovate in a decentralized and unstructured environment.
   (7) Have the ability to solve complex political-military problems and to develop and employ conventional or
unconventional solutions. Develop and employ nondoctrinal methods and techniques when applicable. Be capable of
decisive action for missions in which no current doctrine exists.
   (8) Be able to learn new skills, accept new ideas, and teach others.
   (9) Have good interpersonal and cross-cultural communications skills as well as political acumen and cultural
sensitivity. Mission success will often depend on an ability to establish rapport and influence the attitudes and
behaviors of people from foreign cultures.
17–2. Professional development overview
   a. Commissioned officers. The SF Branch is one of three branches that make up the Army special operations forces
(ARSOF) group within the MFE functional category. The SF Branch consists of officers in the grade of warrant officer
one through colonel. The SF Branch is a volunteer nonaccession branch that draws its officers from other branches of
the Army, or in the case of warrant officers, from within enlisted career management field (CMF) 18. The U.S. Army
Recruiting Command recruits SF officer volunteers. A Department of the Army (DA) centralized accession board
selects promotable first lieutenants who volunteer in the targeted year group. The volunteers undergo a rigorous
assessment and selection program to qualify as SF officers. SF officers must first serve a successful initial tour as a
lieutenant in a small-unit leadership position in one of the Army’s other basic branches. This ensures that they have
knowledge of conventional Army operations and leadership experience. All SF officers are airborne qualified and
maintain that proficiency throughout their careers. They attend the resident Maneuver Captain Career Course (MCCC).
168                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

Based on operational requirements, some SF officers undergo training in advanced special operations skills such as
military free-fall parachuting, combat diving, close-quarter battle, and military mountaineering. Throughout their
careers, SF officers enhance their knowledge by increasing their understanding of the joint and interagency aspects of
special operations while they command SF units at levels of increasing responsibility. SF captains lead detachments;
majors lead companies; lieutenant colonels lead battalions; and colonels lead groups. SF officers should seek post KD
assignments to USAJFKSWCS at all grade levels. Post KD assignments to USAJFKSWCS will be regarded as
essential well-rounded professional development for SF officers and will be regarded as strong competitors for future
command selection.
   b. Warrant officers. The SF warrant officer is a volunteer accessed from CMF 18. All candidates attend the Special
Forces Warrant Officer Technical and Tactical Certification Course (WOTTC) at USAJFKSWCS, Fort Bragg, NC. The
WOTTC is comprised of select officer leadership tasks and Warrant Officer Basic Course tasks. Based on operational
requirements, some SF warrant officers undergo training in advanced special operations skills such as military free-fall
parachuting, combat diving, close-quarter battle, and military mountaineering.
   c. Regional focus. SF officers and warrant officers continuously undergo intensive preparation for assignment in
their unit’s designated geographic areas. Whether the mission profile calls for clandestine employment in a denied area
or a low-visibility FID mission in a developing nation, the overall requirement for regional orientation, language
proficiency, and cross-cultural interpersonal skills remains the same. SF officers and warrant officers gain and maintain
area orientation through military and civilian schooling, language study, area study, mission preparation, and repetitive
operational experience during their careers. While Soldiers gain initial language qualification through formal instruc-
tion, they maintain language skills through practice and self-study. Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) scores
reflect language proficiency. Soldiers must update their DLPT scores annually through formal testing. The organization
of SF groups is by area of concentration; however, the management of regional expertise is subject to modification as
the needs of the Army change.
17–3. Officer development assignments
An officer must first successfully serve in his basic branch to be eligible for SF (see para 17–8b, below). Upon
graduation from the SFDOQC, the officer serves in a key developmental position as a SF captain, followed by other
developmental positions described in the following paragraphs.
   a. Captain.
   (1) SF Branch is a non-accession branch. To meet Army military education level requirements, every SF officer
must complete the MCCC before attending the Special Forces Qualification Course (SFQC).
   (2) SF captains should successfully command an SFODA, optimally for 24 months. This is the key developmental
position for all SF captains. This duty equates to company, battery, or troop command in the other MFE functional
category formerly known as combat arms.
   (3) Upon graduation from the SFDOQC, all SF captains should optimally serve a minimum of 36 months in a
position coded 18A within a SF group. A DA Form 4187 Personnel Action, signed by the battalion and group
commanders, is required for a captain to be reassigned from a SF group before 36 months within the group. A captain
serves two years as an SFODA commander followed by a third year as a company executive officer (XO) or staff
officer within a SF group. In addition, select captains may remain assigned for up to four years in a SF group.
   (4) The primary preferred developmental assignment for a SF captain is in a position coded 18A as a staff officer in
a SF operational battalion or group headquarters. Other preferred developmental assignments include the following:
   (a) Service in a second command following the officer’s initial SFODA command. Selection to a second command
is appropriate for an officer with high potential. This command time is in addition to the officer’s initial tenure as an
SFODA commander.
   (b) Service in a SMU.
   (c) Service as a joint staff officer or Department of Defense (DOD) staff intern.
   (5) In addition to professional development through operational assignments, SF captains should begin an intensive
self-development program. Their efforts should focus on gaining an in-depth understanding of combined arms opera-
tions, gaining and maintaining regional and linguistic expertise, and increasing proficiency in SF and infantry officer
common core and branch tasks.
   (6) Captains may attend advanced special operations skill courses such as Combat Diver; Combat Diving Supervi-
sor; Military Free Fall; Military Free Fall Jumpmaster; Advanced Special Operations Techniques (ASOT); and Special
Forces Advanced Reconnaissance, Target Analysis, & Exploitation Course (SFARTAETC) to meet mission
requirements.
   (7) SF officers, as commanders of airborne units, must successfully complete static line jumpmaster training as a
captain.
   (8) Because of the extensive training involved in SF officer accessions, officers volunteering for SF who do not
already have a baccalaureate degree must complete their degree before attending the SFDOQC.
   b. Major. SF majors should successfully serve for approximately 24 months in any of the key developmental
positions listed below or a combination of these positions. Major positions on Transition Teams (TT) and Provincial
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            169

Reconstruction Teams (PRT) are key and developmental positions as per the Chief of Staff of the Army. SF branch
recommends that majors who serve in these positions seek a key and developmental assignment within their branch
prior to serving in an O–4/major position on a TT or PRT.
   (1) SF company commander. Majors command SF companies. Each line company commander is responsible for his
company headquarters, the Special Forces Operational Detachment B (SFODB), and six subordinate SFODAs.
   (2) SF Operations Officer (S–3). The S–3 performs duties as the battalion operations officer, similar to other MFE
battalion and brigade S–3s.
   (3) SF battalion XO. The XO performs duties similar to other MFE functional category battalion and brigade XOs.
   (4) SF group S–3 plans officer. The group S–3 plans officer performs duties relating to planning for future
operations.
   (5) SF group support company (GSC) commander. The GSC commander is responsible for intelligence, training,
and operations support to SF groups.
   (6) SF group operations detachment commander. The group operations detachment commander is responsible for
training support and oversight of designated special or advanced skills within the groups.
   (7) Positions corresponding to statements one through five above in the USAJFKSWCS, 1st SWTG(A), Special
Operations Recruiting Battalion, a SMU, or the International Special Training Center (Vilseck, GE).
   (8) Designated positions in the Combined Arms Center (CAC) SOF Cell and JRTC Plans.
   (9) Commander, Operational Detachment-39, Korea.
   (10) Designated operations or plans staff officer positions at USASOC, in a theater special operations command
(TSOC) or equivalent joint special operations unit.
   (11) Assignment to the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School as a major, in the
Directorate of Training and Doctrine or in the Directorate of Special Operations Proponency.
   (12) Designated operations or plans staff officer positions in the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security
Cooperation.
   (13) Preferred developmental assignments for SF majors include the following:
   (a) Service as a joint or combined staff officer. Special operations are inherently joint operations, and SF majors
should seek joint or combined duty after their key developmental assignment.
   (b) Service as a SF assignment officer at U.S. Army Human Resources Command (USAHRC).
   (c) Attendance at the highly competitive Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP) at the School of Advanced
Military Studies (SAMS). The AMSP is one year of advanced study for selected officers that have completed
Intermediate Level Education (ILE). The AMPS provides a broad education in the art and science of war at the tactical,
operational, and strategic levels. Any SF major who graduates from SAMS who is key and developmental qualified
will serve in a SAMS assignment. Any officer who is not key and developmental qualified will serve in a SF key and
   developmental qualifying position before fulfilling their SAMS utilization.
   (d) Attendance at the highly competitive Department of Defense Analysis Program at the Naval Postgraduate
School. The Special Operations Master’s Degree Program at the Naval Postgraduate School is 18 months of advanced
study for selected officers. It provides a broad education in the art and science of unconventional warfare at the tactical,
operational, and strategic levels, followed by a tour (normally after serving in a key developmental position) as an
operational planner at USSOCOM, USASOC, a TSOC, or in designated JSOTFs. SF officers who attend the P950 ILE
Preparatory Course, and the Naval Command and Staff Distance Education Courses while attending NPS will receive
full ILE/JPME I credit. When not in command, officers who have completed Special Operations/Low Intensity Conflict
& Interdependent Capabilities (SO/LIC) may serve repetitively in operational and strategic planning positions on the
joint or Office of the Secretary of Defense staffs, USSOCOM, USASOC, and the TSOCs and can be expected to serve
as J–5s in JSOTFs.
   (e) The Interagency Studies Program (ISP) will provide SF officers with an accredited master’s degree that prepares
officers for post key and developmental assignments in joint and interagency Special Operations Forces billets.
   (14) There is much greater emphasis on self-development at the field-grade levels, with the focus on more general
areas of knowledge rather than specific tasks. Officers without a master’s degree are encouraged to enroll in a civilian
college or university to earn an advanced degree either off duty or, if applicable, through a fully funded program in
conjunction with ILE. However, completion of a master’s degree should not take precedence over completion of ILE or
successful execution of any assignment. SF majors should also maintain and enhance their foreign language and
cultural proficiency and continue their self-development program aimed at the mastery of unconventional warfare
doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures.
   c. Lieutenant colonel. Key developmental for a SF lieutenant colonel is successful service as a tactical, training,
institutional, or recruiting battalion commander (centralized selection list billet at the battalion level). For the majority
of lieutenant colonels, promotion to lieutenant colonel constitutes success and subsequent assignments focus on
developing the officer for broader contributions to the branch, the U.S. Army, and special operations in general.
Preferred developmental assignments for SF lieutenant colonels include the following:
   (1) Service in a USSOCOM or a TSOC-designated JSOTF.

training, or DCS, G–7. The USASFC DCS, G–3/5/7 billet is designated for fill by a former battalion commander.
   (6) Service in USAJFKSWCS as the DCS, G–3/5/7, or Special Forces Division Chief, Joint Army Division Chief,
and TDD Division Chief in the Directorate of Training and Doctrine, or as the Special Forces Proponent Chief in the
Directorate of Special Operations Proponency. All of these positions are designated for fill by a former battalion
commander.
   (7) Service in USASOC as the assistant DCS, G–3/5/7, command group XO, or deputy chief of staff.
   (8) Service at USAHRC as the SF officer branch chief or enlisted branch chief in the ARSOF group.
   (9) Service on the staff and faculty of the Command and General Staff College (CGSC).
   (10) For self-development, SF lieutenant colonels focus on general areas of knowledge. They should enhance their
regional knowledge and improve their language proficiency as well as continue their mastery of unconventional
warfare.
   d. Colonel. SF colonels continue to serve the branch, special operations, and the Army through service in any SF-
coded colonel position or combination of positions within USSOCOM, USASOC, USAJFKSWCS, USASFC, HQDA,
joint staffs, service schools, and other key organizations.
   (1) Key development for a SF colonel is successful service as a tactical, training, institutional, or recruiting
commander (command selection list billet at the group or brigade level) or command of a designated JSOTF. SF
colonel assignments aim to develop the officer for broader contributions to the branch, the U.S. Army, and special
operations in general.
   (2) Other developmental assignments include the following:
   (a) Service as the deputy commander of a SF group or SMU.
   (b) Service as a TSOC deputy commander, chief of staff, or J–3.

   (i) Service on the staff and faculty of the CGSC or U.S. Army War College.
   (j) Service on a combined staff.
   (3) For self-development, SF colonels focus on general areas of knowledge. Colonels should further enhance their
regional orientation and language proficiency and continue to follow an extensive professional self-development
regimen.
   e. Warrant officers. Active Army and U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) SF O warrant officers serve in key developmen-
tal positions at the SFODA level. Like their officer counterparts, the warrant officer also serves in primary develop-
mental assignments. SF warrant officers should begin an intensive self-development program. Their efforts should
focus on gaining an in-depth understanding of unconventional warfare, joint operations, gaining and maintaining
regional and linguistic expertise, and maintaining proficiency in SF common core tasks.
   (1) WO1/CW2 SF warrant officers (Active Army and USAR).
   (a) WO1s must successfully complete the SF WOTTC. WO1/CW2s must successfully serve as either the assistant
detachment commander or commander of an SFODA. This is the primary and preferred key developmental position for
all SF warrant officers. The WO1/CW2s must successfully serve for a minimum of three years at the SFODA level,
with a preferred minimum of six years at the SFODA level. Assignment as an SFOD assistant detachment commander
will normally be a warrant officer’s initial assignment following completion of his WOTTC. The primary SFODA-
level staff responsibilities are serving as the chief of staff and focusing on operations and intelligence fusion during
mission planning and execution.
   (b) The WO1s and CW2s should plan and implement an intensive self-development program. Their efforts should
focus on gaining in-depth understanding of UW and combined arms operations. They should gain and maintain
advanced regional and linguistic expertise. They should maintain a current foreign language proficiency that corre-
sponds to their regional affiliation.
   (c) As a goal, SF WO1s and CW2s should complete an associate degree before eligibility for selection to CW3.
   (d) As an integral member of the leadership team in an airborne unit, SF warrant officers must successfully
complete static-line jumpmaster training by promotion to CW3.
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                         171

   (e) Although not required, advanced special operations skill courses such as Combat Diver, Combat Diving Supervi-
sor, Military Free Fall, Military Free Fall Jumpmaster, ASOT, and SFARTAETC provide valuable professional
development.

   (f) Select CW3s who demonstrate exceptional academic capability and meet established criteria may pursue a
funded advanced civilian degree to meet the needs of the Army and SF. The ISP will provide SF warrant officers with
an accredited master’s degree that prepares warrant officers for post key and developmental assignments in joint and
interagency Special Operations Forces billets. Initial utilization assignment for graduates will normally be within
general officer level SF, ARSOF, or joint SOF staffs.
   (g) Attendance at the highly competitive Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP) at the School of Advanced
Military Studies (SAMS). The AMSP is one year of advanced study for selected warrant officers. The AMSP provides

   1. Service as an instructor, doctrine writer, or staff officer at USAJFKSWCS, ideally for no longer than 36 months.
   2. Service as an operations staff officer at NORTHCOM.
   (d) SF CW4s should set a goal of attaining a master’s degree.
   (e) Intermediate Level Education (ILE). The ILE program is available to CW3 and CW4 SF warrant officers. This is
a one-year program that awards ILE and JPME I credit. Ideally a warrant officer should serve in a joint assignment in
their first or second subsequent assignment post completion of ILE.
   (f) SF should maintain a current foreign language proficiency that corresponds to his regional affiliation.
   (g) USAR SF CW4s, when serving on Active Army orders, may serve as operations warrant officer or staff officer,
instructor, or writer at USAJFKSWCS, USASFC (A), USASOC, or a joint assignment.
   (4) CW5 SF warrant officers.
172                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   (a) SF CW5s must complete the Warrant Officer Senior Staff Course no later than one year after their promotion to
CW5. The ARNG SF CW4s must complete WOSSC to be eligible for promotion to CW5.
   (b) The primary preferred developmental assignments for SF CW5s are the following:

   (c) Temporary force needs requiring a SF CW5 will be considered developmental. However, once the requirement
no longer exists, the CW5 should be assigned into a preferred developmental assignment.
   (d) A SF CW5 should successfully serve in a CW5 preferred developmental assignment before selection and
assignment as the chief warrant officer of the branch/military occupational specialty (MOS) 180A proponent or as the
command chief warrant officer of USASFC(A).
   (e) SF CW5s should set a goal of attaining a master’s degree.
   (f) SF CW5s should maintain a current foreign language proficiency that corresponds to their regional affiliation.
   (g) USAR SF CW5s, when serving on Active Army orders, may serve as an operations warrant officer or staff
officer at USAJFKSWCS, USASFC (A), USASOC, or a joint assignment.
   f. Branch and generalist assignments. SF Branch officers who remain in the MFE functional category above the
rank of captain will have increasing opportunities to serve in branch and generalist assignments.
   g. Joint and interagency assignments. The Army will consider. SF officers for joint as well as interagency duty
assignments. They should strive to serve in these critical positions. Joint experience is important to the Army and
essential to individual officers for their advancement into senior leadership positions.
   h. Combined assignments. The Army will consider. SF officers and warrant officers for duty as commanders or staff
officers of combined commands at a rate that equals or exceeds that of the other MFE functional category officers and
warrant officers. Experience in combined commands provides extensive professional development to individual officers
for their advancement into senior leadership positions.
   i. Command selection criteria. The main criterion for SF command selection is exceptional performance. To remain
competitive for command selection in both SMUs and SF groups, officers should balance key assignments in both
types of units. SF officers are strongly encouraged to volunteer for recruiting and garrison command consideration, as
well as critical command and staff billets in joint and JSOTFs. SF officers with post key developmental or preferred
developmental assignments at the USAJFKSWCS will be regarded as strong competitors for command selection.
17–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
   a. Preferences. Regional expertise results from language training and the initial SF group assignment. The goal of
officer professional development is to produce and sustain highly qualified, regionally oriented officers.
   b. Precedence.
   (1) SF officers’ assignments to developmental leadership positions have precedence. Typically, officers should seek
assignments in the following order:
   (a) Service as the commander of an SFODA. This will be the officer’s first assignment after completion of SF
training.
   (b) Service on a battalion or group staff, as an SFODB XO, or on a designated specialty SFODA.
   (c) Service in USAJFKSWCS as the Special Forces Division chief, Joint Army Division chief, and TDD Division
chief in the Directorate of Training and Doctrine, Special Forces proponent chief in the Directorate of Special
Operations Proponency, and Deputy Commander for the 1st Special Warfare Training Group (A). Service in the
USASFC as the Chief of Operations, and Chief of Training. Service in the USASOC as the CG XO, Chief of
Operations, and Chief of Training. All of these positions are designated for fill by a former battalion commander.
   (d) Attendance at the AMSP, the Special Operations Master’s Degree Program in the Department of Defense
Analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School, or the Interagency Studies Program.
   (e) Attendance at the Command and General Staff Officer Course ILE or equivalent program.
   (f) Service as the commander of a SF company, as a battalion S–3 or XO, plans officer, operations detachment
commander, or GSC commander, group S–3, or designated key developmental position.
   (g) Joint assignment.
   (h) Service at a battalion-level command CSL command.
   (i) Attendance at a senior service college.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           173

  (j) Service at a group-level command.
  (2) Active Army and USAR SF warrant officer assignments to positions of leadership and technical expertise have
precedence. Typically, SF warrant officers should seek assignments in the following order:
  (a) Service as an SFODA assistant detachment commander.
  (b) Service as a company (SFODB) operations warrant officer.
  (c) Service as a battalion (SFODC) operations warrant officer.
  (d) Service as a group operations warrant officer or Command Chief Warrant Officer.
  (e) Service as an operations warrant officer or staff officer, instructor, or writer at USAJFKSWCS, USASFC(A),
USASOC or a joint assignment may be sought after promotion to CW3. (Applicable to USAR when serving on Active
Army orders).
17–5. Duration of developmental officer life-cycle assignments
SF Branch key developmental positions. All captains will optimally serve 24 months in their key developmental
position in a SF group as an SFODA commander. The goal is for all majors to serve for 24 months in key and
developmental positions. Majors will serve in an operational group, training group, or other coded 18A position
designated as key and developmental.
                               Figure 17–1. The AA Special Forces Developmental Model

                                  Figure 17–2. The RC Special Forces Developmental Model
17–6. Requirements, authorizations and inventory
   a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for officers who remain in the MFE functional
category. To accomplish this, the field-grade inventory must be structured to meet branch authorizations, to provide
sufficient flexibility in supporting branch and generalist participation, and to allow all officers to serve in key
developmental assignments for the period needed to achieve requisite professional development.
   b. Captain accessions. The goal for all captains is to graduate SFDOQC between their fifth and sixth years in
service to serve in assignments and obtain professional development in SF before consideration for promotion to major.
The CG, USAJFKSWCS, validates captain accessions requirements in an annual mission requirement letter to DA,
DCS, G–1.
17–7. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for Special Forces
   a. Structure. SF structure is somewhat different from that of the other MFE branches because of its high officer
content and the absence of lieutenants.
   b. Acquire. The SF Branch is a non-accession branch. The U.S. Army Recruiting Command recruits officers as SF
volunteers. Officers are accessed upon selection for promotion to captain. Normally they complete all training and
reach their first operational assignment two years later. Over 400 officers typically apply each year. Of the 400
applicants, approximately 155 successfully graduate SFDOQC and branch transfer into SF. The accessions window for
applicants is the ARSOF Officer Accessions Board, which follows the captain’s promotion board. SF warrant officers
are accessed from all CMF 18 MOSs. The DSOP, USAJFKSWCS, publishes recruitment guidance each fiscal year.
The primary recruiters for new accessions are SF warrant officers. Individuals meeting MOS 180A prerequisites submit
an application packet through their respective chain of command to DSOP, USAJFKSWCS, for validation. Once
validated, DSOP forwards Active Army applications to the United States Army Recruiting Command where a
centralized warrant officer selection board will select the best qualified applicants based on the needs of the Army. The
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            175

ARNG applications will be returned to the adjutant generals office of the state where a federal recognition board is
conducted to select qualified applicants. Board-selected individuals will be scheduled to attend the Special Forces
Warrant Officer Technical and Tactical Certification Course at USAJFKSWCS, Fort Bragg, NC.
   c. SF officer training prerequisites. Officers applying for selection for SF training will meet the following
prerequisites:
   (1) Be an Active Army male Soldier.
   (2) Be in their third year of active federal commissioned service when the SF accession board meets (Active Army
only).
   (3) Be a captain or be selected for promotion to captain.
   (4) Have enough time remaining as a captain to complete SF training and serve a minimum of three years in a SF
unit before DA centralized selection board consideration in the primary zone for promotion to major. This allows for
the completion of key development assignments and attainment of sufficient SF experience before selection for major.
   (5) Be airborne qualified. If not airborne qualified, the applicant must volunteer for airborne training.
   (6) Have passed the APFT in his age category, with a minimum of 240 points overall, 60 points minimum per event.
   (7) Be able to swim 50 meters unassisted while wearing the full Army combat uniform with boots.
   (8) Have scored at least 85 on the Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) or have met USAJFKSWCS
language school graduation standards on the DLPT in a SF-required language (other than English).
   (9) Have met the medical standards for SF training per AR 40–501, Standards of Medical Fitness.
   (10) Have a secret security clearance and be eligible for a top secret security clearance.
   (11) Be a resident MCCC graduate by the time of enrollment in the SFDOQC. Normally, officers will attend the
Special Forces Assessment and Selection (SFAS) before resident MCCC attendance.
   d. Branch-transfer policies. Although SF Branch controls volunteers throughout their training, they remain members
of their basic branches of assignment during training. The training pipeline begins with TDY attendance to SFAS,
which the Soldier must successfully complete to continue on to subsequent phases of SF qualification training. Upon
successful completion of SFDOQC, the officer receives his first assignment to a SF operational unit. The USAHRC
transfers officers to SF upon successful completion of the SFDOQC. Officers failing to be selected at SFAS or failing
to achieve SFDOQC course standards must return to their initial branches of assignment. Officers who completed SF
training as enlisted Soldiers will still complete the SFDOQC before transferring to SF. However, they will not normally
attend SFAS or SUT training. SERE training will not be required for those who have already completed the SERE
Level C (High Risk) Course. Active Army and USAR SF qualification training requirements are identical. Officers
who successfully complete the Active Army 18A SFDOQC as reservists do not have to repeat SFDOQC training if
accessed into the Active Army.
   e. Waiver authority. The USAJFKSWCS commanding generalI is the final waiver authority for course prerequisites
as well as qualification and branch-transfer requirements. All requests for waivers should be addressed to the CG,
USAJFKSWCS, ATTN: AOJK–SP, Fort Bragg, NC 28310–5200.
   f. SF warrant officer training prerequisites. Active Army and USAR SF warrant officer training requirements are
identical. SF NCOs applying for selection for SF warrant officer (MOS 180A) training must meet the following
prerequisites:
   (1) Be a U.S. citizenship. No waivers are accepted.
   (2) Have a general technical score of 110 or higher. No waivers are accepted.
   (3) Be a high school graduate or have a general equivalency diploma. No waivers are accepted.
   (4) Have a secret-level security clearance.
   (5) Be able to pass the standard Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) in accordance with FM 21–20 and to meet
height and weight standards in accordance with AR 600–9.
   (6) Be able to pass the appointment physical for technicians as verified by an appropriate medical authority on U.S.
Army Recruiting Command Form 1932.
   (7) Have at least 12 months remaining on their enlistment contract.
   (8) Be less than 46 years of age.
   (9) Be serving as a SSG (E–6) or above.
   (10) Have at least one CMF 18 MOS.
   (11) Have a minimum of three years experience at the SFODA level.
   (12) Have a current DLPT with at least a 1/1 foreign language proficiency score or a DLAB minimum score of 85.
   (13) Be able to meet the medical fitness standards for SF duty. NOTE: Verification statement by appropriate
medical authority to be included on USAREC Form 1932.
   (14) Have letters of recommendation from the chain of command through Commander, USASFC(A), as well as the
senior SF warrant officer and the SF Group Command Chief Warrant Officer.
   (15) Waiver authority. The USAJFKSWCS commanding general is the final waiver authority for MOS prerequisites.
   g. Distribute. Careful management is required to balance the need to retain sufficient experienced officers in the
branch with the need to keep the inventory small enough to allow for sufficient key developmental assignments. The
176                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

Army will make every effort to provide professional development opportunities for officers to ensure they are able to
compete for advancement.
   h. Deploy. SF officers will remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all times. Whether
assigned to deployable TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed-site TDA organizations, all SF officers must be
ready to deploy and able to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. SF officers may deploy on short
notice with their units to conduct combat operations, deter potential adversaries, and to protect national interests or as
individuals to support joint and multinational combat operations or sustainment and support operations. SF officers
must prepare themselves and their Families for this challenging life-cycle function.
   i. Sustain. Recent OPMS updates change the manner of execution in some areas affecting officer career
development.
   (1) Promotion. Following functional category designation, SF officers will compete for promotion only within the
MFE functional category.
   (2) Command. Central selection of SF lieutenant colonel and colonel commanders will continue in four functional
categories: Operations, Strategic Support, Recruiting and Training, and Installation. The CSL announces the results of
the command selection process. The SF personnel proponent at the USAJFKSWCS closely monitors the number of
commands available to SF officers to achieve branch professional development on par with that of the other MFE
functional category branches. A special DA board fills selected SMU commands. Officers are selected to command
SMUs generally in lieu of CSL commands, not as a second command. Selected SMU positions are designated as
second commands.
   (3) Officer Evaluation Report (OER). The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and officer
personnel management. Starting with captain, the rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the
functional category that best suits his abilities and interests. SF raters and senior raters thus perform a critical function
that helps ensure that both the MFE functional category and other functional categories possess quality officers.
   j. Develop. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in
TOE units, staff and TDA billets, joint and coalition assignments, and institutional training positions. Self-development
continues to be an essential component of officer development. The goal is to develop officers that can expertly
conduct SF operations in support of the combatant commanders. Development occurs through the Army school system
with all officers selected for promotion completing some form of resident professional military education training.
Development can also include fellowship programs:
   k. Separation. The branch separation process remains the same as for the rest of the Army.
17–8. Special Forces U.S. Army Reserve officers
   a. General career development. The USAR captain, major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel branch-transfer and
developmental requirements are the same as for Active Army officers. Because of geographical and recruiting realities
of the ARNG system, lieutenants may be assigned to SF companies.
   b. Developmental opportunities. USAR captain, major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel key and primary developmen-
tal assignments, as well as branch-transfer requirements, are the same as for Active Army officers. The ARNG officers
may not find a SF unit with openings at their grade or may be ineligible for promotion until finding a unit position at
the proper grade. USAR officers’ civilian careers and other considerations may limit them to serving in geographically
available units. Other options for such officers include duty in the IRR with possible IMA Program positions or short-
tour positions, AGR Program positions, or positions in non-SF units. Some officers may have to branch transfer. A
USAR officer may branch transfer several times during his career and may not be able to follow the normal SF career
model.
Chapter 18
Psychological Operations Branch
18–1. Unique features of Psychological Operations Branch
   a. Unique purpose of Psychological Operations (PO) Branch. PO are special-purpose forces capable of providing a
deliberate response of extended duration or rapid response to contingencies throughout the world. Their mission is to
conduct PSYOP across the full range of military operations in any operational environment in war, peace, or
contingencies. PO forces expand the range of available options in a variety of scenarios. They provide capabilities not
available elsewhere in the armed forces or other governmental agencies. PSYOP are inherently joint, usually bilateral
and interagency in nature, and focus on the tactical, operational and strategic levels. PO forces frequently conduct their
missions by, with, or through the platforms of key communicators and the media of other forces, organizations,
agencies, or nations. The public typically does not attribute PSYOP actions to United States (U.S.) Army PO personnel
or units.
   b. Unique functions performed by the PO Branch. The PO Branch has both special operations forces (SOF) and
general purpose force (GPF) in the MFE functional category. PO is a non-accession branch; officers are brought into
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                              177

the branch as captains and serve through the rank of colonel. As representatives of the United States in a foreign
country, PO personnel serve as diplomats as well as warriors. In war, PO forces provide unique combined and
combined capabilities to the combatant commander. They may interact closely with and live under the same conditions
as the indigenous people, or they may work in highly restricted U.S.-only facilities for particularly sensitive PSYOP,
activities, and programs. They conduct peacetime operations and promote regional stability in areas where other U.S.
military forces normally do not operate. PO forces’ continuous forward presence assists in the preparation of the
operational environment, which involves disrupting, degrading, and ultimately eliminating terrorist networks, as well as
influencing information and ideas consistent with the political and military objectives that create the conditions for
stable development. The mission of PSYOP is to influence the behavior of foreign target audiences (TAs) to support
U.S. national objectives. PSYOP accomplishes this by conveying selected information and indicators and advising on
actions that influence the emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and, ultimately, the behavior of foreign audiences.
Behavioral change is at the root of the PSYOP mission. Although concerned with the mental processes of the TA,
PSYOP’s mission success is dependent upon the observable modification of TA behavior. It is this link between
influence and behavior that distinguishes PO from other capabilities and activities of information operations (IO) and
sets it apart as a unique core capability; force multiplier, and peacetime contributor.
   c. Unique features of work in PO Branch. PO personnel perform five core roles. These five core roles are: Influence
foreign populations. PO forces accomplish this by expressing information subjectively to influence attitudes and
behavior and to obtain compliance, noninterference, or other desired behavioral changes. These actions facilitate
military operations, minimize needless loss of life and collateral damage, and further the objectives of the supported
commander, the United States, and its allies. Advise the commander on Psychological Operations actions (PSYACTs),
PSYOP enabling actions, and targeting restrictions. These actions and restrictions minimize adverse impacts and
unintended consequences, attack the enemy’s will to resist, and enhance successful mission accomplishment. PO
Soldiers also advise the commander on the psychological effects and consequences of other planned military actions
and operations. Provide public information to foreign populations to support humanitarian activities, restore or rein-
force legitimacy, ease suffering, reduce confusion, and maintain or restore civil order. Providing public information
supports and amplifies the effects of other capabilities and activities such as civil-military operations (CMO). Serve as
the supported commander’s voice to foreign populations to convey intent and establish credibility. This ability allows
the commander to reach more audiences with less expenditure of resources and time. Counter enemy propaganda,
misinformation, disinformation, and opposing information to correctly and positively portray friendly intent and actions
to foreign TAs, thus denying others the ability to polarize public opinion and political will against the United States
and its allies.
   d. Officer roles. PO officers (area of concentration (AOC) 37A) plan, coordinate, direct, and participate in PSYOP
units that perform the above core roles in all operational environments. A PO captain commands a tactical PSYOP
detachment (TPD) or a PSYOP operational detachment (OPDET). The tactical PSYOP detachment is a highly trained
dissemination unit that includes (in addition to the commander) 15 PO noncommissioned officers (NCOs) and enlisted
personnel. United States Army Reserve (USAR) TPDs are part of the GPF and primarily provide support to GPF
Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs). Active Army TPDs are SOF and primarily provide support to SOF and initial support
to GPF BCTs. The PSYOP OPDET is a highly flexible organization that consists of eight NCOs who hold one of the
PO specialties, human intelligence collection or multimedia graphics illustration. The successful OPDET is adept at
accomplishing a wide range of requirements including PSYOP planning, target audience analysis, PSYOP product
development, and PSYOP product testing and evaluation. Dissemination of OPDET PSYOP products is typically by,
with, or through platforms and media owned by other forces, agencies, or nations. All OPDETs are SOF. The public
typically does not attribute PSYOP products to the U.S. Army. Because of this, OPDET personnel must be adept at
negotiating and working with foreign and U.S. government agencies and country teams. PO officers who successfully
command a detachment may later command larger PSYOP units. Generally, majors command companies, lieutenant
colonels command battalions, and colonels command groups. Successful PO officers ultimately serve on upper echelon
PSYOP, Army, Joint Staff and joint special operations forces (JSOF) staffs and in interagency assignments. They also
serve as staff officers in division, corps, Army service component command and theater armies and in joint task forces.
There are many joint, international, interagency, and multinational (JIIM) assignment possibilities and opportunities
within the PO Branch.
   e. Assignment opportunities other than modified table of organization and equipment. In addition to operational
positions, PO officers may serve on joint, interagency, United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations
Command (USACAPOC), USASOC, or Department of the Army (DA) staffs. They may also serve as staff or faculty
at the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS), Command and General Staff
College (CGSC), or War College. There is a wide variety of other SOF, GPF, or branch immaterial positions
worldwide. Because of the wide-ranging demands and opportunities resident in the special operations and general
purpose communities, the PO Branch remains a flexible, diverse force with many individual paths to professional
success and promotion.
18–2. Characteristics required of Psychological Operations officers
   a. Unique attributes. PO officers must—
178                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   (1) Demonstrate the mental, intellectual, and physical aptitude required of a Psychological Operations officer.
   (2) Have unquestioned integrity.
   (3) Be self-reliant team players that can function as leaders in tightly knit small groups.
   (4) Have the cognitive resilience and mental dexterity to act autonomously while under great stress.
   (5) Be able to thrive in complex and ambiguous situations.
   (6) Be mentally flexible and willing to experiment and innovate in a decentralized and unstructured environment.
   (7) Have the ability to solve complex political-military problems and develop and employ conventional or uncon-
ventional solutions. Develop and employ non doctrinal methods and techniques when applicable. Be capable of
decisive action for missions in which no current doctrine exists.
   (8) Be able to inspire others to perform effectively under stress.
   (9) Have good interpersonal skills and display political acumen and cultural sensitivity. Mission success often
depends on an officer’s ability to establish rapport and influence the attitudes and behaviors of people from foreign
cultures.
   b. Unique skills. PO officers must—
   (1) Be proficient in tactical-level operations in their basic branches and experts in PSYOP.
   (2) Be tactically and technically expert in all capabilities required of a TPD or an OPDET.
   (3) Be capable of planning and conducting PSYOP at the tactical and the operational levels interchangeably.
   (4) Be subject matter experts and known authorities in the psychological aspects of warfare, joint and interagency
operations, planning, operations, and intelligence, as well as technical and tactical skills.
   (5) (Active Army only.) Have an aptitude for learning a foreign language and sustain foreign-language proficiency
throughout their careers. This is one of the most important and difficult skills to gain and sustain and is critical for all
PO officers. Immediately after completing the 37A PO Qualification Course (POQC), officers who do not already meet
the language requirements receive extensive foreign-language and cultural training at the USAJFKSWCS and else-
where. PO officers must successfully meet all language-course requirements with a score of 1/1/1 on the Defense
Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) before joining a PSYOP group.
   (6) (Active Army only.) Be airborne qualified before starting training. PO officers must remain eligible to perform
airborne duties throughout their careers. (If the officer’s airborne status is medically terminated, this requirement can be
waivered by proponent, Commander, U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (AOJK–SP).
   (7) Have a minimum physical profile of 111221.
   c. Unique knowledge.
   (1) Completion of the POQC provides officers with entry-level knowledge of PSYOP. As they develop, officers
gain a broader understanding of PSYOP tactics, techniques and procedures; the PSYOP targeting and mission-planning
process; the support and sustainment process for PSYOP’s unique equipment and requirements; and the joint, multina-
tional, and interagency aspects of PSYOP.
   (2) Active Army PO officers continuously undergo intensive preparation for assignment in their unit’s designated
geographic area. Whether the mission profile calls for employment in support of SOF in a denied area or a low-
visibility military support to public diplomacy mission for a country team, the overall requirement for regional
orientation, language proficiency, and cross-cultural interpersonal skills remains the same. PO officers gain and
maintain area orientation through military and civilian schooling, language study, area study, mission preparation, and
repetitive operational experience during their careers. While PO officers gain initial language qualification through
formal instruction, language proficiency must be maintained through practice and self-study. DLPT scores reflect
language proficiency. PO officers must annually update these scores through formal testing. Although only Active
Army PSYOP units are currently organized by area of concentration, the management of regional expertise is subject to
modification as the needs of the Army change.
18–3. Officer developmental assignments
Figure 18–1 provides a depiction of officer career progression.
   a. Lieutenant. The PO Branch is a volunteer non accession branch that draws its officers from other branches of the
Army. For the Active Army only, the Special Operations Recruiting Battalion (SORB) recruits PO, Special Forces, and
Civil Affairs volunteers in accordance with the force stabilization procedures outlined in AR 600–35. PO officers must
serve a successful initial tour as a lieutenant in a small-unit leadership position in one of the Army’s other basic
branches. As a result, should possess knowledge of conventional Army operations and experience in Army leadership.
For the Active Army only, a DA centralized ARSOF accession board selects lieutenants who volunteer in the targeted
year group and then assigns them to a designated Captain Career Course (CCC) to qualify for continued PO officer
training.
   b. Active Army captain A consolidated ARSOF board selects PO candidates and schedules them for attendance at a
select CCC. Upon completion of the CCC, the officer will attend the PO training pipeline before receiving an
operational assignment.
   (1) PO captains must successfully command a detachment.
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                              179

   (2) Optimally, captains will serve for two years in a detachment command. This duty equates to a company, battery,
or troop command in other branches. This service is considered critical branch experience for a captain. Assignment as
a detachment commander will normally be an Officer’s initial assignment following completion of his PO qualification
training.
   (3) The branch objective at the detachment command level is to provide the operational force with the highest
quality leadership possible to execute missions in support of combatant command operational objectives and require-
ments. Detachment command also provides a common base of experience, professional development, and opportunities
by which to develop and evaluate PO captains.
   (4) The goal for a captain is 36 months assigned to AOC 37 coded positions within a PSYOP group. A captain
serves two years as a detachment commander followed by duty as a headquarters (HQ) company commander at
battalion, group, or flag-level HQs or staff officer at battalion or group level. Selection to a second command is
appropriate for an officer with high potential. This command time is in addition to the officer’s initial tenure as a
detachment commander.
   (5) Other preferred developmental assignments include—
   (a) Service as staff or faculty at the United States Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School.
   (b) Completion of the Special Operations Master’s Degree Program at the Naval Postgraduate School. This program
is 18 months of graduate study that includes authorship of a thesis on a topic of current interest to the SOF community.
It provides a broad, deep education in the art and science of unconventional warfare (UW) at the tactical, operational,
and strategic levels. Attendance requires a utilization tour as an operational planner at a division or corps HQ or at
USSOCOM, USASOC, a theater special operations command (TSOC), a PSYOP group, or in a designated joint special
operations task force (JSOTF) or joint special operations Psychological Operations task force (JOPTF) in contingency
operations.
   (6) In addition to professional development through operational assignments, PO captains should begin an intensive
self-development program. Their efforts should focus on gaining an in-depth understanding of mass communications,
marketing, behavioral science, and advertising; gaining and maintaining regional and linguistic expertise; and becoming
proficient in PSYOP and common core and branch tasks.
   (7) Active Army PO officers, as commanders of airborne units, are expected to successfully complete static-line
jumpmaster training early in their careers.
   c. Major.
   (1) The PO majors should successfully serve for approximately 24 months in any of the positions listed below or a
combination of these positions to meet critical branch experience requirements. The branch objective at the major level
is to provide the Army and the SOF community with the highest quality leadership possible and mid-level management
in support of accessing, training, employing, and commanding PO forces worldwide. Additionally, the Army will
provide individual officers with demanding experiential and professional development opportunities focused toward the
individual’s abilities, attributes, skills, and desires, in contrast to the commonality of experience at the captain
detachment level. Major positions on Transition Teams (TT) and Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT) are key and
developmental as per the Chief of Staff of the Army. PO Branch recommends that majors who serve in these positions
should seek a developmental assignment within their branch prior to serving in an O–4.major position on a TT or PRT.
   (a) The PO company commander. Majors command PSYOP line companies and PSYOP detachments. Each PSYOP
detachment commander is responsible for operational- and strategic-level planning for his geographical region and
specified TAs as well as two regionally oriented OPDETs. Each PO development company commander is responsible
for his company HQ and four subordinate PSYOP detachments. Each tactical PSYOP company commander is
responsible for four TPDs.
   (b) The PO battalion S3. The PO battalion S–3 performs duties as the battalion operations, training, and plans
officer, similar to other MFE functional category S–3s.
   (c) PO battalion executive officer (XO). The PO XO performs duties similar to other combat arms battalion or
brigade XOs.
   (d) Positions corresponding to the above in the 1st Special Warfare Training Group (Airborne) (1st SWTG (A)) or a
special mission unit (SMU).
   (e) Designated positions corresponding to the above in a JSOTF or JPOTF in contingency operations.
   (f) Designated operations or plans staff officer positions in USSOCOM, a TSOC, or equivalent joint special
operations unit.
   (g) Other critical designated PO-coded positions.
   (2) Preferred developmental assignments for PO majors include duty as a staff officer in a PO position at division
and corps level, the HQDA, an Army Service component command (ASCC), theater Army, or major subordinate
command (MSC) level, or as a Special Forces group PO staff officer.
   (3) Other developmental assignments for PO majors include:
   (a) Service as staff or faculty at the United States Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School.
180                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   (b) Service as a joint or combined staff officer. PSYOP are inherently JIIM operations and PO majors should seek
joint or combined duty after their key and developmental assignments.
   (c) Attendance at the highly competitive Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP) at the School of Advanced
Military Studies (SAMS). The AMSP is a year of advanced study for selected officers that have completed Intermedi-
ate Level Education (ILE). The AMSP provides a broad, education in the art and science of war at the tactical,
operational, and strategic levels. Any PO officer, who graduates from SAMS who is key and developmental qualified,
will serve in a SAMS assignment. Any PO officer who is not key and developmental qualified will serve in a PO key
and developmental assignment prior to fulfilling their SAMS obligation. Typical PO SAMS developmental assignment
are as an operational planner at division or corp, USACAPOC, USSOCOM, USASOC, a TSOC, or in designated
JSOTF or JPOTF in contingency operations. When not in command, PO officers who have completed AMSP will
serve repetitively in operational and strategic planning positions on the joint or Office of the Secretary of Defense staff,
interagency staff, USSOCOM, USASOC, USACAPOC or a TSOC. They can expect to serve as J–39s on JSOTFs or
JPOTFs during contingency operations.
   (d) Attendance at the Department of Defense Analysis Program at the Naval Postgraduate School. The Special
Operations Master’s Degree Program at the Naval Postgraduate School is 18 months of advanced studies for selected
officers. It provides a broad, deep education in the art and science of unconventional warfare at the tactical,
operational, and strategic levels. Attendance requires a utilization tour as an operational planner at division or corps,
USSOCOM, USASOC, a TSOC, a PSYOP group, or in designated JSOTFs or JPOTFs. PO officers who attend the
P950 ILE Preparatory Course, and the Naval Command and Staff Distance Education Courses while attending NPS
will receive full ILE/JPME 1 credit.
   (e) The ISP will provide PO officers with an accredited master’s degree that prepares officers for post key and
developmental assignments in joint and interagency Special Operations Forces billets. This can be done in conjunction
with attendance at ILE while at Fort Leavenworth, KS.
   (4) There is much greater emphasis on self-development at the field-grade levels, with the focus on more general
areas of knowledge rather than specific tasks. Officers without a master’s degree should enroll in a civilian college or
university to earn an advanced degree either off duty or, if applicable, through a fully funded program in conjunction
with ILE. However, completion of a master’s degree should not take precedence over completion of ILE or successful
execution of any assignment. PO majors should also maintain and enhance their foreign-language and cultural
proficiency and continue their self-development program aimed at the mastery of the psychological aspects of warfare
(doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures) and mass communications and political theory.
   d. Lieutenant colonel.
   (1) Developmental requirements for a PO lieutenant colonel involve successful service in any PO-coded lieutenant
colonel position or combination of positions. The most critical of these assignments is service as a PO table of
organization and equipment (TOE) or Table of Distribution and Allowance (TDA) battalion commander (command
CSL billet), which develops the lieutenant colonel for future responsibilities as a senior commander or staff officer.
Command strongly encourages PO officers to volunteer for all command consideration, whether in operations, strategic
support, recruiting and training, and installation categories, as well as critical command and staff billets in JSOTFs and
JPOTFs.
   (2) The branch objective at the lieutenant colonel level is to provide the Army and the SOF community with the
highest quality leadership possible and senior management in support of accessing, training, employing, and command-
ing PO forces worldwide. For the majority of lieutenant colonels, promotion to this rank constitutes success and their
branch will focus assignments to develop the officer for broader contributions to the branch, the U.S. Army, and
special operations in general. Lieutenant colonel developmental assignments include—
   (a) Service in a USASOC, USACAPOC, USSOCOM, TSOC, or a designated JSOTF or JPOTF in a contingency
operation.
   (b) Service as DCO, XO, or S–3 of a PSYOP group.
   (c) Service as a division, corps, or ASCC or theater Army PO officer.
   (d) Service as a HQDA, DOD, or JCS staff officer or in interagency positions requiring PO experience and
expertise.
   (e) Service as a staff officer or commander in a joint or combined HQ that earns the officer a joint service skill
identifier.
   (f) Service as deputy DCS, G–3/5/7 or deputy DCS, G–8 at USASOC or USACAPOC or DCS, G–3/5/7 at
USAJFKSWCS.
   (g) Service on the staff and faculty of the CGSC.
   (h) The Chief, PO Proponent in the Directorate of Special Operations Proponency or as the Chief, PO Doctrine
Division, Directorate of Training and Doctrine USAJFKSWCS are designated for fill by former battalion commanders.
   (3) For self-development, PO lieutenant colonels focus on general areas of knowledge. They should enhance their
regional knowledge and improve their language proficiency as well as continue their mastery of the psychological
aspects of warfare (doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures) and mass communications and political theory.
   e. Colonel.
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            181

   (1) The PO colonels continue to serve the branch, special operations, and the Army through senior executive service
in any PO-coded colonel position or combination of positions within USSOCOM, USASOC, USAJFKSWCS,
USACAPOC, HQDA, joint staffs, ASCC, theater Army, service schools, and other key organizations.
   (2) Critical assignments include joint staff (deputy director for global operations) J–39 PSYOP, command of a
PSYOP group, USSOCOM , Joint Military Information Support Command, command of a USSOCOM, or TSOC, or a
designated JSOTF or JPOTF in a contingency operation. The main criterion for PO command selection is outstanding
performance of duty in command at the lieutenant colonel level. Command strongly encourages PO officers to
volunteer for command consideration outside the PO Branch in branch immaterial commands, as well as critical
command and staff billets in Army, JSOTFs, and JPOTFs).
   (3) Primary developmental assignments include—
   (a) Service as an ASCC, TSOC, or joint staff officer or commander in a joint critical position requiring PO
expertise.
   (b) Service as chief of staff or DCS, G–3/5/7 at USASOC or USACAPOC.
   (c) Service in the USSOCOM Joint Military Information Support Command.
   (d) Service as assistant commandant, chief of staff, or directorate chief at USAJFKSWCS.
   (e) Service with the Army staff or with another government agency.
   (f) Service on the staff and faculty of the CGSC or U.S. Army War College.
   (g) Service on a combined staff.
   (4) For self-development, PO colonels focus on general areas of knowledge. Colonels should further enhance their
regional orientation and language proficiency and continue to follow an extensive professional self-development
regimen.
   (5) Functional sharing-coded and immaterial "generalist" assignments. PO Branch officers who remain in the PO
Branch above the grade of captain will have increasing opportunities to serve in branch or functional generalist
assignments, such as inspectors general (IGs) and instructors. Officers are provided opportunities to work in functional
areas (FAs), in the same manner as other basic branches. However, they must volunteer for selection.
   (6) Joint assignments. PO officers should expect consideration for joint duty assignments and should strive to serve
in these critical positions. Because of the inherently joint nature of PO, PO Branch has many joint duty assignment
positions. PO officers are used in joint organizations worldwide. Joint experience is important to the Army and
essential to individual officers for their advancement to senior leadership positions.
   (7) Combined assignments. PO officers can expect to be considered for duty as commanders or staff officers of
combined commands at a rate that equals or exceeds that of the other combat arms. Experience in the JIIM
environment provides significant professional development to individual officers for their advancement into senior
leadership positions.
18–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
   a. Preferences. Regional expertise results from language training and the initial PSYOP group assignment. The goal
of PO officer professional development is to produce and sustain highly qualified, regionally oriented officers to lead
forces in combat. The Army will assign officers to further this goal.
   b. Precedence. The PO officers’ assignments to developmental leadership positions have precedence. Typically, PO
Branch officers should seek assignments in the following order:
   (1) Command of a detachment. This command will be the officer’s first assignment after completion of PO officer
qualification training.
   (2) Battalion staff (as an assistant S–3 at battalion or group level) or company command in a company command
billet.
   (3) Service at the USAJFKSWCS, USACAPOC, USASOC, or in a generalist or branch immaterial billet.
   (4) The Advanced Military Studies Program (preceded by ILE) or the Special Operations Master’s Degree Program
in the Department of Defense Analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School.
   (5) ILE or equivalent program.
   (6) Command of a PSYOP company, battalion S–3 or XO, group S–3 or PSYOP detachment commander, or other
designated branch critical assignment.
   (7) Joint assignment.
   (8) Battalion-level (CSL) command or senior-level SOF or senior-level GPF or Army developmental position.
   (9) Senior service college.
   (10) Group level (CSL) command or senior executive-level SOF, or senior executive-level GPF, joint or Army
position.
18–5. Duration of developmental officer life-cycle assignments
   a. PO desired branch experience. The goal is for all PO captains and majors to serve for 24 months in key
182                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

developmental branch positions. All captains will serve in a PSYOP Group. Majors will serve in an operational group,
training battalion, or other specifically designated position.
   b. PO Branch life-cycle. Figure 18–1 displays an Active Army PSYOP branch life-cycle.
                                Figure 18–1. Psychological Operations Developmental Model
18–6. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for Psychological Operations
   a. Structure. PO Branch structure is somewhat different from that of the other MFE functional category because of
its high officer content and absence of lieutenants. Its structure will continue to reflect those characteristics for the
foreseeable future.
   b. Acquisition. PO is a nonaccession branch. For the Active Army only, the U.S. Army Special Operations
Recruiting Battalion recruits PO volunteers. Officers are accessed upon selection for promotion to captain. They
normally complete all training and reach their first operational assignment one to two years later. Over 100 officers
typically apply for the program each year; of these, approximately 40 successfully graduate POQC and branch transfer
into the PO Branch. The accessions window for applicants is the ARSOF Officer Accessions Board, which is
conducted following completion of the captain’s promotion board. The goal for all captains is to graduate POQC
between four to six years in service serve in PO assignments and obtain professional development in the branch before
consideration for promotion to major. The CG, USAJFKSWCS, validates captain requirements in an annual mission
requirement letter to DA DCS, G–1.
   (1) PO training prerequisites. Officers applying for selection for PO training must—
   (a) Be a volunteer for PO training in accordance with DA Pam 351–4.
   (b) Be in their third year of active federal commissioned service when the ARSOF accession board meets (Active
Army only).
   (c) Be selected for promotion to captain (Active Army only).
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           183

   (d) Have enough time remaining as a captain to complete PO training and serve three years in a PSYOP unit before
DA centralized selection board consideration in the primary zone for promotion to major. This permits completion of
the key leader development assignments before selection for major.
   (e) (Active Army only) Be airborne qualified or volunteer for airborne training.
   (f) Have passed the Army Physical Fitness Test.
   (g) (Active Army only) Have scored at least 85 on the Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) or have met
USAJFKSWCS language-school graduation standards of a 1/1/1 on the DLPT in a PO-required language (other than
English).
   (h) Have met the medical standards for PO training in accordance with AR 40–501, Standards of Medical Fitness.
   (i) Be eligible for a top secret security clearance.
   (j) Be a CCC graduate by the time of enrollment in the POQC.
   (2) Branch-transfer policies.
   (a) PO Branch controls volunteers throughout their PO training, and the training pipeline begins with attendance at
the POQC and ends with the assignment of an officer to his first operational unit. U.S. Army Human Resources
Command (AHRC) branch transfers Active Army officers to PO upon successful completion of the POQC. PO officer
training is a multipart entity with a single Active Army service obligation. Officers failing to achieve POQC standards
will not be PO qualified. These officers will return to their initial branches of assignment.
   (b) Officers who completed PO training as enlisted Soldiers must still successfully complete POQC before branch
transfer to PO.
   (c) Active Army and U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) PO qualification training requirements (with the exception of
language) are identical. However, the training requirements occur at different points in the officer’s time line. Officers
who successfully complete the Active Army component 37A POQC as reservists do not have to repeat POQC training
if accessed into the Active Army.
   (d) The CG, USAJFKSWCS, is the final waiver authority for course prerequisites as well as PO qualification and
branch-transfer requirements. All requests for waivers should be addressed to the CG, USAJFKSWCS, ATTN:
AOJK–SP, Fort Bragg, NC 28310–5200.
   c. Deployment. PO officers must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all times.
Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed-site TDA organizations, all PO officers
must be able to deploy and accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. PO officers may deploy on short
notice with their units to conduct combat operations, deter potential adversaries, and protect national interests. PO
officers must also be able to deploy as individuals to support joint and multinational combat operations or operations
other than war, such as humanitarian and peacekeeping missions. PO officers must prepare themselves and their
Families for this most challenging life-cycle function.
   d. Sustainment. The OPMS changes the manner of execution of three major areas affecting officer career
development.
   (1) Promotion. PO Branch officers will compete for promotion as a basic branch within the MFE functional
category. This eliminates the double counting which occurred previously when officers competed in both their branch
and their FA.
   (2) Command. The PO branch lieutenant colonel and colonel commanders will continue to be centrally selected for
command. All PO officer command opportunities are in the Operations Command and Key Billet category. Army wide
these commands are organized into 5 functional categories: Operational, Strategic Support, Recruiting and Training,
Installation and Key Billet. The results of the command selection process are announced in the CSL. The PO personnel
proponent at the USAJFKSWCS closely monitors the number of commands available to PO officers to achieve branch
professional development on par with that of the other branches.
   (3) Officer Evaluation Report. The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and officer
personnel management. Starting with captains, the rater and senior rater will recommend the rated officer for the
functional category that best suits his abilities and interests. PO raters and senior raters thus perform a critical function
that ensures quality officers are designated into both MFE and other functional categories.
   e. Development. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assign-
ments in TOE units with troops, staff and TDA billets, joint and coalition assignments, and institutional training
positions. Throughout an officer’s career self-development continues to be an essential component of officer develop-
ment. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly conduct PO in support of combatant commanders.
Development also occurs through the Army school system, with all officers selected for major completing some form
of ILE training, in accordance with OPMS and MFE functional category guidelines.
   f. Separation. The branch separation process remains the same as for the rest of the Army.
18–7. Psychological Operations, U.S. Army Reserve officers
   a. General career development. The USAR captain, major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel branch-transfer and
developmental requirements are the same as for Active Army officers.
   b. Developmental opportunities. The USAR captains, major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel branch-critical and
184                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

developmental assignments as well as branch-transfer requirements are the same as for Active Army officers, with the
majority of general purpose and few SOF assignments. The USAR officers may not find a PSYOP unit with openings
at their grade or may not be eligible for promotion until finding a troop program unit position at the proper grade. The
USAR officers’ civilian careers and other considerations may limit them to serving in geographically available units.
Other options for such officers include duty in the IRR with possible IMA Program positions or short-tour positions,
Active Guard Reserve (AGR) Program positions, Army National Guard PO positions, or positions in non-PSYOP units.
Some officers may have to branch transfer. A USAR officer may branch transfer several times during his career and
may not be able to follow the normal PO career model.
   c. Life-cycle development model. The USAR life-cycle development model for PO officers is consistent with the
Active Army model, with the majority of general purpose and few SOF assignments.
Chapter 19
Civil Affairs Branch
19–1. Unique features of the Civil Affairs Branch
   a. Unique purpose of the Civil Affairs (CA) Branch. The CA (38A) is a non-accession branch that is aligned with
the MFE functional category. The branch identifies Soldiers and units organized, trained, and equipped to command
and conduct CA operations and to support civil-military operations (CMO). The mission of CA forces is to engage and
influence the civil populace by planning, executing, and transitioning CA operations in Army, joint, interagency, and
multinational operations. To accomplish this mission, CA forces help commanders to engage the civil component of
their operational environment. This enhances civil-military operations or other stated U.S. objectives before, during, or
after other military operations. The U.S. Army conducts CA operations by, with, or through indigenous populations and
institutions, intergovernmental organizations, nongovernmental organizations, or other governmental agencies applying
all instruments of national power. CA forms the nucleus of the Army’s civil-military operations expertise for U.S.
Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), U.S. Army special operations forces (SOF), U.S. Joint Forces Command
(USJFCOM) and conventional forces. CA forces provide military capabilities not available elsewhere in the armed
forces, such as regional orientation, language skills, cross-cultural communication, and civilian-acquired skills. CA
Soldiers and units operate independently or in support of assigned forces. They interact closely with indigenous
populations and institutions, intergovernmental organizations, nongovernmental organizations, or other governmental
agencies.
   b. Unique functions performed by the CA Branch. The focus of CA is the civil component of the operational
environment. CA forces enhance a commander’s ability to plan and conduct civil-military operations. The CA officer is
an expert in the command and employment of CA Soldiers, teams, and units in support of these missions. Employment
of civilian core competencies by the CA functional specialist, found exclusively in the USAR, enables the force to
assess, monitor, protect, reinforce, establish, and transition political, economic, social, and cultural institutions and
capabilities to achieve U.S. national goals and objectives at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of operation.
Application of civilian core competencies found within the USAR CA functional areas make the CA Branch unique.
These six functional areas are public health and welfare, rule of law, governance, infrastructure, economic stability, and
public education and information. CA Soldiers knowledge of these areas is coupled with detailed study of a country’s
people, culture, history, politics, economy, language, institutions and its involvement with intergovernmental and
nongovernmental organizations. CA Soldiers further develop this knowledge in military and civilian education pro-
grams, regularly scheduled unit training, and in the civilian workplace. CA forces support missions across the full
range of military operations. The U.S. Army orients CA units toward a specific region of the world and assigns areas
of responsibility to regional combatant commanders. However, CA units retain the capability of worldwide deployment
and operations. They provide support to conventional forces, SOF units, and interagency organizations. CA officers
integrate diplomatic, information, military, and economic principles into the operations of the supported combatant
commander and his units. Civil Military Engagement is a USSOCOM concept for a globally synchronized, regionally
executed, program of country-specific and regional Civil Military Support Elements (CMSEs), found exclusively in the
Active Army force. These CMSEs identify and engage civil vulnerabilities, “by, through, and with” indigenous and
USG information assurance (IA) partners, to reduce, mitigate, and over time eliminate the underlying conditions and
core motivations for local and regional support to violent extremist organizations (VEOs) and their networks.
   c. Unique features of work in the CA Branch.
   (1) CA core tasks. CA core tasks include Populace and Resources Control (PRC), Foreign Humanitarian Assistance,
Civil Information Management (CIM), Support to Civil Administration (SCA), and Nation Assistance (NA).
   (2) CA officer roles. The CA officer develops, plans, coordinates, commands, controls, evaluates, and transitions
strategic, operational, and tactical CA or civil-military operations policies, procedures, doctrine, and activities for Army
and Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational (JIIM) environments and commands. The CA officer
serves in CA units as the Deputy/Assistant Chief of Staff for Civil-Military Operations (G–9) or as the civil-military
operations staff officer (S–9 ) on a commander’s staff. To operate in these positions, CA officers must—
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                              185

   (a) Be able to interface his general military expertise and knowledge with other special, general, combined arms,
joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational staffs.
   (b) Be able to plan, direct, execute, and transition CA operations and to synchronize CA operations with the
Information Operations Plan.
   (c) Be able to integrate with the supported staff to facilitate maneuver operations, provide foreign humanitarian
assistance, and promote the legitimacy of U.S. objectives.
   (d) Be able to prepare a civil-military operations estimate, CA annex, and CA assessment.
   (e) Be able to plan, establish, and operate a Civil-Military Operations Center.
   (f) Be able to establish, evaluate, and analyze measures of effectiveness and measures of performance.
   (g) Be able to identify, conduct, and transfer civil-military transition tasks to nongovernmental organizations,
intergovernmental organizations, indigenous populations and institutions, or interagency organizations.
   (3) Opportunities to lead and command. The U.S. Army may select the CA officer to lead a variety of traditional
and nontraditional formations. On deployment operations, forces routinely include individuals and teams from other
branches, Services, and countries supporting the full spectrum of CA operations and civil-military operations.
19–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Unique skills. The core competencies for CA officers are cross-cultural communications, regional expertise,
language ability, interpersonal skills, personal lethality (warrior ethos), adaptive thinking and leadership, and technical
proficiency. The CA officer is an expert in the command and employment of functional specialists, CA individuals,
teams, and units in the execution of these missions. CA officers are unique within CA forces because they provide
special or unique civilian core competency skills. Foreign-language skills are acquired through institutional training,
self-development, or unit training. The CA officer must achieve a Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) score of
1/1/1 in their target language. They must have the ability to solve complex political-military problems and to develop
and employ conventional and unconventional solutions. They also must be able to devise and execute nonstandard and
non-doctrinal methods and techniques, when applicable, to remedy unforeseen circumstances. They also must be
capable of decisive action in missions for which no doctrine exists.
   b. Unique knowledge. The CA officer applies his civilian knowledge and cultural expertise to support or enhance the
military operation. The CA officer understands how to interact effectively with civilian representatives of foreign and
indigenous populations and institutions located in the operational area. He is trained to assess how civil areas,
structures, capabilities, organizations, people, and events will help, hinder, or affect U.S. and coalition military
operations.
   c. Unique attributes.
   (1) The human dimension is the differentiating factor that separates CA forces from all other military organizations.
CA forces are people-centric. Though fully comfortable and capable in highly technological operations, their unique
strength is their ability to accomplish the goals and objectives of the United States by operating by, with, or through
indigenous or surrogate populations and institutions. CA forces do not operate in an environment of black and white,
with clearly delineated boundaries. CA officers do not define their operational ethos by mathematical equations, force
ratios, platforms, or equipment. The unique operational area of CA forces is people; the human dimension, the human
sensor, force multiplication, and ground truth. The joint operational environment framework of CA forces is air, space,
land, sea, and the human mind.
   (2) CA officers must be able to act independently. CA officers must be warfighters able to work in remote, austere,
and often hostile environments. They must be able to make important decisions with little or no immediate supervision.
They must be self-reliant team players that can function as leaders in tightly knit small groups.
   (3) Because of the nature of the work, CA officers must be extremely mature professionals. Even at junior grades,
the U.S. Army requires CA officers to work at the highest levels of command organizations on sensitive issues, often
briefing and advising general officers, media representatives, senior U.S. and foreign government officials. Through
their actions and words, CA officers often represent U.S. policy.
   (4) CA officers must be adaptable, flexible, and capable of independent operations in unstructured environments.
They must be able to thrive in complex and ambiguous situations and work in and understand the complexities of
multinational, multicultural, interagency, and joint operations.
   (5) CA officers must be diplomatic in their approach and be influential and persuasive with persons from other
cultures. They must possess good interpersonal skills and display political awareness and cultural sensitivity.
   (6) CA officers must possess unquestioned integrity.
   (7) Demonstrate the mental, intellectual, and physical aptitude required of a Civil Affairs officer.
19–3. Officer developmental assignments
   a. Development overview. CA officer development continues throughout their career life-cycle with progressive
assignments in troop unit, staff, and institutional training assignments. In addition, officers complete their professional
military education requirements to remain competitive for headquarters (HQ) Department of the Army (DA) selection
boards and professional growth. All officers selected for major must complete some form of intermediate level training
186                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

(ILE) training or its equivalent. All officers selected for colonel should attend a Senior Service College (SSC). In
addition, self-development is essential for all CA officers. The uniqueness of the branch requires officers to develop
regional expertise and a foreign-language capability through self-development. The development goal is to access CA
officers at the tactical level and grow them into CA joint planners at the strategic level in support of combatant
commanders.
   b. Career life-cycle development. The CA Branch is a non-accession branch that draws its officers from all other
branches. The U.S. Army Recruiting Command (USAREC) Special Operations Recruiting Battalion (SORB) recruits
Active Army Psychological Operations (PSYOP), Special Forces (SF), and CA volunteers in accordance with the force
stabilization procedures outlined in AR 600–35, Army Force Stabilization System. The U.S. Army expects CA officers
to serve a successful initial tour as a small-unit leader in one of the other U.S. Army branches as a lieutenant to gain a
working knowledge of conventional Army operations and tactics. The U.S. Army accesses officers into CA as senior
first lieutenants and captains. Upon completion of the Captain Career Course (CCC), officers will attend the CA
Qualification Course (CAQC) before receiving an operational assignment. Majors, lieutenant colonels, and colonels
with specific civilian-acquired skills compatible with the functional specialty teams in CA units may request award of
the appropriate skill identifier in accordance with Department of the DA Pam 611–21. CA officers will command CA
units at levels of increasing responsibility. Majors will command companies. Lieutenant colonels will command
battalions. Colonels will command brigades. Brigadier generals will command commands.
   c. Accession. The CA Branch is a non-accession branch. Of the following criteria, requirements 19–3c(1) through
(8) will not be waived. Officers selected for branch transfer must—
   (1) Complete a resident Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC).
   (2) Complete a Basic Branch Officer CCC.
   (3) Complete CAQC.
   (4) Be assigned to a valid entry-level CA 38A position.
   (5) Possess a bachelor’s degree.
   (6) Possess a valid secret security clearance. Active Army officers must be eligible for a top secret clearance in
accordance with AR 600–4.
   (7) Attain a minimum score of 85 on the Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) or a DLPT score of 1/1/1 or
higher (Active Army only).
   (8) Be airborne qualified or medically and physically capable and willing to volunteer for airborne training (Active
Army only). Active Army officers will not start CAQC until they successfully complete Airborne training.
   (9) Possess a physical profile of 111221 (exception to policy outlined in paragraph 19–3g).
   (10) Attain the rank of first lieutenant or captain (exception to policy outlined in paragraph 19–3g).
   d. Desired qualifications. Because of the regional orientation of U.S. Army CA units, a foreign language skill and
regional or cultural expertise is highly desirable. Officers must have an aptitude for learning a foreign language and
must sustain foreign-language proficiency throughout their careers. In addition, advanced civilian education and a
strong background in one of the civilian-acquired functional specialties are desirable.
   e. Opportunities for female Soldiers. All branch 38-coded positions are open to women, including all positions in
CA units and command positions, except for DCPC 1 positions in SF groups and the Ranger Regiment.
   f. Application procedures. Commissioned officers who meet the minimum criteria outlined above and desire a
branch transfer to the CA Branch may apply as follows—
   (1) Active Army officers may apply through the United States Army Special Operations Recruiting Battalion, Bldg.
2–1120 Fort Bragg, NC 28310, Fax: (910) 396–4994, http://www.bragg.army.mil/CAPSYOP/, between their second
and third year of commissioned service. Army Special Operations Forces (ARSOF) Board will consider the packets.
The ARSOF Board is held in the second quarter of each fiscal year.
   (2) U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) troop program unit members who meet all of the requirements of 19–3c, above may
apply through their chain of command to Headquarters, U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and
School (USAJFKSWCS), ATTN: AOJK–SP, Fort Bragg, NC 28310.
   g. Waiver authority. The CG, USAJFKSWCS, is the proponent for all CA forces and the final authority for course
prerequisites as well as CA qualification and branch-transfer requirements. All requests for exceptions to policy should
be routed through the chain of command and addressed to the CG, USAJFKSWCS, ATTN: AOJK–SP, Fort Bragg, NC
28310.
19–4. Officer management
   a. Active Army officers. Upon acceptance for branch transfer, the U.S. Army Human Resources Command
(USAHRC)-Alexandria manages these officers as CA personnel. The CA Branch assignments officer at
USAHRC–Alexandria will schedule the selected officers for CCC, Airborne (if needed), and the CAQC before
assigning him to an entry-level CA position. The CA Branch is awarded once all of the requirements of 19–3c, above,
are met.
   b. USAR TPU members. Upon acceptance for branch transfer, USAHRC–St. Louis manages these officers as CA
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           187

personnel. The CA Branch assignments officer at USAHRC–St. Louis will advise the officer on career progression and
assignments and will schedule the CA officer for professional military education as needed.
   c. Assignment and schooling requirements. To be considered the best-qualified officers in the branch at each grade,
CA officers must complete their operational assignments and schooling. By meeting these requirements, the officer
acquires the skills and knowledge to remain proficient in the CA Branch at his grade and becomes the best-qualified
candidate for promotion in the branch. Officers are strongly encouraged, however, to attain exceptional qualification
requirements in the CA Branch at each grade. Meeting exceptionally qualified requirements will increase the officer’s
probability of being selected for promotion. Meeting exceptionally qualified requirements will also improve the
possibility of command selection for lieutenant colonel and colonel grades. Officers at all grades must recognize,
however, the importance of performance in all assignments.
   d. Key developmental assignments. The following assignments for first lieutenants through colonels are recom-
mended to make the CA officer the best-qualified in the CA Branch at each grade and exceptionally qualified for
future promotion.
   (1) First lieutenant and captain.
   (a) Professional military education—completion of CCC and CAQC.
   (b) Key assignments—CA captains should successfully serve 36 months in any combination of the positions listed
below.
   1. CA team leader. Captains lead CA teams. These teams are the basic maneuver element of CA forces. During
assignment as a CA team leader, the CA captain can expect to successfully accomplish many of tasks, such as leading
and training CA NCOs and Soldiers assigned to the team; employing civil-military operations staff augmentation and
CA planning and assessment support to maneuver commanders; providing linguistic, regional, and cultural expertise to
supported commanders; planning, executing, and transitioning CA operations and civil-military operations tasks in
support of both conventional and SOF forces in a JIIM environment; and employing a CA team to conduct CA
operations and civil-military operations.
   2. Company commander of an HHC CA BN (Active Army). In this position, the officer commands the HQ
company of an Active Army CA battalion. He is responsible for the training and readiness of a multifaceted unit
charged with ensuring the mission readiness of the battalion.
   3. Chief, civil information management section at a CA battalion (Active Army and USAR). In this position, the
officer is responsible for the collection of civil information. He then fuses this information with the supported
headquarters, other U.S. government and Department of Defense agencies, intergovernmental organizations, and
nongovernmental organizations to ensure the timely availability of information for analysis and dissemination. He also
facilitates the combatant commander’s situational awareness and understanding of civil information and ensures that
there is a common operating picture to support strategic and operational levels of war.
   4. S–9, Special Forces battalion (Active Army). Special Forces battalions have limited positions for captains to serve
as S–9s. It is preferable that officers serve first in a CA unit for at least 24 months before being assigned as an SF
battalion S–9.
   (c) Other preferred developmental assignments.
   1. CA company, deputy civil-military affairs operations center (CMOC) officer, assistant battalion operations officer
(A/S–3), CA company operations officer (Active Army), assistant plans officer, CA planning team (CA battalion), or
civilian liaison team chief (USAR CA battalion). All of these positions continue officer development while assigned to
CA units and complement the time spent in key captain’s positions.
   2. Battalion- or brigade-level staff or assistant staff officer. Staff officer responsibilities are similar to other U.S.
Army branches. A detailed listing of duties and responsibilities can be found in FM 6–0.
   (d) Self-development goals. In addition to professional development through operational assignments, CA captains
should begin an intensive military self-development program. Their efforts should focus on gaining an in-depth
understanding of combined arms, joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational operations; gaining and
maintaining regional and linguistic expertise; and becoming proficient in CA common core and branch tasks and in
their civilian acquired expertise. All CA officers must be physically fit. Active Army officers must meet the SOF
validation requirements, including language proficiency. Suggested officer development courses are SOF courses at the
Joint Special Operations University, civil military cooperation NATO courses, and Federal Emergency Management
Agency courses.
   (2) Major.
   (a) Professional military education. Officers must complete 100 percent of ILE OES requirements.
   (b) Key assignments. CA major assignments include planning, executing, and transitioning CA and civil-military
tasks, employing CA and other Soldiers, and leading and developing subordinates. Major positions on Transition
Teams (TT) and Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT) are key and developmental as per the Chief of Staff of the
Army. CA Branch recommends that majors who serve in these positions should seek a developmental assignment
within their branch prior to serving in an O–4/major position on a TT or PRT. Civil Affairs majors are ideally suited to
serve on PRTs. Majors should successfully serve 12 months with a goal of 24 months in any of the positions listed
below or a combination of these positions.
188                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   1. CA company commander. Majors command CA companies. During an assignment as a CA company commander,
majors can expect to successfully command and lead CA officers, NCOs, and Soldiers assigned to a CA company;
direct collective training of a CA company; direct the planning, coordination, and conduct of CA operations in support
of civil-military operations; provide a supported command with advice, coordination, and staff assistance on the
employment of CA capabilities and issues relating to intergovernmental organizations, nongovernmental organizations,
and other governmental agencies; establish and operate a CMOC as well as employ CA, planning, and functional teams
to conduct CA operations in support of civil-military operations.
   2. Battalion S–3. The CA battalion S–3 performs duties as the battalion operations, training, and plans officer
similar to the S–3s of other MFE functional category units.
   3. Battalion executive officer (XO). The CA battalion XO performs duties similar to other MFE functional category
units.
   4. Brigade combat team (BCT) S–9, SF group S–9, or Ranger Regiment S–9. CA majors serve as S–9s for CA in
the BCT, SF group, or Ranger Regiment. Officers can expect to advise the commander on civil-military matters and
the employment of CA forces apportioned to the formation. They will participate in the mission-planning process.
Commanders will expect them to be subject matter experts on civil-military operations.
   5. Company Commander, Special Operations Recruiting Battalion.
   6. Commander, HHC, CA battalion (USAR). Majors command the HHC of USAR CA battalions. These officers are
responsible for the training and readiness of a multifaceted unit charged with ensuring the mission readiness of the
battalion.
   7. Functional specialty team (USAR only). Majors lead the functional specialty teams in a tactical CA battalion.
During assignment on a functional specialty team, CA majors can expect to employ the team to provide technical
expertise, advice, and assistance in identifying and assessing the CA functional specialties.
   8. Positions corresponding to 1 through 3 above in the 1st Special Warfare Training Group (Airborne) (1st
SWTG(A)).
   (c) Other preferred developmental assignments.
   1. Complementary to key assignments, CA majors can expect to serve as a CA planning team chief, (CA battalion),
civil liaison team chief , functional specialty team member (USAR), and other staff position in CA units.
   2. Assignment to the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School as a major, in the Directorate
of Training and Doctrine or in the Directorate of Special Operations Proponency.
   3. General staff officer. In this position, an officer provides professional development at one of the staff sections at
the command, division, corps, ASCC, or joint duty positions.
   4. Senior staff. As senior staff members, majors serve as HQDA, DOD, JCS, SOC, and joint or combined
headquarters staff officers or in interagency positions requiring CA experience and expertise.
   (d) Self-development goals. There is much greater emphasis on self-development at the field grade level, with the
focus on more general areas of knowledge rather than on specific tasks. Officers without a master’s degree should
consider enrolling in a civilian college or university and earning an advanced degree. CA majors should maintain and
enhance their regional and cultural expertise, develop their civilian acquired expertise, and continue their military self-
development reading program. Officers should consider membership in professional organizations within one of the six
functional specialty areas and complete the requirements for one of the CA skill identifiers described in AR 611–21.
Officers must remain physically fit and Active Army officers must meet SOF validation requirements. Suggested
officer development courses are SOF courses at the Joint Special Operations University, NATO courses, and Joint
Professional Military Education Level II.
   (e) Naval Postgraduate School. The Special Operations Master’s Degree Program at the Naval Postgraduate School
is 18 months of advanced studies for selected officers. It provides a broad education in the art and science of
unconventional warfare at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels followed by a tour (normally after serving in a
key developmental position) as an operational planner at USSOCOM, USASOC, a Theater Special Operations Com-
mand (TSOC), or in designated JSOTFs. CA officers who attend the P950, ILE Preparatory Course, and the Naval
Command and Staff Distance Education Courses while attending NPS will receive full ILE/JPME 1 credit. The
Interagency Studies Program will provide CA officers with an accredited master’s degree that prepares officers for post
key and developmental assignments in joint and interagency Special Operations Forces billets. This can be done in
conjunction with attendance at ILE while at Fort Leavenworth, KS.
   (f) Attendance at the highly competitive Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP) at the School of Advanced
Military Studies (SAMS). The AMSP is one year of advanced study for selected officers that have completed
Intermediate Level Education (ILE). The AMSP provides a broad education in the art and science of war at the tactical,
operational, and strategic levels. Any CA officer who graduates from SAMS who is key and developmental qualified
will serve in a SAMS assignment. Any CA officer who is not key and developmental qualified will serve in a CA key
and developmental assignment prior to fulfilling their SAMS utilization.
   (3) Lieutenant colonel.
   (a) Professional military education. Lieutenant colonels who want to remain competitive for subsequent promotion
should attend a SSC. All lieutenant colonels should strive to complete JPME II. Officers selected to command
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            189

battalions will attend the Army Pre-Command Course. Active Army officers will also attend the ARSOF PCC and the
Joint Special Operations PCC.
   (b) Assignments. Key developmental assignments for lieutenant colonels include—
   1. Battalion command. Command of a CA TOE or TDA battalion (CSL) is the most critical assignment for a CA
lieutenant colonel. Service as a CA battalion commander develops the lieutenant colonel for future responsibilities as a
CA brigade commander.
   2. Primary staff, division Civil Affairs officer.
   3. Service as the Deputy Commander of a CA brigade
   4. Service as primary staff officer at a CA brigade.
   (c) Other developmental positions.
   1. Service as a staff officer at CA brigade or command.
   2. Service on a CA planning team.
   3. Service on one of the six specialty teams (USAR only).
   4. Service as the CA Proponent Division Chief in the Directorate of Special Operations Proponency or the CA
Division Chief in the Directorate of Training and Doctrine, USAJFKSWCS, are designated for fill by former battalion
commanders.
   5. Service as an HQDA, DOD, JCS, ASCC, major command, joint, or combined headquarters staff officer or in
interagency positions requiring CA experience and expertise. (For USAR: These positions are not normally USAR
TPU positions but are sometimes available through various programs.)
   (d) Self-development goals. CA lieutenant colonels should enhance their regional knowledge and continue their
military self-development professional readings and mastery of branch skills and civilian acquired skills. Complete a
master’s degree in one of the CA disciplines; complete continuing education programs in acquired civilian skills, if
applicable; and complete the requirements to be awarded one of the CA skill identifiers described in AR 611–21.
Officers should consider membership in professional organizations within one of the six functional areas. Officers must
remain physically fit and meet special operations forces and mobilization validation requirements.
   (4) Colonel.
   (a) Professional military education. Completion of SSC.
   (b) Assignments. CA colonels continue to serve the branch, special operations, and the Army through service in any
CA-coded colonel position or combination of positions within USSOCOM, U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM),
U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), U.S. Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command
(USACAPOC), USAJFKSWCS, HQDA, joint staff, service schools, and other key organizations. Key developmental
assignments include—
   1. Service as the commander of a CA brigade.
   2. Service as a primary staff officer in the corps G–9.
   3. Service as the deputy commander of a CA brigade or command.
   4. Service as the assistant chief of staff for one of the primary staff positions at brigade and command level.
   5. Service as the team chief of a specialty team.
   6. Service as the team chief of a CA planning team.
   7. Service as an HQDA, DOD, JCS, joint, or combined headquarters staff officer or in interagency positions
requiring CA experience and expertise.
   (c) Self-development goals. Colonels should further enhance their regional orientation and continue their profes-
sional readings and mastery of branch skills; complete a master’s degree in one of the CA disciplines; complete
continuing education programs in acquired civilian skills, if applicable; and meet special operations forces validation
requirements.
19–5. Assignment preferences and precedence
   a. Preferences. The Army assigns CA officers based upon its needs, the regional alignment of the officer, and the
desires of the individual officer. Worldwide assignments are available. The goal of CA officer development is to
produce officers that can assimilate into Army and JIIM staffs and immediately integrate CA plans and principles into
the deliberate planning process.
   b. Precedence. Assignment of officers to developmental leadership positions has precedence over other assignments;
however, there is flexibility on assignment sequence. Ideally, CA branch officers should seek assignments in the
following order:
   (1) Service as a CA team, CA company, or functional specialty team leader; staff officer at the battalion, brigade,
Civil Affairs Command (CACOM), DRU, ASCC or Army Command level.
   (2) Service as an executive officer.
   (3) Service as a commander at the company, battalion, brigade, or command level.

   (4) Service in assignments at the joint, SOCs, joint theater staffs, HQDA, and OSD are important to the Army and
essential to individual officer’s advancement to senior leadership positions.
19–6. Duration of developmental officer life-cycle assignments
   a. CA key developmental assignments. Officers in the CA branch should ideally serve for a minimum of 12 months
with a goal of 24 months in the following types of assignments:
   (1) Service as commanders of CA commands, brigades, battalions, and companies.
   (2) Service as primary CMO staff officers (S–9/G–9) in BCTs, SF groups, Ranger Regiments, or division HQs
   (3) Service as staff officers at all levels in CA units.
   (4) Service as CA functional team and section leaders at all levels in CA units.
   (5) Service as CA instructors in service schools, including joint service schools.
   (6) Service as unified and specified command staff positions that plan civil-military operations and CA operations.
   (7) Service as members of CA support teams, for example, theater, operational, tactical in a theater of operations.
   b. CA branch life-cycle. Figure 19–1 displays the CA branch life-cycle with key developmental positions.
                                    Figure 19–1. Civil Affairs Officer Development Model
19–7. Requirements, authorizations, and inventory
The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for CA branch officers. The numbers of CA authorized billets
allow adequate career progression for CA officers.
19–8. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for CA
   a. Structure. Structure changes to CA MTOEs will be implemented in FY 2008 through FY 2010.
   b. Acquire. Officers recruited into the branch should be in the grade of first lieutenant or captain, have troop leading
experience, and, as a minimum, be a CCC graduate from a U.S. Army basic branch.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                              191

   c. Distribute. Under OPMS, CA officers will only serve in CA and branch immaterial positions. Only CA officers
are authorized to fill CA positions and command CA units. The CA Assignments Branch, MFE Division at
USAHRC–Alexandria, and Officer Personnel Management Directorate (OPMD) manage Active Army CA officer
assignments. Team four, Officer Management Division at USAHRC–St. Louis manages USAR CA officer assignments.
   d. Development. The CA Qualification Course is the branch-producing course for all CA officers. Active Army
officers will be required to attain and maintain language proficiency at the 1/1/1 level. Officer development will
continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments in TOE units with troops, staff/TDA
assignments, JIIM, and institutional training assignments. Self-development continues to be an essential component of
officer development. The goal is to professionally develop officers to expertly conduct CA operations in support of the
war fighting combatant commanders. Development starts in the Army school system. All officers selected for major
should complete ILE and should work to obtain a master’s degree as discussed earlier. All lieutenant colonels should
strive to complete JPME II. All colonels should complete SSC.
   e. Deployment. CA officers are warfighters who remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide
on short notice. All CA officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of operations. CA
officers may deploy with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests. CA officers and
enlisted Soldiers may be deployed as individuals to support operations in all JIIM environments. CA branch officers
must prepare themselves and their Families for this most challenging career development function.
   f. Transition. The separation process is the same as for all Army officers.
Chapter 20
Information Operations Functional Area (FA 30)
20–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose of Information Operations.
   (1) IO are the integrated employment of the core capabilities of electronic warfare (EW), computer network
operations (CNO), psychological operations (PSYOP), military deception, (MILDEC), and operations security (OP-
SEC) in concert with specified supporting and related capabilities, to influence, disrupt, corrupt or usurp adversarial
human and automated decision making while protecting our own (JP 3–13).
   (2) Army doctrine retains the intent and essence of joint IO doctrine. Due to the nature and scope of land operations,
however, the Army discharges the IO capabilities a bit differently while still nesting them in the context of JIIM
operations. FM 3–13, under revision, will contain detailed information about Army IO.
   (3) An FA 30’s role in the employment of IO is determined by unit of assignment, mission, and/or commander’s
guidance.
   (4) Information is an element of combat power. Commanders think in terms of combat power required to accom-
plish their assigned mission. They use leadership and information to optimize the effects of the six warfighting
functions. Commanders apply the five Army Information Tasks to achieve the potential of information in full spectrum
operations: Military Deception (MILDEC), Operations Security (OPSEC), Command and Control Warfare (C2W),
Information Protection, and Information Engagement (IE) (FM 3–0).
   (a) Military deception. The DCS, G–3/5/7 has responsibility for military deception. It is coordinated and synchro-
nized in the plans cell. The responsibility for preparing, executing, assessing, and adapting military deception passes to
the DCS, G–3/5/7’s current operations cell in accordance with unit standing operating procedure or upon direction from
the commander or chief of staff.
   (b) Operations security. The G–3/5/7 has responsibility for operations security and physical security. Operations
security is coordinated and synchronized in the Protection Cell.
   (c) Command and control warfare. C2W are actions involving the use of computer networks, electromagnetic and
directed energy, and physical attack to degrade or destroy adversarial command and control or neutralize adversarial
attack capabilities; and, actions to search for, intercept, identify, and locate or localize sources of radiated electromag-
netic energy for the purpose of threat recognition, targeting, planning, and conduct of future operations. C2W
comprises electronic attack, electronic warfare support, computer network attack, computer network exploitation, and
physical attack capabilities. The DCS, G–3/5/7 has overall responsibility for C2W.
   (d) Information protection. Information protection are active or passive measures to protect and defend friendly
information and information systems to ensure friendly access to timely, accurate, and relevant information while
denying adversaries the opportunity to exploit friendly information and information systems for their own purposes.
Information protection comprises information assurance, computer network defense, and electronic protect capabilities.
The CIO/G–6 coordinates and synchronizes information protection in the command, control, communications, and
computer operations (C4OPS) cell.
   (e) Information engagement. Depending on the unit, mission, and commander’s guidance, the S–7/G–7 is responsi-
ble for Information Engagement. Information engagement is defined as the integrated employment of public affairs to
192                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

inform U.S. and friendly audiences; psychological operations, combat camera, U.S. Government strategic communica-
tion and defense support to public diplomacy, and other means necessary to influence foreign audiences; and, leader
and Soldier engagements to support both efforts (FM 3–0). Information Engagement comprises the commander’s
intentional use of words and images to communicate and engage with those publics and actors relevant to the success
of the mission.
   (5) FA 30 officers serve mostly in Army echelons and serve as the unit’s S–7/G–7 or in those staff sections. When
FA 30 officers are assigned to a Joint or other non-Army headquarters they may serve in a J39 staff or equivalent IO
position.
   (6) IO on land are unique in that ground forces are immersed in the socio-cultural mosaic of native populations.
Populations typically comprise diverse social groups, often with diametrically opposed interests, objectives, cultures,
and norms. Hence, in addition to employing the traditional capabilities of IO against adversaries, land component
commanders confront the challenge of orchestrating Information Engagement activities among the disparate social
groups in their area of operations. Army commanders think of IO in terms of effects they must generate to achieve an
operational advantage rather than as a set of information-related tools or capabilities.
   (7) The success of Army full spectrum operations in general, and stability operations in particular, depends largely
on promoting positive perceptions and attitudes of a host population. This shapes the land AO for political, social, and
economic normalization. Commanders use IO and related activities to build trust and confidence, communicate
information, promote support, and counter effects from enemy propaganda, misinformation, rumors, confusion, fear,
and apprehension. Where the use of force is restricted or is not a viable option, the commander can influence attitudes,
reduce commitment to a hostile cause, and convey the willingness to use force without actually employing it through
the integration and application the information tasks. Information used in this manner allows friendly forces to
accomplish missions faster, with fewer casualties and enduring effects.
   b. Proponent information.
   (1) Functional area 30 (FA 30) resides within the functional category of Maneuver, Fires and Effects.
   (2) The Commanding General, Combined Arms Center (CAC) is the Army Proponent for IO and the FA 30
functional area. The CAC CG’s action agency is the Information Operations Proponent, located at 950 Bluntville
Avenue, Building 391, Fort Leavenworth, KS 66027–2100. The Personnel Proponent phone number is 913–684–5318
(DSN 552).
   c. Functions performed by the FA 30. Though FA 30 officers are assigned elsewhere in the force, they serve
primarily as the S/G–7 on staffs at Brigade Combat Team (BCT) through Army Service Component Command
(ASCC). The S/G–7:
   (1) Is a primary coordinating staff principal and, as such, is responsible for conducting necessary coordination
among the staff and with higher, lower, and parallel staff;
   (2) Integrates EW, CNO, OPSEC, MILDEC, and PSYOP capabilities depending on unit of assignment, mission,
and/or commander’s guidance.
   (3) Assists the commander, the staff, and subordinate units in identifying and analyzing those publics and actors
whose perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors are relevant to the unit’s mission;
   (4) Assists the commander and the staff in clarifying and articulating the desired end state conditions (in terms of
perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors) for each relevant public or actor;
   (5) Assists the commander and the staff with the campaign design and the production of operations plans and orders,
helping to ensure planned words, images, and actions are mutually supporting and reinforcing, and are likely to
produce the intended change in perceptions and behaviors among the relevant publics and actors;
   (6) Assists the commander in developing the campaign or mission narrative;
   (7) Coordinates and synchronizes the IE activities-including leader and Soldier engagement, public affairs, psycho-
logical operations, combat camera, and defense support to public diplomacy; and,
   (8) Assists the commander, the staff, and subordinate units in identifying and analyzing adversarial IO capabilities.
   (9) Features of work in FA 30 include:
   (a) Understanding the human, socio-cultural nuances of the operational environment and their implications on the
unit’s assigned mission.
   (b) Understanding the cognitive process-how humans make sense of their environment-and the use of information,
engagement, collaboration, cooperation, and coordination as means to affect the perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, and
ultimately, behaviors of publics and actors that can affect the success or failure of the assigned mission.
   (c) Translating strategic communication guidance from higher into operational and tactical activity; and
   (d) As required, integrate the Information capabilities and resources at the disposal of the command, both military
and non-military, required to implement the commander’s guidance.
20–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders in the 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army
Values and the warrior ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            193

spectrum of conflict. They must be able to operate in JIIM environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in
achieving their objectives. Our officers must be culturally astute and able to use their awareness and understanding to
conduct operations innovatively and courageously to exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the
operational environment. Further explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of
this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of an FA 30 officer.
   (1) Remain up-to-date on Army organizations, structure, and doctrine.
   (2) Be familiar with the core capabilities of IO as well all related and supporting elements.
   (3) Possess the necessary tactical and operational expertise in order to advise the commander and staff on the
benefits of information engagement and other information capabilities and how best to achieve its full potential.
   (4) Possess an undergraduate degree, in one the following or closely related fields of study:
   (a) Advertising
   (b) Cultural Anthropology
   (c) Area Studies
   (d) Broadcasting
   (e) Mass Communications
   (f) Political Science
   (g) History (non-American)
   (h) International Relations
   (i) Journalism
   (j) Marketing
   (k) Psychology
   (l) Sociology
   (m) Public Diplomacy
   (5) Possess the potential for advanced civilian schooling (ACS), training with industry (TWI), and training with
government agencies in the areas of international studies, government, or marketing. Indicators of potential may
include Distinguished Military Graduate from commissioning source, undergraduate grade point average above 3.25,
military academic reports in the top 20 percent, graduating as honor graduate from the FA 30 Qualification Course
(QC) or qualifying graduate record examination scores.
   (6) Understand cultural and/or social anthropology, cross-cultural communications, media and information network
dissemination and gain the required cultural acuity necessary to advise commanders, staffs and units about the area in
which the unit is operating. Officers that have been immersed in a different culture (college junior year abroad, church
mission, Family situation, and so forth) may possess this understanding.
   (7) Have experience in operational assignments, preferably command at platoon or company level and staff experi-
ence in plans or operations.
   (8) Exhibit capacity and capability to understand, articulate, and apply complex concepts as well as properly frame
and solve ambiguous problems.
   c. Unique attributes of an FA 30 officer. FA 30 officers are 21st Century warriors who possess the highest standards
of discretion, integrity, and professional ethics. In addition, they are:
   (1) Adaptive leaders, strategic thinkers.
   (2) Creative problem solvers.
   (3) Expert communicators.
   (4) Masterful negotiators, mediators and arbitrators.
   (5) Creators of exploitable opportunities.
   (6) Ultimate team players.
   d. Security clearance requirements. FA 30 officers must have a secret clearance with eligibility for Top-Secret
Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) access. FA 30 officers must immediately initiate procedures to obtain
the proper level of clearance upon notification of the FA 30 functional designation.
20–3. Officer development
   a. Officer Development Model. The officer development model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation at the 4th or 7th year develops both specific and broad functional competencies.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive for training and assignments
that will broaden and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These broadening opportunities are
194                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

outside one’s normal branch or functional area career development, and are joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and
multinational in nature.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (6) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   b. Lieutenant. FA 30 has no authorized/assigned lieutenants.
   c. Captain. Captains, who are designated as an FA 30 officer and successfully complete the FA 30 QC are
competitive for promotion to major. FA 30 assignment experience as a captain is not required for promotion to major
for 7-year designated captains. This is because the timeline after accession into the functional area does not support
attendance at the FA 30 QC and the completion of a FA 30 follow-on assignment before the major Selection Board.
Developmental assignments for 4 year captains include: serving on Division staff or a Direct Reporting Unit (DRU).
   d. Major. FA 30 majors serve as BCT S–7 officer or in staff organizations at Division, Corps, ASCC or a DRU.
These assignments ensure that FA 30 officers further develop their knowledge and understanding of the operational
force. FA 30 officers can attend resident Intermediate Level Education (ILE) and AOWC at the Command and General
Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. They will be able to compete to attend the School of Advanced Military
Studies (SAMS), Training with Industry (TWI), an Advance Civil Schooling (ACS) program or other initiatives.
Majors that successful complete the FA 30 QC and ILE and have served 24 months cumulative service in an FA 30
assignment are competitive for promotion to lieutenant colonel. Majors that graduate from SAMS must serve a SAMS
utilization tour and at least 12 months in a FA 30 assignment to be competitive for promotion to lieutenant colonel. In
accordance with the CSA’s guidance, assignments with transition teams (TT/PRTs) are considered key developmental
assignments. Majors that serve on these teams should also seek to serve at least 12 months in a FA 30 assignment in
order to be considered competitive for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
   e. Lieutenant colonel. FA 30 lieutenant colonels serve as DCS, G–3/5/7 primary staff officers at Army Division
headquarters or on the staff at Corps, ASCC, Army or a DRU. Lieutenant colonels will have the opportunity to
compete for command of 1st Battalion, 1st Information Operations Command. With additional training, they may serve
on a joint or combatant command staff. Lieutenant colonels that successful complete the FA 30 QC and ILE, and have
served 48 months cumulative service in an FA 30 assignment are competitive for promotion to colonel.
   f. Colonel. FA 30 colonels serve as DCS, G–3/5/7 primary staff officers at Army Corps and ASCC headquarters and
on the staff at Army or a DRU. FA 30 colonels may compete to command 1st Information Operations Command.
Additionally, and with additional training, they may serve on a joint or combatant command staff. If not selected for
resident Senior Service College, FA 30 colonels should apply for the nonresident U.S. Army War College Distance
Education Course.
   g. Overview of FA 30 officer development. Captains interested in becoming FA 30 officers submit their functional
area preference through Human Resource Command’s (AHRC) Web-based preference system in their 4th or 7th year
of commissioned officer military service. Captains, majors and lieutenant colonels are functional area designated into
FA 30 through an Army functional category board or by submitting a request to transfer into FA 30 through AHRC.
The FA 30 career manager at AHRC reviews functional area preference requests in order to identify, recruit, select,
and assess officers who meet the criteria and possess the required skills and experience to serve as FA 30 officer.
Officers may serve in an FA 30 assignment prior to functional area designation by filling a position in an S/G–7 staff
following graduation from the Tactical Information Operations Course (TIOC) at Fort Sill, OK (or one of the two
Army Reserve TIOC Courses). However, the FA 30 career manager at AHRC manages only functional area designated
officers.
   h. FA 30 qualification and development. FA 30 officers will receive initial training and education before they begin
a FA 30 assignment. After selection into FA 30, officers will attend the 12-week FA 30 Qualification Course (QC) at
Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The FA 30 QC is the sole credentialing course for FA 30 designated officers. The FA 30
QC develops FA 30 officers with the requisite competencies to serve successfully on staffs at a Brigade Combat Team
(BCT) through ASCC. FA 30 officer participation in other Army educational opportunities is based on Army needs. A
limited number of officers will be selected for fully funded ACS or TWI programs. Although it is not required for
promotion consideration, a graduate degree should be a goal of every FA 30 officer.
   i. Command opportunities and key billets.
   (1) There are two command opportunities for FA 30 officers: Commander, 1st Battalion, 1st Information Operations
Command at the rank/grade of LTC/O–5, and Commander, 1st Information Operations Command at the rank/grade of
COL/O–6.
   (2) There are several key billet opportunities for FA 30 officers (effective FY 11/12): Corps-level officers for DCS,
G–3/5/7 (COL/O–6) and Division-level DCS, G–3/5/7 (LTC/O–5) positions.
   j. Nominative assignments. FA 30 officers have several opportunities to serve in nominative assignments including:
Army Staff (ARSTAF), Joint assignments, Special Mission Units (SMU) and NATO.
   k. Joint assignments. Joint FA 30 positions are on the JDAL. Officers assigned to those billets will receive the joint
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           195

officer specialty skill identifier upon successful joint tour completion. Normally, FA 30 officers are nominated for joint
duty assignments after selection to major. FA 30 officers assigned to a joint, COCOM, or other non-Army headquarters
will most likely serve in the J39 section.
   l. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Captains and above can serve in branch/functional area generalist
assignments such as ROTC, USMA faculty and staff, and Inspector General. Although not associated with a specific
branch or functional area, these assignments are important to the Army.
   m. Assignment preferences and precedence. The assignment sequencing in a functional area is not as rigid as that of
a branch. Functional area assignments should professionally develop FA 30 officers in a variety of environments. After
receiving their initial training, FA 30 officers should seek different types of responsibilities within the FA 30 force
structure to provide breadth to their experiences and professional development. Normally, FA 30 officers will complete
at least one operational assignment in a FA 30 coded position before ILE attendance.
   (1) Preferences. The FA 30 career development path provides for many diverse opportunities. The objective of these
opportunities is to develop FA 30 officers with the ability to help commanders and staffs achieve the full potential of
Information at increasing levels of responsibility in both Army and Joint assignments. Officers will attend the FA 30
QC course prior to their initial assignment to an FA 30 position.
   (2) Precedence. Assignments to FA 30 positions deployed in support of on-going operations will have precedence
during this era of persistent conflict. FA 30 officers will complete an Army FA 30 assignment before a joint
assignment. Typically, FA 30 officers should seek the following assignments: BCT S–7; Field Support Team Chief;
Division-level officer for DCS, G–3/5/7; Commander, 1st Battalion, 1st Information Operations Command; Command-
er, 1st Information Operations Command; Corps-level officer for DCS, G–3/5/7; Director, Information Operations
Proponent; and Chief, DAMO–ODI.
   n. Duration of critical officer life-cycle assignments. Most assignments for FA 30 officers will be 24 to 36 months
in length. Tours may be longer in areas with a high concentration of billets, such as the National Capital Region.
Locations outside the continental United States will continue to require specific tour lengths. There is no single position
that fully qualifies an FA 30 officer. Figure 20–1 depicts an IO functional area life-cycle development model for an
Active Army officer.
   o. Requirements, authorizations and inventory. FA 30 officers are 21st century warriors, personally and profession-
ally prepared to deploy worldwide at all times. The FA 30 career progression goal is to maintain a viable career path
for FA 30 officers. To meet this goal, the field grade inventory is prioritized to fill FA 30 authorizations for the current
and future force requirements. FA 30 officers are provided sufficient time in assignments to fully qualify them before
consideration for promotion.
   (1) Acquire. The criteria for selecting an officer into FA 30 include needs of the Army, type of civilian degree and
grade point average, duty performance, and personal preference. Personal preference will be determined by using
AHRC’s functional designation preference sheet, which will be online at the link provided in the MILPER message
advising eligible year groups to submit their preferences. Eligible officers are in their 4th or 7th year of commissioned
service.
   (2) Distribute. The FA 30 career manager at AHRC manages FA 30 officers from their functional designation
through the rank of lieutenant colonel. Once selected for colonel, the Senior Leadership Division gains control over the
FA 30 officer’s career path and assignments. Assignments will depend upon the needs of the Army, professional
development considerations, officer qualifications, and officer preference.
   (3) Deploy. Whether assigned to TO&E or TDA organizations, all FA 30 officers must be deployable to accomplish
missions across the full spectrum of operations. FA 30 officers may deploy with their units or as individual support to
various worldwide operations.
   (4) Sustain. FA 30 officers will compete within the functional category of Maneuver, Fires, and Effects, for
promotion to major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel.
   (5) Develop. FA 30 incorporates a professional officer development plan offering maximum diversity for assignment
and schooling. FA 30 officers apply and develop their skills through a series of progressively challenging assignments.
As FA 30 officers progress through their careers, they become eligible for additional educational training, preparing
them for positions of increased responsibility.
   (6) Train. The FA 30 officers attend the ILE, both the Common Core Course and the AOWC at the Command and
General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, KS. The FA 30 officers are Military Education Level (MEL) ILE and JPME
1 qualified after successfully completing the ILE Common Core Course and AOWC.
   (7) Separate. The FA 30 officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
196                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

                              Figure 20–1. Information Operations Officer Development Model
20–4. Warrant officer development.
FA 30 has no authorized/assigned warrant officers.
20–5. Reserve Component Information Operations officers
   a. General career development. Reserve Component (RC) FA 30 officer development objectives and qualifications
parallel those planned for their Active Duty counterparts. Officers must develop a strong foundation through assign-
ments in their basic branches before specializing in FA 30 assignments.
   b. Functional area qualification and development opportunities. RC officers should strive for FA 30 assignments
that yield the same development opportunities as their AA counterparts. RC officers retain their basic branch with a
skill identifier for FA 30, since they do not functional area designate into FA 30 through a AHRC functional area
designation board.
   (1) The qualification standards at each rank, professional military education and length of service in FA 30
assignments are the same as for AA officers.
   (2) RC officers with FA 30 skill identifiers can expect to serve in a Theater IO Group, Troop Program Unit, as an
individual mobilization augmentee, or in an individual ready reserve assignment. These varying assignments bolster
total Army FA 30 capabilities, develop officer’s leadership skills, and increase the individual’s knowledge of the RC
roles and mission.
   (3) RC officers with civilian acquired skills in communications, marketing, organizational behavior, or other related
fields are a valuable Army resource. Officers with skills in these areas through employment or civilian education will
be competitive for promotion and selection to FA 30 positions of increased responsibility.

Public Affairs Functional Area (FA 46)
21–1. Unique features of the Public Affairs functional area
   a. Unique purpose of Public Affairs functional area. Public Affairs (PA) is a functional area aligned under the MFE
functional category. Public Affairs is an element of command policy and decision-making that provides trusted advice
and counsel on the public implications of organizational operations. Army public affairs programs play a vital role in
the ability of a command to meet its military objectives. Public Affairs officers develop strategies, lead and supervise
the conduct of public engagements, community relations, command information and media relations in support of this
role. The Public Affairs officer’s principle role is to advise and counsel the commander and the staff on how the unit’s
operations will be comprehended by the affected publics both internal and external. The officer then develops and
executes effective public affairs operations designed to articulate and explain the commander’s actions to those affected
in such a manner that they are informed in peacetime, conflict and war. Public Affairs officers provide commanders
with the expertise and guidance to conduct public affairs operations and enhance the command’s ability to collect,
process and act on information. Because mass media and information technologies reach audiences immediately, Public
Affairs officers assist the commander to anticipate and address the media impact on internal (command information)
and external (public information) audiences. Public Affairs has a complementary role to Civil Affairs, SOF and
associated roles with Psychological Operations and Information Operations. Trained and experienced Public Affairs
officers operate in a rapidly evolving and adapting information environment and their activities enhance the capabilities
of the other MFE branches. The Department of the Army Chief of Public Affairs is the proponent for FA 46.
   b. Unique functions performed by Public Affairs functional area. Public Affairs fulfills the Army’s obligation to
keep the American people and the Army informed, and helps to establish the conditions that lead to confidence in
America’s Army and its readiness to conduct operations in peacetime, conflict and war. This mission includes planning
for and providing information to Soldiers and government and contract employees on their roles, keeping Family
members informed, explaining to the American public what the Army is doing, maintaining effective relationships with
communities and stakeholder groups, anticipating and responding to issues that arise from media coverage or commu-
nity interest.
   c. Unique features of work in Public Affairs functional area. Effective Army Public Affairs requires the application
of professional and technical skills from the military and civilian sectors. Public Affairs officers are personal staff
officers or principals who supervise public affairs staffs, advise senior commanders and leaders, lead PA units or serve
on higher command public affairs staffs. They serve on the personal staff at brigade and higher. They serve as
instructors at the Defense Information School (DINFOS), Fort Meade, MD and other institutions. They provide public
affairs coordination at all levels of command and are responsible for effective execution of the public affairs core
processes:
   (1) Advisor to commander and staff. Public Affairs officers provide the advice and counsel regarding the public
(internal and external) implications of all major decisions and actions. This role includes:
   (a) Counseling commander and staff as to strategies to achieve information dominance and reduce misinformation,
rumors, uncertainty, fear and enemy disinformation efforts.
   (b) Participating in boards, working groups, cells and advisory groups.

   (a) Evaluating community relations programs and public attitudes through formal, developed feedback mechanisms.
   (b) Developing and managing of community relations programs such as commander’s councils and speakers’
bureaus.
   (c) Planning and arranging special events, open houses, tours, speaking engagements, exhibits and demonstrations.
21–2. Public Affairs officer characteristics required
   a. General. Public Affairs officers are tactically proficient because of their basic branch training and assignments.
This grounding in the tactical and operational Army is vital to success and credibility as Public Affairs officers.
Because their roles and duties require them to explain the Army and its operations to a wide range of external and
internal audiences, Public Affairs officers participate in ongoing operational professional military education and
maintain a sound grasp of Army and joint doctrine and warfighting knowledge throughout their careers. Public Affairs
core processes occur across the spectrum of peacetime and conflict in joint, interagency, intergovernmental and
multinational contexts. Public Affairs officers require extensive understanding of these other key participants in the
information domain. Public Affairs units operate extensively in support of joint operations requiring PAOs to have a
solid understanding of joint operations and planning processes. All Public Affairs officers require security clearances
and access to programs to perform their duties at the level to which they are assigned. FA 46 majors typically are
assigned Public Affairs or IO/IE planning staffs at Division or higher and should begin processing TS–SCI requests
immediately upon receiving orders. All operational FA lieutenant colonel assignments require TS–SCI access and
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                          199

officers selected for those positions should immediately process requests upon release of the MFE–PA lieutenant
colonel promotion list.
   b. Unique skills. FA 46 officers form a pool of highly qualified officers capable of supporting tactical, operational
and strategic level requirements in peace and war. FA 46 officers are required to display a wide range of skills,
knowledge and attributes.
   (1) Interpersonal skills. Public Affairs officers are part of the combined arms and joint and expeditionary teams.
They must be confident, informed and skilled in building teamwork within their staff organization and recognize they
often simultaneously belong to many teams; facilitating development of those teams. In addition, they must:
   (a) Be effective, exemplary communicators with highly developed speaking and listening skills.
   (b) Demonstrate outstanding leadership skills in tactical and institutional environments; apply those skills in dealing
with military and civilian personnel.
   (c) Have highly developed coaching, mentoring and facilitation skills.
   (2) Conceptual and decision-making skills. Public Affairs officers must have sound judgment and be both critical
and creative in their thinking. They routinely operate in high-level staff assignments where guidance may be minimal
and close interaction with senior level decision makers is frequent. They work in a dynamic, high tempo environment
and must be tactically and technically skilled, effective staff officers with the ability to synthesize data and to
communicate information clearly. Public Affairs officers work independently and make decisions with little or no
immediate supervision. The ability to work under pressure and deal positively with stress is essential.
   (3) Tactical and technical skills. Public Affairs officers must exhibit proficiency in professional knowledge, judg-
ment and warfighting.       They apply skills from the military and private sectors and must:
   (a) Master and apply a comprehensive set of communication, counseling and advising skills to accomplish public
affairs and military support to public diplomacy missions.
   (b) Incorporate and apply advanced automation and information management skills to the Public Affairs functional
area.
   (c) Be the Army’s experts in all forms of internal, external, interpersonal, organizational, intercultural and mass
communications, to include training others in communications skills.
   (d) Be innovative, adaptive and at ease when operating in joint, interagency intergovernmental and multinational
operations.
   (e) Be capable of conducting independent operations in support of Commanders’ information campaigns.
   c. Unique knowledge. Public Affairs officers are well versed in current Army organization, structure and doctrine. In
addition, they:
   (1) Possess a comprehensive knowledge of public relations, organizational communications and issue management.
   (2) Remain current on developments in the civilian community for possible application to their area of expertise.
   (3) Understand the implications of operating in the real-time and near real-time information battle space and
advising commanders and staff in that aspect of operations.
   (4) Observe, understand, assess and operate in the greater geo-military political realm.
   (5) Understand the impact of their actions and information strategies on the local, regional, theater-strategic and
strategic battlespace.
   d. Unique attributes. Public Affairs officers must exhibit intellectual honesty with superiors and be unafraid to state
and defend their convictions. Public Affairs officers must often deliver unpleasant news and persuade superiors to
approve or accomplish difficult or unattractive courses of action. They must:
   (1) Possess a deep respect for the principles of Constitutional democracy. No one can effectively perform as an
Army Public Affairs officer without a thorough knowledge of the Bill of Rights and the conviction that the American
people have a right to know.
   (2) Realize they represent the Army and the commander first and have a specific mandate to help Army leaders gain
and keep public support for Army Leadership goals.
   (3) Understand a fundamental tenet of Army Public Affairs philosophy is that the best way to gain and maintain
public support is always tell the truth. Integrity is paramount.
   (4) Be warfighters capable of leading change and accommodating ambiguity in the conduct of operations in the
global information environment.
   (5) Be comfortable and confident in working in the joint, combined, interagency and multinational aspects of public
information.
21–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
   a. General. The goal of FA 46 development is to provide the Army a qualified, credentialed Public Affairs
professional and advisor to the commander and provide the individual officer a successful career within the Maneu-
ver, Fires and Effects functional category. All FA 46 officers begin their careers in one of the Army’s accession
branches and attend branch basic and advanced courses. Officers who have served successfully in company grade
positions are highly desired for designation to the Public Affairs functional area in their eighth year of service. A small
200                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

number of officers will be provided the opportunity for early functional designation at their 4th year of commissioned
service following the CCC. Designation is based upon the needs of the Army, officer preference, military experience
and in some cases, civil schooling. Most officers will not receive a FA 46 assignment until selection to major and
functional designation into the MF&E functional category as a Public Affairs officer. The most competitive officers are
those who have served successfully as the Public Affairs officer in operational units.
   b. Functional area qualification and development. Attendance at the Defense Information School’s Public Affairs
Qualification Course (PAQC) is mandatory for all FA 46 officers prior to their first FA 46 assignment. FA 46 officers,
whose first Public Affairs assignment is with the American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS), Defense
Media Agency (DMA) or a Broadcast Operations Detachment (BOD) for RC officers, attend specialized training in the
management and administration of broadcast networks after attending PAQC. FA 46 officers assigned to AFRTS or
BOD positions later in their career will attend this training en route to the assignment.
   (1) Captain. Experience in the Public Affairs functional area at the rank of captain is not a requirement for
promotion to major, but could enhance selection to Public Affairs during the Functional Board Designation process. FA
46 captain positions are key developmental billets, but in the current OPMS system are not crucial to career
progression in the functional area. At this level, officers can serve as Public Affairs Detachment commanders, Mobile
Public Affairs Detachment team leaders, or division or higher Public Affairs staff officers.
   (2) Major. After selection to major, officers will be designated into one of the three OPMS Career Fields by a
Functional Designation Board. Public Affairs officers in the MF&E functional category serve primarily in operational
PA assignments. FA 46 majors should aggressively seek key assignments in which they are the principal spokesperson
for operational units or Mobile Public Affairs Detachment commanders. Other qualifying jobs include nominative
assignments on headquarters, DOD and joint staffs. Majors who complete required developmental training and have
served successfully for at least 24 months in a Public Affairs assignment are considered qualified for promotion in the
functional area. They compete against other officers in the MF&E functional category for promotion to lieutenant
colonel. Completion of the ILE Common Core Curriculum is essential for all majors to be competitive for promotion to
lieutenant colonel. Majors who have successfully served in BCTs as the spokesperson for and principle advisor to the
Commander on Public Affairs Operations are highly sought after for future senior leadership positions including
division and corps PAO.
   (3) Lieutenant colonel. Officers selected for lieutenant colonel should seek assignments of greater responsibility as
the primary Public Affairs officer in operational units. FA 46 lieutenant colonels are generally assigned to senior staff
positions, where they can fully use their knowledge of the Army and their functional area. Public Affairs officers who
have demonstrated high potential will be assigned to flag-officer level commands and nominative positions on
headquarters, DOD and joint staffs, and DMA/AFRTS network command positions. Lieutenant colonels are encour-
aged to seek Public Affairs assignments within joint commands to gain the joint and combined command exposure and
experience.
   (a) Professional development. A graduate degree in a public affairs related discipline is highly desired, but not
required, for FA 46 lieutenant colonels prior to primary zone consideration for promotion to colonel. Additionally,
Public Affairs officers are encouraged to seek professional accreditation through organizations such as the Public
Relations Society of America or the International Association of Business Communicators.
   (b) Functional area qualification. The FA 46 officers are considered functional area qualified and eligible to compete
in the MF&E Functional category for promotion to colonel if they have 48 months cumulative public affairs
experience. They also must have served in one of the following positions:
   1. Principal Public Affairs officer for a 2-star or 3-star level commander for at least 18 months.
   2. AFRTS/DMA Network lieutenant colonel level commander for 24 months.
   3. Director of an Office of the Chief of Public Affairs field operating activity. All FA 46 officers should have served
a minimum of 18 months time in field grade operational or equivalent assignments, preferably as a primary Public
Affairs officer, prior to consideration for promotion to colonel.
   4. Colonel. All FA 46 colonels should complete resident or nonresident Senior Service College. As the senior
practitioners in their functional area, they serve primarily on joint, ACOM, ASCC or HQDA staffs. Key assignments
include combatant commands and ACOM or ASCC Public Affairs officer positions, director of Army Broadcasting
Service, director of Army Public Affairs Center, director of the Defense Information School or division chief billets on
the HQDA and DOD Public Affairs staffs.
   c. Defense Media Agency assignments. The DMA was instituted by the 2005 Quadrennial Review Report to
consolidate the Services’ internal information efforts under one organization. The Soldiers Media Center, established in
2004 to consolidate the Department of the Army’s internal information effort, is the DMA Army element. The SMC
includes:
   (1) U.S. Army News Service
   (2) U.S. Army Soldiers Magazine
   (3) U.S. Army Soldiers Radio and Television
   (4) U.S. Army Element Army/Air Force Hometown News Service
   (5) AFN–Europe
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            201

   (6) AFN–South
   (7) AFN–Korea
   d. OCPA Field Operating Activities assignments:
   (1) U.S. Army Office of the Chief of Public Affairs-Western region, Los Angeles
   (2) U.S. Army Office of the Chief of Public Affairs-Eastern Region, New York
   (3) U.S. Army Office of the Chief of Public Affairs, Mid-West
   (4) Army Public Affairs Center
   e. Joint assignments. FA 46 officers will serve in joint commands whether they are formally assigned to a JDAL
position. Officers assigned to JDAL positions will meet all JPME requirements. Public Affairs units and officers
routinely support joint operations. Public Affairs officers should seek to attend all available joint courses taught by
DINFOS and the National Defense University Joint Forces Staff College. Only officers who first graduate the Joint and
Combined Warfighting School prior to a follow-on joint assignment will be designated as Joint Specialty Officers (skill
identifier 3L). FA 46 officers normally will not be considered for assignment to JDAL positions until they have served
an initial Army FA 46 assignment and been selected for promotion to major. Because not all FA 46 officers will serve
in JDAL assignments, the absence of a joint assignment will not preclude their selection to colonel.
   f. Assignment preference and precedence.
   (1) Assignment sequencing. Prior to their first FA 46 assignment, all officers will receive their initial functional area
training at DINFOS. All Public Affairs officer assignments require graduation from the Public Affairs Qualification
Course (PAQC). In addition to the PAQC requirement, an AFRTS/DMA assignment requires successful completion of
the DINFOS Broadcast Management Course (BMC). It is extremely important that an officer’s first FA 46 assignment
be a position where the officer is personally supervised or mentored by a senior Public Affairs officer and works with
Public Affairs noncommissioned officers.
   (2) Precedence. Some FA 46 billets are designated as requiring ACS or TWI. Officers assigned to those jobs must
complete the required courses prior to reporting to their duty assignments.
   (a) Officers selected for ACS should seek degrees supporting strategic or mass communication and public diploma-
cy. Officers who have successfully completed ACS and TWI programs will be assigned to jobs that provide the Army
maximum benefit from this valuable training. In some cases officers selected for ACS and TWI incur an additional
service obligation and designated assignment to capitalize on that experience.
   (b) Unique opportunities for repetitive assignments. U.S. Army Accessions and Recruiting Commands have require-
ments for Public Affairs officers with education, experience and expertise in marketing and advertising. The USAREC
has several positions at the captain and major level requiring either advance civil schooling or TWI in marketing and
advertising. The USAAC and USAREC senior level PAO positions may require both experiences in order to provide
the Army the correct skills to advise the commander and develop programs in support of the Army’s recruiting efforts.
FA 46 may offer select officers repetitive assignments within USAAC to capitalize on these unique skill sets and
professional development requirements.
21–4. Duration of critical officer life-cycle assignments
   a. General. Most public affairs assignments are 36 months and will be synchronized with Unit Life Cycle manage-
ment to the maximum extent possible. Tours could be longer in areas with a high concentration of PA positions. The
OCONUS locations will continue to require tour lengths specific to those regions. This strategy will allow officers to
attend public affairs functional area training en route to their PA assignments as required.
   b. Key Public Affairs functional area qualification assignments. Public Affairs Detachment commanders should
serve for 18 to 24 months. Mobile Public Affairs Detachment commanders should serve for 24 months. Unless
assigned to a short tour area, Public Affairs assignments should be a minimum of 24 months, however the goal is to
serve at least 36 months. The AFRTS network commanders serve for 24 to 36 months per theater assignment policies.
   c. Public Affairs functional area life-cycle. Figure 21–1 depicts the Public Affairs life-cycle model.
202                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

                                Figure 21–1. The AA Public Affairs Officer Development Model
21–5. Requirements, authorizations and inventory
   a. Goal. The goal is sustain a cadre of highly qualified Public Affairs officers while providing a viable career path
to colonel for high-potential FA 46 officers. The FA 46 officer inventory must be optimized to fulfill Public Affairs
requirements while providing sufficient time for functional area qualification prior to consideration for promotion to
lieutenant colonel and colonel.
   b. OPMS implementation. The number of authorized FA 46 authorizations, by grade, will vary as force structure
decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more information on current authoriza-
tions or inventory should contact the AHRC FA 46 assignments officer. Figure 21–1 provides a good overview of
assignment opportunities. Public Affairs maintains a professional forum and collaboration site within Army Knowledge
Online with additional information.
21–6. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for Public Affairs
   a. Structure. Public Affairs officers serve in all echelons worldwide. The FA 46 positions exist in Army operational
units, headquarters staffs, joint commands, and national agencies.
   b. Acquire. The FA 46 officers comprising a particular year group are designated into the functional area at their
fourth year, for a select few, and eighth year of service. The criteria for selecting an officer to the Public Affairs
functional area include manner of performance, civilian degree concentration, grade point average, and personal
preference.
   c. Distribute. After designation into the MFE functional category and functional area designation as Public Affairs,
the AHRC Career Management Division will manage FA 46 officer assignments. The FA 46 officers will be assigned
in accordance with force stabilization strategies.
   d. Deploy. Public affairs is a high-demand, low-density career field. The FA 46 officers are warfighters who remain
personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide. The majority of FA 46 officers are assigned to TOE units
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                         203

with high levels of readiness. All FA 46 officers must be worldwide deployable to accomplish missions across the full
spectrum of peace and conflict. The FA 46 officers may deploy tomorrow with their expeditionary units to deter
potential adversaries and to protect national interests, or as individuals to support joint and multinational operations
other than war, such as humanitarian and peacekeeping missions. Public Affairs officers must prepare themselves and
their Families for this challenging life-cycle function.
   e. Sustain. Officers designated into the MFE functional category will compete within their functional category for
promotion to lieutenant colonel and colonel.
   f. Develop. Public affairs officer development is based upon institutional training, operational assignments, cultural
awareness and self-development. Effective development and sustainment of FA 46 skills and knowledge occurs
throughout the FA 46 life-cycle.
   (1) Training. The FA 46 institutional training includes the following elements:
   (a) Initial specialty training. This training is conducted at DINFOS. All FA 46 officers attend the 8-week Public
Affairs Officer Qualification Course prior to their initial public affairs assignment. The PAOQC provides the basic
knowledge and skills required to perform entry-level public affairs officer duties. Officers selected for their first
broadcast assignment will attend the BMC at DINFOS.
   (b) Graduate level advanced civilian schooling (ACS). Some FA 46 officers attend Army-funded graduate school in
a public affairs related discipline. Selection is competitive and normally occurs after the eighth year of service.
Following graduation, officers are assigned to Army Educational Requirements System (AERS) designated utilization
positions such as OCPA staff, Army Accessions Command staff and OCPA field operating agencies, unless Army
needs dictate otherwise.
   (c) Training with industry program. High-potential officers spend from 10 to 12 months training with leading print,
broadcast or public relations companies. Following graduation, they are assigned to AERS designated positions. The
nomination process for TWI is similar to the ACS program process, but officers should have completed ILE, have 24
months public affairs experience and be highly competitive for promotion. Utilization tours are OCPA–NY, OC-
PA–MW, OCPA–LA, AFN–E, AFN–S, AFN–K and Army Accessions Command.
   (d) Combined ACS/TWI program. This highly competitive program places an officer in a program that combines
graduate level schooling with a TWI assignment. At the completion of an 18-month program, the officer receives a
graduate degree in public communication along with TWI experience at a leading international Washington D.C. based
public relations firm. The officer then serves a utilization tour in the Office, Chief of Public Affairs or as the PA
assistant to a senior Army leader.
   (e) Joint Communications Course. Sponsored by DINFOS, this graduate-level course is taught at a major university
and is geared toward communication theory, research and evaluation. Credit earned can be applied toward a graduate
communication degree.
   (f) ILE Common Core Curriculum. Presently, FA 46 majors will attend the 12-week common core course in
residence at a course location site or Fort Leavenworth. Select officers will attend ILE at Fort Leavenworth followed
immediately by the AOWC. After graduation from ILE, officers are Intermediate Staff College graduates and creden-
tialed with Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) 1 qualification. Full ILE credit is awarded when the officer
has completed the common core course. Full ILE credit is not required prior to promotion to lieutenant colonel.
Reserve Component officers can attend TASS classrooms located in CONUS and OCONUS course location sites.
   (g) Advance Operational Warfighting Course. High performing public affairs officers will attend AOWC at Fort
Leavenworth at the same ratio as other MFE officers.
   (h) Broadcast Management Course. Taught at DINFOS for officers who are en route to an AFRTS or a BOD
assignment. The course familiarizes officers with AFRTS broadcast management principles, station management and
broadcast policies.
   (i) Senior Public Affairs Officer Seminar. The seminar is available for senior lieutenant colonels and colonels
selected to attend by the Chief of Public Affairs. The seminar provides a capstone experience for seasoned practitioners
who will occupy senior public affairs billets at the highest levels of military service. Using a blend of top-flight outside
speakers and classroom discussion, this course will better prepare senior PAOs to become effective strategic communi-
cations counselors to combatant commanders, for example, CJCS, Unified Commands, Service Chiefs, and so forth.
   (2) Operational assignments. Public affairs officers should serve in operational and generating force assignments.
Public affairs officers should have at least 48 months cumulative field grade public affairs experience prior to primary
zone consideration for promotion to colonel.
   (3) Self-development. Public affairs officers must pursue an aggressive self- development program. Membership and
accreditation by a relevant professional organization is strongly encouraged. Professional reading and research is key to
maintaining strategic and tactical skills and knowledge. Public affairs officers must maintain currency with doctrinal
developments, joint PA policies and procedures, and overall U.S. political, economic and military strategies. All public
affairs officers must be familiar with HQDA level strategic communications programs and goals.
   g. Separate. Public affairs officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
204                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

21–7. Public Affairs Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. Reserve Component FA 46 officer development objectives and qualifications
parallel those of their Active Army colleagues. Because the majority of tactical public affairs assets are in the RC, RC
public affairs officers can expect Active Duty deployments in support of Army and joint missions. This mandates an
equivalent development program for RC FA 46 officers. The RC officers do not necessarily single track within CF
designation 46 due to the locations of various public affairs units. However, recurring assignments and supporting
education and deployments within public affairs are essential for qualified and experienced RC leadership.
   b. Public affairs Reserve Component functional area qualification and development. Development and qualification
will be equivalent to the AA. Greater use of distance learning approaches will be used to ensure delivery of required
training and education to RC officers. The RC public affairs officers should seek the same developmental opportunities
as their AA counterparts or equivalent opportunities available in the Army National Guard or U.S. Army Reserve. The
RC officers will not be awarded FA 46 until successful completion of the Public Affairs Officer Qualification Course-
Distance Learning (PAOQC–ADL) (Phase II) or the resident PAOQC. RC officers enrolled in PAOQC–ADL may
serve in a public affairs billet prior to completion. The PAOQC–ADL must be completed within 3 years of enrollment.
Successful completion of PAOQC–ADL or PAOQC is required prior to assumption of PA TOE unit command.
Officers assigned to Broadcast Operations Detachments should attend BMC following PAOQC–ADL or PAOQC
completion. Qualification requirements may be waived only with the concurrence of the Chief, Army Public Affairs.
The FA 46 exception to policy requests should be forwarded through the appropriate RC public affairs headquarters for
review before reaching the Army Public Affairs Center for a final decision. Contact the appropriate RC public affairs
headquarters or the Army Public Affairs Center for current procedures.
   c. Public Affairs Reserve Component assignments. The RC FA 46 officer assignments parallel those of their AA
colleagues with some inherent component unique differences. These component unique positions include State Area
Command PAO, BOD Commander/Operations Officer and Unified Command Staff IMA. Because the majority of
tactical public affairs assets are in the RC, RC public affairs officers can expect Active Duty deployments in positions
of Coalition Press Information Center staff officer/director in support of ongoing Army and joint missions. Many
positions parallel the AA, to include Public Affairs Operations Center commander, MPAD commander, BOD com-
mander, Public Affairs Detachment commander, brigade combat team PAO, Division PAO, TSC PAO.

Signal Corps Branch
22–1. Introduction.
   a. Purpose of the Signal Corps branch. The primary mission of the Signal Corps (Branch 25) is to provide seamless,
secure, continuous and robust communications networks and information services support at all levels from sustaining
military bases to forward-deployed fighting forces in support of Army, Joint, Combined, and Coalition operations
worldwide. Signal officers lead and manage Signal organizations, forces and operations that enable globally-dispersed,
network-centric warfare. Signal warrant officers provide technical leadership and advice in planning and directing
Signal operations.
   b. Proponent Information. All component (AA, USAR and ARNG) Branch 25 officers and warrant officers have an
Army personnel proponent in the Office of the Chief of Signal, Fort Gordon, GA. Further information can be obtained
through http://www.gordon.army.mil and by calling 706–791–6652. Also managed by this office are the FA 24
Telecommunications Systems Engineer and FA 53 Information System Manager.
   c. Functions. Signal branch and warrant officers are responsible for the Army’s communication and information
systems and serve as Joint command, control, communications and computers systems integrators. It is the Signal
Corps’ responsibility to—
   (1) provide and manage the communications and information systems support that network the force across a
multitude of battlefield platforms and mission areas.
206                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   (2) encompass all aspects of planning, designing, installing, maintaining, managing and protecting information
networks to include communications links, computers, and other components of local and wide area networks.
   (3) integrate user owned and operated systems into the networks.
   (4) plan, install, operate, maintain and protect voice and data communications networks that employ single and
multichannel satellite (space-based), tropospheric scatter, terrestrial microwave, switching, messaging, video-telecon-
ferencing, visual information, and other related systems.
   (5) integrate tactical, strategic and sustaining base communications, information processing and management sys-
tems into a seamless global information grid (GIG) that enables network-centric warfare for Army, Joint and Coalition
operations.
   (6) provide a myriad of state-of-the-art, real time voice and data tactical information systems to provide information
services to all elements on the battlefield and reach-back to the sustaining military base.
   (7) be responsible for the Army’s portion of the Defense Information System Network (DISN) and its interface with
tactical signal elements at theater and corps.
   (8) Together with its Air Force and Navy counterparts, the Signal Corps manages and directs the Joint operation of
the GIG serving the Department of Defense and the National Command Authority. At all levels, the Signal Corps
provides communications and information systems and networks to support the Nation’s forces across the entire
operational spectrum.
22–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army Values
and the warrior ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the spectrum of
conflict. They must be able to operate in JIIM environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving
their objectives. Our officers must be culturally astute and able to use their awareness and understanding to conduct
operations innovatively and courageously to exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the operational
environment. Further explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this
publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of a Signal officer. The BR 25 Signal officer is the orchestrator of the warrant
officers, enlisted Soldier and functional area officers to accomplish the core competencies of the Signal Regiment.
Those core competencies are enterprise systems management/network management, computer network defense/infor-
mation assurance, content staging/information dissemination management, visual information and electro-magnetic
spectrum operations. These competencies support the Army CIO /G–6 focus areas of knowledge management and
cyberspace operations. BR 25 officers must also possess expert knowledge of Army, Joint, Combined, and Coalition
signal support and coordination principles. This knowledge includes practical experience in tactics, combined arms
operations and the employment of direct and indirect fire weapon systems. Signal officers require technical proficiency
with branch and mission unique equipment, tools and systems. Proper balance between these technical skills and the
ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactical skills to include military decision making skills, troop to task
assignments and TACSOP development is critical for mission success. Signal officers are grounded in troop leading
skills as well as managerial and technical skills. Signal officers must aggressively pursue knowledge about existing and
future information systems and technology. Additionally, all Signal officers should strive both on and off duty to learn
as much as possible about technology management, telecommunications, automation and the Global Information
Infrastructure. Signal officers are encouraged to obtain additional degrees in some type of information related
discipline.
22–3. Signal Branch officer development
   a. Officer Development Model. The Officer Development Model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation at the 4th or 7th year develops both specific and broad functional competencies.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive for training and assignments
that will broaden and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These broadening opportunities are
outside one’s normal branch or functional area career development, and are joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and
multinational in nature.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (6) Flexible timelines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                          207

   b. Lieutenant development.
   (1) Education. All Signal lieutenants must complete the Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC) phase III which
provides the technical signal training. These skills along with the tactical training accomplished in phase II prepare a
new Signal lieutenant for success in their initial assignment.
   (2) Assignments for lieutenants are normally at company level to gain troop-leading experience and to enhance
technical and tactical competence including:
   (a) Platoon leader
   (b) Direct Signal Support Team Officer in Charge (DSST OIC)
   (c) Company Executive Officer
   (d) Battalion Staff Officer Signal Corps lieutenants are fully developed after serving a minimum of 12 months in
any of these positions.
   (3) Self-development. Lieutenants should focus on acquiring and refining troop leading procedures, coordination,
logistics, technical and administrative skills, as well as Signal unique technical skills required to plan, install, operate,
and maintain signal equipment and systems. In addition to branch unique tasks, Signal lieutenants should also become
proficient in common core tasks.
   (4) Desired experience Before promotion to captain, officers should possess in-depth knowledge of Signal opera-
tions and its integration into combined arms operations.
   (5) The Signal Corps Branch Detail program is an important part of officer accession process. This critical program
assigns newly commissioned Signal officers to branches with large lieutenant requirements. In accordance with AR
614–100, 3–1g, the branch detail period is 48 months including time spent in Initial Entry Training (IET). Upon return
to the Signal Corps, branch detailed officers must attend the Signal Officer Branch Qualification (SOBQ), followed by
the Signal Captain Career Course (SCCC). After completing both courses, detailed officers are developed in the same
manner as their non-detailed counterparts.
   c. Captain development.
   (1) Education for Signal captains is the Signal Captain Career Course (SCCC) generally attended between the 4th
and 7th year of service. The SCCC is a permanent change of station (PCS) course. Additionally those assigned as
Battalion S–6 should return to Fort Gordon to attend the Battalion S–6 Staff Officers Course.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Captains should have as a goal to serve at least 24 months in one or a
combination of the following key developmental assignments:
   (a) Company Command
   (b) Non-Signal Battalion S–6
   (c) Transition Team (TT) Signal Mentor/Advisor
   (3) AHRC Network and Space Operations Branch will make the final determination as to when an officer is
determined to be a senior captain based on experience, timing and acquired competencies.
   (4) Developmental and broadening assignments Upon completion of key developmental assignments as a captain,
officers can be assigned in other developmental assignments that are consistent with current Army requirements. These
assignments include:
   (a) Combat Training Centers (CTC) observer/controller (O/C).
   (b) USAREC Command or Staff.
   (c) Active Army/Reserve Component duty.
   (d) Signal Battalion/Brigade principal staff.
   (e) USMA Staff.
   (f) ROTC Instructor.
   (g) Service School Instructor.
   (h) Education Opportunity (advanced civilian schooling (ACS), Training with Industry (TWI), JCS Internship, and
so forth).
   (i) Functional area positions.
   (j) Other generalist positions.
   (5) Self-development. Captains should begin working on a graduate level education in an IT related discipline and
obtain industry certifications related to networking, information assurance and other pertinent disciplines as the
opportunity presents itself.
   (6) Desired experience. Captains should continue to gain an in-depth understanding of combined arms operations
and be proficient in both Signal operations and common core competencies. These competencies provide the founda-
tion of knowledge required to serve in the branch with tactical and technical proficiency, in addition to being a leader
of Soldiers. Captains gain a working knowledge of command principles, battalion-level staff operations, combined arms
operations and signal operations at the battalion and above.
   (7) Functional Designation is conducted at the 4th and 7th YOS and open to all officers. See chapter 8 for more
information on this process which is managed by Human resources command. The formal FD is based upon the needs
of the Army, officer skills and experience, and preference. The Chief of Signal is the proponent manager for FA 24

22–5. Signal Corps Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. The Army National Guard (ARNG) and U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) Signal Corps
officers serve the same role and mission as their Active Army counterparts. The unique nature of the Reserve
Component (RC) Soldier’s role as a “citizen Soldier” poses a significant challenge for professional development. To
fulfill its wartime mission of planning, installing, administering, managing, maintaining, operating, integrating and
securing the Army’s strategic, operational and tactical communications infrastructure and voice and data information
systems, services and resources, the Signal Corps is dependent upon extensive interaction between the AA and the RC,
maintaining skills through civilian education, industry organizations and certifications, and on-line collaboration tools.
   (1) Geographic dispersion of unit may constrain RC career progression within a specific MOS or branch. To meet
professional development objectives, RC Signal officers must possess a willingness to rotate between assignments with
troop program units, ARNG organizations, the IRR, and IMA positions. Often there are insufficient numbers of
positions in a geographic area to continue in Signal assignments. If geographic constraints are such that the assignment
to a BR 25 Signal officer position is not possible, officers should seek temporary assignment to branch immaterial
position or pursue assignments in a functional area related to Signal such as FA 53 and FA 24, see appropriate chapters
for more information.
   (2) Both TOE and TDA organizations host RC Signal officer assignments. Their duties and responsibilities are
fundamentally the same as their AA counterparts except for those personnel management, administrative and opera-
tional requirements unique to the ARNG and USAR. All RC Signal assignments are open to male and female officers.
   (3) USAR officers should seek the advice of the Signal Senior Personnel Management Advisor (SPEMA) for more
information on current authorizations, schooling and career development. Army National Guard officers are advised to
contact their respective state Senior Signal Officer (J–6) and personnel management office. Another source of
information is the Reserve Component Affairs Office (RCAO) Deputy Assistance Commandants for USAR and ARNG
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             217

affairs located at Fort Gordon. This office also maintains a web page on Army Knowledge Online (AKO) with current
information and points of contact.
   b. Officer development. For basic guidance on Reserve Component officer development see chapter 7. Unique
Signal officer information is detailed below. All Signal officers are encouraged to actively participate in professional
communication organizations, on-line sustainment training, collaboration with peers, civilian education and to continue
with life-long learning to stay relevant in the communications field.
   (1) Lieutenant. Newly accessed officers must attend the Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC) phase III for technical
training in the Army’s communication field prior to promotion to first lieutenant. A bachelor’s degree is also required.
   (2) Captain. For consideration for promotion to major, a Signal captain must successfully complete all five phases of
the Signal Captain Career Course-Reserve Component (SCCC–RC). Officers must complete SCCC–RC for competitive
career progression (See chapter 7.) Officers are encouraged to pursue a branch related graduate degree or industry
certification programs. Captains should serve a minimum of 24 months in a signal key developmental position.
   (3) Major. The primary professional development objective of a Signal Corps major in the RC is to continue to
strengthen IT skills. During this phase, officers must enroll in Intermediate Level Education (ILE). Officers must
complete ILE Common Core for consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel. Officers are highly encouraged to
complete a branch related graduate degree or related industry certifications during these years. Majors should serve a
minimum of 24 months in a key developmental position.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels can expect assignments to senior staff positions in a variety of both
branch related and branch/functional area generalist positions in units, training centers and headquarters elements.
Officers should seek professional military education at the Senior Service College (SSC) level. Lieutenant colonels are
eligible for selection to the rank of colonel upon completion of the requisite service requirements listed in chapter 7 of
this pamphlet. Officers remain eligible for promotion as long as they continue to serve in an active status and meet
selection criteria. Lieutenant colonels should strive to complete an aggregate of 24 months in a key developmental
position.
   (5) Colonel. The primary objective for officers during this phase is maximum use of the officer’s technical and
tactical capabilities, managerial skills and executive skills in positions of higher responsibility. Colonels should strive
to complete an aggregate of 24 months in a signal operations or operational support position.
   c. Branch transfer. Officers may join the Signal Corps at anytime during their career prior to colonel. For captains
through lieutenant colonel who have completed another Captain Career Course they only need to complete phases 2
and 3 of the SCCC–RC and serve 12–24 months in a key developmental assignment. All others should contact the BR
25 Proponent Manager in the Office Chief of Signal for more information.

computer science, computer systems engineering, systems engineering, engineering, math, physics or a related
discipline.
   g. Special qualifications. All Telecommunications Systems Engineering officers must qualify for and maintain a Top
Secret (TS) clearance with special compartmented information (SCI) access. FA 24 officers should initiate procedures
to obtain the proper level of clearance immediately upon notification of the FA 24 functional designation.
   h. Regimental affiliation. The Signal Regiment is organized under the “whole branch” regimental concept in
accordance with AR 600–82 The U.S. Army Regimental System. All FA 24 officers are strongly encouraged to re-
affiliate with the Signal Regiment upon graduation from the Telecommunication Systems Engineering Course and
award of AOC 24A.
23–3. Officer development
   a. Officer Development Model. The Officer Development model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation at the 4th or 7th year develops both specific and broad functional competencies.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive for training and assignments
that will broaden and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These broadening opportunities are
outside one’s normal branch or functional area career development, and are JIIM in nature.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (6) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   b. Captain development. Interested basic branch officers must apply for FA 24 through the functional designation
(FD) process at the 4th or 7th year of service.
   (1) Education. Selected officers should attend functional area qualification (FAQ) training and serve in an FA 24
utilization assignment as soon as possible after FA 24 designation. FAQ training includes successful completion of the
Information Systems Operations Leveler (ISOL) course (ATRRS Course Number 7E–F70) and the Telecommunication
222                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

Systems Engineering Course (TSEC) (ATRRS Course Number 4C–24A) in sequence. All officers designated FA 24 at
the 4th YOS should attend the Signal Captain Career Course prior to FAQ training.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. FA 24 candidates should normally transfer from their basic branch to begin
FAQ within 12 months of designation. All FA 24 positions are considered key and essential developmental assign-
ments. After FAQ training, captains are normally assigned to the following for 12 to 24 months:
   (a) Network Engineer in Division/Corps CIO/G–6.
   (b) System Engineer in Signal battalion/brigade or higher commands.
   (c) Communications-Electronics staff officer at ACOM/ASCC/DRU/HQDA/ DOD/Joint Activity/Multinational Staff

   (f) Telecommunications Test, Evaluation and Integration Officer Instructor.
   (g) Combat Developer at USMA/TRADOC School.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Transferring from a basic branch into FA 24 is in itself a broaden-
ing experience. FA 24 officers’ training, education and development focuses on telecommunications systems engineer-
ing including repetitive and progressive assignments of increasing responsibility. Due to the technical nature and need
for early development in this functional area, combined with the high number of FA 24 authorizations especially in
TOE units, FA 24 captains normally will not serve in branch immaterial or other assignments outside of the functional
area. Upon completion of the first developmental assignment, captains may be selected for fully funded advanced
civilian schooling (ACS) or Training with Industry (TWI) in an FA 24 related discipline. Graduates of either program
will incur a follow-on utilization assignment in an Army Education Requirements Systems (AERS) coded position.
ACS and TWI programs must be approved by the personnel proponent.
   (4) Self-development. The FA 24 captains should pursue graduate-level education in an IT related discipline and/or
obtain industry certifications related to networking, information assurance, and other pertinent disciplines as the
opportunity presents itself. It is recommended that graduate degrees and certifications be in telecommunications
management, telecommunications systems engineering, or an IT-related field of study.
   (5) Desired experience. FA 24 captains should demonstrate competency in basic network engineering, assessment,
managing, and planning, as well as experience in conducting current network operations and security. Assignments
should enable captains to gain knowledge, skills, and abilities to accurately evaluate technologies and prepare technical
specification documents based on those evaluations. Desired experience at the rank of captain is 12 to 24 months in at
least one FA 24 developmental assignment in order to gain the necessary technical skills and operational background.
   c. Major development.
   (1) Education. All FA 24 majors must successfully complete Intermediate Level Education (ILE) which includes
FAQ training and completion of the Command and General Staff Officers Course (CGSOC) common core. If not
previously qualified at captain, FA 24 majors must complete the FAQ training requirement outlined in paragraph
23–3b1, above. All must attend the 14-week resident ILE common core course not later than their 12th year of
commissioned service. Graduates of the CGSOC common core are Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) I
qualified. FAQ training and ILE Common Core can be completed in any sequence; either way, ILE is essential to FA
24 professional development.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. All FA 24 positions are considered key and essential developmental assign-
ments. Officers should serve 24 to 36 months in an FA 24 major position. Majors will typically be assigned to the
following key developmental positions:
   (a) Operations Officer, TNOSC (Theater Network Operations Security Centers).
   (b) Network Engineer/Systems Engineer/Electrical Engineer in Division or Corps CIO/G–6.

                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            223

to focus on telecommunications systems engineering. Due to the high number of FA 24 authorizations, especially in
TOE units, and the technical nature of this functional area, FA 24 majors normally will not serve in branch immaterial
or other assignments outside of the functional area. Generally, FA 24 majors should seek repetitive assignments in FA
24 striving for a variety of experiences at different levels of operation. Majors may be selected for fully funded ACS or
TWI in a telecommunication systems engineering related discipline. Graduates of either program incur a follow-on
utilization assignment in an AERS coded position. Some highly experienced FA 24 officers may compete for and be
selected to attend the School of Advance Military Studies (SAMS) at the U.S. Army and Combined Arms Center, Fort
Leavenworth, KS. Successful completion of SAMS and a 12 month utilization assignment as Div/Corps CIO/G–6
Network Engineer is equivalent to 24 months key developmental time. FA 24 officers are encouraged to seek
broadening opportunities that enhance the officers understanding of the global network environment associated with
JIIM assignments. Successful completion of JPME II is encouraged.
   (4) Self-development. Majors should pursue continuing education programs to enhance their mastery of telecommu-
nications systems engineering to include JIIM operations. Self-development may include correspondence courses,
civilian education, and institutional training. Officers should devote time to a professional reading program in order to
broaden their tactical and technical knowledge. Due to the rapid changes in technology, majors are encouraged to join
professional organizations and subscribe to journals in order to stay current with industry trends and advancements.
Majors are also encouraged to conduct research and write articles for professional, military publications. FA 24 majors
should continue to pursue graduate-level education in IT-related disciplines and/or obtain industry certifications
related to networking, information assurance, computer network defense, and other pertinent disciplines as the
opportunity presents itself. This includes pursuing the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief Information Security
Officer (CISO) course offered by the National Defense University (NDU), Information Resources Management College
(IRMC). For more information see http://www.ndu.edu/IRMC.
   (5) Desired experience. FA 24 majors should demonstrate competency and advanced skills in network engineering,
assessment, managing, and planning, as well as experience in conducting current network operations and defending/
securing networks. Field grade development should enable FA 24s to further hone knowledge, skills, and abilities in
the accurate evaluation of technologies and the preparation of technical specification documents based on these
evaluations. Successful completion of ILE and 24 to 36 months of experience in key development assignments of
increasing responsibility will prepare majors for service at lieutenant colonel.
   d. Lieutenant colonel development.
   (1) Education. There is no educational requirement. Successful completion of JPME II is desired.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. All FA 24 lieutenant colonel positions are considered key and essential
developmental assignments and officers should serve 24 to 36 months in any FA 24 coded position. Typical key
developmental assignments at lieutenant colonel include:
   (a) Network Engineer/Plans Officer, Corps CIO/G–6.
   (b) Director, TNOSC.
   (c) Deputy Director at Battle Command Battle Lab, Signal Center.

   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Generally, FA 24 lieutenant colonels should continue to seek
repetitive assignments in FA 24 striving for a variety of experiences at different levels of operation and concentrating.
their professional development in telecommunications systems engineering. At lieutenant colonel, selected FA 24
officers may serve broadening assignments in branch immaterial positions or in related cross-branch/functional area
positions within the Network and Space Group. They may also obtain broadening experience through TWI and Army
fellowships. Some FA 24 lieutenant colonels may be selected to participate in an IT related PhD program. All FA 24
officers are encouraged to seek broadening opportunities that enhance the officers understanding of the global network
environment associated with JIIM assignments to include achieving JQO status.
   (4) Self-development. Completion of a master’s degree in an IT discipline and industry related certifications are
desired. Self-development may include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training. Due to the
rapid changes in technology, lieutenant colonels are encouraged to maintain membership in professional organizations
224                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

and subscribe to journals in order to stay current with industry trends and advancements. The FA 24 lieutenant colonels
should complete the CIO or CISO course offered by the NDU, IRMC either in resident or nonresident attendance.
   (5) Desired experience. FA 24 lieutenant colonels should demonstrate a high degree and mastery of the telecommu-
nications systems engineering profession. FA 24 officers in the grade of lieutenant colonel serve as senior leaders and
managers throughout the Army providing technical engineering guidance, applying network integration experience,
emerging technology vision and overall Soldier mentorship mastered over many years in uniform as a network
engineer. It is expected that assignments of increasing responsibility will continue to enhance their leadership skills and
technical competencies in leading, managing and integrating enterprise-wide communications networks and information
services for the Army and JIIM organizations. Twenty four to 36 months of experience in assignments of increasing
responsibility will prepare lieutenant colonels for selection to colonel.
   e. Colonel development.
   (1) Education. FA 24 colonels should successfully complete Senior Service College (SSC) either resident or
nonresident. Successful completion of JPME II is desired.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. All FA 24 colonel positions are considered key and essential assignments and
officers should serve 24 to 36 months in any FA 24 coded position. Typical key developmental assignments at colonel
include:
   (a) Director/Deputy Director/Division Chief at ACOM/ASCC/DRU/HQDA/Joint Activity/Multinational/DOD level.

assignments striving to achieve a variety of engineering experiences in Army, Joint and Multinational organizations.
Selected officers may serve broadening assignments in branch immaterial positions or in related cross-branch/functional
area positions within the Network and Space Group. FA 24 officers are encouraged to seek Joint education and duty
assignments to achieve JQO status.
   (4) Self-development. All FA 24 colonels should continue to pursue continuing graduate level education and
industry certifications. Officers also need to stay current on industry trends through trade associations and journals, and
by participating in DOD and industry sponsored forums focused on evolving IT issues and advances. Some candidates
may pursue completion of a PhD in an IT-related discipline.
   (5) Desired experience. As senior practitioners in FA 24, colonels constitute the elite of the telecommunications
systems engineering officer corps. Their years of accumulated training, education and progressive assignments con-
stutitute a level of expertise that enables them to serve in executive-level leadership positions on ACOM/ASCC/DRU,
HQDA, Joint and DOD staffs. The FA 24 colonels should strive for assignments that balance and round out their field
grade experience with a mix of tactical, operational and strategic assignments. Selected officers may be assigned to
high performance FA 24 colonel positions as determined by the Chief of Staff Army. Successful completion of SSC
plus 24 to 36 months of FA 24 experience will prepare colonels for service at next higher grade. Field grade
assignments should include ARSTAF, Joint, and operational deployment experiences to be competitive for selection to
general officer.

23–4. Telecommunication Systems Engineering RC officers
   a. General career development. The ARNG and U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) Telecommunication Systems En-
gineering officers serve the same role and mission as their AA counterparts. The unique nature of the RC Soldier’s role
as a “citizen Soldier” poses a significant professional development challenge. To fulfill their wartime mission of
planning, engineering and managing the integration of diverse communication, information and visual information
equipment and systems into interoperable enterprise networks, FA 24 officers rely upon extensive interaction between
the AA and the RC, maintaining skills through civilian education, industry organizations and certifications, and online
collaboration tools.
   b. Functional area qualification and development opportunities.
   (1) Geographic dispersion. The geographic dispersion of telecommunication systems engineering positions con-
strains RC career progression in FA 24. Few RC FA 24 officers will be afforded an opportunity to meet minimum
career progression goals of the AA. To meet professional development objectives, RC FA 24 officers should be willing
to rotate between assignments with USAR TPU organizations, ARNG units and IMA positions. Usually there will be
insufficient numbers of positions within a geographic area to continue in telecommunication systems engineering
functional area assignments. If geographic constraints are such that assignment to an FA 24 position is not possible,
officers should seek assignment in their basic branch or in a related functional area required in the geographic region.
   (2) Assignments. Telecommunication Systems Engineering officer assignments in the RC are almost split evenly
between TOE and TDA organizations. Their duties and responsibilities are fundamentally the same as their AA
counterparts except for those personnel management, administrative and operational requirements unique to the ARNG
and USAR. Officers may be assigned to the IRR when unable to accept a TPU or ARNG unit assignment. Officers in
the IRR may request assignment to a Reinforcement Training Unit (RTU), an IMA position, a tour of Active Duty for
Special Work (ADSW), Annual Training (AT), or Active Duty for Training (ADT). Officers in the IRR may meet
226                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

professional military education (PME) requirements by requesting ADT. All RC officers, major and below with less
than 15 years of Active Federal Service (AFS), may request Active Guard and reserve (AGR) assignment.
   (3) Guidance. USAR officers should seek the advice of the Senior Personnel Management Advisor (SPEMA) for
more information on current authorizations, schooling and career development. The ARNG officers are advised to
contact their respective state senior Signal Officer (J–6) and personnel management office. Another source of informa-
tion is the Reserve Component Affairs Office (RCAO) Deputy Assistant Commandants for USAR and ARNG affairs
located at Fort Gordon. This office maintains a Web page on the Army Knowledge Online with current information
and points of contact.
   c. Professional development. There are four phases of professional development for RC Telecommunication Systems
Engineering officers. The phases relate to military rank and include broadly based goals and career objectives at each
rank so that an officer may expand capabilities and optimize performance. Telecommunication Systems Engineering
life-cycle development objectives, RC requirements and an officer’s own strengths, priorities, civilian experience,
private and service provided education, and performance influence their professional development.
   (1) Captain. The FA 24 RC officer candidates have the same prerequisites as the AA. They must have a hard skill
undergraduate degree in mathematics, physics, electrical engineering, telecommunications engineering, telecommunica-
tions management, computer systems engineering, computer science or a related discipline. They must have completed
their basic branch Captain Career Course (CCC) prior to development in FA 24, preferably the Signal CCC. Initial
FAQ requires successful completion of the ISOL, (ATRRS Course Number 7E–F70) followed by the TSEC, ATRRS
Course Number 4C–24A). Attendance at the ISOL may be waived based on prior equivalent education/experience.
Typical TOE positions include communications-electronics engineer, systems engineer, and communications-electron-
ics staff officer. Typical TDA positions include Signal support officer, systems engineer and communications-electron-
ics staff officer. Note: The CCC is required for promotion to major.
   (2) Major. The primary professional development objective of a FA 24 major in the RC is to continue to strengthen
telecommunication systems engineering skills. During this phase, officers must complete ILE common core for
promotion to lieutenant colonel. FA 24 majors are highly encouraged to pursue a specialty related graduate degree and
obtain a professional engineering license. Telecommunication Systems Engineering majors should serve a minimum of
24 months cumulative service in a Telecommunication Systems Engineering operations or operational support major
position.
   (3) Lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels can expect assignments to senior staff positions employing them in a
variety of diverse and challenging functional area related positions. FA 24 officers should seek professional military
education at the Senior Service College level. Telecommunication Systems Engineering RC lieutenant colonels are
eligible for selection to the rank of colonel upon completion of the requisite service requirements listed in chapter 7 of
this pamphlet. Lieutenant colonels remain eligible for promotion as long as they continue to serve in an active status
and meet selection criteria. FA 24 lieutenant colonels should serve a minimum of 48 months cumulative service in a
Telecommunication Systems Engineering support position.
   (4) Colonel. The primary objective for officers during this phase is maximum use of the officer’s technical and
tactical capabilities, managerial skills and executive skills in positions of higher responsibility. RC Telecommunication
Systems Engineering colonels should serve a minimum 72 months cumulative service in an FA 24 operations or
operational support position.
   d. Constructive credit. RC officers (captain and above) who acquire telecommunications systems engineering skills,
knowledge and abilities through civilian industry or through education and training may apply for ISOL/TSEC
constructive credit and award of the FA 24 functional designation. Officers may apply for constructive credit through
the Office Chief of Signal (Proponent Office) at Fort Gordon, GA. Current information and points of contact are
located on the RCAO AKO Web site.

24–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the core characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders in the 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army
Values and the warrior ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the
spectrum of conflict. They must be able to operate in JIIM environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in
achieving their objectives. Our officers must be culturally astute and able to use their awareness and understanding to
conduct operations innovatively and courageously to exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the
operational environment. Further explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of
this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills. FA 53 officers are skilled in the principles of information systems management and
how they support the Signal Regiment’s Mission domain — Army Communications Networks and Information
Services. This requires that they possess a computer and information systems background. FA 53 officers must also
fully comprehend the organization, structure and doctrine of the warfighting Army as well as the joint community. In
addition, they are: able to apply highly technical concepts to more generalized, military unique issues; well versed in
information technology and capable of clearly and accurately communicating these complex technical concepts to non-
technical decision-makers; extremely adept at organizing workload, assigning tasks and mentoring civilian and military
subordinates; able to conduct a thorough technical assessment of strategic/theater-level and below information systems
and services management, which include host nation infrastructure and associated interoperability standards.
   c. Unique technical knowledge. FA 53 Information Systems Management officers knowledge and skills are critical
to the Signal Regiment’s ability to provide communications networks and information services for the Army and DOD.
Inherent with this mission is the technical knowledge and understanding of the Regiment’s five core competencies
which are network management/enterprise systems management (NM/ESM), IA/CND, IDM/CS, electromagnetic spec-
trum operations (EMSO) and visual information (VI) operations. They must also know and understand the DOD
network operations construct to include GEM, GND, and GCM. The FA 53 officers must maintain currency in the
information systems management discipline due to the rapid change of IT and operational concepts and doctrine. FA 53
officers must maintain proficiency in the computer systems and information systems management discipline. They must
understand the capabilities and limitations of full spectrum information systems operations at the tactical, operational,
and strategic levels of war. As the Army’s preeminent information systems experts, they must understand information
management responsibilities, policies, procedures, and regulations as detailed in Federal law, DOD, and Army
regulations.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           229

   d. Areas of concentration (AOC). FA 53 has one AOC. Information Systems Management Officer (AOC 53A)
supervises information systems operations for units, installations, and activities. Advises commanders and staff on
computer information systems policy, technical, and implementation matters. Plans and manages the integration of
hardware, software and data communications at the user interface level. Supervises the installation, operation, mainte-
nance and administration of computer systems and local area networks (LAN) at all organizational levels to include
combined, joint and service agencies. Supervises and manages computer systems and networks engineering organiza-
tions and activities. The AOC 53A officer has primary responsibility for the following information services:
   (1) LAN Connectivity, Administration, and Management.
   (2) Content Staging, Database Management, and information dissemination configuration and management.
   (3) Information Systems Administration and Security.
   (4) Information Network Management and Security.
   (5) IA/CND.
   (6) Leveraging IT to enable Knowledge Management
   e. Detailed features of work. Information Systems Management officers:
   (1) Serve as Information Systems Management staff officer at brigade and higher-level commands.
   (2) Serve as Information Systems Management officer in combat service support and other logistical units at brigade
and higher.
   (3) Provide information services and information systems coordination and integration at all levels of command.
   (4) Solve technical problems through teamwork and joint intellectual efforts.
   (5) Apply technical expertise to leverage military and non-military commercial-off-the- shelf (COTS) equipment and
tools.
   (6) Understand joint and combined arms operations and concepts, which are vital for Information Systems Manage-
ment officers supporting Army, joint and coalition operations.
   f. Prerequisites. Officers should possess an undergraduate or graduate degree in one of the following disciplines to
be accessed into FA 53: information systems management, computer systems management, information assurance,
computer science, computer engineering, computer systems engineering, computer information systems, computer
resource and information management, information technology, information technology management, or a related
discipline.
   g. Regimental affiliation. The Signal Regiment is organized under the “whole branch” regimental concept in
accordance with AR 600–82 The U.S. Army Regimental System. All FA 53 officers who receive functional designa-
tion (FD) from branches other than Signal are strongly encouraged to re-affiliate with the Signal Regiment upon
graduation from the Information Systems Management Course and award of AOC 53A.
24–3. Officer development and assignments
   a. Officer Development Model. The Officer Development Model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation at the 4th or 7th year develops both specific and broad functional competencies.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive for training and assignments
that will broaden and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These broadening opportunities are
outside one’s normal branch or functional area career development, and are JIIM in nature.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (6) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate

                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             233

24–4. Information Systems Management Reserve Component (FA 53)
   a. General career development. The ARNG and U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) Information Systems Management
officers (FA 53) serve the same role and mission as their AA counterparts. The unique nature of the RC Soldier’s role
as a “citizen Soldier” poses a significant professional development challenge. To fulfill their wartime mission of
planning, providing and managing information systems and services at all levels of command in support of full
spectrum operations, FA 53 officers rely upon extensive interaction between the AA and the RC, maintaining skills
through civilian education, industry organizations and certifications, and online collaboration tools.
   b. Functional area qualification and development opportunities.
   (1) Geographic dispersion. The geographic dispersion of information systems management positions constrains RC
career progression in FA 53. The limited number of FA 53 positions in any one geographical area limits opportunity
for officers to meet minimum career progression goals of the AA. To meet professional development objectives, RC
FA 53 officers should be willing to rotate between assignments with USAR TPU organizations, ARNG units and IMA
positions. If geographic constraints are such that assignment to an FA 53 position is not possible, officers should seek
assignment in their basic branch or in a related functional area required in the geographic region.
   (2) Assignments. Information Systems Management officer assignments in the RC exist in both TOE and TDA
organizations. Their duties and responsibilities are fundamentally the same as their AA counterparts except for those
personnel management, administrative and operational requirements unique to the ARNG and USAR. Officers may be
assigned to the IRR when unable to accept a TPU or ARNG unit assignment. Officers in the IRR may request
assignment to a Reinforcement Training Unit (RTU), an IMA position, a tour of Active Duty for Special Work
(ADSW), Annual Training (AT), or Active Duty for Training (ADT). Officers in the IRR may meet professional
military education (PME) requirements by requesting ADT. All RC officers, major and below with less than 15 years
of Active Federal Service (AFS), may request Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) assignment.
   (3) Guidance. USAR officers should seek the advice of the Senior Personnel Management Advisor (SPEMA) for
more information on current authorizations, schooling and career development. The ARNG officers are advised to
contact their respective state senior Signal Officer (J6) and personnel management office. Another source of informa-
tion is the Reserve Component Affairs Office (RCAO) Deputy Assistant Commandants for USAR and ARNG affairs
located at Fort Gordon. This office maintains a web page on the Army Knowledge Online with current information and
points of contact.
   c. Professional development. There are four phases of professional development for RC Information Systems
Management officers. The phases relate to military rank and include broadly based goals and career objectives at each
rank so that an officer may expand capabilities and optimize performance. The Information Systems Management life-
cycle development objectives, RC requirements and an officer’s own strengths, priorities, civilian experience, private
and service provided education, and performance influence their professional development.
   (1) Captain. The FA 53 RC officer candidates have the same perquisites as the AA. They should have an
undergraduate or graduate degree in information systems management, computer systems management, information
assurance, computer science, computer systems engineering, information technology management or a related disci-
pline. They must have completed their basic branch CCC prior to development in FA 53, preferably the Signal CCC.
Initial FAQ requires successful completion of the ISMC (ATRRS Course Number 7E–53A). Typical key developmen-
tal assignments include Information Systems Management Officer in tactical organizations at brigade, division, corps
and higher levels, and in strategic and sustainment organizations. Note: The Captain Career Course is required for
promotion to major.
   (2) Major. The primary professional development objective of a FA 53 major in the RC is to continue to strengthen
information systems management skills, knowledge and abilities. During this phase, officers must complete ILE
common core for promotion to lieutenant colonel. FA 53 majors are highly encouraged to pursue a specialty related
graduate degree and obtain professional certifications from IT industry. Information Systems Management majors
should serve a minimum of 24 to 36 months cumulative service in one or more FA 53 positions.
   (3) Lieutenant colonel. Lieutenant colonels can expect assignments to senior staff positions employing them in a
variety of diverse and challenging functional area related positions. FA 53 officers should seek professional military
education at the SSC level. Information Systems Management RC lieutenant colonels are eligible for selection to the
rank of colonel upon completion of the requisite service requirements listed in chapter 7 of this pamphlet. Lieutenant
colonels remain eligible for promotion as long as they continue to serve in an active status and meet selection criteria.
FA 53 lieutenant colonels should serve a minimum of 48 to 60 months cumulative service in FA 53 positions.
   (4) Colonel. The primary objective for officers during this phase is maximum use of the officer’s technical and
tactical capabilities, managerial skills and executive skills in positions of higher responsibility. RC Information Systems
Management colonels should serve a minimum 72 months cumulative service in an FA 53 positions.
   d. Constructive credit. RC officers (captain and above) who acquire information systems management skills,
knowledge and abilities through civilian industry or through education and training may apply for ISMC constructive

   (6) FA 40C officers perform space flight related duties as directed by NASA: Space Shuttle Mission Specialist;
International Space Station Commander, Flight Engineer, or Science Officer; Ground support of Space Shuttle and ISS
crews - Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM), Crew Support Astronaut, Kennedy Space Center Support Astronaut or
positions with any space vehicles/missions in the future.
25–3. Officer development
   a. Officer Development Model. The Officer Development Model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation at the 4th or 7th year develops both specific and broad functional competencies. Once an
                                              DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           237

officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive for training and assignments that will broaden
and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These broadening opportunities are outside one’s
normal branch or functional area career development, and are Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental and Multinational
in nature. Officers desiring designation into Space Operations are encouraged to seek space-related assignments and
educational opportunities (FA 40 or requiring the skill identifier (SI) 3Y, Space Activities) at the earliest opportunity.
   (4) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both Joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (5) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   b. Functional area 40 development. To be considered fully developed in the functional area, officers will have
completed Space Operations Officer Qualification Course (SOOQC) and served 12 months in a key developmental
(KD) identified position or completed SOOQC and served 24 months in a non-KD position at each rank, beginning at
major. Success will depend not on the number or type of positions held, but rather on the quality of duty performance
in every assignment.
   (1) Space Operations. Officers who successfully perform in a Space Operations functional area assignment will be
afforded other Army, Joint, and civilian space-related educational opportunities based on their performance of duties
and the needs of the Army.
   (2) Qualifying education. Space Operations Officers have certain requirements to ensure they are developed and
well grounded in Army and Joint operations.
   (a) All officers must complete the basic functional qualification training, the SOOQC, which is the FA 40 phase of
Intermediate Level Education (ILE). Officers serving in select areas (that is, NASA) may submit a request for waiver
identifying comparable training and/or experience and by completing space training specified by the FA 40 PDO.
SPACE OPNS OFF QUAL CR will be entered into Section VI, Military Education, of the ORB.
   (b) Completion of SOOQC is highly desired prior to the initial FA 40 assignment, is required for functional area
development and will be completed prior to consideration for ACS or Training with Industry (TWI).
   (c) Completion of the National Security Space Institute Space 300 course is highly recommended for officers prior
to their promotion to colonel.
   (3) Professional development. Officers are encouraged to pursue educational opportunities as part of life-long
learning and to enhance their professional competence and personal development.
   (4) All officers are encouraged to pursue graduate-level degrees in space-related or technical fields to improve
performance and contributions to the area of space-based operations. Specifically:
   (a) To ensure optimized support to warfighting commanders, Space Operations officers must possess an in-depth
understanding of all aspects of space-based capabilities. Warfighting commanders and their staff will rely on the FA 40
to be the expert in all space-related technologies.
   (b) Experienced Space Operations officers may be called on to serve in the research and development field for
future space capabilities during assignments at such places as the NRO, Battle Labs, military related research labs
(NPS or AFIT) or the USASMDC Directorate of Combat Development (DCD). The nature of these assignments
requires advanced academic training (graduate or PhD) to ensure Army Space needs are adequately addressed.
   (c) Space officers will be called on to develop the curriculum, educate and train the next generation of Army Space
Cadre beginning at the Service Academies and continuing through the FA 40 training process.
   (5) Select Space Operations officers, who have completed at least one operational Space assignment, will have the
opportunity to participate in ACS or TWI. Officers who participate in these programs will serve in FA 40 PPO
designated utilizations tours as well as incur appropriate Active Duty Service Obligations (ADSO).
   (6) FA 40 officers may apply for the Army’s School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS). Upon successful
completion, their utilization assignment will be in a designated key developmental (KD) position. Officers interested in
pursuing SAMS should coordinate with the FA 40 Career Manager.
   (7) To stay highly knowledgeable of up-to-date developments in space, all Space Operations officers are encouraged
to attend the periodic space operations training symposiums and complete training updates as announced by the FA 40
PPO.
   c. Joint assignments. Space operations are inherently Joint. As members of the Army and DOD Space Cadre, FA 40
majors and above can expect to serve in JIIM organizations. There are Space Operations functional area billets on the
Joint Duty Assignment List. The JDAL, and its subset the Joint Critical billets, award Joint credit to our officers.
Assignments are usually preceded by JPME I, completed at ILE (CSC). The Joint Critical billets are typically filled by
Joint Qualified Officers (JOQ), those with a previously completed Joint tour, plus JPME II completed at JCWS or in a
SSC.
   d. Officer Generalist (01A) assignments. Space Operations officers may have the opportunity to serve in officer
generalist assignments. These duty positions require a broad understanding of Army leadership, doctrine, policy, force
structure and management and are not identified with or limited to one specific branch or functional area. These billets
include but are not limited to Joint, ROTC, USMA, Army Staff and Inspector General.

   e. FA 40C functional area qualification, development and assignment. After nomination by the U.S. Army Human
Resources Command (AHRC) and upon selection by NASA, Army Astronaut Candidates are assigned to NASA JSC
per the DOD and Army MOU with NASA. Astronaut Candidates complete 12–18 months of technical NASA-specified
training and education. After completion of the Candidate Course of Instruction, they are automatically functionally
designated 40C and are eligible for assignment to Space Shuttle or ISS missions. As astronauts, they will perform
duties as assigned by the Chief, Astronaut Office and NASA JSC. Duties will include flight assignments, training and
collateral technical assignments. Although most astronaut candidates will enter the program at the grade of major or
lieutenant colonel, NASA’s selection process is irrespective of military rank. Levels of responsibility in assignments
generally increase with space flight experience and demonstrated performance.
   f. FA 40 career life-cycle.
   (1) Lieutenant development. Officers below the rank of captain who possess a 3Y ASI and expect to FD FA 40
should contact the AHRC FA 40 Career Manager concerning opportunities to further develop their space experience,
knowledge, training and education. (Contact with AHRC can be made through the FA 40 PPO.)
   (2) CPT development.
   (a) Education: Space 100, Space Fundamentals, Space Enabler Training, CCC.
   (b) KD assignments: Company Command within Basic Branch.
   (c) Developmental and broadening assignments: Any O3 FA 40 or 3Y coded assignment. After first Space opera-
tional assignment, ACS followed by space related utilization tour.
   (d) Self-development: NSSI Distance Learning, NRO Distance Learning, Advanced Civilian Degree in Space/
Technical discipline.
   (e) Desired experience: Degree in Space/Technical discipline, completion of 3Y coded assignment, Basic Branch

ing, NRO Distance Learning, ILE, JPME II.
   (b) KD assignments: Any JDAL FA 40 position (exception: JFCC–IMD position); Company/Detachment Command
within 1st Space Battalion; 1st Space Battalion Executive Officer and S2/3; Fires Brigade Space OPS Officer; HQDA
DCS, G–3/5/7.
   (c) Developmental and broadening assignments: Any O4 FA 40 assignment; ACS/TWI followed by utilizations tour;
O1A assignment; Fellowships; USMA.
   (d) Self-development: Advanced Civilian Degree in Space/Technical discipline, NSSI Distance Learning, NRO
Distance Learning.
   (e) Desired experience: Advanced Civilian Degree in Space/Technical discipline (masters or PhD); completion of
3Y coded assignment; Basic Branch and FA 40 operational assignments; JIIM.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel development.
   (a) Education: Space Operations Officer Qualifications Course (SOOQC), Space 200, TSOC, JPME II, Space 300,
SSC.

   (d) Self-development: Post-graduate degree in space/technical discipline.
   (e) Desired experience: JIIM; leadership roles in Army strategic, operational and tactical level space-related
assignments.
25–4. Warrant officer development
There are currently no warrant officers assigned to functional area 40, Space Operations.
25–5. Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. Reserve Component (RC) Space Operations officers serve in the same role as their
Active Army counterparts. Therefore, the development objectives and qualifications for the RC Space Operations
officer parallel those planned for their AA counterparts. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation through
assignments in their basic branches before specializing in FA 40. They may also establish credentials relevant to Space
                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            239

Operations in their civilian careers and should keep their career managers apprised of specific competencies with
potential application to their future as Army Space Professionals. The quality and quantity of training that RC Space
Operations officers receive prior to mobilization dictates, to a large extent, their wartime effectiveness.
   b. Functional area development opportunities. The RC officers should strive for Space Operations assignments that
yield the same developmental opportunities as their AA counterparts even though they are limited by geographical
considerations. The citizen Soldier’s dual role presents a unique challenge in pursuing such an ambitious development
program. To meet professional development objectives, RC Space Operations officers may be required to rotate among
ARNG and United States Army Reserve (USAR) troop program units, the IRR, the IMA, IRR–Augmentee, the Army
Joint Reserve Element (ARE) or Active Guard Reserve (AGR) programs.
   c. Intent. The intent is to provide as many officers as possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and
staff positions due to the limitations imposed by geographical considerations, which necessitates these transfers.
Additionally, there may be occasions when RC officers will be transferred to the TTHS account while they complete
mandatory educational requirements. Such transfers should not be seen as impacting negatively on the officer’s career.
The success of an RC officer is not measured by the length of service in any one component or control group, but by
the officer’s breadth of experience, duty performance and adherence to the requirements described herein. Every
attempt will be made to assign RC officers to FA 40 or a branch space-related position. Unlike their AA counterparts,
geographic constraints limit the ability of RC officers to stay in FA 40 positions throughout their career. When barriers
such as this deny the opportunity to successfully participate in the USAR, officers are encouraged to seek qualification
and utilization in related functional areas. RC FA 40 qualification standards are as follows:
   (1) Lieutenant development. N/A.
   (2) Captain development.
   (a) Become fully qualified in their basic branch.
   (b) Complete the Captain Career Course.
   (c) NSSI distance learning, NRO distance learning.
   (d) Civilian degree in space/technical discipline.
   (3) Major development.
   (a) Successfully complete ILE Common Core.
   (b) Successfully complete either the resident or reserve version of the Space Operations officer portion of ILE.
   (c) Serve in a FA 40 position for a minimum of 24 months (may include some space-related schooling or training
with on-the-job experience preferred).
   (d) Officers are encouraged to obtain a master’s degree from an accredited college or university in a space-related
discipline to reinforce additional skills required for certain Space Operations assignments.
   (e) NSSI distance learning, NRO distance learning.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel development.
   (a) Serve in a FA 40 position for a minimum of 24 cumulative months (may include some space-related schooling
or training with at least 12 months of job experience) as a field-grade officer.
   (b) Officers are encouraged to obtain a master’s degree from an accredited college or university in a space-related
discipline to reinforce additional skills required for certain Space Operations assignments.
   (5) Colonel. N/A.

Chapter 26
Military Intelligence Branch
26–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. The principal focus of military intelligence (MI) is to provide timely, relevant, accurate, predictive, and
actionable intelligence and electronic warfare (IEW) support to commanders. MI reduces uncertainty and risk to U.S.
and Allied forces and permits effective application of combat power. MI officers lead Soldiers and civilians in
directing, collecting, processing, producing, and disseminating intelligence across the entire operational spectrum. The
intelligence requirements of a predominantly CONUS-based, force projection Army dictate that all echelons focus on
the needs of contingency forces during any crisis, deployment, or actual military operation. The entire Army intelli-
gence effort must focus on support to the warfighter. While this focus blurs the traditional distinction between tactical,
operational and strategic intelligence, we still refer to these levels for training, assignment and other purposes.
   b. Proponent information. The Commanding General, U.S. Army Intelligence Center (Chief of the Military Intelli-
gence Corps) is the proponent for Branch 35. The Office of the Chief, Military Intelligence is the personnel proponent
office for Branch 35 (ocmi@conus.army.mil).
   c. Functions. All MI officers must know, understand, and be able to function in all intelligence disciplines; human
intelligence (HUMINT), imagery intelligence (IMINT), measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT), signals
intelligence (SIGINT), and open source intelligence (OSINT). Additionally MI officers must understand the counterin-
telligence (CI) function and how it provides multidiscipline support to force protection through operations security,
deception, and rear area operations. It is crucial for the MI officer to be able to communicate with and integrate
products from each of the disciplines into their own intelligence products, so a more accurate picture of ground truth
can be painted for commanders and decision makers. Officers within the MI Branch are assigned throughout the force
from maneuver battalion level to Joint, unified and specified commands. MI officers perform numerous tasks ranging
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             241

from intelligence preparation of the battlefield in a tactical battlefield situation to strategic intelligence collection
management and analysis. The processes involved are refined through continuous improvement, often in a high volume
production environment. Intelligence work requires the ability to interpret patterns associated with complex situations,
as well as the ability to synthesize and interpret such activities. Intelligence production requires the transformation of
data into applicable and usable information. Analytical proficiency at the tactical level requires an understanding of the
tactical concepts of both friendly and threat operations.
26–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for 21st century. These leaders must be: competent in their core
proficiencies, broad enough to operate across the spectrum of conflict, able to operate in JIIM environments and
leverage other capabilities in achieving their objective, culturally astute and able to use this awareness and understand-
ing to conduct operations innovatively, courageous enough to see and exploit opportunities in the challenges and
complexities of the objective environment, and grounded in Army Values and warrior ethos. Further explanation of
these characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0 and chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of a Military Intelligence officer. The following are a core set of skills, common to
all MI officers and taught at varying levels throughout the MI education system. These skill sets have applicability to
all MI officers, regardless of AOC—
   (1) ISR synchronization. An action that integrates the planning and operation of sensors, assets, processing, exploita-
tion, and dissemination systems in direct support of current and future operations.
   (2) Collection. The acquisition of information and the dissemination of this information to processing elements.
   (3) Analysis/assessment. The conversion of processed information into intelligence through the integration, evalua-
tion, and interpretation of all source data and the preparation of intelligence products in support of known or
anticipated user requirements. Must understand military doctrine, capabilities, and order of battle of foreign states or
non-state entities
   (4) Presentation. The method used to present intelligence data to the commander for decision making purposes.
   (5) Cultural awareness. Developing sensitivity and understanding of another ethnic group or peoples.
   c. Special qualification required of MI officers. Military Intelligence officers must qualify for a Top Secret (TS)
security clearance based on a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) and for access to Sensitive Compart-
mented Information (SCI). Officers must also possess the ability to maintain the TS/SCI access throughout their
careers.
26–3. Officer development
   a. Officer Development Model. The Officer Development model is focused on the quality and range of experience,
rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress in rank.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental and
Multinational (JIIM) experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation at the 4th and 7th year develops both specific and broad functional competencies.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive for training and assignments
that will broaden and develop skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These broadening opportunities are
outside one’s normal branch or functional area career development and are joint, interagency intergovernmental and
multinational in nature.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   b. MI officer development-areas of concentration. All MI officers begin their career as 35D (All-source intelligence
officer) and may acquire additional AOC training upon completion of the MI Captain Career Course (MI CCC). This
provides the Army with a corps of intelligence generalists possessing a common skill set that can succeed at most
echelons. All AOCs accomplish their mission through six primary tasks which generate intelligence synchronized to
support the commander’s mission and intelligence requirements. These six tasks: indications and warnings, intelligence
preparation of the battle space, situation development, target development, force protection, and battle damage assess-
ment can be thought of as the mission-essential task list for intelligence.
   (1) All-Source Intelligence Officer (35D). All MI officers receive initial and advanced training as a 35D. Duties
include directing, supervising, and coordinating the planning, collection, processing, production, and dissemination of
all-source intelligence (HUMINT, IMINT, MASINT, SIGINT, OSINT, and CI) at all echelons (to include JIIM). They
perform multidiscipline collection management, coordination of surveillance and reconnaissance activities, and provide
advice on the use of intelligence resources at all echelons. They supervise and perform IPB using automated
242                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

intelligence data processing systems and advise the commander and subordinate units on the enemy, weather, and
terrain.
   (2) IMINT Officer (35C). Duties include planning, directing, managing, coordinating, and participating in the
collection, production, analysis, exploitation, and dissemination of optical, infrared, and radar IMINT from national,
operational, and tactical sensors to support reconnaissance and surveillance operations at all echelons (to include JIIM).
The 35C AOC will be deleted effective FY12. Selected officers will be able to attend imagery intelligence training, but
instead of an AOC will be awarded a skill identifier (SI).
   (3) CI Officer (35E). Duties include planning, directing, managing, coordinating, and participating in the collection,
production, and dissemination of CI information and conducting CI investigations and operations at all levels. Provide
CI input and assistance to force protection planning and execution by limiting the effectiveness of foreign multidis-
cipline collection directed against Army operations, activities, technology, and personnel at all echelons (to include
JIIM).
   (4) HUMINT Officer (35F). Duties include directing, coordinating, and participating in controlled collection opera-
tions to obtain intelligence information in support of Army and DOD requirements. Senior captains may apply and
must have 35D experience prior to selection.
   (5) SIGINT/Electronic Warfare Officer (35G). Duties include planning, directing, managing, coordinating, and
participating in the collection, production, and dissemination of SIGINT and conducting electronic warfare at tactical,
operational, and strategic levels (to include JIIM).
   (6) All-Source Intelligence Aviator (15/35). These officers serve in both Aviation and MI officer positions. As
aviators, they command platoons, companies, and battalions employing Special Electronic Mission Aircraft (SEMA) in
support of tactical, operational, and strategic intelligence missions. They perform duties as the aviation battalion and
brigade S2. They may also perform in any 35D position. As staff officers in MI aviation units, they plan for, direct,
and control SEMA units to accomplish assigned intelligence and electronic warfare missions. These officers also direct
and control the training, safety, administration, communication, supply, maintenance, transportation, and force protec-
tion activities of SEMA units. As MI officers, they are responsible for IEW planning and operations at all levels.
   c. Lieutenant development.
   (1) Education. Successful completion of the MI Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC), Phase III (proponent
institutional training conducted at the U.S. Army Intelligence Center at Fort Huachuca).
   (2) Assignment. After completing the MI BOLC Phase III, MI lieutenants will most likely be assigned to serve with
troops in leadership developmental positions such as platoon leader, executive officer (XO), or in other assignments
such as assistant S2/combat support battalion S2, assistant brigade S2 or staff officer in an MI battalion. MI lieutenants
most commonly serve as an intelligence officer at echelons corps and below.
   (3) Self-development. Lieutenants should take every opportunity to broaden their knowledge of all aspects of
military intelligence through courses, professional readings, and personal research into intelligence related topics.
   (4) Desired experience. Lieutenants should strive to acquire, reinforce, and hone troop leading, technical, tactical,
logistical, and administrative skills. Inculcation of the warrior ethos and Army core values is essential in the
development of young MI lieutenants. Prior to promotion for captain, the officer must possess an in-depth knowledge
of combined arms and intelligence operations gained through on the job training.
   d. Captain development.
   (1) Education. Successful completion of the MI Captain Career Course (MI CCC). Some MI officers will be given
the opportunity to train and acquire an additional MI area of concentration (see above paragraph 26–3b(2).
   (2) KD assignments. The following are considered KD assignments for MI captains:
   (a) Battalion S2
   (b) Company or Detachment Commander

   (g) MI Advisor-Combat (foreign nation TT)
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Any MI coded position at any echelon.
   (4) Self-development. MI captains should take every opportunity to broaden their knowledge of all aspects of
military intelligence through courses, professional readings and personal research into intelligence related topics.
   (5) Desired experience. Branch specific assignments will provide captains with exposure to the Army and in some
cases, to JIIM organizations. MI officers should attempt to gain maximum experience by serving in multiple MI
assignments as a MI captain.
   e. Major development.
   (1) Education. Successful completion of MEL–ILE level producing course.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. The following are considered KD assignments for MI majors:
   (a) S2 of BDE/BCT/Regiment/SF group

   (g) MI Advisor-Combat (foreign nation TT)
   (h) USAIC Course Manager/Instructor
   (i) Army or Joint Staff (35 coded positions)
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. MI majors should strive to have a broad base of intelligence
experience at various echelons. This will prepare them for the next higher grade where a good balance of positions is at
EAC.
   (4) Self-development. Majors should actively pursue self-development opportunities to fully master all aspects of
operations including JIIM operations. Self-development includes correspondence courses, civilian education, and
institutional training.
   (5) Desired experience. MI majors should strive to gain JIIM experience.
   f. Lieutenant colonel development.
   (1) Education. MI lieutenant colonels are encouraged to complete JPME II.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. The following are considered KD assignments for MI lieutenant colonels:

   (h) Army or Joint Staff (MI 35 coded positions)
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Officers selected for lieutenant colonel and CSL positions must
seek assignments within the branch and with JIIM positions that directly contribute to, and develop, the Army
intelligence profession.
   (4) Self-development. MI lieutenant colonels must continue to actively pursue self-development opportunities to
fully master all aspects of operations including continued performance at multiple echelons and JIIM operations.
   (5) Desired experience. Ideally, MI lieutenant colonels will serve at multiple echelons and types of positions
throughout their tenure. MI lieutenant colonels should seek the opportunity for Joint qualification, as well as intelli-
gence broadening assignments and intelligence focused civilian and institutional training, as well as professional
development through progressive assignments.
   g. Colonel development.
   (1) Education. Selection and successful completion of senior service college and JPME II.
   (2) KD assignments. Colonels contribute to the branch by serving in critical assignments to include the following:
   (a) Corps DCS, G–2
   (b) CSL Brigade-Level Commander
   (c) ASCC or ACOM DCS, G–2
   (d) J2 (JSOC, JTFs, and so forth.)
   (e) TRADOC Capabilities Manager

26–4. Military Intelligence officer special skill producing programs
MI officers may apply for a number of skill producing programs that award a skill identifier (SI). MI officers who
participate in one of these programs are not eligible for functional area designation. As a rule, selected MI officers may
participate in only one of the following programs:
   a. National Systems Development Program (NSDP) (SI 3F). The NSDP is a 1-year intensive academic program
comprised of various courses offered throughout the intelligence community. This program is designed to develop a
cadre of space smart collection managers who understand and have the ability to harness national intelligence systems
and capabilities and incorporate national level support into tactical intelligence collection plans. Graduates serve an
initial 12–24 month utilization tour applying their newly acquired skills as a division or corps intelligence collection
manager in an Army priority unit upon completion. Selectees PCS to Fort Meade, MD, and are positioned to serve as
future ACE Chiefs, battalion S3/XOs and deputy DCS, G–2s.
   b. Junior Officer Cryptologic Career Program (JOCCP) (SI 3W). The JOCCP is a 3-year program conducted at the
National Security Agency at Fort Meade, MD. Graduates serve six-month operational tours in up to six National
Security Agency work centers and 1,000 hours of formal instruction at the National Cryptologic School The 3-year

26–5. Warrant officer development
   a. Unique knowledge and skills of an MI warrant officer. All Army warrant officers (WO) must maintain the level
of officer characteristics as identified in paragraph 26–2, above.
   (1) Military Intelligence Branch warrant officers are skilled technicians and are skilled in officership at all levels;
who possess strong warrior ethos, leader attributes and leader skills; and who fully understand the key leadership
actions that will assure success. Additionally, there are branch unique skills, knowledge, and attributes that require
professional development
   (2) MI warrant officers must possess expert knowledge of intelligence, combined arms and combat support and
coordination principles. This knowledge includes practical experience in tactics, combined arms operations and the
employment of intelligence systems and processes.
   (3) MI warrant officers gain this knowledge through a logical sequence of continuous education, training, and
experience, sustained by mentoring.
   (4) MI warrant officers sustain knowledge through institutional training and education, duty in operational assign-
ments and continuous self-development. Warrant officer may deploy with their units or as individuals to support joint
and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping missions.
   (5) Junior WOs (WO1/CW2s) can be assigned to fill senior WO (CW3/CW4) positions but this should only occur if
the junior warrant officer has attended the essential WO PME training course identified for the senior WO billet. For
example, a WO1 should not fill a CW4 billet since the WO1’s training is limited to Warrant Officer Basic, not Staff or
Senior Staff WO training.
   b. Military Intelligence warrant officer military occupational specialties (MOSs). MI warrant officers are experts
who provide technical and tactical expertise and experience as well as invaluable leadership throughout the MI
community at all levels of command. The following are MOSs for MI warrant officers.
   (1) All Source Intelligence Technicians (350F). Duties include planning, supervising, and conducting the analysis,
fusion, production, dissemination and evaluation of All-Source intelligence. All-Source intelligence technicians lever-
age information from all intelligence disciplines and leverage automation to conduct trend, pattern and comparative

ing and performing IEW maintenance operations at all echelons. Their key function is to ensure that intelligence
equipment and systems are operational.
   c. Warrant officer development.
   (1) Warrant Officer Development Model. The Warrant Officer Development model is focused more on the quality
and range of experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (a) Entry level. Warrant officers are accessed according to the needs of the Army, previous MOS, education and
experience. All AA and USAR warrant officer candidates must attend the resident WOCS at Fort Rucker, AL. The
ARNG warrant officer candidates can attend various states’ two-phased WOCS at RTIs in lieu of WOCS at Fort
Rucker. The focus of the course is common material that provides the officership skills, knowledge and behaviors
required of all warrant officers, regardless of specialty. WOCS graduates are appointed to warrant officer one, grade
W1. The appointment is contingent upon certification by the MOS proponent that the warrant officer is technically and
tactically qualified to serve in the authorized warrant officer position.
   (b) W1/CW2. Throughout a warrant officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain operational assignment
experience. WOs should continue their self-development, professional reading and pursuit of military and civilian
education goals.
   (c) CW3/CW4. At this point in a warrant officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain a broader
understanding of both their MOS and of their AOC. Nominative assignments should be sought. WOs should continue
their self-development, professional reading and pursuit of the next military and civilian education goals.
   (d) CW5. Capstone achievement for all AOC/MOS. Once an officer has received his or her functional AOC
capstone designation it is then that they should strive to get training and assignments that will give them the additional
skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. This training and assignments are outside one’s branch and are
nominative and joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational in nature. Lifelong learning, supported by both
civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop both joint and expeditionary competencies.
Flexible time lines enable warrant officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring warrant officers have
adequate time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   (2) MI WO1 development.
   (a) Education. Upon graduation from WOCS and appointment to grade W1, each officer will attend both BOLC II
(Nov 09 or later) and the Warrant Officer Basic Course. The WOBC consists of MI common core followed by MOS
certification.
   1. Common Core for MI WOs consists of common Intelligence and officership training objectives for all MI WOs.
The training identifies critical skills for the new WO to be effective in the Military Intelligence Corps and in the
Operational Army.
   2. MOS certification consists of unique training requirements identified for specific MI WO MOS. The length of
this phase depends on the individual MOS requirements. The second phase is identified as a certification of required
skills for MI WO training at the basic level. In some cases the WO may have been assessed from a non-feeder enlisted
MOS or have reclassified from one WO MOS to another and will require attendance at the Enlisted 10 Skill level
course prior to entering the MI WOBC second phase.
   (b) Developmental and broadening assignments. Military intelligence warrant officers at WO1 can serve as intelli-
gence production section chiefs, ISR synchronization managers, platoon leaders, analysts, or CI technicians, at the BCT
or DIV level or within a Theater Intelligence Brigade in CONUS or OCONUS. Some SIGINT technicians will be
assigned at Regional SIGINT Operations Centers. There are occasional opportunities for assignment at the National and
Joint levels in the Department of Defense. These are nominative assignments and are for the demonstrated exceptional
performer in specialties required.
   (c) Self-development. The WO1 should actively pursue self-development opportunities to fully master all aspects of
operations. Self-development includes distributive learning courses, civilian education, and institutional training.
   (d) Desired experience. The WO1 should continue to reinforce and hone technical, tactical, and officership skills.
Inculcation of the warrior ethos and Army core values is essential in the development of young MI warrant officers.
Prior to promotion to CW2, warrant officers must possess an in-depth knowledge of combined arms and intelligence
operations gained through on the job training.
   (3) CW2 development.
   (a) Education. Officers with at least one year time in grade as a CW2 are eligible to attend the MI Warrant Officer

Chapter 27
Strategic Intelligence Functional Area (FA 34)
27–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. The Strategic Intelligence functional area (FA 34) provides a focused, trained corps of strategic
intelligence professionals to Army organizations, combatant commands, DOD, the Joint Staff, and interagency commu-
nities with tailored intelligence required for the development of national security policy and theater strategic plans and
operations. The Strategic Intelligence officer acts as the premier expert on strategic and global intelligence activities
that accomplish U.S. strategic objectives developed through unique training, education, and recurring assignments at
theater, national, DOD, joint and interagency communities. The Strategic Intelligence officer translates national security
strategy into intelligence strategies. Providing premier intelligence in a strategic context, the Strategic Intelligence
officer enables decisionmakers and warfighters to dominate the battle space. The Strategic Intelligence officer repre-
sents Army interests at the Joint and interagency communities.
   b. Proponent information. The Commanding General, U.S. Army Intelligence Center (Chief of the Military Intelli-
gence Corps) is the proponent for FA 34. The Office of the Chief, Military Intelligence is the personnel proponent
office for FA 34 (ocmi@conus.army.mil).
   c. Functions. Strategic Intelligence officers work primarily at echelons above corps worldwide. FA 34 positions
exist in intelligence units, headquarters, national agencies and unified commands. FA 34 officers will participate in all
phases of the intelligence cycle. The Strategic Intelligence officer is an agile, national and theater level, interagency
expert, who leads, plans and directs all-source analysis, intelligence systems, and intelligence policy and programs,
252                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

supporting key decisionmakers, policymakers and warfighters in an interagency, Joint, coalition, and combined envi-
ronment. Exercising broad responsibility and authority, the Strategic Intelligence officer is capable of integrating
interagency activities and interacting with the foreign intelligence services to produce predictive strategic intelligence
to advise policymakers and combatant commanders to deliver overwhelming advantage to our warfighters, defense
planners, and national security policymakers.
27–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for 21st century. These leaders must be: competent in their core
proficiencies, broad enough to operate across the spectrum of conflict, able to operate in JIIM environments and
leverage other capabilities in achieving their objective, culturally astute and able to use this awareness and understand-
ing to conduct operations innovatively, courageous enough to see and exploit opportunities in the challenges and
complexities of the objective environment, and grounded in Army Values and warrior ethos. Further explanation of
these characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0 and chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of an FA 34 officer. Work within FA 34 requires the continuous monitoring and
assessment of the geopolitical/military situation and provides strategic warning of developments that adversely affect
and/or identify strategic opportunities to advance U.S. interests. The Strategic Intelligence officer translates raw data
into finished intelligence creating knowledge and context for use in plans, operations, and executive decision-making.
This officer is required to solve long term complex strategic intelligence problems in Army, DOD, Interagency, and
Multi-national environments. The work requires the ability to interpret patterns in complex situations as well as the
ability to synthesize and analyze both concrete and abstract activities and intentions. The Strategic Intelligence officer
must be adaptive and have the ability to provide both long term in-depth and short term crisis response assessments to
decision makers.
   c. Special qualifications required of FA 34 officers.
   (1) Possess the demonstrated aptitude to obtain an advanced degree; therefore they must have a minimum GPA of 3.
0 or a GRE of 500/500/4.0. (This is a requirement for acceptance into the Master of Science in Strategic Intelligence
program at the National Defense Intelligence College).
   (2) Officers selected for FA 34 training who do not satisfactorily complete, receive constructive credit for, or receive
a waiver for Strategic Intelligence Officer Course (SIOC) and/or MSSI may be returned to their basic branch or
redesignated into another functional area.
   (3) A background in geography, political science, international relations, government or social studies is an added
benefit for FA 34 candidates.
   (4) Qualify for a top-secret security clearance based on a single scope background investigation (SSBI) and for
access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI). Officers must also possess the ability to maintain the TS–SCI
throughout their careers.
   (5) Possess highly specialized knowledge pertaining to one or all phases of the intelligence cycle; intelligence law
and management; Joint and Army intelligence and communications architectures; Army, Joint and national intelligence
systems and/or programs; information security principles; national agency functions; and aspects of intelligence
planning which have been gained through attendance at specialized academic training or over a significant period of
time.
   (6) Understand the organization, structure, and doctrine of the warfighting Army.
   (7) Understand the organization, structure, and doctrine of the Joint force. Know how to integrate Army and Joint
intelligence and systems.
   (8) Understand domestic political context in which the Army seeks to fulfill its Title 10 responsibilities and the
DOD seeks to provide for national security.
   (9) Understand issues related to the international geopolitical arena and their implications for developing the
national security policy and the national military strategy.
   (10) Understand the organization of the Army, its Title 10 responsibilities and the missions, roles and functions of
its ACOMs, ASCCs, and DRUs.
   (11) Understand the organization of the DOD and the national intelligence community; the defense intelligence
programs; developing the national military strategy; and the missions, roles, and functions of its warfighting commands
and various agencies.
27–3. Officer development
   a. Officer Development Model. The Officer Development Model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation it is then that they should strive to get training and
assignments that will give them the additional skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These training
opportunities and assignments are outside one’s normal career path and are joint, interagency, intergovernmental and
multinational in nature.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                               253

   (2) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (3) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   (4) FA 34 officers are not considered for FA 34 assignment until they have completed the required FA 34 training.
Upon selection for FA 34, officers will be scheduled for training at the earliest possible time. Officers selected for FA
34 will receive the necessary training and will be either majors or promotable captains when they arrive at their first
FA 34 assignment. Additional specialized training may be needed for specific assignments.
   (5) All FA 34 positions are considered essential to professional development. In addition to the required training, a
good mix of Strategic Intelligence positions at different echelons and manner of performance will demonstrate the
officer’s ability to perform at the next rank. All FA 34 officers should pursue Joint qualification (SI 3A) as a
professional development goal.
   b. Major development.
   (1) Education.
   (a) Successful completion of the FA 34 Strategic Intelligence Officer Course (SIOC) conducted at the U.S. Army
Intelligence Center, Fort Huachuca, AZ (required for non-MI Branch officers only).
   (b) Successful completion of the Master of Science in Strategic Intelligence (MSSI), conducted by the National
Defense Intelligence College (NDIC), Bolling Air Force Base (AFB), Washington, DC.
   (c) Successful completion of the ILE common core (ISC and JPME 1 qualification).
   (d) Successful completion of JPME II is desirable.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. The following are considered key developmental assignments for majors.
   (a) Team/Branch Chief or Deputy
   (b) Desk Officer/Senior Analyst
   (c) Plans/Operations/Warning Officer
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Developmental assignments for FA 34 majors are essentially any
FA 34 coded position. Broadening assignments are defined as any non-FA 34 coded positions in which the officer
conducts strategic intelligence collection and/or analysis, and assignments that require the application of strategic
intelligence skills, expertise and knowledge. FA 34 officers should strive to get joint experience.
   (4) Self-development. Majors should actively pursue self-development opportunities to fully master all aspects of
operations including JIIM operations. Self-development includes correspondence courses, civilian education, and
institutional training.
   (5) Desired experience. At the rank of major, it is expected that assignments will give a Strategic Intelligence
Officer experience in leading and managing a team or a branch in strategic intelligence analysis, planning and
production at all levels. Assignments will additionally enable majors to enhance competencies in collaboration and
conduct of analytical intelligence exchange/liaison with interagency and foreign intelligence services. Moreover, majors
will gain knowledge, skills and abilities in the management of, participation in and advice to intelligence support
activities within DOD and interagency campaign planning.
   c. Lieutenant colonel development.
   (1) Education. Successful completion of JPME II is desirable.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. The following are considered key developmental assignments for lieutenant
colonels: Branch Chief/Deputy Division Chief; Deputy Director of Intelligence; and Plans/Operations Officer
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Developmental assignments for FA 34 lieutenant colonels are
essentially any FA 34 coded position. FA 34 officers should strive to get joint experience. Broadening assignments are
defined as any non-FA 34 coded positions in which the officer conducts strategic intelligence collection and/or
analysis, and assignments that require the application of strategic intelligence skills, expertise and knowledge.
   (4) Self-development. The FA 34 lieutenant colonels must continue to actively pursue self-development opportuni-
ties to fully master all aspects of operations including continued performance at multiple echelons and JIIM operations.
   (5) Desired experience. At the rank of lieutenant colonel, it is expected that assignments will continue to enhance
the Strategic Intelligence officer’s competencies in leading, managing and integrating strategic intelligence analysis,
planning and production in support of combatant commanders. Assignments will additionally enable lieutenant colonels
to strengthen competencies as the DOD/Army representative in the national level interagency Intelligence Community
(IC) advising senior DOD leaders on interagency intelligence issues. Lieutenant colonels will continue to integrate
strategic intelligence issues by region, function, discipline and process into operations at all levels. Moreover, lieuten-
ant colonels will gain knowledge, skills and abilities in the management and leading of strategic intelligence planning
efforts at all levels.
   d. Colonel development.
   (1) Education. Completion of resident or nonresident SSC and JPME II.
   (2) KD assignments. The following are considered key developmental assignments for FA 34 colonels

   (b) Senior Intelligence Officer/Deputy Senior Intelligence Officer
   (c) Director/Deputy Director of a JIOC, JIC, JAC at COCOM or intelligence agency level
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments for colonels are defined as any non-FA 34 coded positions in which
the officer conducts strategic intelligence collection and/or analysis, and assignments that require the application of
strategic intelligence skills, expertise, and knowledge.
   (4) Desired experience. At the rank of colonel, it is expected that assignments will enhance the Strategic Intelligence
officer’s competencies in directing and leading strategic intelligence analysis, planning and production at the national
level. Additionally, colonels will direct and coordinate DOD/Army participation in the national level interagency IC,
ensuring strategic intelligence support to DOD/Interagency campaign plans reflects national strategy.
   e. Joint assignments. The vast majority of FA 34 positions are Joint. Many of these Joint positions are on the JDAL.
Officers assigned to JDAL positions may attend the JPME II course and could qualify for Joint Specialty Officer (JSO)
designation (SI 3L).

Chapter 28
Foreign Area Officer Functional Area (FA 48)
28–1. Introduction
  a. Purpose. Foreign Area Officers (FAOs) are commissioned officers deliberately accessed, trained, educated and
developed to meet worldwide Army requirements for officers possessing a unique combination of strategic focus,
regional expertise, foreign language proficiency, and professional military skills and experience. Army Foreign Area
Officers are Soldiers who are regionally focused experts in political-military operations with advanced language skills,
cultural understanding and the ability to advise senior military and civilian strategic decision-makers in an era of
persistent conflict.
  b. Proponent information. Functional area 48 is managed within the Operations Support functional category. The
DCS, G–3/5/7, Strategic Plans and Policy serves as the proponent for FA 48. The Strategic Leadership Division within
DCS, G–3/5/7, DAMO–SSF, executes FAO policy and is located in the Taylor Building, 5th Floor, Crystal City (703)
602–8183. The FAO proponent Web site is: http://www.fao.army.mil.
  c. Functions. The FAOs are often the sole Army and/or Department of Defense representatives in foreign countries,
256                                       DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

executing national security policies and objectives or serving as key advisors to senior level commanders and Chiefs of
Mission. They:
   (1) Advise senior military and civilian leaders as political-military officers.
   (2) Engage foreign military leaders, personnel and government officials to help build partnership capacity and
facilitate foreign military training and exercises.
   (3) Train future leaders as instructors at U.S. service academies and schools as well as international military schools.
28–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to operate in Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmen-
tal, Multinational (JIIM) environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving their objectives. Further
explanation of these characteristics is referenced in chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of an FA 48 officer. The FAO FA requires officers who are multiskilled leaders.
They are expected to remain well-grounded in Army skills while operating for extended periods of time outside of
Army organizations. In addition to the attributes mentioned above, FA 48 officers possess unique skills and knowledge
focused on functional competencies that include language, culture, regional political-military expertise and interagency
integration.
   (1) The FAOs possess the following unique skills:
   (a) Minimum language proficiency at an Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) level 2 listening/ 2 Reading with
goal of attaining a level 3 in Listening, Reading, and Speaking, per DOD Directive 1315.17 and DOD Instruction 1315.
20.
   (b) Regional Expertise at a level 3 (professional), 4 (advanced professional), or 5 (expert), per Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs Instruction 3126.01.
   (c) Ability to operate as advisors to senior military and civilian leaders in executing foreign policy and engaging
foreign militaries in security assistance objectives.
   (2) The FAOs possess the following unique knowledge:
   (a) In-depth understanding of foreign cultures gained from a regionally focused graduate degree and experience
living and working in a specified region.
   (b) Expert knowledge of regional military forces.
   (c) Well-versed in U.S. foreign policy and regional security cooperation initiatives.
   (d) Political-military, economic, and social issues relevant to their regional Areas of Concentration (AOC).
   (e) Sound understanding of interagency and nongovernment organization (NGO) capabilities and unique professional
cultures.
   c. Unique features of work in the foreign area officer functional area.
   (1) The FAOs serve worldwide in critical and sensitive positions requiring extensive regional expertise and experi-
ence. They are military attachés and Security Assistance Officers in U.S. Embassies and host nation Ministries of
Defense, political-military advisers to deployed military commanders, and liaison officers to foreign militaries.
   (2) The FAOs are trained as regional experts in one of the following nine AOCs. In some cases, officers trained in
one AOC may be assigned to work in another, based on their language, experience, and/or the needs of the Army. The
FAOs who require additional training to support SDO/DATT or Defense Cooperation portfolios may attend the Joint
Military Attaché School at Bolling AFB or the Defense Institute of Security Assistance Management (DISAM) course
at Wright Patterson AFB.

28–3. Functional area 48 officer development
   a. Functional area qualification and development. The life-cycle of the FA 48 functional area is based on the three
domains of leader development — institutional training, operational assignments, and self-development. These three
leader development concepts focus and shape FAO management in terms of accessions, training, utilization and
professional development. The FAO careers begin with a comprehensive, five-phased education and training period
that includes the FAO Orientation Course (FAOOC), basic language training, in-country training (ICT), ACS, and
intermediate level education (ILE). These phases may occur in any order, although the FAO proponent prefers that
language training be completed before ICT and ACS. Once trained, the officer gains experience through a variety of
FAO assignments, both in region and in CONUS.
   b. Lieutenant and captain development prior to functional designation. Experience gained by lieutenants and
captains during basic branch assignments serve as the foundation for future effectiveness for FA 48 officers. All
officers will attend a branch CCC and are strongly encouraged to seek a key developmental experience prior to
functional designation (FD) at the 7th year of commissioned service. The FAO functional area seeks officers with
demonstrated language skills, graduate study experience, and regional/international professional experience as a civil-
ian, student, or Soldier. Officers who have received master’s degrees in a regional or international discipline and have
shown, through a Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) or Defense Language Aptitude Test (DLAT), an ability
to learn a foreign language will be given special emphasis during the functional area designation process.
   c. Education and training requirements. All FAOs must complete the following unless granted a waiver or
constructive credit by the FAO Proponent Office. Officers selected for FAO training who do not satisfactorily complete
or receive constructive credit for the FAOOC, language training, ICT and/or ACS may be returned to their basic branch
or re-designated into another functional area.
   (1) Foreign Area Officer Orientation Course (FAOOC). The FAOOC is a mandatory, one-week course designed to
provide new FAOs an introduction to the FAO FA. Topics include FAO roles and responsibilities, FAO developmental
phases, Family issues, the JIIM environment, the FAO life-cycle, personal security, and an orientation to each regional
AOC. This course also affords an opportunity for FAOs to develop their personal training plan, establish working
relationships with their proponent managers and assignment officers, and understand the varied roles played by FAOs
around the world. The FAOOC is conducted semiannually at the DLIFLC and annually for officers conducting
language studies in the Washington, DC area. Because FAOs often serve in remote locations and Families are placed in
difficult cultural situations, spouses are also encouraged to attend the FAOOC to better understand the lifestyle/career
choice into which the FAO is entering.
   (2) Language training. The FAOs are provided with basic language training in at least one of the predominant
languages in their assigned AOC. The language assigned in training and subsequent ICT site will be designated by the
FAO proponent based on the accessed FAOs abilities and the needs and priorities of the Army. Language training will
be conducted at the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center (DLIFLC) or the Defense Language Institute
Washington (DLI–W). The duration of these courses range between 6 and 18 months, depending upon the level of
difficulty of the targeted language. The FAO must achieve minimum language proficiency during this entry-level
training in order to continue in the program. Minimum language proficiency at the end of basic language training for
FAOs is 2/2/1+.
   (3) In-country training (ICT).
   (a) ICT is designed to immerse the officer, accompanied by their Family where appropriate, in the local language
and culture of their assigned AOC. This can be accomplished through attendance at a host nation professional military
education (PME) course or assignment to a host nation military unit. It is designed to provide advanced language
studies and develop in-depth knowledge of the region through a program of travel, research, and self-study. The FAOs
are expected to conduct extensive familiarization travel throughout the region and attain first-hand knowledge of
national and regional cultures, geography, political-military environments, economies, and societal differences. Officers
who attend foreign military schools are recognized as performing an Army Security Cooperation mission as well as
training for future assignments. Relationships developed during ICT at a foreign military school or through interaction
with host nation military personnel are frequently maintained for years and enhance capability and effectiveness in
future assignments. The duration of ICT is generally no longer than one year and during this period a FAO must
continue to improve language capability with the goal of attaining general professional level (level 3) proficiency.
   (b) Eurasia FAOs (48E) have the option to complete a traditional one-year ICT in region or attend a 12-month
course of instruction at the George C. Marshall Center for Security Studies in Garmisch, Germany, focusing on
advanced language skills, in-depth military representative assignments and representing the U.S. in the international
security studies courses held at the Center. The FAO internships in the 48E region are key elements of the curriculum
258                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

of the Marshall Center. During these internships, officers will have the opportunity to work and travel throughout
Eurasia while serving in operational military representative positions.
   (4) Advanced civilian schooling. FAOs must complete a regionally focused graduate degree and the Army’s fully-
funded ACS program is a privilege available to officers with demonstrated potential for continued service. Officers
must meet the requirements outlined in AR 621–1 to be eligible for ACS.
   (a) The FAOs attend graduate schools approved by the FAO Proponent as published in the annual list of approved
graduate degree programs. Requests to attend graduate programs not on the approved list must be submitted to the
FAO Proponent with appropriate supporting documentation well in advance of the ACS application process. It is the
prospective FAO’s responsibility to demonstrate the program is accredited and will provide at least 60 percent of its
required credits in the appropriate regional focus. Exceptions to this standard must be approved by the Chief of the
FAO Proponent Office.
   (b) When applying to graduate schools, FAOs must apply to at least one tax- supported school which will offer you
in-state tuition and is generally considered a low-cost school (< $13,000 per annum for FY 08). Your two other choices
may be a medium cost (< $ 20,000 per annum for FY 08) or high cost if the institution agrees to provide tuition
assistance or otherwise remain below the medium cost cap.
   (c) Officers entering the FAO program who have possess a graduate degree in a FAO-related discipline or possess
the necessary background and/or professional experience combined with extensive personal and professional interna-
tional exposure may apply for constructive credit from the Chief of the FAO Proponent Office. If approved, these
officers will not be afforded further graduate schooling at Army expense as part of the formal FAO training process.
   (d) The FAOs attending graduate schooling via the Army’s ACS program will obtain a master’s degree in an
appropriate FAO-related discipline including: international relations/affairs, area studies, international economics,
international security studies, geography, geopolitics, government, regional history, Master of Military Arts and Science
(MMAS) (with an FAO-related concentration), national security studies, political science, and social science and
strategic intelligence (from the National Defense Intelligence College (NDIC)). Any exceptions to this list of disci-
plines must be coordinated with the FAO Proponent Office prior to declaration of the graduate degree program.
   (e) The FAOs in ACS are required to maintain or improve their language skills. The officers must meet the
language requirement for degree completion for their institution. If there is no language requirement for degree
completion, the officer must maintain language proficiency through elective course work or independent study.
Language training will be conducted at no cost to the Army.
   (f) The FAOs in ACS are required to maintain contact with their respective Regional Managers in the FAO
Proponent Office throughout their attendance at the institution. Regional Managers will review curricula prior to every
quarter or semester to ensure the aforementioned instructions are followed. The FAOs will provide copies of all grade
reports, receipts, and so forth per established procedures.
   d. Intermediate level education. FAOs will, in coordination with the AHRC FAO training officer and their Propo-
nent regional manager, have several options to choose from to attain MEL–ILE or Intermediate Level Education (ILE).
An FAO may attend the 10-month AOWC at Fort Leavenworth or select Latin American FAOs (48B) may have the
opportunity to attend ILE at the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC). These options
follow completion of basic language training, ICT and ACS. These courses reorient the FAO to Army operations after
completion of FAO-specific training prepare the FAO for potential service in an ASCC, Corps HQs or the Army staff
while completing JPME I. The FAOs should identify their preference for this course at the beginning of their training
tours. Other FAOs will attend a 14-week ILE Common Core Course conducted at any of the approved ILE satellite
sites. The course is designed to provide the officer a JPME I educational background. An FAO can attend ILE at any
point in the training cycle after completion of basic language training. Officers can also receive MEL credit for
graduation from foreign staff and war colleges. The FAO proponent and AHRC will determine approved foreign
military staff courses based on Army Chief of Staff Guidance.
   e. Utilization. FAO majors and lieutenant colonels focus mainly on their technical competencies through breadth and
depth of FAO assignments. These skills are refined as the officer moves into the senior leader level at the rank of
colonel. Sequencing of the type and location of assignments is not critical. The FAOs should avoid “homesteading,”
and alternate between overseas and CONUS tours as much as possible. Confining oneself to any one type of work or in
any one location typically reduces an officer’s utility as a FAO. Therefore, FAOs should ideally complete at least one
assignment from three of the following five categories before promotion to colonel:
   (1) Overseas U.S. country team. Assignments include Defense attaché, Army attaché, assistant Army attaché, and
security cooperation positions in a Security Assistance Office, Office of Defense Cooperation, or military group.
   (2) Army operational. Assignments include positions at the ASCC, Corps HQs, and Army Staff.
   (3) Political-Military. Assignments include OSD Staff, Joint Staff, National Security Council, Department of State,
Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DIA, and combatant commands.
   (4) Broadening. Generalist positions outside of FA 48 may be available as a means of broadening and developing
multifunctional FA 48 officers with operational relevance. Broadening assignments develop a wider range of knowl-
edge and skills, augment understanding of the full spectrum of Army missions, promote practical application of
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            259

leadership skills and permit FAOs to gain relevancy in areas outside of their AOC. Broadening assignments may
include MiTTs and PRTs.
   (5) Institutional. Assignments include AHRC, Defense Language Institute, USMA, TRADOC, Fort Leavenworth,
Carlisle Barracks, and WHINSEC.
28–4. Duration of critical officer life-cycle assignments
Most assignments for FAOs are 24 to 36 months in length. OCONUS locations will continue to require specific tour
lengths. Officers desiring to become FAOs must recognize that a large portion of FA 48 positions are located
OCONUS.
   a. Key foreign area officer functional area qualification positions. Completion of training as listed in paragraph
28–3, current language proficiency, and successful completion of, or assignment in, a FA 48 tour for at least 12 months
are the prerequisites for FA qualification at each grade.
   b. The foreign area officer functional area life-cycle. Figure 28–1, below, depicts an FA 48 life-cycle. Additionally,
it identifies development assignments within the FA.
                              Figure 28–1. The AA Foreign Area Officer Developmental Model

28–5. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for the foreign area officer
   a. Structure. The FAOs serve at all echelons worldwide. The FAO positions exist on the Army Staff, in ASCCs,
Combatant Commands, Joint Commands, Defense Agencies, National Agencies, and the institutional Army. The Active
Army life-cycle development model for FAOs is shown at figure 28–1, above. It depicts FA qualification requirements
and key developmental assignments.
   b. Acquire. Officers are accessed into the FAO program as part of their cohort year group’s (YG) 7-year FDB. The
FAO proponent establishes the minimum criteria the DA-level FDB will use in selecting officers for FA 48. Minimum
criteria for FA 48 are —
   (1) Demonstrated aptitude for learning foreign languages by attaining an acceptable score on the Defense Language
Aptitude Battery (DLAB). The minimum DLAB score for designation as a FAO is 95. The minimum scores for
officers designated to study in different categories (CAT) of language are as follows: CAT I languages (Spanish,
French, Italian, Portuguese) - 95, CAT II languages (German, Indonesian)- 100, CAT III languages (Dari, Pashto,
Persian, Farsi, Russian, Uzbek, Hindi, Urdu, Hebrew, Thai, Serbian, Croatian, Tagalog, Turkish, Sorani, Kurmanji) -
105, and CAT IV languages (Arabic-MSA, Chinese Mandarin, Korean, Japanese)- 110. These requirements may be
waived by the FAO proponent for officers who have a current (less than one year old) Defense Language Proficiency
Test (DLPT) score of 2/2 or higher.
   (2) Officers must have a time in service (TIS) of less than 17 years AFCS by the start of ACS in accordance with
AR 621–1.
   (3) No officer is selected for FAO training without having first successfully completed company grade leader
development and having obtained quality experience in basic branch assignments. Officers at risk for promotion will
not be considered.
   (4) All officers must be eligible for a Top Secret security clearance based upon an SBI under AR 380–67.
   (5) If the officer’s spouse and other dependent Family members are not U.S. citizens, they must begin the
naturalization process when the officer begins the FAO accessions process. If this is not completed in a timely manner,
it may limit an officers’ assignment potential.
   (6) The officer’s spouse and other dependent Family members must be free of serious or chronic medical problems
that would preclude worldwide assignment. If a Family member is enrolled in the Exceptional Family Member
Program with a condition that prevents them from living overseas, the officer must be prepared to serve unaccom-
panied overseas tours.
   (7) Given the nature of FAO assignments, joint domicile needs are extremely difficult to accommodate. Officers
with military spouses should carefully consider the potential personal costs in terms of Family hardship prior to
choosing a FAO career.
   c. Distribute. The AHRC manages FAO assignments. Distribution of FAO-coded billets throughout the Army, the
Joint force, and the Interagency is the responsibility of FAO proponent.
   d. Deploy. The FAOs are Soldiers who must remain prepared to deploy worldwide at any time to support
operational commanders and in support of other requirements. All FAOs must be deployable to accomplish missions
across the full spectrum of operations. The FAOs may deploy with their units or as individuals as the mission demands.
FAOs must prepare themselves and their Families for this reality.
   e. Sustain. Officers designated into the operations support functional category will compete within their functional
category for promotion to lieutenant colonel and colonel.
   f. Develop. Throughout their FAO career, officers will have the opportunity for training and further professional
development. This starts with a FAO’s initial training, followed by continued development through assignments and
required courses, and lastly by the officer’s self-development efforts.
   (1) Initial training. All FAOs will generally conduct the five phases of training previously discussed.
   (2) Continued development. Officers may receive further education through training required for certain positions.
Examples include low-density language training, JPME II, Defense Institute for Security Assistance Management
(DISAM), Joint Military Attaché School, and Individual Terrorism Awareness Course (INTAC). Future initiatives may
include billet sharing opportunities or broadening positions outside of the 48 functional area which will permit FAOs to
maintain an operational link to the deployed force.
   (3) Self-development. All FAOs will seek self-development/continuing education opportunities as they serve in
positions of increased responsibility. This includes remaining relevant in national security and policy issues which
affect their respective regional expertise. This can be done by engaging experts in think tanks, DOD regional
hemispheric centers and academia. The FAOs must ensure their language skills are maintained through rigorous self-
study and assignments within their area of concentration.
   g. Separate. The FAOs will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                          261

28–6. Foreign area officer Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. The AR 135–11 provides specific information about the process and pre-requisites
for designation as a RC FAO but can be summarized as essentially complementing and paralleling those of the active
Army. Junior officers must develop a strong foundation through assignments in their basic branches before receiving
the FAO designation. Management of the Reserve FAO Program is a shared responsibility between the Military
Intelligence Branch/Functional Area Management Office, Human Resources Command - St. Louis (AHRC–OPB–MR)
and the FAO Functional Proponent, Strategic Leadership Division, Army DCS, G–3/5/7 (DAMO–SSF). The MI
Branch/Functional Area Management Office is responsible for the assignment of MI officers, as well as FAOs. Close
coordination and continued monitoring is required to verify that assignment of officers to FAO billets is limited to
qualified Reserve FAOs who have been identified through the FAO formal designation process
   b. Functional area qualification. Reserve officers requesting FAO designation must have a current DLPT of at least
2/2, 50 percent completion of Intermediate Level Education, documented evidence of relevant experience, and comple-
tion of a master’s degree, preferably in regional studies or a field related to FAO duties. Chief of the FAO Proponent
can grant waivers when officers are unable to fulfill entry requirements but clearly will add value to the Reserve FAO
program. This qualitative decision depends on an overall review of the officer’s file. In many cases, a Reserve officer
may have gained critical experience in a region, sometimes in multiple regions, through their civilian career.
   c. Functional area 48 developmental opportunities. After thorough vetting, a prospective Reserve FAO may be
given a FAO designation with the stipulation that ILE or a master’s degree program be completed within a defined
period. Unlike their Active Duty counterparts, Reserve FAOs remain in their basic branch and receive FAO functional
area designation only. There is no funding allocated either for the initial training or the continued professional
development of Reserve FAOs in their functional area. All Reserve officers enter the Reserve FAO program with 2/2
language ability documented by DLPT results within the past 12 months. Language sustainment and enhancement is
largely accomplished through self-development. The Military Intelligence Readiness Command provides cost-effective
language training for linguists and FAOs through a limited number of CONUS language refresher training courses, as
well as a cost-effective OCONUS immersion program offering three-week home stays, classroom instruction, and
cultural excursions.
   d. Reserve foreign area officer billets. The FAO billets are divided almost equally between the DIA, Directorate of
Human Intelligence, with 52 authorized positions and the Army commands, which have a total of approximately 50
positions. The majority of Army billets are DIMA positions located on HQDA staff and COCOMs, although there are a
few troop unit (TPU) billets with Reserve Regional Readiness Commands and one FAO billet at the U.S. Military
Academy.
   e. Life-cycle development model. The RC life-cycle development model for FAOs is shown at figure 28–2, below. It
depicts FA qualification requirements and KD assignments.

Chapter 29
Strategic Plans and Policy Functional Area (FA 59)
29–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. Strategic Plans and Policy officers are warfighters who provide the Army with a highly trained cadre
specializing in the development and implementation of national strategic plans and policies; theater strategy and
campaign planning; and the evolution of concepts and doctrine for employing military forces at the operational and
strategic levels of warfare. In addition to the common leader attributes described in Army FM 3–0, the FA 59 officers
possess four functional competencies: strategic appraisal, strategic and operational planning, interagency integration,
and strategic education.
   b. Proponency. FA 59 is managed within the Operations Support functional category (OSFC). The DCS, G–3/5/7
serves as the proponent for FA 59. The Web site is: https://www.fa-59.army.pentagon.mil/.
   c. Functions. FA 59 officers primarily lead the long-range planning efforts of their supported organizations. In
addition to their planning functions, FA 59 officers often lead joint and combined planning groups, integrate non-
military or interagency partners, and execute high-level strategic and operational appraisals in support of national
strategies and theater-level operational plans. In addition to these functions, FA 59 officers also educate the rest of the
Army and the joint force on strategy development, joint/interagency planning, and doctrine. Strategic Plans and Policy
officers serve primarily at the Army Command level and above. Strategists also work on the Joint Staff, OSD,
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            263

Regional Combatant Command staffs, multinational staffs, and various staffs and interagency working groups in the
government where they support the formulation and implementation of national security strategy and national military
strategy. Additionally, officers in FA 59 also operate in commands that focus on the future development of concepts
and doctrine for employing military forces at both the operational and strategic levels of warfare.
   d. Functional competencies. Over the course of their careers, FA 59 officers develop four functional competencies:
strategic appraisal, strategic and operational planning, interagency integration, and strategic education. In addition to
these functional competencies, officers are encouraged to develop regional or institutional planning competencies in
accordance with their interests:
   (1) Strategic appraisal: Officers build feedback mechanisms that enable iterative reassessment and adjustment of
plans in response to adaptive adversaries, shifting ends, and complex situations within the context of a coherent
strategy. FA 59 officers develop effective measures to evaluate performance and integrate assessment mechanisms
within plans and senior leader decision forums. Appraisal mechanisms identify the linkages between policy, strategy,
and operations and focus particularly upon the cultural and organizational constraints that inhibit effective strategic
analysis.
   (2) Strategic planning: Officers create and sustain actionable plans or recommendations that translate operational and
institutional means into desired endstates. Particular emphasis is placed on campaign planning and integration of joint
capabilities within national and theater-level plans. Officers provide specific expertise on the use of military forces and
the combinations of national capabilities that are best able to achieve objectives. Important subsets of strategic planning
include but are not limited to: deliberate and contingency planning at all echelons division and above, Department of
Defense and Army institutional planning, red-teaming, national and combatant command risk adjudication planning,
security cooperation planning, transition planning from military to political authorities, long-range program manage-
ment, and alliance management functions.
   (3) Inter-service/Interagency integration: FA 59 officers provide non-partisan approaches to develop synergistic and
integrated solutions that maximize team capabilities. FA 59 officers promote understanding of team strengths and
weaknesses while leading joint planning groups and similar forums. They also cultivate deeper expertise collectively
through establishing appropriate divisions of labor within joint/interagency planning venues. In addition to leading
joint/interagency planning efforts, FA 59 officers also codify best practices in joint and Army organizations through
development of doctrine at all levels.
   (4) Strategic education: Strategic Plans and Policy officers teach and develop curriculum to support education in
military theory, the strategic arts, and national security strategies and policies. They exploit interdisciplinary approaches
that leverage the strengths of multiple fields for diagnosis, analysis, assessment, and execution. FA 59 educators seek
to train the joint force to think and operate beyond preferred operational concepts to achieve desired strategic effects.
Officers emphasize sensitivity to context-understanding the variability of people, places, conditions, and problems
while perceiving elements of discontinuity that preface emerging trends in complex environments.
   e. Sample duties. Examples of the duties and functions performed in various commands include, but are not limited
to:
   (1) Division/corps planners: FA 59 officers serve as staff leads for operational planning, strategic concept develop-
ment, and force generation planning for Army operational headquarters and joint task forces. Strategists within these
commands integrate division and corps operations into their strategic context with joint, interagency, and multinational
partners. Officers develop operational campaign plans, strategic concepts, strategic appraisals, and force flow plans in
support of joint operations. Strategists at division and corps level coordinate extensively with combatant commands,
service components, other joint task forces, and other Army commands. Officers serving in divisions and corps may
expect to develop campaign planning and strategic appraisal skills, with those officers serving in joint task forces also
developing JIIM integration skills.
   (2) Theater Army Staff: FA 59 officers serve as staff leads for the development of operational plans, contingency
plans, and functional plans in support of their designated geographic combatant commands, as well as planning Title 10
support for Army forces and Army Support to Other Services in their geographic area of responsibility. Additionally,
strategists serving in these commands develop Theater Campaign Plans in support of the National Military Strategy and
Guidance-for-Employment-of-the-Force. Officers coordinate extensively with their Combatant Command, Department
of the Army, sister Service Component Commands, other Army Commands, and with their assigned theater enabling
commands. Officers serving in these commands will develop strong campaign planning and contingency planning
skills, experience leading large and integrated institutional and operational planning efforts, and will develop a deeper
understanding of the complexities and challenges associated with specific geographic regions.
   (3) HQDA / U.S. Army Forces Command / U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command / Office of the Chief Army
Reserve / Director, Army National Guard staffs: FA 59 officers serve as the staff leads for Service Title 10 planning
regarding manning, training, and equipping the force. Strategists serving in these commands ensure that the Army as a
Service provides capabilities necessary to achieve national ends. Officers will develop institutional campaign plans, risk
adjudication documents, strategic appraisals, future force requirements, long-range programming instructions, and a
variety of other generating force planning documents that drive transformation of the Army. Officers coordinate
extensively with the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, and other Army
264                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

Commands. Officers serving in these staffs may expect to develop strong campaign planning and strategic appraisal
skills relevant to Army generating force activities.
   (4) Instructors and professors: FA 59 officers serve as staff and faculty members at staff colleges and war colleges
nationwide. They develop curriculum and instruct graduate level courses in the fields of: critical reasoning, joint,
multinational and interagency environment; strategic level military problems and challenges; campaign planning and
concepts of operational art; joint operational planning in both contingency and crisis action planning environments.
Their duties also include academic writing in the field of strategy and policy, and management of the Army’s
professional programs and symposia on joint professional military education, strategy, campaign planning, and joint
operational studies. Officers maintain broad networks of subject matter experts across the Department of Defense
enterprise and the national academic community. Officers serving as instructors will develop strong skills in their
teaching subjects while developing the functional competency of strategic education.
   (5) Doctrine developers: FA 59 officers serve as doctrine authors and reviewers for strategic- and operational-level
Service, Joint and Multinational doctrine. Strategists serving in this capacity ensure that doctrine provides an accurate
theoretical, intellectual, institutional, and practical foundation for our forces to achieve national security ends. Officers
develop a wide range of Army doctrine based on Service priorities, as well as review, assist and develop Joint and
Multinational doctrine. Doctrine developed can include field manuals, interim field manuals, joint publications, allied
joint publications and other doctrinal and pre-doctrinal documents that codify the Army’s role in the current and future
strategic environment. Officers coordinate extensively with Multinational Commands, Joint Forces Command, the Joint
Staff, and Army Commands. Officers serving in this capacity may expect to develop strong joint, interagency,
international, and multinational integration and strategic education skills relevant to army, joint and multinational
operations and training.
   (6) Alliance and Combined Staff strategists: FA 59 officers provide strategic appraisal and planning expertise to
their commanders and senior leadership on joint multinational operations, multinational force generation, and regional
engagement. Officers often lead the strategic level planning process by formulating strategic engagement campaign
plans to transform partner nations or serving as staff leads on the integration of partner nations into multinational
operations as well as future force planning. They conduct liaison with other combined and multinational organizations
such as NATO, UN, EU, and the OSCE, as well as national capitols to coordinate plans and advocate command
interests. Strategists here promote and coordinate multinational HQ command interests in the interagency policy
formulation process with OSD, Joint Staff, State Department, COCOM staffs, and U.S. embassy country teams
worldwide. Officers serving in these commands develop strong campaign planning, political-military planning, inter-
agency coordination, and strategic appraisal skills relevant to Army operations in a joint, interagency, and multinational
environment.
   (7) Combatant Command strategists: FA 59 officers serving in geographic and functional combatant commands
serve as staff leads for the development of operational plans, contingency plans, and functional plans associated with
their command’s regional or functional requirements. Officers often integrate the planning efforts of the command’s
subordinate service components while simultaneously integrating national-level guidance into regionally-specific plans.
FA 59 officers serving in the combatant commands may expect to also work on a variety of tightly-defined joint,
interagency, or multinational projects or U.S. specific special access programs as required. Strategists here promote and
coordinate national interests in the interagency policy formulation process with OSD, Joint Staff, State Department,
international partners, and U.S. embassy country teams worldwide. Officers serve as the staff leads for service-level
integration associated with deliberative and contingency plans. Officers serving in these commands develop strong
campaign planning, contingency planning, JIIM integration skills, and strategic appraisal skills relevant to joint
operations.
29–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army Values
and the warrior ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the spectrum of
conflict. They must be able to operate in Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) environments
and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving their objectives. FA 59 officers must be culturally astute and
able to use their awareness and understanding to conduct operations innovatively and courageously to exploit opportu-
nities in the challenges and complexities of the operational environment. Further explanation of these characteristics
can be referenced in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge/skills. Strategic Plans and Policy officers require specialized knowledge in strategic matters
that include the following:
   (1) Recognize dynamics of organization, structure, doctrine, and the operating environment of the institutional and
operational Army, the Services, the combatant commands, and alliance partners.
   (2) Employ interdisciplinary problem solving and assessment techniques that complement senior leader decision-
making and appraisal.
   (3) Know how the Army’s capabilities can be integrated with other Services and government agencies to enable the
                                               DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            265

prosecution of effective Joint, combined arms, and interagency operations by use of Joint and inter-Governmental
planning, resourcing and war fighting systems at the strategic, theater strategic, and operational levels of war.
   (4) Understand the domestic political and constitutional context in which DOD provides for national security and in
which the Army must fulfill its Title 10 USC and Title 32 USC responsibilities; particularly the formal and informal
systems which operate the USG, emphasis on force generation at the Army-enterprise level.
   (5) Possess broad understanding of the formal and informal procedures and processes for resourcing DOD and for
developing the national security strategy and national military strategy to include the Joint Strategic Planning System
(JSPS), the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS), and emerging joint requirements of Adaptive
Planning (AP).
29–3. Officer development
   a. Officer Development Model. The officer development model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation at the 7th year for FA 59 develops both specific and broad functional competencies. FA
59 selects at the 7th year because it seeks officers who are well-grounded in tactical-level planning and who understand
the capabilities and limitations of the Army Operating Force.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive for training and assignments
that will broaden and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These broadening opportunities are
outside one’s normal branch or functional area career development, and are joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and
multinational in nature.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (6) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   b. Lieutenant and captain development prior to functional designation. Experience gained by lieutenants and
captains during basic branch assignments serves as the foundation for future effectiveness for FA 59 officers. All
officers will attend a branch CCC and are strongly encouraged to seek a key developmental experience prior to
functional category designation (FD) at the 7th year of commissioned service. Due to the complexity and self-
development requirements of the field, officer desire to serve in the functional area and demonstrated intellectual
capabilities provide the most important indicators for long-term success. The functional area actively recruits officers
with history, policy, business, and economics academic backgrounds because these fields best prepare officers to serve
in policy fields. The functional area also seeks officers who have been repeatedly identified within their Leadership
Attributes/Skills/Actions OER sections as having strengths in the following: Mental Attribute, Conceptualizing/Tactical
Skills, and Communicating, Planning, Decision-Making, and Learning Actions. Officers who have served in planning
assignments or have received master’s degrees in the academic fields above will be given special emphasis during
functional designation processes.
   c. Post functional designation captains and majors development. In accordance with the CSA’s vision for OPMS,
there are no prescriptive developmental paths for the future Army officer corps. FA 59 officers may complete any
combination of MEL–ILE producing opportunities and the Basic Strategic Arts Program (BSAP) to become education-
ally qualified as an Army Strategic Plans and Policy officer. The FA 59 career manager will work with individual
officers to enhance their professional development and meet Army requirements. FA 59 majors who have not
completed ILE will not be considered for additional developmental opportunities until this requirement is met.
   (1) Education
   (a) Graduate degree. Beginning with YG 2000, all FA 59 captains will have the opportunity to receive some form of
fully-funded ACS. These programs include the Army G–3/5/7 Harvard Strategist Program (JFK School of Govern-
ment), Johns Hopkins University (School of Advanced International Studies), National Defense Intelligence College,
and other public and private institutions which provide masters level degrees in public policy, history, political science,
and international relations. FA 59 officers wishing to attend other institutions should contact the AHRC career manager
for guidance on school selection. The AHRC career manager will guide officers during the application process.
   (b) Defense Strategy Course. The DSC is a six-month distance education program provided by the U.S. Army War
College. The course improves student understanding of the role of the DOD in the development of national security
strategy. The DSC addresses the national security policymaking process and the relationship of the national elements of
power to defense strategy. Enrollment for FA 59s is open to FD captains and above. FA 59 officers transferring into
the FA after 2006 are required to complete the DSC within two years of FD. Completion of DSC will confer skill
identifier (SI) 6Z (Army Strategist).
   (c) Intermediate Level Education: ILE is a 14-week common course taught by the CGSC at selected satellite site
266                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

locations. ILE inculcates all field grade officers with a warrior ethos and warfighting focus and prepares them for
positions in the Army and JIIM environments executing the full spectrum of operations. Currently, all FA officers
attend the 14 week ILE common core. Dependent on officer development time lines and Army requirements, FA 59
officers will attend either the 14 week ILE common core at a CGSC satellite site or they will attend the 10 month
resident program at CGSC.
   (d) Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course. The 10 month resident ILE/Advanced Operations Warfighting
Course program includes the 14 week ILE common core and improves field grade officers’ abilities to conduct full
spectrum operations in JIIM environments. The course also provides the requisite competencies to serve successfully
on staffs at division level and above. FA 59 officers who attend AOWC take the 6Z (Army strategist) and 3H (Joint
operations planner) electives and any available University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies (UFMCS) courses
that may be offered in the elective phase of study. Officers who attend AOWC are also expected to attain a master’s
degree while assigned to the CGSC.
   (e) Other Service command and staff colleges. Due to extensive FA 59 Joint requirements, FA 59 officers are
encouraged to attend MEL–ILE producing programs and to enroll in Service-unique electives while attending those
programs. Due to its unique content, FA 59 will send qualified officers to Naval Command and Staff College each
year. Officers attending this program will receive a master’s degree in strategy and policy.
   (f) Basic Strategic Arts Program (BSAP): All FA 59 officers YG 94 to present and those who FD to FA 59 after
2006 will attend BSAP. FA 59s YGs 93 and older are strongly encouraged to attend BSAP. However, due to
competing requirements for student seats, not all FA 59 officers will attend. BSAP is an intensive 14-week program,
conducted at the graduate level by designated faculty members of the U.S. Army War College. The course educates
newly designated FA 59s in the fundamentals of national strategy and fills a critical educational requirement which
provides the tools for junior majors to bridge the gap between their tactical/operational background and the challenges
of operating at the grand-strategic and theater-strategic levels of war and policy. It also introduces the officers to the
unique skills, knowledge, and attributes needed as a foundation for their progressive development as Army strategists.
   (g) Advanced Military Studies Programs (AMSP). Following AOWC or later in their careers, some FA 59s may
attend AMSP for the Army or its Service equivalents (JAWS, SAAS, NOPSC, and SAW). AMSP is a graduate-level
program of the School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) emphasizing military art and science of planning,
preparing and executing full spectrum operations in JIIM contexts. Curriculum combines integrated study of military
history, military theory, and execution-based practical exercises. It also enhances officers’ cognitive problem-solving
skills regarding operational challenges at the tactical and operational levels of war. The course emphasizes both
command and staff perspectives on military decision making, doctrine, and force employment. Graduates earn a
master’s degree in Military Arts and Sciences (MMAS). In addition, FA 59s who choose to attend the SAMS will have
the opportunity to obtain a master of arts degree in Security Studies from a civilian institution partnered with the
CGSC. AMSP attendance is not required, but it is highly encouraged.
   (h) USMA Instructors. Prior to the FD board (6 th year), some officers will be selected as instructors at the USMA
and will attend ACS programs at the purview of USMA. The proponent for this process is USMA and any instructors
who wish to become Army Strategists should coordinate through the FA 59 career manager. Officers who are assigned
to USMA and FD FA 59 are strongly encouraged to attain PhDs and complete nonresident ILE and DSC while at the
USMA. In certain cases, the AHRC career manager will work with officers to facilitate completion of Ph.D. programs
and in matching Ph.D. complementary disciplines with follow-on assignments.
   (i) Harvard Strategist Program. Captains who apply for the HQDA DCS, G–3/5/7 Army Harvard Strategist Program
will be selected by an HQDA panel of senior FA 59 colonels. Upon graduation from the JFK School of Government,
they serve a two-year utilization tour on the Army Staff within HQDA DCS, G–3/5/7 and will then be functionally
designated into FA 59.
   (j) University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies Red Team University (UFMCS RTU): Often offered as an
elective at CGSC, UFMCS RTU attendance is not mandatory; however, officers who wish to attend UFMCS TDY en
route should contact the FA 59 career manager and request attendance to the 8 week introductory course. Graduation
will award them an appropriate SI 7G and enable them to work as Red Team members at the Division/Corps/ASCC
level. Red Team members are responsible to challenge Blue Courses of Action and do so based upon their broad
knowledge of culture and the various influences that influence the enemy decision making process.
   (2) KD assignments: A key developmental position is one that is deemed fundamental to the development of an
officer in his or her functional area competencies or deemed critical by the senior Army leadership to provide
experience across the Army’s strategic mission. All FA 59 billets are coded as KD equivalents so that officer
management focuses upon ensuring continuity to supported commands and ensuring that promotions and selection
within the FA 59 community are based solely upon manner of performance and competency development. Accessions
Branch officers may serve in identified billet-sharing positions (59XC positions) with appropriate training and creden-
tials — to include positions identified as “key developmental” within the FA 59 field. For complete listings of
assignments and developmental pathways, please see: https://www.fa-59.army.pentagon.mil/Positions.htm.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments: All officer positions are developmental. They enhance some aspect
of warfighting skills, increase officers’ levels of responsibility, develop their understanding of interoperability among
Army branches, or expose them to branch related generating force/JIIM opportunities that directly contribute to success
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            267

as an agile and adaptive leader. Broadening assignments develop a wider range of knowledge and skills, augment
understanding of the full spectrum of Army missions, promote practical application of language training or increase
cross cultural exposure, and expand officer awareness of other governmental agencies, units or environments. Since all
FA 59 billets are KD, the functional area treats “Developmental” positions as those external to the functional area or
filled prior to Functional Designation. By the nature of the four FA 59 functional competencies and authorized billets,
many FA 59-coded positions fall within the “Broadening” assignments subfield of Army “Developmental” positions.
Accessions Branch officers may serve in identified billet-sharing positions (59XC positions) with appropriate training
and credentials-to include positions identified as “Broadening” within the FA 59 field.
   (4) Self-development: The complex and changing nature of strategy formulation and policy development require
extensive self-development by FA 59 officers. Officers are encouraged to complete nonresident education opportunities
offered through the other Services (such as nonresident Service Command and Staff or War Colleges). Further, most
FA 59s are encouraged to seek multiple graduate degree opportunities to broaden their experience bases and to improve
their skills in multidisciplinary problem solving. FA 59 officers are strongly encouraged to embark on a continuous
program of professional readings and as available they should seek local, national and international think-thanks for use
to continue their development. This can be in the form of lectures, publication and so forth. In addition, all FA 59
officers may consider joining or participating in various Strategist associations within the Department of Defense.
   (5) Desired experience: FA 59 officers are expected to master at least two of the four functional competencies and
to have gained the 6Z (Strategist) additional skill identifier by the time they become senior majors. Foremost, mid-
grade FA 59 officers must gain skills in the strategic planning competency through repetitive opportunities to develop
operational and institutional plans-deliberate and contingency. Further, FA 59 officers are expected to have completed
all of the educational requirements listed above before entering their primary zone consideration for LTC.
   d. Lieutenant colonel development. Development as a FA 59 LTC focuses upon gaining exposure and understanding
of all four functional competencies. As the component of the strategic planning competency, FA 59 LTCs are expected
to understand strategic, operational, and institutional planning systems.
   (1) Education: No education is mandated beyond that listed within the CPT/MAJ development path. However, FA
59 provides fellowships, broadening programs, and Senior Service College opportunities to improve educational depth
in preparation for FA 59 COLs teaching and leadership positions:
   (a) Fellowships. Upon completion of one FA 59 assignment, officers can pursue several unique training/fellowship
opportunities designed to enhance previous educational experiences. In addition to the centrally-selected Army fellow-
ships, FA 59s may request assignment to one of four OSD-approved fellowships designed exclusively for FA 59. These
Non MEL–ILE assignments (1 year) are located within the National Capitol Region and are designed to provide
broadening opportunities and expose FA 59s to policy development at the national strategic level. FA 59s selected to
attend are designated as U.S. Army Fellows and act as ambassadors for the CSA. Senior FA 59 majors and lieutenant
colonels are encouraged to apply and will be selected by a panel of HQDA DCS, G–3/5/7 FA 59s at the beginning of
each academic year. Officers interested in applying should contact the FA 59 career manager. In accordance with
appropriate regulations, a three to one Active Duty Service obligation (ADSO) is incurred.
   (b) Seminar XXI. Strategic Plans and Policy officers may also compete for seven fully-funded educational opportu-
nities hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Seminar XXI (MIT) is a fully-funded educational
program for senior military officers, Government and NGO officials, and executives in the national security policy
community. The program provides leaders with enhanced analytic skills for understanding foreign countries and the
relations among them. Seminar XXI explores key policy issues by examining countries and problems critical to
American interests through a variety of paradigmatic lenses. At each session, eminent speakers present alternative
perspectives from which the given country or problem can be understood. The seminar provides concrete frameworks
for examining how different paradigms suggest fundamentally different, even conflicting, answers to the questions
American policymakers must resolve. Senior FA 59 majors through colonels are invited to contact the FA 59 proponent
manager for further information.
   (c) PhD Completion Program: FA 59s may compete to attend a degree completion program for a PhD in a policy
related field. The intent is to give an officer time to complete his or her research and dissertation. The program is open
only to officers who have advanced to doctoral candidacy, and selection is weighted toward officers who have not
already had an opportunity to serve within an academic setting.
   (d) Senior Service College: FA 59s compete for Senior Service College in the same manner as other Army officers.
The Proponent emphasizes that the Joint Advanced Warfighting School (JAWS) is the preeminent SSC opportunity for
which FA 59s should strive because the school’s curriculum directly builds upon the strategic planning, strategic
appraisal, and joint/interagency integration functional competencies. The Proponent also recommends that officers who
attend Army Senior Service College compete for selection for the Advanced Strategic Art Program (ASAP). This
program strengthens officers’ abilities to develop theater campaign plans and enhances officers’ skills in strategic
appraisal and joint/interagency integration. All officers should attempt to complete another Service’s distance education
SSC program to improve their understanding of joint operations and Service culture.
   (e) Senior Service College Fellowships: The Proponent also recommends that SSC-selects compete for the Ad-
vanced Operational Art Studies Fellowship (AOASF) or one of the National Capitol Region Interagency Fellowships.
268                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

Officers should compete for these fellowships to round-out niche areas of specialization within the four functional
competencies or should select fellowship opportunities that will prepare them for follow-on assignments.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Same as above. All FA 59 billets are coded as KD equivalents.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Same as above.
   (4) Self-development. Same as above.
   (5) Desired experience. The FA 59 LTCs are expected to master the four functional competencies by the time they
become senior LTCs. The FA 59 LTCs must understand national-level resource and budgeting systems as a component
of their competency development. Also, all FA 59 officers are expected to have completed at least two years of joint or
interagency planning and at least two complete FA 59 assignments (approximately 6 years of experience) throughout
the force prior to their PZ consideration for colonel.
   e. Colonel development. The FA 59 colonels must have successfully completed at least two previous Strategic Plans
and Policy assignments before being assigned into a FA 59 position. Only those FA 59 colonels with experience at
Army Command and higher Joint experience will be recommended for anticipated assignments within other Govern-
mental agencies. The FA 59 colonels may expect to serve in a variety of national-level plans and policy positions or as
senior faculty within a Senior Service College.
29–4. Warrant officer development.
There are no warrant officers in FA 59.
                              Figure 29–1. The AA Life-cycle Development Model for FA 59
                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           269

29–5. Reserve Component officers
   a. Career development. Reserve Component FA 59 Strategic Plans and Policy officer development objectives and
desired experiences will generally parallel Active Army FA 59 officers. Officers in the USAR AGR program and
officers within the Active Army will be developed to one federal standard. The challenge for the Army is to match the
unique skills and expertise of civilian professionals with mission needs and requirements. The RC FA 59 officers must
be afforded military education and assignment opportunities so that senior military and civilian leaders can leverage the
unique capabilities that exist among RC FA 59 officers. The goal is to build a talented and fully integrated FA 59
community within the Total Army, the Joint force, and the U.S. Government.
   b. Assignment opportunities. The RC Strategic Plans and Policy officers can expect assignment opportunities similar
to those of Active Army officers (RC Strategic Plans and Policy officers include National Guard officers). In addition,
there are positions exclusive to the Reserves and National Guard that exist in response to the changing geo-strategic
environment. Whether through mobilization of TPUs, mobilization tours for IMAs, extended Active Duty assignments,
or the limited call to Active Duty program (see below), RC FA 59 officers will serve at all levels within the Army,
Joint community, and the Department of Defense. The success of an RC strategist is not measured by length of service
in any one component or control group, but by the officer’s experience, abilities, and performance. FA 59 assignments
are made based upon the USAR, AGR, and IMA officers available and qualified coupled with military necessity and
requirements. Civilian acquired skills, advanced military and civilian education, and demonstrated abilities to function
in a strategic environment exist among a diverse pool of RC strategists.
   c. Call to Active Duty (CAD). Interested RC strategists are encouraged to pursue the CAD program. This enables RC
strategists to re-enter the Active Army while maintaining continuity of service. Once accessed into the Active Army,
CAD officers are assigned, promoted, and educated in the active Army. Those officers who are interested should
contact the Active Duty FA 59 career manager.
   d. FA 59 development opportunities.
   (1) A diverse and fluid career. The competing demands of civilian and military life pose a challenge for the
professional development of the FA 59 RC strategist. RC strategists should follow Active Army officer development
patterns as closely as possible. However, a FA 59 RC officer’s development and assignment progression can be
characterized by its ability to adapt to changes. Civilian professional development can benefit the Total Army, and
should be leveraged. To meet military career development objectives, RC officers must be willing to rotate between
ARNG and USAR TPU, IRR, IMA program, and the AGR programs. These transfers are necessitated by individual
career paths, military requirements, geographical considerations, and the need to provide as many officers as possible
the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions. The RC strategist should expect numerous and
rewarding transitions from civilian to military life. It is important to be flexible and weigh various options as
assignments and schools come available. FA 59s should seek TDY assignments and/or mobilization as an IMA.
Mobilized TPUs will present opportunities. Transferring to the IRR may be necessary while completing mandatory
military educational requirements necessary to build a career and advance as a FA 59 RC officer. The RC strategists
should contact the FA 59 RC career manager to review options and opportunities.
   (2) Education and training. Due to the complexity and diversity of assignments in the FA 59 field, RC officers must
continually develop their knowledge and analytical skills. The RC strategists will be offered opportunities to pursue
continuing education and training (civilian and military) and government internship programs to improve skills.
Strategists in the grade of major should attend resident BSAP and complete the DSC. RC officers will have increased
time windows to complete requirements.
   (3) Life-cycle development model. The RC life-cycle development model for FA 59 RC Strategic Plans and Policy
officers mirrors that for Active Army officers, except that assignments are not limited to one component or control
group. Figure 29–2 , below, illustrates a typical RC FA 59 career.

Nuclear and Counterproliferation Functional Area (FA 52)
30–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. Nuclear Operations and Counterproliferation officers are warfighters who provide the Army with a
technically educated, operationally experienced and highly trained cadre specializing in all aspects of nuclear and
combating WMD strategic and operational level planning and execution. This includes expertise across the spectrum of
nuclear and combating WMD operations from weapon design and effects, surety, protection, detection, and conse-
quence management. In addition to the common leader attributes described in Army FM 3–0, the FA 52 officers
possess five functional competencies: strategy, plans, policy and operations; research, development and capabilities;
doctrine, education and training; modeling and simulation; and combating WMD.
   b. Proponent information. The FA 52 is managed within the Plans Development Group of the Operations Support
functional category (OSFC). Headquarters, Department of the Army, DCS, G–3/5/7 serves as the proponent for FA 52,
with the Director, U.S. Army Nuclear and Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction Agency (USANCA) as the
designated proponent. FA 52 and Proponent-related information may be found in the USANCA Knowledge Center
(controlled access) on Army Knowledge Online, at https://www.us.army.mil/suite/kc/10739290.
   c. Functions. The FA 52 officers primarily lead the nuclear and combating WMD planning, training, requirement
development, and operations efforts of their supported organizations. FA 52 officers often lead joint, combined and
interagency planning and action groups and teams for general combating WMD activities and specific nuclear weapons
issues. The FA 52 officers are frequently the Department of Defense’s single point of entry to coordinate WMD
activities with non-military or interagency partners. In addition to these functions, FA 52 officers provide technical
advice and support in developing national and military strategy, plans and policy recommendations to Army, Combat-
ant Command, Department of Defense, and Interagency leadership in nuclear and combating WMD mission areas.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                         271

30–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army Values
and the warrior ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the spectrum of
conflict. They must be able to operate in Joint, Interagency, International, and Multinational (JIIM) environments and
leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving their objectives. Our officers must be culturally astute and able to
use their awareness and understanding to conduct operations innovatively and courageously to exploit opportunities in
the challenges and complexities of the operational environment. Further explanation of these characteristics can be
referenced in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Functional competencies. Over the course of their careers, FA 52 officers develop five functional competencies:
strategy, plans, policy and operations; research, development and capabilities; modeling and simulation; and combating
WMD. In addition to these functional competencies, officers are encouraged and are provided opportunities to develop
national security, scientific, technical and mission oriented competencies in accordance with their personal interests:
   (1) Strategy, Plans, Policy and Operations: Officers assist in forming and providing advice on national and military
nuclear weapons and combating WMD strategy, plans, policy and operations. Officers must have a unique understand-
ing of nuclear weapons, including the international issues pertaining to use and deterrence value of all strategic
weapons and threats posed by state and non-state nuclear and radiological threats to the United States. Officers
participate at all levels from tactical to strategic, in operations and operations support to the warfighter. In this capacity,
FA 52 officers provide professional technical advice on nuclear matters that include strategic targeting, weapons
effects, limitations posed by radioactive contamination, and consequence management during post-blast crisis
operations.
   (2) Research, development, and capabilities: Officers conduct research and analysis as scientists and engineers on
nuclear weapons and related nuclear weapons effects. FA 52 officers lead the Army’s analysis on the effect of nuclear
weapons on the warfighter and combat equipment. Officers lead and manage development programs that create a wide
range of radiation/nuclear equipment including detectors and protective equipment that once it moves out of the
conceptual phase often move into the Army and Joint acquisition. Furthermore officers provide senior leaders with
detailed assessments of the Army’s vulnerability to nuclear effect, and create inputs to force development models
ensuring that technical and tactical solutions are considered in long range planning. Key to our national security is the
FA 52 led nuclear surety program, ensuring stockpile weapons are secure, functional, and will perform as designed.
   (3) Doctrine, Education, and Training: FA 52 officers provide advice to commanders and staffs at all levels
regarding doctrine, education and training. Officers formulate doctrine for the Army DCS, G–3/5/7 as new radiological
and nuclear threats emerge. Officers use the network of highly skilled FA 52 officers to analyze threats and develop
doctrinal responses to protect the warfighter and allow for continued operations in nuclear environments. Additionally
FA 52 officers plan and execute training for military and non-military response forces to combat WMD. The FA 52
officers specifically train USMA cadets and other government personnel in nuclear weapons, weapons effects, and
other nuclear sciences. This cultivates deeper expertise within the U.S. government collectively through establishing
appropriate divisions of labor within joint and interagency planning and operation organizations. The FA 52 officers
codify best practices in joint and Army organizations through development of doctrine at all levels.
   (4) Modeling and Simulation: FA 52 officers lead the Army’s efforts for nuclear, combating WMD and consequence
management modeling and simulation. Officers serve on staffs at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels providing
support to senior leaders in crisis management and effects mitigation operations. Detailed knowledge of current and
developmental modeling tools assists FA 52 officers in providing commanders and battle staffs an understanding
potential future scenarios involving WMD, which is critical to the development of plans, orders and mission require-
ments. Additionally FA 52 officers have the unique technical skills that enable them to work with highly sophisticated
programs that simulate the effects of nuclear weapons which allow them to provide target analysis and employment
planning for nuclear and advanced conventional weapons. FA 52 officers also conduct technical analysis to support
nuclear weapons stockpile surety, a critical element in the USG nuclear stockpile stewardship program. Through these
efforts FA 52 officers ensure that the current nuclear stockpile meets the nation’s strategic nuclear posture
requirements.
   (5) Combating WMD: The 2002 National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction and the 2006 National
Military Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction frames the mission into three principal pillars; nonprolifera-
tion, counterproliferation, and consequence management. FA 52 officers are integral to the execution of all parts of the
national and military strategies. FA 52 officers at all experience levels and ranks function in critical billets in all
Combating WMD categories.
   (a) Nonproliferation: Nonproliferation activities focus on efforts to keep nuclear materials and weapons at the source
of origin. This includes various arms control, monitoring, and treaty/agreement protocols. FA 52 officers participate in
all aspects of nonproliferation from international treaty negotiations and formulation through inspections and verifica-
tion missions. Additionally, FA 52 officers provide technical expertise to the intelligence community and interagency
bodies that monitor specific threat areas that provide a WMD proliferation risk. Advice, technical expertise, and
experience are essential for framing political policy positions, and metered governmental responses to the full spectrum
of nonproliferation issues.
272                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   (b) Counterproliferation: Counterproliferation activities are those conducted once WMD materials have illegally left
their point of origin or control of a legitimate authority. These activities focus on deterrence, defense and mitigation
efforts. FA 52 officers are engaged at all levels from the national policy level to the tactical execution level to track,
identify, interdict and dispose of illicit WMD shipments.
   (c) Consequence management: Consequence management activities are conducted in response to a WMD release or
a non-weaponized release of toxic chemicals/materials/pathogens though deliberate, accidental, or natural catastrophic
means. During a crisis well informed and educated operations officers are essential to ensure leadership at all levels
tactical, operational, and strategic are provided with accurate, timely information with appropriate context for rapid,
effective and informed decision making. FA 52 officers provide professional, technically accurate analysis during the
initial stages of a WMD crisis and in the weeks and months following. The FA 52 officers are key to ensuring military
and civilian leaders are provided with technically and operationally sound courses of action, so that the Army provides
an appropriately metered response considering the crisis at hand and other Army strategic mission requirements.
   c. Unique knowledge/skills. The FA 52 officers must fully comprehend the organization, structure and doctrine of
the warfighting Army as it evolves into the 21st century. Work within the Nuclear and Counterproliferation functional
area requires the application of technical skills in their military applications. As such, they must:
   (1) Possess an undergraduate degree in any mathematics, science or engineering discipline and/or operational
experience with weapons of mass destruction at the company grade level.
   (2) Possess the ability to obtain a master’s degree in a nuclear or combating WMD related field.
   (3) Expect to routinely serve in staff positions where guidance is minimal and close interaction with senior-level
decision makers is common. Nuclear and Counterproliferation officers are frequently the sole subject matter experts
within their command or organization.
   (4) Apply highly technical scientific concepts to more military- specific issues and applications.
   (5) Be capable of communicating this technical expertise in either written or oral communications.
   (6) Be extremely adept at organizing workload, assigning tasks, and mentoring civilian and military subordinates.
30–3. Officer development
   a. Officer Development Model. The Officer Development model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments. FA 52 officers may come from any basic branch.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation at the 7th year for FA 52 develops both specific and broad functional competencies. FA
52 officers are designated at the 7th year because it seeks officers who are well-grounded in tactical-level planning and
who understand the capabilities and limitations of the Army Operating Force.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive for training, education and
assignments that will broaden and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These broadening
opportunities may be outside one’s normal branch or functional area career development, and are joint, interagency,
intergovernmental, and multinational in nature. Because of the organizations supported by FA 52 officers, many of
these JIIM opportunities will occur as part of their normal functional area career development.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (6) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   b. Lieutenant and captain development prior to functional designation. Experience gained by lieutenants and
captains during basic branch assignments, and to a lesser degree, company grade branch immaterial assignments, serves
as the foundation for future effectiveness for FA 52 officers. All officers will attend a branch CCC and are strongly
encouraged to seek a key developmental experience prior to functional category designation (FD) at the 7th year of
commissioned service. When considering electing FA 52 as one of their preferences for their Functional Designation
Board, an officer’s desire to serve in the functional area and the aptitude for advanced civil schooling in a nuclear or
combating WMD related field provide the most important indicators for long-term success in the field. The functional
area actively recruits officers with mathematics, science or engineering (MSE) academic backgrounds because those
fields best prepare officers to serve in technical FA 52 assignments. While any MSE degree is acceptable for minimum
entry-level qualification, historically, officers with academic backgrounds in physics, nuclear engineering, chemical
engineering, and mechanical engineering have found their undergraduate backgrounds best prepare an individual for
FA 52 assignments and advanced civil schooling. The functional area also seeks officers who have company grade
experience in areas related to weapons of mass destruction. There are some direct applications of company grade
WMD operational skills from officers from the basic branches of Chemical (BR 74), Explosive Ordnance Disposal
(AOC 89E), Special Operations (BR 18), Medical Service Corps (AOC 72A), and Military Intelligence (BR 35).
Officers from any basic branch who have prior service in WMD Civil Support Teams (CST) will find many CST skills
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           273

directly applicable to FA 52. Officers who are attending or have attended advanced education programs in support of
the U.S. Military Academy Rotating Faculty program, particularly in support of the Department of Physics or the
Department of Chemistry and Life Sciences, could be given special emphasis during the functional designation process.
Individuals who have, through any other program, received an advanced degree in any of the academic disciplines
listed above could also be given special emphasis during functional designation processes. In limited cases, basic
branches may release an officer following early completion of that branch’s key developmental experience to attend an
FA 52 sponsored advanced civil schooling opportunity. Individuals who complete or are enrolled in FA 52 sponsored
advanced civil schooling at the time of the Functional Designation Board will be administratively designated into FA
52.
   c. Post functional designation captains and majors development. In accordance with the CSA’s vision for OPMS,
there are no prescriptive developmental paths for the future Army officer corps. FA 52 officers should complete the
Intermediate Level Education (ILE) Common Core Curriculum and the FA 52 qualification course, the Nuclear and
Counterproliferation Officer Course (NCP52) to become initially qualified as an FA 52 officer. The FA 52 career
manager will work with individual officers to enhance their professional development and meet Army requirements.
Most FA 52 officers will initially serve in entry-level positions in Defense Agencies, either the Defense Threat
Reduction Agency or the Defense Intelligence Agency, or in an Army Command, primarily in the 20th Support
Command (CBRNE), where they will work in staff positions across all of the mission areas of combating weapons of
mass destruction. FA 52 majors who have not completed ILE will not be considered for additional developmental
opportunities until this requirement is met.
   (1) Education and training
   (a) Graduate degree. All FA 52 officers who meet the academic prerequisites and have an acceptable military
manner of performance will have the opportunity to receive some form of fully-funded ACS. These programs include
the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), the National Defense Intelligence College (NDIC), the Naval Postgradu-
ate School (NPS) and other public and private institutions which provide masters level degrees in nuclear, nuclear
related and Combating WMD related disciplines. FA 52 officers wishing to attend other institutions should contact the
FA 52 career manager at AHRC or the FA 52 Proponent Manager at USANCA for guidance on school selection. The
FA 52 career manager will guide officers during the application process.
   1. AFIT. The Department of Engineering Physics, Graduate School of Engineering and Management at the Air
Force Institute of Technology, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, provides the opportunity for a number of FA 52 officers to
begin advanced civil schooling each academic year. While the majority of FA 52 officers attending AFIT will enroll in
the Graduate Nuclear Engineering (GNE) program, some officers, based upon academic background and desire, may
enroll in the Combating WMD Technology program (nuclear, biological or chemical tracks) or the Applied Physics
program. The AFIT programs for FA 52 officers may be found at: http://www.afit.edu/en/enp/Degrees.htm.
   2. NDIC. The National Defense Intelligence College, located in the DIA Center, Bolling AFB, Washington DC,
provides the opportunity for a number of FA 52 officers to enroll in the Master of Science in Strategic Intelligence
(MSSI) program each academic year. FA 52 officers enrolled in MSSI will, based upon course availability, enroll in
the “Transnational Threats: Intelligence Challenges” area of study with the focus being available WMD related and
Science and Technology electives. FA 52 officers enrolled in MSSI should coordinate directly with the FA 52 Chair at
NDIC for thesis selection. NDIC programs for FA 52 officers may be found at: http://www.ndic.edu/mssi/mssi.htm.
   3. NPS. The Department of National Security Affairs, and its affiliated Institutes and Centers, at the Naval
Postgraduate School, located in Monterrey, CA, provides the opportunity for a limited number of FA 52 officers to
begin advanced civil schooling each year. FA 52 officers enrolled in the Master of Arts in National Security Affairs
may enroll in any of the WMD related programs at NPS that include “Defense Decision Making and Planning,”
“Homeland Security and Defense,” or “Combating Terrorism - Plans and Strategy.” FA 52 officers enrolled at NPS
will enroll in, as available, specific WMD and proliferation related electives. NPS programs for FA 52 officers may be
found at: http://www.nps.edu/Academics/GeneralCatalog/Home.htm
   4. Other academic institutions. A limited number of FA 52 officers may, based upon availability of resources, be
allowed to attend FA 52 sponsored ACS at academic institutions not listed in 1 to 3 above. Direct coordination with
the FA 52 Proponent Manager is required to determine the availability of funding and approval of institution and
program of study. Officers attending ACS in support of one of the academic departments at USMA who desire input
on selection of an academic program that would also support later service as an FA 52 officer may contact the FA 52
Proponent Manager at USANCA for input, if desired.
   (b) Intermediate level education: ILE Common Core (CC) is a 14-week course taught by the U.S. Army CGSC at
selected satellite site locations. ILE CC inculcates all field grade officers with a warrior ethos and warfighting focus
and prepares them for positions in the Army and JIIM environments executing full spectrum operations. Currently, all
FA 52 officers attend the 14-week ILE CC in residence, or, by exception, may enroll in the ILE CC Distant Education
course. All FA 52 should attend the Nuclear and Counterproliferation Officer Course (NCP52) at their earliest
opportunity, normally enroute to their first FA 52 assignment. NCP52 is currently a four-week course taught at the
Defense Nuclear Weapons School (DNWS), Kirtland AFB, NM. Successful completion of ILE CC and NCP52 will
provide FA 52 officers with their MEL–ILE qualification.
   (c) Other Service command and staff colleges. On an exception basis, FA 52 officers may attend MEL–ILE
274                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

producing programs of the other services. Due to its unique content, the preferred course for FA 52 officers is the
Naval Command and Staff College. Officers attending this program will receive a master’s degree in strategy and
policy, a program very similar to the national security master’s program at the Naval Postgraduate School.
   (d) USMA instructors. Prior to the FD board, some officers will be selected to serve as instructors at USMA and
will attend ACS programs at the purview of USMA. The proponent for this process is USMA and any instructors who
wish to later become an FA 52 officer should coordinate through the FA 52 career manager at AHRC. While the vast
majority of USMA instructors who become FA 52 officers are found in either the Department of Physics and the
Department of Chemistry and Life Sciences, instructors in any academic departments may request to FD into FA 52.
   (2) Key developmental assignments: A KD position is one that is deemed fundamental to the development of an
officer in his or her functional area competencies or deemed critical by the senior Army leadership to provide
experience across the Army’s strategic mission. All FA 52 billets are coded as KD equivalents so that officer
management focuses upon ensuring continuity to supported commands and ensuring that promotions and selection
within the FA 52 community are based solely upon manner of performance and competency development. Accessions
Branch officers may serve in identified billet-sharing positions (52XC positions) with appropriate training and creden-
tials-to include positions identified as “key developmental” within the FA 52 field.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments: All officer positions are developmental. They enhance some aspect
of warfighting skills, increase officers’ levels of responsibility, develop their understanding of interoperability among
Army branches, or expose them to branch related generating force/JIIM opportunities that directly contribute to success
as an agile and adaptive leader. Broadening assignments develop a wider range of knowledge and skills, augment
understanding of the full spectrum of Army missions, promote practical application of language training or increase
cross cultural exposure, and expand officer awareness of other governmental agencies, units or environments. Since all
FA 52 billets are KD, FA 52 treats developmental positions as those external to the functional area or filled prior to
Functional Designation. By the nature of the five FA 52 functional competencies and authorized billets, many FA 52-
coded positions fall within the “Broadening” assignments subfield of Army developmental positions. Accessions
Branch officers may serve in identified billet-sharing positions (52XC positions) with appropriate training and creden-
tials-to include positions identified as “Broadening” within the FA 52 field.
   (4) Self-development: The complex and changing nature of the nuclear and combating WMD areas require continu-
ous self-development by FA 52 officers. Officers are encouraged to enroll in available resident and distant education
training opportunities to remain current in WMD related issues. Functional training courses are abundant and available,
and, in most cases, have no tuition expenses. FA 52 officers should register for and utilize the resources available in
the FA 52 Community folder of the USANCA Knowledge Center on AKO. Among the available resources are listings
of available functional training courses. Finally, FA 52 officers are strongly encouraged to embark on a continuous
program of professional readings. General information regarding a FA 52 Professional Reading List and Training
Opportunities is found in Appendix E of the Nuclear and Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction Handbook.
   (5) Desired experience: FA 52 officers can have expected to serve in at least two of the five functional competencies
by the time they become senior majors. Foremost, mid-grade FA 52 officers must continue to develop their skills
across the spectrum of these functional competencies through repetitive assignments within the FA 52 force structure.
Further, FA 52 officers are expected to have completed the educational and training requirements listed above before
entering their primary zone consideration for LTC.
   d. Lieutenant colonel development. Development as a FA 52 LTC focuses upon gaining additional exposure and a
broader understanding of all five functional competencies. As a minimum, FA 52 LTCs are expected to apply the
functional competencies developed as a CPT/MAJ to senior level national security and interagency staffs.
   (1) Education. No education is mandated beyond that listed within the CPT/MAJ development path. However, FA
52 provides the opportunity for some of its officers to pursue higher level academic programs to support requirements
for that expertise in FA 52 supported organizations. FA 52 officers who participate in these academic programs must
realize that they will be foregoing, at a minimum, three years of FA 52 development and experience.
   (a) Joint and Defense PhD requirements. A limited number of requirements exist in JIIM organizations for FA 52
officers with PhDs in nuclear and combating WMD related disciplines. Similar to FA 52 sponsored masters programs,
limited opportunities exist for FA 52 officers with the appropriate academic background and FA 52 manner of
performance to attend full-funded advanced civil schooling at the PhD level. As with other FA 52 sponsored academic
programs, the school options under this program are limited, both in number and in cost. Individuals desiring to pursue
an FA 52 sponsored PhD program should coordinate directly with the FA 52 Proponent Manager for both availability
and desired program of study. In most cases, participation in an FA 52 sponsored PhD program has a directed initial
utilization tour immediately following completion of the program of study.
   (b) USMA Rotating PhD Faculty Program. A limited number of requirements exist for FA 52 officers with PhDs to
serve on the rotating faculty at USMA. While the majority of these positions are in the Department of Physics and the
Department of Chemistry and Life Sciences, FA 52 officer may serve in other academic departments on a limited basis.
Officers attending USMA-sponsored educational programs will coordinate directly with the department sponsoring the
education for advice on academic discipline, school of choice and desired academic focus. Though not required, most
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            275

FA 52 officers participating in this program will have served on the USMA rotating faculty at the MS level earlier in
their career.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Same as above. All FA 52 billets are coded as KD equivalents.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Same as above.
   (4) Self-development. Same as above.
   (5) Desired experience. The FA 52 LTCs are expected to master the five functional competencies by the time they
become senior LTCs, even if they have not had the opportunity to serve in each individual competency. FA 52 LTCs
should have, as a minimum, served in three of the five functional competencies. As a function of ensuring a broad
development across the FA 52 functional competencies, all FA 52 LTCs should have completed at least one joint or
interagency tour and at least two complete FA 52 assignments (approximately 6 years of experience) throughout the
force prior to their PZ consideration for colonel.
   e. Colonel development. With the exception of select transfers, FA 52 colonels normally will have successfully
completed at least two previous Nuclear and Counterproliferation assignments before being assigned into a FA 52
position. Because of the relatively small number of FA 52 COL positions, FA 52 COLs can expect to serve in a variety
of national-level positions based upon their previously developed FA 52 skills and experience. Though limited, some
FA 52 COLs can expect to serve outside of FA 52 to meet Army branch immaterial requirements.
30–4. Warrant officer development
There are no warrant officers in FA 52.
                                Figure 30–1. The AA Life-cycle Development Model for FA 52
276                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

30–5. Reserve Component officers
   a. Career development. Reserve Component FA 52, nuclear and counterproliferation officer development objectives
and desired experiences will generally parallel Active Army FA 52 officers. Officers in the USAR AGR program and
officers within the Regular Army will be developed to one Federal standard. The challenge for the Army is to match
the unique skills and expertise of civilian professionals with mission needs and requirements. The RC FA 52 officers
must be afforded military education and assignment opportunities so that senior military and civilian leaders can
leverage the unique capabilities that exist among RC FA 52 officers. The goal is to build a talented and fully integrated
FA 52 community within the Total Army, the Joint force, and the U.S. Government.
   b. Assignment opportunities. The RC FA 52 officers can expect assignment opportunities similar to those of Active
Army officers. In addition, there are positions exclusive to the Reserves and National Guard that exist in organizations
that support the mission areas of combating weapons of mass destruction. Whether through mobilization of TPUs,
mobilization tours for IMAs, extended Active Duty assignments, or the limited call to Active Duty program (see
below), or traditional RC service, RC FA 52 officers may serve at all levels within the Army, Joint community, and the
Department of Defense. The success of an RC FA 52 officer is not measured by length of service in any one
component or control group, but by the officer’s experience, abilities, and performance. The FA 52 assignments are
made based upon the availability and qualifications of individual USAR, AGR, and IMA officers coupled with military
necessity and requirements. Civilian acquired skills, advanced military and civilian education, and demonstrated
abilities to function in the nuclear and combating WMD community exist among a diverse pool of RC FA 52 officers.
   c. Call to Active Duty. Interested RC officers are encouraged to pursue the CAD program. This enables RC officers
to re-enter the Active Army while maintaining continuity of service. Once accessed into the Active Army, CAD
officers are assigned, promoted, and educated in the active Army. Those officers who are interested should contact the
Active Duty FA 52 career manager.
   d. RC FA 52 developmental opportunities.
   (1) A diverse and fluid career. The competing demands of civilian and military life pose a challenge for the
professional development of the FA 59 RC officer. RC officers should follow Active Army officer development
patterns as closely as possible. However, a FA 52 RC officer’s development and assignment progression can be
characterized by its ability to adapt to changes. Civilian professional development can benefit the Total Army, and
should be leveraged. To meet military career development objectives, RC officers must be willing to rotate between
ARNG and USAR TPU, IRR, IMA program, and the AGR programs. These transfers are necessitated by individual
career paths, military requirements, geographical considerations, and the need to provide as many officers as possible
the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions. The RC FA 52 officer should expect numerous
and rewarding transitions from civilian to military life. It is important to be flexible and weigh various options as
assignments and schools come available. FA 52s should seek TDY assignments and/or mobilization as an IMA.
Mobilized TPUs will present opportunities. Transferring to the IRR may be necessary while completing mandatory
military educational requirements necessary to build a career and advance as a FA 52 RC officer. RC officers should
contact the FA 52 RC career manager to review options and opportunities.
   (2) Education and training. Due to the complexity and diversity of assignments in the FA 52 field, RC officers must
continually develop their knowledge and analytical skills. RC FA 52 officers will be offered opportunities to pursue
training opportunities to improve their functional skills. RC FA 52 officers should attend the Nuclear and Coun-
terproliferation Officer Course (NCP52) at their earliest opportunity and complete RC ILE in accordance to current RC
policy. RC officers will have increased time windows to complete requirements.
   (3) Life-cycle development model. The life-cycle development model for FA 52 RC officers mirrors that for Active
Army officers, except that assignments may not be limited to one component or control group. Figure 30–2 , below,
illustrates a typical RC FA 52 career.

Force Management Functional Area (FA 50)
31–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. Force Management is a critical operating function for the Army. The Force Management functional area
provides distinctively skilled officers who integrate and implement changes in organizational requirements and authori-
zations, documentation of those changes, program development and funding, and materiel development and equipment
fielding at tactical and operational levels of Army and Joint forces. Force Management officers (FA 50s) are trained,
educated, and qualified in critical aspects of the force management process to ensure Army forces are organized and
equipped with the capabilities necessary to support the missions of the Combatant Commands. They are self-
disciplined strategic thinkers. Most of all, FA 50 officers are problem solvers.
   b. Proponency. FA 50 is part of the Operations Support functional category. The DCS, G–8 is the proponent for FA
50. The Web site is http://www.fa50.army.mil.
   c. Functions. Force Management officers manage the organizational and materiel changes that are fundamental to
Army modernization. These officers are critical to accomplishing the Army’s Title 10 responsibilities of organizing,
manning, training, equipping and supporting land combat forces. FA 50s are highly educated, trusted advisors at all
levels who serve as the subject matter experts on the technical processes of force management. Force Management
officers are experts at Force Development, the process of determining warfighting requirements, designing operational
and institutional force structure, identifying and allocating authorized resources, and analyzing second and third order
effects of changes to requirements, structure and resources; and Force Integration, the integration and synchronization
of Army requirements across the Force Integration functional areas. FA 50 officers are found primarily at Headquarters
Department of the Army DCS, G–3/5/7 and DCS, G–8, the Army Command (ACOM) and Army Service Component
278                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

Commands (ASCC), and the Corps and Division headquarters as well as the Joint Staff and several Joint Command
headquarters.
31–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the basic characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for the 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army
Values and the warrior ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the
spectrum of conflict. They must be able to operate in Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, Multinational (JIIM)
environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army to achieve their objectives. Further explanation of these
characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Functional competencies. Force Management is demanding, challenging and rewarding, providing officers the
opportunity to influence the development of the Army of the future directly. A Force Management officer:
   (1) Designs organizations to support Army and Joint warfighting concepts and doctrine;
   (2) Supports the development of Tables of Organization and Equipment (TOE), Basis-of-Issue Plans (BOIP), and
Manpower Requirements Criteria;
   (3) Determines the structure and composition of Army operating and generating forces through the Total Army
Analysis process;
   (4) Determines manpower and equipment allocations for the planned, programmed, and budgeted forces and related
organizations and equipment within the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) system;
   (5) Develops, allocates, synchronizes documentation and executes organizational authorizations (Modification TOEs
and Tables of Distribution and Allowances); conducts affordability, supportability, and executability assessments; and
monitors and adjusts execution of programs through the concept plan and command plan processes;
   (6) Coordinates activation/inactivation/reorganization of units; develops, processes and analyzes Joint Urgent Opera-
tional Needs Statements and Operational Needs Statements, operates within the Rapid Acquisition Process; and
coordinates and synchronizes the fielding of new equipment and systems;
   (7) Analyzes cost effectiveness of personnel and materiel solutions;
   (8) Analyzes and develops requirements for training programs, training devices and simulations in support of new
systems;
   (9) Determines cost effectiveness and risk mitigation factors associated with establishing the Army’s Program
Objective Memorandum.
   (10) Develops and synchronizes new equipment fielding plans and New Equipment Training (NET).
   c. Required skills. The Force Management functional area requires officers who are skilled in leadership at all
levels; who understand military operations; who possess strong Army Values, leader attributes and skills; and who fully
understand the key leadership actions that must be taken to adapt the Army as change occurs. Force Management
officers also have the technical aptitude necessary to grasp complex, abstract ideas. Force Management officers at all
levels must be able to:
   (1) Operate routinely in high level staff assignments where guidance may be minimal and close interaction with
senior level decision makers is frequent;
   (2) Express their ideas clearly, concisely, and accurately in both oral and written communication;
   (3) Thoroughly develop issues and clearly articulate recommendations and their potential second and third order
effects to senior level decision makers;
   (4) Reduce raw data for effective use by senior level decision makers;
   (5) Organize, integrate, and lead work groups of military and civilian specialists to solve specific force management
problems;
   (6) Conduct innovative research on evolving force management processes or developmental Army systems or
capabilities.
   d. Unique knowledge and skills. To be the Army’s subject matter experts to manage organizational and materiel
change, Force Management officers require detailed knowledge of Army organization, structure, and doctrine. Force
Management officers must:
   (1) Possess a thorough understanding of Army force management processes, gained through specialized education
and training courses and through varied force management assignments at operational and strategic levels of command.
   (2) Understand the organization of the Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve, their Title 10 U.S.C. and
Title 32 U.S.C. responsibilities, and the missions, roles and functions of their major commands.
   (3) Possess a thorough knowledge and understanding of the PPBE system.
   (4) Understand, in broad terms, the organization of the Department of Defense; the principal strategic planning
documents (National Military Strategy, National Defense Strategy, National Security Strategy, Defense Planning
Guidance); joint warfighting concepts; the Joint Strategic Planning System; and the formal and informal procedures and
processes for resourcing the DOD and the Services.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           279

   (5) Understand how national issues, including political, military, economic, social, intergovernmental, and interna-
tional/multinational challenges influence Army and Joint force management.
31–3. Officer development and assignments
   a. Officer Development Model. The Officer Development Model focuses more on encouraging a range and quality
of experience, rather than on specific gates or assignments required to progress. Prior to functional designation, officers
gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important leadership experience in
company grade assignments.
   (1) Functional designation at the 7th year develops both specific and broad functional competencies. FA 50 seeks
officers who are well-grounded in tactical-level planning and who understand the capabilities and limitations of the
Army Operating Force.
   (2) Upon functional designation, the officer should strive for training and assignments that will broaden and develop
the skills necessary to lead the development and modernization of the Army of the future. These broadening
opportunities may be outside one’s normal branch or functional area career development, and may be JIIM in nature.
   (3) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force - regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (4) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   b. Lieutenant and captain development prior to functional designation. Tactical, operational and leadership experi-
ence gained by lieutenants and captains during basic branch assignments serve as the foundation for future effective-
ness as FA 50 officers. Skill identifier (SI) 3R (Force Management) provides a basic familiarity with Army force
management processes. Officers at the rank of captain or higher who are interested in the Force Management functional
area are encouraged to seek out assignments and positions coded for SI 3R. Attending the 4-week Advanced Force
Management Course (AFMC) Course at the Army Force Management School (AFMS) at Fort Belvoir, VA, results in
award of SI 3R.
   c. Functional area qualification and development. The Active Army, Title 10 ARNG AGR, or Title 10 USAR AGR
Force Management officer will typically begin his/her functional area career at HQDA, ARNG Headquarters, or U.S.
Army Reserve Command (USARC) level to provide a solid grounding in Department of the Army force management
processes and to enhance future utility when assigned to units at operational Army level. Following initial assignment,
the Force Management officer should seek to broaden and hone his/her skills, knowledge, and experiences at every
grade. For FA 50 majors and lieutenant colonels, the “1-of-1” positions at division and corps levels are considered to
be particularly important and challenging key developmental assignments. Success depends not on the number or type
of positions held, but rather the quality of duty performance in every assignment. Force Management officers can
increase their expertise and broaden their skill sets by seeking subsequent assignments that alternate between organiza-
tional and materiel orientation and cross echelons between ARSTAF, ACOM, Operational Units (ASCC, Corps,
Division), and Joint levels as they progress through their careers.
   (1) Additional opportunities outside the typical functional area professional development path exist for selected
officers. Pursuing an advanced degree is highly recommended and very desirable anytime in a Force Management
officer’s career. Officers may also apply for the School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) at Fort Leavenworth,
KS.
   (2) Force Managers should also actively pursue Temporary Duty (TDY) opportunities to increase their operational
exposure in major theaters and JIIM experience as well. Officers should ensure that experiences outside traditional
branch or functional area positions, even for short periods, are documented by supervisors in performance evaluations.
   d. Captain development. There are currently no functional area requirements for captains; however, AA captains
desiring to serve in a force management assignment prior to or upon functional designation should work directly with
the Human Resources Command (AHRC) FA 50 career manager concerning options for the last company grade
assignment prior to consideration for promotion to major. The ARNG Title 32 captains desiring entrance into the FA
50 career field should work through their individual State or Territory concerning entrance and assignment into the
ARNG FA 50 career field either as a Title 10 AGR or a Title 32 AGR. After designation, officers will complete the
FA 50 Qualification Course (Q–Course) and be assigned their initial Force Management positions.
   e. Major development. To be considered functionally qualified at the rank of major an officer must complete the
following requirements:
   (1) Education.
   (a) Intermediate Level Education (ILE) Core. The ILE Common Core is a 13.5 week resident course taught by the
Command and General Staff College at selected satellite locations. ILE will prepare field grade officers with a warrior
ethos and warfighting focus for leadership in Army, Joint, multinational, and interagency organizations executing full
spectrum operations.
   (b) The FA 50 Q–Course. All officers (YG 93 and later) designated into FA 50 must complete the FA 50
Qualification Course (Q–Course), which is the FA 50 phase of ILE. Completion of the Q–Course is highly desired
280                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

prior to the initial FA 50 assignment. It should be completed prior to consideration for ACS or Training with Industry
(TWI). The Q–Course includes the 4-week AFMC, which provides an understanding of the logical flow of operational
concepts, requirements determination, capabilities-based assessments, organizational design and documentation, equip-
ment and manpower resourcing, and materiel acquisition and fielding, and an intense 10 week phase which blends the
principles of Army force management with practical exercises on the component systems of force management.
(Officers in YG 92 and earlier are required to complete the 4-week AFMC, and encouraged to take the 10-week phase.)
   (c) The ILE Core Course and the FA 50 Q–Course provide the officer the required training and education for
intermediate career education requirements and Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) 1 qualification. Officers
are expected to complete ILE (core and functional qualification) prior to the 15th year of commissioned service. See
chapter 4 for further discussion of ILE.
   (d) Officers may also complete a brief but focused assignment oriented curriculum to prepare them with the skills
specific to their first assignment in force management.
   (2) KD assignments. Majors, as a minimum, should successfully complete at least 24 months in one or more of the
following key developmental positions:
   (a) Force Modernization Officer/Plans Officer at Division;
   (b) Requirements Synchronization Officer at HQDA, DCS, G–3/5/7;
   (c) Force Management Officer at ACOM/ASCC or HQDA DCS, G–3/5/7 or DCS, G–8;
   (d) System Synchronization Officer at HQDA, DCS, G–8;
   (e) Joint Force Manager at a Joint Command, Joint Staff J8 or at HQDA, DCS, G–8;
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Officers are encouraged to broaden their individual and professional
skills by seeking alternating assignments in positions that vary both in type and echelon of major headquarters and
achieve a balance between strategic and operational levels.
   (a) Opportunities to compete for nominative assignments exist outside of the functional area are available to the
Force Management officer to the extent that the functional area can support. However, the intent of the Army is to
utilize its senior force managers in positions that make the best use of their force management experience.
   (b) FA 50 functional area positions also exist on the Joint Duty Assignment List for major and above. Officers
seeking assignments at the Joint Commands, JCS, or OSD should first successfully complete at least one Army Force
Management assignment, preferably at the DA or ACOM staff level.
   (4) Self-development. The ever-changing nature of Transformation and Army modernization require extensive self-
development by force managers. The FA 50 officers are strongly encouraged to seek out nonresident educational
opportunities offered by the Army and other Services. Officers are also encouraged to embark on a continuous personal
program of professional readings.
   (5) Advanced civilian schooling. The FA 50 majors may compete for a fully funded master’s degree once they are
functional area qualified. Any MA or MS program in a field that supports the work of an Army Force Manager (for
example, Business Administration, Systems Management Administration, Industrial Engineering, Public Policy Admin-
istration, Procurement and Contract Management, and so forth) should be considered. Officers assessed into the ACS
program incur an Active Duty Service Obligation (ADSO) upon completion of their studies, in accordance with AR
350–100. The officer must meet the minimum standards outlined in AR 621–1.
   (6) Fellowships. After becoming functionally qualified, FA 50 majors may compete for any Army-sponsored
fellowship. For example, FA 50 sends one officer a year to serve a 12-month tour with the RAND Arroyo Center in
Alexandria, VA. This fellowship offers the opportunity to conduct in-depth research and analysis on critical force
management issues at Department of the Army and DOD levels, as well as to become a published author. Interested
officers undergo a rigorous interview and selection process to ensure that the best qualified officer represents the force
management community. Upon successful completion of the one-year tour, the officer incurs a three-year commitment.
Officers interested in competing for a Fellowship must meet the requirements outlined in AR 621–7. It will be
advantageous for officers to complete a master’s degree in a primary or associate discipline prior to competing for a
fellowship.
   (7) Desired experience. Majors serve primarily as force management specialists or as individual action officers with
specific focus in force management areas of responsibility. Officers should seek force management assignments that
provide additional breadth to their experiences and skill sets, and should strive to serve in positions that exercise force
development or force integration processes at several levels.
   f. Lieutenant colonel development.
   (1) Education. There are no mandated educational requirements for FA 50s beyond those specified in the CPT/MAJ
development path. Force Managers who are competitive for Senior Service College (SSC) selection should consider the
Industrial College of the Armed Forces. The ICAF’s focus on defense acquisition and strategic resourcing strongly
supports the skills and attributes of a successful Force Manager.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. At the time of this publication, FA 50 does not have any LTC centralized
selection list (CSL) billets. Development and final approval is ongoing. Should the VCSA approve 50A-coded CSL
billets for FA 50 officers, they will be considered key positions for LTCs, otherwise all FA 50 LTC positions are
considered key developmental positions. To be considered qualified at the rank of lieutenant colonel, an officer should
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             281

complete the functional area qualifications for major, and successfully complete at least 24 months in one or more of
the following key developmental positions:
   (a) Force management officer at corps;
   (b) Force developer or force integration officer at ARNG, USARC, Corps, ACOM/ASCC or HQDA, DCS, G–3/5/7
or DCS, G–8;
   (c) Deputy division chief at HQDA, DCS, G–3/5/7 or DCS, G–8;
   (d) Branch or team chief at ACOM/ASCC, HQDA, DCS, G–3/5/7 or DCS, G–8;
   (e) Requirement synchronization officer/system synchronization officer at HQDA, DCS, G–3/5/7 or DCS, G–8;
   (f) Joint Force manager at a Joint Command, Joint Staff, or HQDA, DCS, G–8.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Assignments outside of the functional area exist, as discussed
above, and opportunities to compete for nominative assignments are available to the force management officer to the
extent that the functional area can support. Joint experience, while highly encouraged, is not required for an FA 50
officer to be promoted to colonel. Officers seeking assignment opportunities within the Joint Commands, JCS, or OSD
should first successfully complete at least one Army force management assignment, preferably at the DA or ASCC/
ACOM staff level.
   (4) Self-development.
   (a) All officers are encouraged to possess an advanced degree at this level, and to seek out opportunities for further
personal development as organization managers such as Army and other Service nonresident command and staff or
War College courses.
   (b) Advanced civilian schooling. The FA 50 lieutenant colonels may compete for a fully funded master’s degree
once they are functional area qualified. Officers assessed into the ACS program will incur a 3-year commitment upon
completion of the degree studies. To compete for the ACS program, the officer must meet the minimum standards
outlined in AR 621–1.
   (c) Fellowships. Upon successful completion of at least one FA 50 assignment, officers may compete for any Army-
sponsored fellowship. Interested officers undergo a rigorous interview and selection process to ensure that the best
qualified officer represents the force management community. Upon successful completion of the 1-year tour, the
officer incurs a 3-year commitment. Officers interested in competing for this fellowship must meet the requirements
outlined in AR 621–7. It will be advantageous for officers to complete a master’s degree in a primary or associate
discipline prior to competing for a fellowship.
   (5) Desired experience. Lieutenant colonels serve primarily as force management supervisors and senior action
officers at major commands and HQDA. lieutenant colonels are expected to understand the programmatic underpin-
nings of requirements determination, materiel solutions development, force design, and resource programming and
funding. They guide and review the force management work of subordinates and apply analytical assessment tech-
niques to a wide range of military force management and managerial issues. Officers should seek force management
assignments that provide additional breadth to their experiences and skill sets, and should strive to serve in positions
that exercise force development or force integration processes at several levels.
   g. Colonel development.
   (1) Qualifications. As senior force managers, colonels serve in assignments requiring leadership, technical force
management and managerial skills. They oversee and direct diverse force management efforts and analytical studies to
determine the most feasible force management solutions to combat, Army, Joint, and DOD issues. At the time of this
publication FA 50 does not have any colonel centralized selection list (CSL) billets. Development and final approval is
ongoing. Should the VCSA approve 50A-coded CSL billets for FA 50 officers, they will be considered key positions
for colonels; otherwise all FA 50-coded colonel billets are key developmental assignments. Colonels should have a
broad background in analytical processes, and possess the following qualifications:
   (a) Joint qualified (3A or 3L).
   (b) SSC graduate.
   (c) Serve successfully in an FA 50 colonel functional area authorized position.
   (2) Education. The FA 50 colonels, upon selection, should attend one of the SSCs or one of the many available
fellowships to obtain MEL SSC education status. An officer attending a fellowship should work with the colonels
human resource manager in the Senior Leader Development Division to arrange attendance at JPME–II instruction
either prior to, or after, fellowship attendance.
   (3) Key developmental assignments. Colonels are considered members of the Army Strategic Leadership. The Chief
of Staff’s colonel assignment framework considers recent operational experience, Joint experience, enterprise manage-
ment exposure and experience, and input from the Army Senior Leadership. Army Staff experience is highly desirable.
Experience in multiple geographic venues is encouraged. Officers should work with the colonel human resource
manager to assist them in their career assignments and development. Developmental and broadening assignments
increase officers’ skill sets in preparation for promotion to general officer.
   (4) Self-development. There are a wide variety of schools and professional development opportunities available to
282                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

an officer serving at the grade of colonel. The available list can be accessed at the senior leader Web site at http://
www.srleaders.army.mil or by contacting the human resource manager.
   (5) Desired experiences. The CSA’s guidance for colonel assignments is discussed above. Younger officers, to
prepare themselves to serve at the rank of colonel, should pursue functional area assignments that provide operational,
Joint, and Army Staff/Enterprise level experience.
   h. Life-cycle development model. The model in figure 31-1 shows typical sequences of assignments and training/
education for an active component FA 50 force management officer.
                               Figure 31–1. The AA Life-cycle Development Model for FA 50
31–4. Warrant officer development.
There are no warrant officers managed under functional area 50 in the AA at this time.
31–5. Reserve Component force management officers
   a. General. Reserve Component (RC) Force Management officers in the Title 10 Active Guard and Reserve (AGR)
program in an active status perform the same roles and missions as their AA counterparts. Officers in a Title 32 AGR
program for the Army National Guard or in reserve status, Title 32 M-day for ARNG or in troop program units (TPUs)
for USAR, perform similar but not identical roles as AA FA 50s. The roles and missions Title 32 AGRs, Title 32 M-
day, and TPU FA 50s perform are dependent upon the type and level of the organizations they support. The unique
nature of the reserve status RC officers’ roles as “citizen Soldiers” poses challenges for professional development.
Despite these challenges, RC officers are expected to follow AA officer development patterns as closely as possible,
with the exception that RC officers have increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. To meet
professional development objectives, RC officers in a reserve status (Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve
Title 32 AGR, Title 32 M-day, or TPU) must be willing to, whenever feasible, rotate among ARNG units, TPUs,
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                          283

Individual Ready Reserve, and Individual Mobilization Augmentee programs both within and outside of their respec-
tive components. The AGR professional development assignments are managed separately by each component’s force
programs directorate. However, Title 32 AGR professional development assignments are managed by the individual
States and Territories. Geographical considerations and time on station, as well as the need to provide as many officers
as possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions necessitate these transfers. Every
attempt will be made to assign RC force management officers in developmental positions. Unlike their AA counter-
parts, RC force management officers may have to revert to basic branch assignments to continue their reserve
participation and career development. For guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7.
   b. Assignment opportunities. Title 10 AGR force management officers can expect assignment opportunities that
mirror those of AA officers, as well as positions applicable exclusively to the RC. Title 10 AGR FA 50 officers serve
at all levels within DOD, and must fully understand and be conversant with the roles, missions, and composition of the
RC as an integral component of the Total Army. The success of a Title 10 AGR force management officer is not
measured by length of service in any one component or control group, but by the officer’s breadth of experience, duty
performance, and adherence to functional area requirements. Assignments in FA 50 are available throughout the RC
(AGR, M-day, TPU, and IMA).
   c. Assignment opportunities for RC FA 50s not in Title 10 AGR status. Title 32 AGR, Title 32 M-day, and TPU FA
50s assignment opportunities are not as broad as their Title 10 AGR and AA FA 50 counterparts. Reserve Component
FA 50s are documented in Divisions and Sustainment Commands for ARNG and in Theater Signal Commands and
Sustainment Commands for the USAR. The core of ARNG Title 32 FA 50s can be found at individual State Joint
Force Headquarters, performing duties as assistant force integration and readiness officer (AFIRO) for their State. Title
32 AGR FA 50s are required to belong to a federally recognized ARNG unit where they may serve in a force-
management capacity, per the authorization document or as a basic branch assignment.
   d. Qualification and professional development. The RC force management officers satisfy functional area qualifica-
tion requirements and become competitive for promotion when they attend military schools and then seek assignments
in positions of increased responsibility.
   (1) Qualification. Requirements for qualification depend upon component and status. For RC officers of the USAR
and ARNG in the Title 10 AGR program, functional qualification and professional development requirements are the
same as for AA FA 50 officers as outlined in paragraph 31–3, Officer development. For ARNG FA 50s in Title 32
AGR or M-day status, constructive credit may be used in accordance with AR 310–1 and submitted to the State or
Territory of membership to award the FA 50 area of concentration (AOC). Constructive credit consideration require-
ments are:
   (a) Have completed the 4-week AFMC;
   (b) Have completed the ARNG Force Management Course (two weeks);
   (c) Have accumulated two years of force development/force integration experience in the past 5 years;
   (d) Receive endorsement from the Division Chief, Force Management (NGB–ARF). Requests for constructive credit
award of FA 50 AOC will be made through NGB–ARF to the FA 50 Personnel Development Office.
   (2) Professional development. The following standards listed below must be met for Title 32 AGR, Title 32 M-day,
and TPU FA 50s to be considered qualified for promotion to the next higher rank unless otherwise noted. Length of
service in a given position should not be narrowly construed; key is assignment diversity, level of participation, diverse
experiences and skill set and sufficient time within each assignment to develop competence:
   e. Warrant officer through captain ranks. The ARNG Title 32 warrant officers through captains designated to fill a
FA 50 coded position must attend the 2-week ARNG Force Management Course. Attendance to the 4-week AFMC
will enhance their professional development. Warrant officers through captains have the opportunity to attend force
management training at the AFMS and serve in 50A-coded positions, once they have completed any basic branch
requirements and schooling.
   f. Major.
   (1) Education.
   (a) Majors must successfully complete the Captain Career Course and Common Core ILE Course.
   (b) Complete the 4-week AFMC. Further professional development opportunities include the 10-week phase of the
FA 50 QC and ACS/TWI/RAND fellowships.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Title 32 AGR, Title 32 M-day, and TPU majors as a minimum should
successfully serve in a 50A-coded position preferably for 24 or more months in one or more of the following key

   (3) At the O–4 level, USARC Organizational Integrator is considered the equivalent of battalion executive officer or
battalion S3 positions.
   g. Lieutenant colonel.
   (1) Successfully complete Common Core ILE Course and the AFMC.
   (2) Serve successfully in a LTC grade level, force management position. Optimally qualified officers will have 36
months in a coded 50A position of which 12 months should be in an O–5 position. Key developmental positions are
those at HQDA, Office of the Chief of the Army Reserve, Joint Staff, or United States Army Reserve Command
(USARC) Staff. Civilian Force Management service such as time spent as a career program (CP) 26 Series, Manpower
and Force Management, employee will be taken into consideration. Civilian force management service must be
annotated on the biography submitted to promotion boards.
   (3) Officers are also encouraged to pursue additional non-MEL producing educational opportunities.
   (4) At the O–5 level, Division Chief, Branch Chief, Deputy Director of Force Programs, full-time support and force
development officer at the two-star level at the operational/functional commands are all considered battalion command
equivalent positions.
   h. Colonel.
   (1) Successfully complete ILE and the AFMC.
   (2) Serve successfully in at least one 50A coded position. Preferably, qualified officers will have served 48 months
in 50A positions of which they should serve 12 months in an O–5 50A position as an LTC and 12 months in an O–6
50A position as a colonel. As senior force managers, colonels serve in assignments that require leadership, technical
force management and managerial skills. They should be able to oversee and direct diverse force management efforts.
They should pursue an advanced civilian degree, completion of resident SSC, and potential senior-level fellowships.
   (3) Key developmental positions. Certain jobs for Army Reserve AGR officers are critical for career progression. At
the O–6 level, the Director of Force Programs is considered a brigade command equivalent position.
   i. Life-cycle development model. The RC life-cycle development model for FA 50 officers is shown at figure 31–2.
                                Figure 31–2. The RC Life-cycle Development Model for FA 50

   j. Civilian acquired skills. Many RC officers are qualified force management officers in their civilian profession, but
do not possess FA 50 qualifications. These officers are strongly encouraged to apply for FA 50. The FA 50 Personnel
Development Office, through AHRC–St. Louis is the approval authority for all USAR requests, while NGB–ARF, in
coordination with the States and Territories will be approval authority for all ARNG officer requests. Civilian force
management assignments will be considered as developmental equivalents when qualifying these officers for positions
of increased responsibility.
   k. Reserve Component training participation and credit. See chapter 7.
Chapter 32
Operations Research/Systems Analysis Functional Area (FA 49)
32–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. The ORSA functional area provides uniquely skilled officers that assist decision makers in solving
complex problems by producing the analysis and logical reasoning necessary to inform and underpin critical those
decisions. The ORSAs are an integral part of the Army and Joint leaders’ decisionmaking processes to organize, man,
train, equip, sustain, and resource transformation from the current to the future force and conduct analysis in support of
the Global War on Terror and other war fighting operations.
   b. Proponent information. The FA 49 is managed within the Operations Support functional category. The FA 49
Proponent Office resides in the Program Analysis and Evaluation Directorate, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G–8,
HQDA.
   c. Functions. The FA 49 officer uses analytic methods and mathematically based procedures to enable leadership
decisions in a constantly changing global environment. The ORSAs introduce quantitative and qualitative analysis to
the military’s decisionmaking processes by developing and applying probability models, statistical inference, simula-
tions, optimization and economic models. The ORSA functional area encompasses diverse disciplines that include
personnel management, doctrine and force development, training management, system testing, system acquisition,
decision analysis, and resource management, as well as tactical, operational and strategic planning from division
through combatant command, and from Army Command (ACOM) through the highest levels of the DOD.
32–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army Values
and the warrior ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the spectrum of
conflict. They must be able to operate in Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental and Multinational (JIIM) environments
and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving their objectives. Our officers must be culturally astute and able
to use their awareness and understanding to conduct operations innovatively and courageously to exploit opportunities
in the challenges and complexities of the operational environment. Further explanation of these characteristics can be
referenced in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of an operations research/systems analysis officer. The FA 49 officer integrates
military knowledge and experience with the scientific and managerial fields. They serve as subject matter experts in
designing forces, allocating resources, analyzing effects, performing course of action and trade-off analysis, and they
effectively communicate potential solutions to complex problems to decision makers. The ORSA officer will typically
serve in one of several general assignments as:
   (1) A combat analyst on a division, corps, Army Service Component Commands (ASCCs), or equivalent joint
headquarters staff.
   (2) An analyst on an Army, joint or defense agency staff.
   (3) An analyst in an organization whose principal mission is to provide analysis that supports the organizing,
equipping, manning, training and operations of military forces. Such organizations include Center for Army Analysis
(CAA), TRADOC Analysis Center (TRAC), the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), branch battle labs and
combat development organizations.
   (4) An instructor teaching ORSA and/or mathematics courses at the U.S. Military Academy (USMA), Army
Logistics Management College (ALMC), Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), or Air Force Institute of Technology
(AFIT).
   c. Training/qualification of a functional area 49 officer. The FA 49 officers are expected to maintain a level of
technical expertise in the area of Operations Research and Systems Analysis. This expertise is gained through both
education and experience.
   (1) Qualification for entry into FA 49. Due to the technical nature of FA 49, all Army officers are not qualified to
286                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

move into the functional area. Officers moving into FA 49 are expected to have a background in math, science,
economics, finance or engineering in order to be eligible for FA 49. Those undergraduate disciplines that support this
training are listed in table 32–1. This list is not all inclusive and officers that feel that they have the requisite
background despite not having one of the specified undergraduate degrees can contact the FA 49 assignment officer
and/or the FA 49 proponent for consideration.
   (2) Initial training/education. All ORSA officers are required to learn the basic tools for their trade. This education
comes in one of two forms, completion of ORSA–Military Applications Course (MAC) I or completion of a graduate
degree in a primary or associated field as defined in table 32–2. Even if an officer completes ORSA–MAC, he/she is
expected to continue their education with a goal of gaining a master’s degree.
   (3) Mid-grade military education. All officers junior to YG 1993 are required to complete the ILE Common Core
course and the FA 49 Qualification course. These two courses combine to grant FA 49 officers Military Education
Level ILE (MEL ILE) credit. Unlike the initial training and education received upon entry to the functional area, this
level of education focuses on mid grade level leadership and ORSA-related skills.
   (4) Advanced education. Select FA 49 officers will be afforded the opportunity to obtain additional training or
education. Opportunities for advanced education and training include, but are not limited to, completion of a PhD,
attendance in the School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) and completion of FA 49 related fellowships such as
the Rand Arroyo fellowship.
   (5) Senior Service College. A centralized Army selection board will afford a select number of lieutenant colonels
and colonels the opportunity to attend SSC.
32–3. Officer development
   a. Officer Development Model. The Officer Development Model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation at the 4th or 7th year develops both specific and broad functional competencies.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive for training and assignments
that will broaden and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These broadening opportunities are
outside one’s normal branch or functional area career development, and are JIIM in nature.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so on.
   (6) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   b. Lieutenant development. The FA 49 does not have any LTs.
   c. Captain/junior major development. Officers are selected for FA 49 as captains in their 7th year of service. Before
making the transition to FA 49, officers are to be fully qualified as a captain in their basic branch.
   (1) Prior to an officer’s first ORSA assignment he or she is required to either complete initial ORSA training via
ORSA–MAC I or complete a graduate degree in a primary or associated field as defined in table 32–2. Even if an
officer completes ORSA–MAC, he/she is expected to continue their education with a goal of gaining a masters degree.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. All FA 49 assignments are considered key developmental. Upon completion of
ORSA training FA 49 officers will enter into their first assignment with the goal of mastering their analytic skills.
These assignments are typically in organizations that have senor FA 49 officers able to coach, mentor and teach the
new FA 49 officers. These such assignments include:
   (a) Combat operations analyst in TRAC, CAA, TRADOC schools and centers.
   (b) Manpower or market analysts with Cadet Command, Recruiting Command (USAREC), Accessions Command
(USAAC), Human Resources Command (AHRC), or Army DCS, G–1.
   (c) USMA instructors in math, systems engineering, finance, or economics. The USMA analyst positions such as
those in the Operations Research Center of Excellence (ORCEN) are included. Some of these positions may be coded
as 01A; the coding of the position is not relevant but rather the experience gained in the initial ORSA assignment.
   (d) Test and evaluation analyst with the Army Test and Evaluation Command.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Since FA 49 officers are selected as senior captains, the combina-
tion of their basic branch assignments with their initial ORSA assignment (defined above) provides a sufficiently broad
experience.
   (4) Self-development. Officers without a graduate degree should pursue one though other means such as the
professional development programs offered by TRAC or CAA. Officers should pursue venues to keep current though
programs like the Continuing Education Program offered through ALMC, courses such as the force management
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            287

course, and involvement in professional organizations such as the Military Operations Research Society (MORS), the
Army Operations Research Symposium (AORS), and so forth.
   (5) Desired experience. Upon completion of an officer’s FA 49 assignment, they should have mastered their analytic
skills, be capable of applying those skills to the operational force and be able to lead analytic efforts.
   d. Major development.
   (1) Education. Majors are required to be MEL ILE. This includes ILE or CGSC for officers in year group 1993 and
senior. Officers in year group 1994 and junior are also required to complete the FA 49 Qualification Course. Some
majors will pursue advanced education, as outlined in section 32–2, while they are a major.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. All FA 49 assignments are considered key developmental. In addition, assign-
ments to transition teams (TT) and provincial reconstruction teams (PRT) are considered key developmental positions
for all active component majors.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments.
   (a) Either after completion of a first ORSA assignment or during the latter half of their first assignment, FA 49
officers should seek experience as an ORSA supporting deploying force units. A select group will have to opportunity
to serve as a division or corps ORSA. Those officers that do not serve at the division or corps level should gain
operational experience though individual augmentation to deploying forces, as members of Combatant Commands
(COCOM) or ASCC staffs, as TT/PRT members or in other capacities. Officers commissioned before 1998 may not
have the opportunity to serve in these assignments as many positions did not exist before 2008.
   (b) Once an ORSA officer has completed a first assignment and gained relevant operational experience they are
prepared to serve in ORSA positions of increased responsibility and in positions of leadership. The majority of Army
Staff (ARSTAF) major positions require such ORSA officers. Other assignments of increased responsibility in TRAC,
CAA, USAREC, USAAC, Cadet Command, ATEC, COCOMs, AHRC, USMA, and other organizations. Some officers
will pursue a PhD or fellowship at this point in their career.
   (4) Self-development. Many ORSA officers will attend the ORSA Tactical Operations Course prior to serving in a
deploying force unit. Officers without a graduate degree should continue to pursue one through other means such as the
professional development programs offered by TRAC or CAA. In addition, officers should pursue venues to keep
current through programs like the Continuing Education Program offered through ALMC, courses such as the force
management course and involvement in professional organization such as the MORS, AORS, and so forth.
   (5) Desired experience. The FA 49 officers should have mastered ORSA skills, be operationally relevant, and be
prepared to serve as an ORSA leader.
   e. Lieutenant colonel development.
   (1) Education. Some LTCs will be selected to attend SSC. Some will pursue advanced education, as outlined in
section 32–2, while they are a LTC.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. At the time of this publication FA 49 does not have any LTC centralized
selection list (CSL) billets. Development and final approval is ongoing for fiscal year (FY) 2011 and 2012 CSL.
Should the VCSA approve FA 49 CSL billets for FA 49 officers, they will be considered key developmental for LTCs,
otherwise all FA 49 LTC billets are considered key developmental positions.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. The FA 49 LTCs are expected to serve in positions of increased
responsibility and leadership in the ORSA community. They should serve as leaders on the ARSTAF, the Joint Staff,
in COCOMS, in analysis agencies (such as TRAC and CAA) , in USAREC, U.S. Army Accessions Command
(USAAC), in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Chief of Staff of the Army, the Secretary of the Army, and in
other positions pursuant to their level of expertise and grade.
   (4) Self-development. Many ORSA officers will attend the ORSA Tactical Operations Course prior to serving in a
deploying force unit. Officers without a graduate degree should continue to pursue one through other means such as the
professional development programs offered by TRAC or CAA. In addition officers should pursue venues to keep
current through programs like the Continuing Education Program sponsored by ALMC, courses such as the force
management course and involvement in professional organization such as the MORS, AORS, and so forth.
   (5) Desired experience. The ORSA lieutenant colonels should have served as leaders in the ORSA community and
on high level staffs such as the ARSTAF, JCS, OSD, COCOM, and so forth.
   f. Colonel development.
   (1) Education. All FA 49 colonels are required to have completed a masters degree before being selected for
colonel. While in the grade of colonel, some FA 49 officers will complete SSC.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Effective FY 2010 the following FA 49 billets have been identified as key
billets and will be filled based on an Army centralized selection board. In FY2010: CENTCOM, Chief, Requirements
and Assessments (3 year joint); TRAC–Leavenworth, Senior Military Analyst/Deputy Director (2 year); Center for
Army Analysis, Senior Military Analyst/Deputy Director (2 year) and the Director, Program Analysis and Integration
Office (Corps of Engineers (MNF–I) (1 year deployed). For FY2011: SOCOM, Director of Strategic Planning (3 year
joint); TRAC–White Sands Missile Range, Senior Military Analyst/Deputy Director (2 year); Army Materiel Systems
Analytical Activity, Deputy Director (2 year) and the S Director, Program Analysis and Integration Office (Corps of
Engineers (MNF–I) (1 year deployed).

   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. The FA 49 colonels serve in a variety of positions across the Army
and Department of Defense to include positions not specifically coded for FA 49 but for which an officer is well
suited.
   (4) Self-development. Officers should pursue venues to keep current through programs like the Continuing Educa-
tion Program sponsored by ALMC, courses such as the force management course and involvement in professional
organization such as the MORS, AORS, and so on.
   (5) Desired experience. The FA 49 COLS should be strategic thinkers capable of leading analysis in all JIIM
environments.
                               Figure 32–1. The AA Life-cycle Development Model for FA 49
32–4. Warrant officer development
The FA 49 does not have warrant officers.
32–5. Reserve Component officers
   a. General. The Reserve Component ORSA officers fulfill similar roles and missions as their Active Army
counterparts. The range and scope of possible RC assignments is somewhat more limited than those found within the
AA, due, in part, to differences in force structure and partly because there are no RC organizations comparable to the
TRADOC Analysis Center or the Center for Army Analysis. Nevertheless, every attempt will be made to assign RC
ORSA officers either in FA 49 or branch/functional area generalist positions, given available opportunity. Unlike their
AA counterparts, RC ORSA officers may be expected to revert to basic branch assignments to continue reserve
participation and career development. For additional guidance on RC officer development, see chapter 7.
   b. Assignment opportunities. The Reserve Component ORSA assignments are similar to AA assignments with a few
exceptions. Generally, Army Reserve (USAR) entry-level positions are in the accessions system area. The USAR
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                         289

analysts have two other areas of activity in which to gain experience toward becoming a well-rounded senior analyst.
The first is in resourcing and represents all assignments relevant to the planning, programming, budgeting and
execution (PPBE) process. The second is in the operations, plans, and doctrine area, which include operational
deployments, COCOM and USARC assignments, and basic branch/branch generalist assignments relevant to strategy
and doctrine development. The ARNG analysts are primarily assigned to organizations in the National Capital Region
and to ARNG staffs.
   (1) Captains. The USAR entry-level positions include several captain billets, most managed under the AGR
Program. Almost all USAR captains serve as analysts at USAREC Headquarters. They are supervised and mentored by
senior civilian analysts, work alongside their AA peers, and complete their tours prepared for personnel, strength
management, or accessions system policy assignments at USARC, USAAC, OCAR, ARCD, AHRC, and HQDA.
   (2) Majors/lieutenant colonels. Most Reserve Component ORSA positions are field grade and are governed by the
IMA and AGR programs, and most authorizations for senior majors and above are in the National Capital Region. Two
ARNG ORSA majors are authorized for the Division, Corps and Army Headquarters staff.
   (3) Colonels. There are few colonel positions and senior analysts should seek branch/functional area generalist
positions. Colonels should maintain broad perspectives and should seek experience throughout the analytical
community.
   c. Mobilization. Significant numbers of mobilization requirements exist for FA 49 qualified officers. AHRC man-
ages pre-trained individual manpower to fill shortfalls in Regular Army, Army Reserve and Army National Guard units
using officers assigned to the Individual Ready Reserve.
   d. Qualification and professional development. The RC ORSA officers satisfy functional area qualification require-
ments and become competitive for promotion when they attend military schools and serve in positions of increased
responsibility. The following standards must be met to be considered qualified for promotion to the next higher rank
unless otherwise noted (length of service in a given position should not be narrowly construed; key is assignment
diversity, level of participation, and sufficient time within each assignment to develop competence):
   (1) Captain development.
   (a) Successfully complete basic branch captains Officer Education System (OES) courses (either AA or RC
curriculum).
   (b) Serve in at least one basic branch position for a minimum of 24 months to gain the requisite skills and
experiences required by their basic branch
   (c) Complete ORSA MAC or obtain a master’s degree in a primary or associated ORSA discipline listed in table
32–2.
   (d) Serve in at least one entry-level ORSA position at least 24 months.
   (e) Advanced civilian schooling is available to both captains and majors, but Naval Postgraduate School is the only
fully funded ACS opportunity, and these opportunities are limited. Officers should develop a plan to obtain a relevant
master’s degree.
   (2) Major development.
   (a) All officers in the primary zone for the LTC Selection Board in September 2010 or later are required to
complete the FA 49 Qualification Course and the ILE Common Core Course to successfully complete ILE require-
ments. The FA 49 Qualification Course is designed to prepare field grade officers to serve successfully in FA 49
positions on Army and Joint Staffs.
   (b) Serve a minimum of 24 months in at least one ORSA position. Best-qualified officers will serve 36 or more
months in ORSA positions.
   (c) Continue development through continuing education program (CEP) or various civilian education venues with
the ultimate goal of obtaining a master’s degree in a primary or associated ORSA discipline listed in table 32–2. A
master’s degree is not a requirement for promotion to lieutenant colonel, but is highly encouraged. Some assignments,
including HQDA Staff and OSD, may require a master’s degree in an ORSA discipline.
   (d) If a second ORSA assignment is not available, serve a minimum of 36 months in a branch/functional area
generalist or basic branch position. AGR officers will be single tracked FA 49 to the maximum extent possible.
   (3) Lieutenant colonel development.
   (a) Serve a minimum of 6 years at the field grade level in an ORSA position. Time spent obtaining a masters degree
listed in table 32–2 as a full time duty may be included as part of the 6-year minimum. Civilian ORSA service, such as
time spent as a GS 1515 series employee, will be considered towards meeting the 6-year minimum as well. Civilian
ORSA service must be annotated on the biography submitted to promotion boards.
   (b) Be selected for Senior Service College.
   (4) Colonel development.
   (a) Serve in at least one ORSA position for a minimum of 24 months.
   (b) As senior analysts, colonels serve in assignments that require both technical and managerial skills. They should
be able to oversee and direct diverse studies and analytical efforts. Colonels should have a broad background in
290                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

analysis throughout the Army, having served in a variety of different FA 49 authorizations in previous field grade
assignments.
   e. Life-cycle development model. The Reserve Component life-cycle development model for FA 49 officers is shown
at figure 32–2.
   f. Civilian acquired skills. Many Reserve Component officers possess education and/or work experience through
their civilian profession comparable to that of ORSA officers but are not designated FA 49. These officers are strongly
encouraged to seek FA 49 designation through AHRC. Civilian ORSA-related work experience will be considered for
developmental equivalency when qualifying these officers for positions of increased responsibility.
   g. Reserve Component training participation and credit. See chapter 7.
   (1) Captain Career Course required for promotion to major.
   (2) ILE: must complete Common Core for promotion to LTC. The LEDC counts as 50 percent completion of
CGSC.

Academy Professor Functional Area (FA 47)
33–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. Functional area 47 is a dual functional area. Professor, USMA, area of concentration (AOC) 47A and
Academy Professor AOC 47* (asterisk denotes all Academy Professor AOCs). Functional area 47 includes committee-
recommended officers appointed for the purpose of leading and administering the academic programs at the United
States Military Academy (USMA). These officers serve as the senior military and academic leaders of the academic
organization.
   b. Proponent information. Superintendent, United States Military Academy, MAAG–PM, West Point, New York
   c. Functions of the Academy Professor.
   (1) Professor USMA (47A). These officers serve as the senior military and academic leaders of the academic
organization. They directly supervise Academy Professors (47*) other senior military and civilian professors. Title 10,
USC, governs the selection and establishment of professors, USMA, including the Dean of the Academic Board, the
Vice Dean for Education, and 28 Head of Department PUSMAs and 28 Deputy Department heads. Professors, USMA,
who are heads of departments, command (less UCMJ authority) their respective departments. The professors, USMA,
perform all duties stated in paragraph 33–1b below. In addition, they provide long-term stability to the education
programs at USMA to insure accreditation standards and continuity are maintained. As members of the Academic
Board they advise the Superintendent on major policy changes, recommend separation of cadets, and authorize the
awarding of diplomas. A 47A at the United States Military Academy who has over 36 years of Service is entitled to
receive additional compensation in accordance with 10 USC. This additional pay may not be used in the computation
of retired pay.
   (2) Academy Professors (47*). Academy Professors serve as military and academic leaders of the USMA faculty
and the United States Army Preparatory School (Commandant/Dean). Academy Professors are a critical link between
the senior academic leaders and the civilian and rotating faculty and staff. Academy Professors directly lead and
supervise the assigned faculty and perform the general duties identified in paragraphs 33–1b and 33–1c, below.
   d. Unique functions performed by the academy professor functional area. The USMA-stabilized military faculty
provides military and academic leadership to USMA’s academic departments composed of stabilized military faculty,
Army, and other Service officers on a two or three year USMA assignment, and civilian faculty hired in accordance
with 10 USC, and professional staff. They are highly successful and experienced military officers and are outstanding
educators with doctorates (ACS) in one of the academic areas offered at USMA. Stabilized military faculty members
contribute to formulation of USMA’s curriculum, methods of instruction, and academic standards required for gradua-
tion; establish standards within academic departments for classroom instruction; guide and mentor faculty development,
professionalism, and academic accomplishment; educate, train and inspire cadets within areas of academic expertise;
provide continuity to the academic program; serve as a source of experience and academic depth to the rotating and
civilian faculty; participate in USMA governance by serving on bodies such as the Academic Board, Installation
Planning Board, Admissions Committee, and accreditation committees; select officers to be sponsored for graduate
schooling prior to a teaching assignment at USMA; maintain academic currency by research, writing, and involvement
with professional education or academic specialty organizations; maintain military professional currency in a variety of
ways, including operational deployments with Army troop units and conducting outreach activities in support of the
Army; contribute to cadet development by supporting athletic and extracurricular activities at USMA; and contribute to
officer development by counseling and mentoring.
   e. Selection process. The FA 47 positions exist only at the United States Military Academy and United States
Military Academy Preparatory School. These positions are filled through a search committee process. The FA 47
vacancies are advertised in the Army Times newspaper (worldwide), on various computer bulletin boards, and
computer web sites to include the USMA Adjutant General home page (http://www.usma.edu/adjutantgeneral). The
advertisement will include specific criteria that an officer must meet to be considered for appointment. Applications are
forwarded to a selection committee composed of both stabilized and rotating faculty members, civilian faculty, and in
some cases, representatives appointed by HQDA. The committee considers all applicants; evaluating the breadth of the
applicant’s military experience, depth achieved in military specialties and evidence of leadership. A list of the top
qualified applicants is forwarded to the Dean of the Academic Board, to the Superintendent, and to the USMA
Academic Board. The Academic Board will make a final recommendation. Professor, USMA (47A) appointments
require presidential nomination and congressional approval. HQDA has approval authority for Academy Professors
(47*).

successful completion of ILE. They must also complete a Ph.D. in an appropriate discipline and have the appropriate
296                                       DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

professional experience to engage in teaching activities at the undergraduate level. The goal of the FA 47 developmen-
tal process is to maintain a faculty, sensitive to both Army needs and academic standards, which supports the USMA
mission to provide the Army with commissioned leaders of character.
   b. Captain development. There are no FA 47 authorizations at the grade of CPT.
   c. Major development. There are no authorized FA 47 positions at the grade of major. However, officers selected for
Academy Professor positions while in the grade of major must focus on earning a Ph.D.
   d. Lieutenant colonel development. Lieutenant colonels are generally assigned within their respective organizations
to significant academic, administrative, and leadership positions such as program directors, division chiefs, and
directors of centers of excellence. Lieutenant colonels with a Ph.D. are considered eligible to compete for promotion to
colonel.
   e. Colonel development. Colonels are generally assigned within their respective organizations to significant academ-
ic, administrative, and leadership positions such as program directors, division chiefs, and directors of centers of
excellence.
   f. Academic advancement. Orderly progression for USMA stabilized faculty includes completing military schooling;
training with military units; completing a Ph.D. not later than 3 years following assignment to as an Academy
Professor; teaching; developing and implementing courses, programs, and curricula; assessment; conducting research
and participating in scholarly activities; and conducting research activities in support of the Army. The central focus of
orderly progression and academic promotion is development in the five domains of teaching, scholarship, service, cadet
development, and faculty development. Conducting research and participating in scholarly activities provide continued
growth and development opportunities within the officer’s selected academic discipline. Outreach activities in support
of the Army provide continued military growth and professional development opportunities within the officer’s selected
academic discipline. FA 47 officers are not considered for selection by Army competitive boards for attendance at
SSC. The Dean of the Academic Board has developed a military schooling program that provides SSC opportunities
for USMA stabilized faculty. USMA stabilized faculty performs outreach Service, to include Service with Army
laboratories and consultation with HQDA and DOD agencies, related to their academic and military expertise and
special duty with units in the Army. USMA stabilized faculty members normally retain their faculty positions until
retirement and follow a career pattern that is necessarily directed toward academics, teaching, and research. These
activities are necessary to ensure that the stabilized faculty continues to develop mastery of their academic disciplines
and possesses the latest, as well as emerging techniques and information.
   g. Tenure. Duration of stabilized faculty assignment is through mandatory retirement for Academy Professors (28
years for lieutenant colonels and 30 years for colonels) and for Professors, USMA (age 64).
   h. Branch/FA generalist assignments. FA 47 officers do not serve in branch/FA generalist assignments.
   i. Joint assignments. FA 47 officers do not serve in Joint assignments.

Simulation Operations Functional Area (FA 57)
34–1. Unique features of Simulation Operations functional area
   a. Unique purpose of Simulation Operations functional area. To provide the Army with a cadre of operationally
experienced, technically proficient officers who are well versed in the application of modeling and simulation
environments, battle command and knowledge management principles, systems and services in support of full spectrum
training and operations today and in the foreseeable future. Simulation Operations (FA 57) proponency falls within the
Operations Support functional category within OPMS. The HQDA DCS, G–8 is the proponent for Simulation
Operations (FA 57).
   b. Unique functions performed by the Simulation Operations functional area. The Simulation Operations functional
area supports the Army by providing highly skilled officers capable in the development, delivery and integration of
complex live, virtual and constructive training environments (LVC–TE) with current Army battle command systems
298                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

(ABCS), gaming technologies and knowledge management principles. FA 57 provides the Army with experts in full
spectrum training and operations.
   c. Unique features of work in the Simulation Operations functional area. FA 57 officers work at all levels of the
Army and perform many of the following types of functions and tasks:
   (1) Train staffs at all levels of command; Army, joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational (JIIM)
using simulations, battle command and knowledge management systems, tools and environments.
   (2) Act as Battle Command Officers (BCO) in brigade combat teams (BCTs), focused on developing the information
environments that fuse and synchronize data, information, knowledge, and experience to assist the commander’s
decision making and battlefield visualization.
   (3) Integrate battle command systems and architectures with existing simulations to create suitable environments for
full spectrum training and operations.
   (4) Develop and integrate current and future knowledge management principles and processes into Army institu-
tional and operational units.
   (5) Identify new and emerging methods of using modeling and simulations in support of training and operations at
all levels of the Army.
   (6) Develop doctrine, organizations and equipment for the FA 57 mission area.
   (7) Support service schools and Combat Training Centers (CTC’s) with the most current training and operational
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
   (8) Provide simulation subject matter expertise within the TEMO, RDA and ACR domains.
34–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. General. The Simulation Operations functional area requires officers who embody the warrior ethos that under-
stand how to employ the latest battle command and knowledge management principles and systems in support of
military training and operations. An FA 57 is a leader with deep operational experience steeped in doctrinal knowledge,
tactics, techniques and procedures; a dynamic, competent, agile and adaptive thinker who is comfortable with technol-
ogy and is effective in creating, integrating, managing and leading.
   b. Competencies and actions common to all. Army officers must be warfighters who can effectively apply the four
core dimensions of leadership: values, attributes, skills, and actions (for additional discussion of these leadership
dimensions, see FM 6–22). The four core leadership dimensions provide the basis for what a leader must be, know, and
do. The values and attributes set the basis for the character of the leader — what a leader must be. The skills developed
by leaders establish his or her competence — what a leader must know. The actions that leaders conduct and execute
constitute leadership — what a leader must do. The leadership framework describes a leader of character and
competence who acts to achieve excellence across the spectrum of operations from total war, to operations other than
war, to disaster relief and in times of peace.
   (1) Leader values. Values are at the core of everything the Army is and does. The Army is an institution of people
with unique and enduring values. These values must be a part of the men and women—officer, enlisted, and civilian
personnel—who are the Army. These values provide the sense of purpose necessary to sustain our Soldiers in combat
and help resolve ambiguities in operations other than war. There are seven Army Values (LDRSHIP).
   (a) Loyalty. Bear true faith and allegiance to the U.S. Constitution, the Army, your unit and other Soldiers.
   (b) Duty. Fulfill your obligations.
   (c) Respect. Treat people as they should be treated.
   (d) Selfless-service. Put the welfare of the nation, the Army and your subordinates before your own.
   (e) Honor. Live up to all the Army Values.
   (f) Integrity. Do what’s right, legally and morally.
   (g) Personal courage. Face fear, danger or adversity (physical or moral) with the spirit and determination of a
warfighter.
   (2) Leader attributes. Attributes are fundamental qualities and characteristics. Attributes assist in defining what an
officer should be and contribute to leader actions. Army leader attributes are described in three categories — mental,
physical and emotional.
   (a) Mental attributes describe aptitudes and capacities for learning that leaders should possess and develop. Included
in this category are will, self-discipline, initiative, judgment, confidence, intelligence and cultural awareness.
   (b) Physical attributes specify physical dispositions or aptitudes that can be nurtured and developed. Included in this
category are health fitness, physical fitness, stamina, military bearing and professional bearing.
   (c) Emotional attributes are those affective aptitudes or capacities that contribute to how one feels and substantially
contribute to leadership. Included in this category are self-control, balance, and stability.
   (3) Leader skills. Skills are synonymous with competencies. They are abilities or competencies that one develops
and uses with people, with ideas and with things. Competence is of primary importance for all Army officers. The
Army recognizes that officers must develop four types of skills.
   (a) Interpersonal skills reflect competence in communicating with people.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            299

   (b) Conceptual skills refer to competence in handling ideas.
   (c) Technical skills reflect competence with things.
   (d) Tactical skills refer to the ability to put together technical, interpersonal, and conceptual skills and apply them to
warfighting tasks.
   (4) Leader actions. Officers provide purpose, direction and motivation as they influence their subordinates, operate
to accomplish their mission and strive to improve their unit or organization. Leader actions are how Army officers act
to achieve excellence and get the job done. These actions are applicable across all levels of leadership.
   (a) Influencing refers to the use of appropriate people skills to guide subordinates or teams toward mission
accomplishment. Influencing subdivides into communicating, decisionmaking, and motivating.
   (b) Operating or accomplishing the mission refers to the relative short term actions of getting the job done.
Operating subdivides into planning, executing and assessing.
   (c) Improving refers to the long-term investment-type actions essential to improving everything the leader influ-
ences. Improving subdivides into developing (people), building (teams) and learning.
   c. Unique skills.
   (1) Tactical and technical skills. The FA 57s are officers who are operationally seasoned and possess technical
proficiency with modeling and simulation tools, battle command and knowledge management systems. They enhance
battle command and knowledge management processes by their unique ability to translate the commander’s require-
ments and intent into training and operational solutions using technology, if required, to accomplish the mission. FA
57s have the skills to develop complex environments using live, virtual, constructive and gaming tools and concepts to
support training, acquisition, testing, experimentation and analysis within the Army. They have the skills needed to
assist in the refinement of current simulations and for the development of the Army’s future simulation needs. FA 57
officers understand physical, mathematical, logical and process modeling, and when their use is appropriate. They have
the ability to implement simulation architectures sufficiently to stimulate battle command and knowledge management
systems. As BCOs, FA 57s integrate ABCS into the unit military decision making process, build and maintain
information knowledge architectures for the commander and assist in the information and knowledge transfer within
the command post by establishing and managing the commander’s common operating picture. They effortlessly move
between the training and operations, supporting both concurrently. These skills are gained and developed through
operational assignments and continuous professional study and self-development. FA 57s understand the complexities
of net-centric warfare. They are able to fully exploit technology to transform information into a tactical, operational
and/or strategic advantage while simultaneously integrating organizations and processes. FA 57s are flexible, agile and
adaptive.
   (2) Tactical competence. FA 57 officers are students of current operations. They display proficiency in the required
professional knowledge, skills and abilities of a leader in combat. They understand current Army and joint doctrine and
use that knowledge to solve and defend recommendations for tactical, operational and strategic problems. As BCOs,
they use their understanding of current operations to create the environment that provides the commander with
knowledge and information superiority.
   (3) Conceptual competence. FA 57 officers are mentally responsive, flexible and adaptive. They possess the ability
to synthesize and clearly communicate complex information in a timely manner. The chaotic conditions surrounding
military operations demand mental endurance and agility often under severe conditions and time constraints. FA 57
officers think quickly and act decisively. Through experience they have effectively developed the ability to communi-
cate the capabilities that they can provide commanders under any given set of circumstances.
   (4) Interpersonal competence. FA 57 officers are part of a combined arms team. They continuously interact with
both technical and operational experts. They are comfortable receiving guidance from multiple competing bosses to
accomplish the mission. FA 57 officers simultaneously belong to many teams. FA 57s are successful because of their
ability to communicate clearly, concisely and accurately, both orally and in writing, at the appropriate level, to both
their superiors and teammates.
   (5) Technical competence. FA 57 officers are comfortable working in, around and with new and existing tech-
nologies. They are able to translate complex technical material and situations into operational language and concepts
easily understood by the commander and his staff. Their technical knowledge and understanding of modeling and
simulations, battle command systems and knowledge management principles allows them to act as the interface
between the technical and tactical/operational/strategic worlds in which they operate.
   (6) Decisionmaking skills. FA 57 officers may work independently, behind the scenes with little or no direct
guidance. They are problem solvers who take their commander’s intent and formulate it into solutions and environ-
ments utilized for training and decision making. The ability to make timely decisions in ambiguous situations comes
from the individual officer’s confidence in his or her abilities and the training they receive.
   d. Unique knowledge. FA 57 officers:
   (1) Are familiar with organization, structure and doctrine of the Army, Department of Defense, joint, interagency,
multinational and commercial simulation activities.
   (2) Possess expertise, conceptual understanding, and knowledge of the uses of models and simulations to support

military units and staffs at all levels in planning and executing realistic training through the use of live, virtual,
constructive and game driven simulation environments.
   (3) Understand how to design and implement unique simulation/C4I system federations to support training, exercises
and military operations.
   (4) Are knowledgeable on how to best employ and integrate ABCS in support of operations.
   (5) Understand how to maximize and distribute organizational knowledge using the unique ABCS and knowledge
management systems available.
   (6) Understand how to design and develop the environments that support experiments to test battle command
configurations, C3I design concepts, doctrinal techniques, and so forth.
   (7) Understand the capabilities and limitations of technologies as they are applied to unique training, testing,
experimentation and operational problems.
   (8) Understand DOD, Joint and Army policies that govern the development and use of simulations.
   e. Unique attributes. FA 57 officers:
   (1) Understand how best to leverage new and emerging modeling and simulations, battle command and knowledge
management systems, techniques and technologies in support of organizational training and operations.
   (2) Are self-starters confident in their knowledge of Army operations and the use of technology to support
operations.
   (3) Display systems management skills and the ability to understand, monitor and improve systems.
   (4) Work and excel in dynamic, complex, high-tempo environments performing functions that are counter-intuitive
to the majority of their peers/superiors.
   (5) Integrate technology with training principles when necessary to accomplish the mission/task.
   (6) Are familiar with the requirements involved in the integration of software, hardware, networks and communica-
tions that support training and operations.
   (7) Are agile, adaptive, inquisitive thinkers who possess the ability to conduct research and present information in a
clear and concise manner.
   (8) Are comfortable analyzing and solving complex technical problems.
   (9) Demonstrate intellectual honesty with superiors.
   (10) Translate complex technical concepts and terms into language that the tactical warfighting commander/operator
understands.

most senior levels of the Army and the Department of Defense.
   (5) Additional factors. The professional development objective for colonels is greater contribution to the functional
area and the Army.
34–4. Assignment preferences and precedence.
   a. Preferences. The Simulation Operations functional area has diverse career development path opportunities. The
goal of the professional development of FA 57 officers is to produce a talented group of officers who have developed
operationally as simulation, battle command and knowledge management specialists. Additionally, functional area
assignments will provide continual development of an FA 57 officer’s skills and abilities in order to prepare them for
positions of greater leadership and responsibility in the branch and in the Army. Requests from FA 57 officers for
assignments that do not contribute directly to this goal must be fully justified and approved.
   b. Precedence. All positions will be filled in accordance with Department of the Army manning guidance and
operational priorities. All officers will attend the Simulation Operations Course prior to their initial FA 57 assignments.
Completion of the Battle Command Officer Integration Course is required prior to battle command or knowledge
management officer assignments. Some FA 57 billets are designated as requiring advanced education. Generally,
officers assigned to those assignments will have completed the necessary education requirements.
34–5. Duration of critical officer life-cycle assignments
   a. Key Simulation Operations functional area qualification positions. Functional area qualification for FA 57
officers is defined by grade, as stated above.
   b. Simulation Operations functional area life-cycle model. Figure 34-1, below, displays a FA 57 functional area time
line with qualifying developmental and utilization assignments.
34–6. Requirements authorizations and inventory
   a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for FA 57 functional area officers. To do this, the field
grade inventory must be optimized in order to meet functional area authorizations.
   b. OPMS implementation. The numbers of authorized FA 57 billets, by grade, will vary as force structure decisions
are made and implemented. Officers desiring more information on FA 57 authorizations and inventory are encouraged
to contact the DCS, G–8 Simulation Proponent Division or the Human Resources Command, FA 57 Career Manager/
Assignments Officer.
34–7. Key life-cycle initiatives for Simulation Operations
   a. Structure. The FA 57 force structure has developed significantly in the last several years, and will see continued
growth through FY 13, primarily in the Operational Army.
   b. Acquire. Captains will be functionally designated into the Simulation Operations functional area at their seventh
year of service. Majors and lieutenant colonels may opt to become FA 57 officers through branch transfer and call/
                                              DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           303

recall to Active Duty requests in accordance with U.S. Army Human Resources Command (AHRC) procedures and
guidelines (see AHRC Web site).
   c. Distribute. The FA 57 (Simulation Operations) Career Manager/Assignments Officer within AHRC, and the
Functional Area Assignments Officer at the colonels, Senior Leader Development (SLD) Branch, manage FA 57
assignments. FA 57 assignments to Advanced Civilian Schooling, TWI, fellowships and branch/functional area devel-
opmental positions are based upon Army requirements/priorities, officer skills, experience, and officer preferences at
the time of assignment.
   d. Deploy. Simulation Operations officers are Soldiers who remain prepared to deploy worldwide at all times.
Whether assigned to deploying MTOE units with high levels of readiness or TDA organizations, all FA 57 officers
must maintain both operational and branch-specific skills to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of military
operations. FA 57 officers will deploy with assigned units in the course of normal operations, or as individuals to
support joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping missions.
   e. Sustain. Organizational requirements and continuing. OPMS evolution will determine future FA 57 officer career
development and structure.
   (1) Promotion. FA 57 functional area officers compete for promotion within the Operations Support functional
category. Promotion numbers and percentages reflect Army and functional area requirements that select the best
qualified, agile, and adaptive leaders able to meet future Army requirements.
   (2) Officer Evaluation Report (OER). The OER will reinforce the linkage between officer development and OPMS.
Starting with captain, the rater and senior rater will recommend on the officer’s OER, the career field which best suits
his or her abilities and interests.
   f. Develop. FA 57 offers diversity for both assignment opportunities and professional development. The increasing
complexity of the technical skills required mandates that some officers attend advanced civilian schooling or Training
with Industry. Officer development will continue to occur through a methodical sequence of progressive assignments as
listed in para 34–3. Self-development continues to be an essential component of officer development.
   g. Separate. FA 57 officers separate from the Army in accordance with applicable regulatory guidance.
                                         Figure 34–1. The AA Developmental Model

34–8. Simulation Operations Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. Reserve Component (RC) describes both the ARNG and USAR and, unless
otherwise indicated, references to the RC are applicable to both. The RC Simulation Operations officer development
objectives shall follow the AA officer development pattern as closely as possible. However, the unique nature of the
RC Soldier’s role as a “citizen Soldier” poses a significant challenge for professional development. Due to the
complexity and detailed understanding of Army systems and functions required to serve effectively in this functional
area, junior officers must develop a strong foundation through assignments in their basic branch before functional area
specialization begins (see chapter 7 for more guidance on RC officer development).
   b. Assignment opportunities. The RC Simulation Operations officers can expect assignment opportunities that mirror
those of AA officers as well as those positions applicable exclusively to the Reserve Component. The success of an RC
Simulation Operations officer is not measured by length of service in any one component or control group, but by the
officer’s breadth and depth of experience, duty performance, and adherence to functional area requirements. Although
Simulation Operations assignments for the ARNG are MTOE while USAR are primarily TDA or troop program units
(TPUs) within Battle Command Training Divisions; there are positions for Active Guard Reserve (AGR) and DIMA
personnel. Civilian acquired skills, advanced military and civilian education, and demonstrated abilities to function in a
simulation environment are highly desirable for assignment to any RC FA 57 position.
   c. Functional area qualification and development opportunities.
   (1) The unique nature of the RC Soldier’s role as a “citizen Soldier” poses a challenge for professional development.
RC officers are expected to follow AA officer’s development patterns as closely as possible, except that RC officers
have increased windows to complete mandatory educational requirements. To meet professional development objec-
tives, RC officers must be willing to rotate between ARNG and USAR TPU, Individual Ready Reserve, IMA Program,
and the AGR programs. These transfers are necessitated by geographical considerations, as well as the need to provide
as many officers as possible the opportunity to serve with troops in leadership and staff positions. Additionally, there
may be occasions when RC officers will be transferred to the IRR while they complete mandatory education
requirements. Such transfers will be temporary and should not be seen as impacting negatively on the officer’s career.
RC FA 57 officers assigned to these -positions must continually develop their knowledge and analytical skills. RC
officers awarded FA 57 will be offered the opportunity to pursue continuing education opportunities (civilian and
military), and government internship programs.
   (2) Captain. NA
   (3) Major.
   (a) Education. Successfully complete the Captain Career Course (CCC) and not less than 50 percent Common Core
Intermediate Level Education (ILE–CC) Course.
   (b) Assignments. Could include Simulation Training Officer and Operations Officer positions within Battle Projec-
tion Groups. Upon assignment to a FA 57 position, the Simulation Operations Course and Battle Command Officer
Integration Course must be completed, if not previously completed and serve in a FA 57 position for twelve months.
   (c) Self-development. In addition, officers should strive to obtain advanced civilian schooling compatible with FA
57 position requirements.
   (d) Desired experience. Successfully completion of branch, functional area or broadening assignments prior to
consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel.
   (e) Additional factors. The objective of major professional development is through key RC developmental assign-
ments; continuous professional study and self-development, distance learning and attendance at professional forums/

Logistics Corps Officer Branches
35–1. Introduction to the Logistics Corps
The Logistics Corps consists of Soldiers (officers, warrant officers, and enlisted) in the historical Quartermaster,
Ordnance, and Transportation regiments, as well as the new multifunctional Logistics branch, and the civilians who
work in the various logistics career fields. The technical skills of our enlisted Soldiers, noncommissioned officers,
warrant officers, and lieutenants remain consistent with the transformed Army and the continued need for functional
expertise. This chapter explains how logistics officers are accessed, assigned, and professionally developed, as well as
describes the skills, knowledge, and attributes needed for officers to succeed in today’s Army as versatile logistics
leaders.
   a. History and background. Army logistics dates back to the early days of the American Revolution with the
establishment of the Quartermaster Department in June 1775. The Ordnance Department followed during the War of
1812. World War II saw the creation of the Transportation Corps in July 1942. These three branches, and their
306                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

supporting civilians, have long, distinguished records of superior service and are vital components of the total Army
force structure. In 1993, FA 90 was created within the Operations Career Field in order to support the development of
multifunctional logisticians. Since then, the FA 90 designation has been used to signify officers skilled across the
functional logistics branches. In 2005, as part of an OPMS review, an effort was undertaken to examine how to further
advance the notion of multifunctional logistics leaders. The result was the creation of a Logistics branch for officers in
the grade of captain through colonel and the formal recognition of a “Logistics Officer Corps” as approved by the
Army Chief of Staff in May 2006. The Logistics branch official establishment date was 1 January 2008.
   b. Logistics Officer Corps concept. “Logistics Officer Corps” is the term used to describe all officers (commissioned
and warrant) who hold a branch or MOS within the Logistics Corps. Commissioned officers accessed as lieutenants
into one of the three Logistics Corps functional branches (Ordnance, Quartermaster, Transportation) will develop these
functional branch skills for the first 3-4 years of their careers. Upon promotion to captain and successful completion of
the Combined Logistics Captain Career Course (CLC3), officers will be inducted into the Logistics branch. Their
original functional branch (Ordnance, Quartermaster, or Transportation) will become the secondary area of concentra-
tion (AOC) and will qualify them for those types of functional assignments. Logistics knowledge, expertise and
development have primacy over individual skills within the Ordnance, Quartermaster and Transportation fields. As the
Logistics Corps technical experts, warrant officers will only have functional specialties. All four Logistics Corps officer
branches are in the force sustainment functional category. *EOD officers will hold 89E as their primary AOC and 91A
as their secondary AOC until revocation of their volunteer statement.
   c. Chapter organization. This chapter is organized into an introductory section and four branch sections. The
Commanding General, U.S. Army Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM) is the proponent for this chapter
and the Logistics branch section. The Ordnance, Quartermaster, and Transportation branch proponents are responsible
for their particular sections within this chapter.
35–2. Logistics Branch
   a. Purpose. Logistics branch officers plan, integrate, and direct all types of sustainment activities in order to operate
effectively on the modern battlefield enabling Army forces to initiate and sustain full spectrum operations. The nature
of warfare in the 21st century operating environment mandates that Logistics branch officers maintain competence in all
facets of logistics; therefore, the Logistics branch merges Ordnance, Quartermaster and Transportation basic branch
officers into one unified branch at the rank of captain.
   b. Proponent information. The Commanding General, U.S. Army Combined Arms Support Command, Sustainment
Center of Excellence (CASCOM/SCOE), is the proponent for the Logistics branch and the contact office is the
Logistics Branch Proponency Office, CASCOM/SCOE, Fort Lee, VA.
   c. Functions. Logistics branch officers serve in both operating and generating forces and require extensive knowl-
edge and experience in planning, preparing, executing, and assessing the sustainment warfighting function subcom-
ponent, logistics (see FM 4–0 for discussions on the sustainment warfighting function. Logistics tasks include supply,
field services, transportation, maintenance, distribution management, contracting, and related general engineering.
Logistics branch officers serve as the Army’s explosive ordnance disposal experts. EOD is a highly technical area and
is a sub-function of the protection warfighting function (see FM 3–0 and FM 4–0). Additionally, Logistics branch
officers should be familiar with the other sustainment warfighting function subcomponents, including the Personnel
Services (human resources support, financial management, legal support, religious support, and band support) and
Health Services support. Logistics officers may also be called upon to support Special Operations Forces or Joint
Forces, and to handle more functions as further changes are made to the Army modular force.
35–3. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army Values
and the warrior ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the full
spectrum of conflict. They must be able to operate in Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM)
environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving their objectives. Our officers must be culturally
astute and apply their situational awareness and situational understanding to conduct operations innovatively and
courageously to exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the operational environment. Further
explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this publication. Logistics branch
officers recognize that their Soldiers are the cornerstone of our Army, providing service and support to the Warrior and
their missions. With this recognition comes the understanding that they must place the welfare of their Soldiers above
their own and adhere to Army Values because without our Soldiers, the Army cannot accomplish its mission. Logistics
branch officers are self-reliant, agile, proactive leaders who work in asymmetric and unpredictable environments where
time available for problem analysis is likely constrained, but where sound, timely decisions are urgent. They must be
responsive to a rapidly evolving operational environment and improvise ways and means to accomplish the mission
when doctrinal approaches do not apply. The ultimate goal for Logistics branch officers is to never let a mission fail
due to lack of quality logistics support. Mission success ultimately requires the proper balance between technical skills
and the ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactical skills at the right moment. Success also requires honed
                                              DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            307

conceptual skills, enabling officers to handle changing situations and ideas. They must be experts in integrating the
various aspects of logistics into the commander’s plan, and in order to do so, must be heavily experienced in
multifunctional logistics and have a basic competence in the skills, knowledge and attributes of supply, maintenance
and transportation operations. From the Basic Course forward in a logistics officer’s career, tactics are an essential skill
set. Tactics will be incorporated in the education of a logistics officer early and continually. Responsiveness, improvi-
sation, and economy are key logistics principles that enable officers to lead units to support an agile combat force and
execute operations more swiftly than their opponents.
   (1) Responsiveness. Responsiveness is providing the right support in the right place, at the right time, and it includes
the ability to foresee operational requirements. Responsiveness involves identifying, accumulating, and maintaining the
assets, capabilities, and information necessary to meet support requirements. Responsiveness involves the ability to
meet changing requirements on short notice. Anticipating those requirements is critical to providing responsive
logistics.
   (2) Improvisation. Improvisation is the ability to adapt sustainment operations to unexpected situations or circum-
stances affecting a mission. It includes creating, inventing, arranging, or fabricating what is needed from what is
available. It may also involve changing or creating methods that adapt to an enemy that quickly evolves. This requires
commanders, their staffs, and Soldiers to improvise other possible means to accomplish an operation. The sustainment
commander must apply operational art to visualize complex operations and understand what is possible at the tactical
level. These skills enable commanders to improvise operational and tactical actions when enemy actions or unexpected
events disrupt sustainment operations.
   (3) Economy. Economy means providing sustainment resources in an efficient manner to enable a commander to
employ all assets to generate the greatest effect possible. The commander achieves economy through efficient
management and discipline by prioritizing and allocating resources. Staffs look for ways to eliminate redundancies and
capitalize on joint interdependencies. They also apply discipline in managing resources, minimizing waste and unneces-
sary stockpiling. Disciplined sustainment assures the greatest possible tactical endurance of the force and constitutes an
advantage to commanders who achieve economy of force in sustainment. Staffs also achieve economy by contracting
for Host/Partner Nation support that minimizes the use of limited military resources. Economy reflects the reality of
resource shortfalls, while recognizing the inevitable friction and uncertainty of military operations. Economy enables
strategic and operational reach by reducing unnecessary use of transportation of resources, and minimizing storage and
warehouse support.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of a Logistics branch officer. Logistics branch officers must know how to exploit
the following aspects of the agile logistics force when planning and executing operations; modular unit designs, force
tailoring, and split based operations. Logistics branch officers must know sustainment unit capabilities and how units
are employed in order to provide relevant sustainment information to the commander in terms he/she can rapidly apply
to the situation, enabling him to visualize, describe, and direct operations. The aforementioned logistics knowledge
must be coupled with practical experience in tactics and combined arms operations at the tactical, operational, and
strategic levels. Additionally, logisticians must understand the concepts and employment of Joint logistics in order to
provide support to the combatant commander wherever the force is located. The Logistics branch incorporates six
AOCs and three skill identifiers. Training for these AOCs and skills is open to all male and female Logistics branch
officers. Logistics branch officers all have a common, primary AOC, 90A. Officers will also hold another AOC that
indicates their chosen specialty within the Logistics branch; these are classified as “Logistics functional areas.” Officers
will continue their affiliation with the Ordnance, Quartermaster, or Transportation regiments based on this secondary
AOC. Refer to the other branch sections of this chapter for a more detailed description of the types of functional units
and staff jobs as well as the criteria for obtaining each of the other AOCs.
   (1) Multifunctional Logistics (AOC 90A). This is the primary AOC for the Logistics branch. Officers will command
and control multifunctional logistics units as well as serve in various multifunctional logistics staff positions. All
officers receive this designation as their primary AOC once they graduate from CLC3.
   (2) Transportation (AOC 88A). This is one of five Logistics functional areas. Officers holding the 88A AOC will
command and control marine, terminal, motor or rail transportation units as well as serve in varied levels of
transportation staff positions. Officers holding this skill serve on division or higher staffs/commands at the operational
or strategic level in order to provide specialized knowledge of transportation organizations, equipment, and doctrine.
Officers will plan, coordinate, and synchronize the rapid deployment, RSO&I, sustainment/distribution management
and redeployment of forces in any area of operations.
   (3) Explosive Ordnance Disposal (AOC 89E). This is one of five Logistics functional areas. Officers holding the
89E AOC will command and control EOD units as well as serve in varied levels of EOD staff positions. Logistics
branch officers possessing this specialty must sign a volunteer statement accepting duty as an EOD officer. Due to the
unique nature of this specialty, officers will be utilized primarily in 89E duty positions, followed by 91A ammunition
staff officer positions, then 90A positions. Until officers revoke their volunteer statement, 89E will be designated as the
primary AOC, 91A as the secondary AOC and 90A as the tertiary AOC.
   (4) Maintenance and munitions (AOC 91A). This is one of five Logistics functional areas. Officers holding the 91A
AOC will command and control maintenance or ammunition units as well as serve in varied levels of ordnance staff
positions.

   (5) Supply and services (AOC 92A. This is one of five Logistics functional areas. Officers holding the 92A AOC
will command and control quartermaster units as well as serve in varied levels of quartermaster staff positions.
   (6) Aerial delivery and materiel (AOC 92D) (Effective 1 October 2010, AOC 92D will become SI R9). Officers
attending the Aerial Delivery and Materiel Course will command and control aerial delivery and materiel units as well
as serve in varied levels of aerial delivery staff positions.
   (7) Petroleum and water (AOC 92F). This is one of five Logistics functional areas. Officers holding the 92F AOC
will command and control petroleum and water units as well as serve in varied levels of petroleum staff positions.
   (8) Mortuary affairs (SI 4V). Officers attending the Mortuary Affairs Course serve as staff officers for mortuary
affairs support.
   (9) Theater Logistics Studies Program (SI P1). Officers attending the Theater Logistics Studies Program or Associ-
ate Theater Logistics Studies Program will serve as logistics planners, primarily at the ESC/TSC level.
   c. Medical Service Corps officer. (MFA 70). The Medical Service Corps officer is an integral part of our support
battalion structure and as such, they are offered the chance to hold key developmental positions at the major level, the
more common being support operations officer and executive officer. Ideally, officers will attend CLC3 in order to
obtain the requisite training in order for them to be successful at those jobs. The Support Operations Course (SOC) and
Theater Logistics (TLog) Studies Program are acceptable training substitutes if an officer did not have the opportunity
to attend CLC3 as a captain. This applies to both the Active Army and Reserve Component. It is this combination of
training and major-level key developmental experiences that allows MSC officers to be competitive for command of
multifunctional logistics units as a lieutenant colonel, as well as the opportunity to command them at the brigade level.
Those officers who do not have the requisite training and KD experiences will not be allowed to compete in those
LTC/COL command categories.
35–4. Officer development
   a. Officer Development Model. The Officer Development Model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments in one of the three logistics branches (Quartermaster, Transporta-
tion, or Ordnance) prior to induction into the Logistics branch.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation at the 4th or 7th year develops both specific and broad functional competencies. For
example, many logistics officers apply to the Acquisition Corps (FA 51). If accepted into this program, officers attend
numerous qualification courses and have specific developmental paths for future assignments. However, once officers
are accepted into another FA designation, such as FA 51, they will not return to the Logistics branch nor will they be
eligible to command logistics units.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive for training and assignments
that will broaden and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These broadening opportunities are
outside one’s normal branch or functional area career development, and are joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and
multinational in nature.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (6) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   (7) The goal of the professional development of Logistics branch officers is two-fold. First and foremost the goal is
to produce and sustain highly qualified, tactically and operationally oriented individuals able to provide seamless
logistical support in combat and other missions. These skills are gained and developed through multiple operational
assignments and continuous professional study and self-development. Secondly, Logistics branch officers will maintain
proficiency in one logistics functional area. Officers will maintain proficiency in their secondary AOC through periodic
developmental assignments and self-development. Logistics branch positions that are coded 90A on authorization
documents provide the required experience and development in order to gain proficiency as a Logistics branch officer
and are only found at the captain and above experience level. Assignments should alternate periodically between 90A
assignments and assignments to an officers’ chosen logistics functional area of expertise and/or assigned skill identifi-
ers as stated in paragraph 35–3b. However, as an officer gains rank, the majority of time spent should be in 90A
positions. Assignment patterns will vary depending on the needs of the Army, professional development requirements,
manning guidance, and individual officer preferences. Logistics branch officer career development should include a
wide variety of units and organizations to include heavy, Stryker, light, airborne, air assault, and special operations
forces. Having diverse experiences will afford logistics officers more possibilities for future assignments while
promoting an increased appreciation and level of expertise for a wide range of tactical and operational level logistics
operations. Each officer, with support from mentors, should develop career goals and clearly articulate those goals to
the commander and assignments officer at the AHRC. Always remember that an officer is his or her own best career
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                          309

manager. By actively participating in the management of career decisions, officers will improve the likelihood of a
successful career.
   b. Lieutenant development. Logistics officers are accessed into one of the three functional branches (QM, OD, or
TC) and then inducted into the Logistics branch after selection for promotion to captain and successful completion of
CLC3.
   c. Captain development.
   (1) Education. Officers will attend the Combined Logistics Captain Career Course (CLC3), generally between their
3rd-4th YOS. Attendance is mandatory for Logistics lieutenants and captains; there will be no substitution of other
CCCs. Officers receive basic instruction in multifunctional logistics, instruction on commanding at the company level,
and advanced technical instruction in their chosen logistics functional area.
   (2) KD assignments. After graduation from CLC3, captains can expect assignments as company commanders or
logistics battalion /brigade staff officers as well as other staff positions in the operating and generating force. Company
command is the only key developmental (KD) experience recognized. There are many types of logistics company
commands; some are coded 90A, such as the forward support company or distribution company, others are purely
functional, such as a field maintenance, ammunition, petroleum pipeline, or cargo transfer company. It does not matter
what type of company an officer commands; what does matter is successfully serving as a company commander for at
least 12 months. Company command is a KD experience that will enhance an officer’s chance for command of a
logistics unit at higher levels.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. When not commanding a company and executing logistics mis-
sions, captains generally serve on logistics staffs, either as a multifunctional or functional expert, tracking current
commodity status or planning future logistics support for supported units. During their 4th - 10th YOS, captains
normally have a chance to pursue the following additional educational opportunities that enhance and broaden their
understanding of multifunctional logistics:
   (a) Support Operations Course (SOC). Further develops multifunctional logistics skills normally associated with
assignment to a support operations section.
   (b) Advanced civilian schooling (ACS). Allows an officer to complete an advanced degree in a logistics discipline,
followed by an appropriate utilization assignment.
   (c) Training with industry (TWI). Gives officers an appreciation of logistics from an industry point of view and is
followed by an appropriate utilization assignment on the Joint or Army DCS, G–4 staff. This program is not degree
producing.
   (d) Theater Logistics (TLog) Studies Program. A 19-week course (skill identifier producing) specializing in logistics
planning at the theater level. A select number of officers may elect to couple this training with a cooperative degree
program pursuing an advanced degree in logistics from the Florida Institute of Technology.
   (4) Self-development. Logistics branch officers who do not receive the opportunity to participate in the TWI, TLog,
or ACS programs are encouraged to obtain graduate-level education in an appropriate discipline. Logistics branch
officers must be able to translate information on status and location of resources into the impact on combat effective-
ness in the present and near future using emerging information technology. Logistics branch officers should be well
versed in all logistics Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS) and C2 Systems, such as the Battle
Command Sustainment and Support System (BCS3), Movement Tracking System (MTS), and Global Combat Support
System-Army (GCSS–A).
   (5) Desired experience. At the company-grade level, logistics officer assignments should be fairly evenly split
between multifunctional and functional. As officers progress from company-grade to field-grade, assignments grow
increasingly multifunctional. Officers must develop and use a diverse set of skills as they move between functional and
multifunctional assignments in the operating and generating force. Logistics branch officers are strongly encouraged to
serve on military transition teams (MiTTs) where they will gain valuable leader and training experience.
   d. Major development.
   (1) Education. Majors must complete ILE which includes the core course and the Advanced Operations and
Warfighting Course at Fort Leavenworth, as well as specified logistics electives. Completion of ILE will make officers
ILE and JPME I qualified. Attendance at ILE will be an assignment process, not by board selection, and will normally
occur between the 8th- 12th YOS. All officers are also encouraged to take advantage of the opportunity at ILE to obtain
graduate-level education in an appropriate discipline. After completion of ILE, select officers will have the opportunity
to attend the School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS), one of the U.S. Army’s best educational opportunities to
develop leaders. The course focuses on educating future commanders and leaders to become operational artists and
critical thinkers. The graduates of SAMS are not just planners but great operators who can plan and lead combat
formations. These officers will lead our Army for the next 15–20 years
   (2) KD assignments. Majors are primarily staff officers, serving in positions at all levels. They must plan and
organize various logistics missions and demonstrate their abilities to manage multifunctional organizations. They build
on their skills and experiences from their captain years, have assignments of greater complexity, and prepare them-
selves to be battalion commanders. An officer’s performance during these assignments demonstrates a mastery of
logistics skills, knowledge, and attributes. The amount of time spent in key developmental assignments can be varied,
310                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

due to unpredictable manning policies. Officers will serve between 12 to 24 months in each assignment, although not
required due to the unpredictable nature of stabilization policies. The particular key developmental assignments for
which a major is selected and the officer’s level of success in those assignments sets the conditions for promotion
opportunities to lieutenant colonel and possible selection for battalion command and key billet. There is no one
particular KD job in a specific logistics unit that is considered “most important” or a “must have” for promotion
selection. However, the type of unit in which you have your key developmental experiences will, in part, influence the
type of unit that you may be most suited to command and may dictate your competitiveness within that command
category. An officer’s manner of performance and senior rater comments on future potential are still the contributing
factors towards doing well on command boards. As a Logistics branch officer, you are expected to have mastered the
art of logistics as well as be an expert in your chosen secondary field of expertise. The following 90A (Multifunctional
Logistics) assignments are considered to be key developmental at the major level:
   (a) Battalion Support Operations Officer
   (b) Battalion Executive Officer
   (c) Brigade/Regimental S4 (any type of TOE brigade)
   (d) Battalion/Brigade/Group S2/3 or Operations Officer (major authorized)
   (e) Major-level company command
   (f) Brigade Logistics Support Team (BLST) chief
   (g) Division Assistant Chief of Staff, Logistics/Corps Assistant Chief of Staff, Logistics/ESC/TSC/ASCC Logistics
Planner (SAMS and TLog utilization)
   (h) ALE Team Chief
   (i) Military Transition Team (MiTT)/Provisional Reconstruction Team (major authorized)
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Each of the three functional logistics branches, QM, OD and TC
within this chapter will list those development assignments that allow officers to maintain their functional expertise in
their secondary areas of expertise. Once an officer has completed their key developmental assignment as a major, they
should seek to serve in joint, interagency, intergovernmental and multinational organizations and on military transition
teams as well as logistics staff positions at the ESC level and higher. In addition, some officers will have an
opportunity to attend advance civil schooling and fellowships to obtain post-graduate degrees that will provide the
officer with an opportunity to serve at higher level of responsibility.
   (4) Self-development. Self-development is the responsibility of every officer and ranges from professional reading
during off-duty time to aggressively seeking out positions of increased responsibility. Officers are encouraged to
continue to broaden their logistics experience by doing the following: establish a professional reading program,
participate in their regimental association, participate in civilian professional logistics organizations, become a certified
professional logistician, obtain a civilian degree in logistics-related fields, complete logistics-related correspondence
courses, complete courses in joint logistics at ALMC, and conduct research and write articles for professional logistics
publications.
   (5) Desired experience. A variety of assignments across the logistics spectrum, as well as a combination between the
operational and generating force, will enhance an officers key developmental experiences
   e. Lieutenant colonel development.
   (1) Education. Lieutenant colonels selected for command must complete the Pre-Command Course at ALMC.
Lieutenant colonels should continue their self-development in all facets of logistics, particularly in Joint and multina-
tional operations. Many ALMC courses are available, focusing on Joint and multinational logistics as well as national-
level logistics. All officers are encouraged to obtain a graduate-level education in an appropriate discipline.
   (2) KD assignments. Developmental experience gained as a lieutenant colonel provides the Army with officers in
senior grades who have further expanded their mastery of both multifunctional and functional logistics skills. Lieuten-
ant colonels serve primarily in key staff and/or Joint positions in sustainment brigade headquarters, expeditionary
sustainment commands, theater sustainment commands, division, corps, and higher staffs. The following assignments
are considered to be key developmental at the lieutenant colonel level:
   (a) Battalion Commander
   (b) Division Assistant Chief of Staff, Logistics
   (c) Distribution Management Center Chief
   (d) Support Operations Officer (lieutenant colonel authorized)
   (e) Deputy Commander/Executive Officer
   (f) Joint Staff Officer
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Each of the three functional logistics branches, QM, OD and TC
within this chapter will list those development assignments that allow officers to maintain their functional expertise in
their secondary areas of expertise. Once an officer has completed their key developmental assignment as a lieutenant
colonel, they should seek to serve in joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational organizations and on
military transition teams as well as logistics staff positions at the ESC level and higher. In addition, some officers will
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                              311

have unique opportunities, such as attend senior service college, participate in fellowship programs, and serve as
congressional liaison officers that will provide them with opportunities to serve at higher level of responsibility.
   (4) Self-development. Lieutenant colonels should expand their military professional reading program to include
other services and logistics periodicals, and magazines, participate in civilian professional logistics organizations,
become a certified professional logistician, conduct research and write articles for professional logistics publications,
and obtain a post-graduate degree in a logistics discipline. Additionally, officers should attend Six Sigma or Lean Six
Sigma training and certification programs that will assist them in improving their organizations business processes.
   (5) Desired experience. Select lieutenant colonels will have the opportunity to command battalions. Successful
battalion command and key billet assignment, while not mandatory for promotion to colonel, will enhance the officer’s
potential for brigade command.
   f. Colonel development.
   (1) Education. Although no specific mandatory military education requirement exists for colonels, attendance at a
SSC or completion of the AWC Distance Education Course identifies those officers with exceptional promotion
potential for service in positions of increased responsibility at the next higher grade. All officers are encouraged to
obtain a graduate-level education in an appropriate discipline. Officers should continue their self-development in
logistics skills and keep current as to the future changes within the logistics arena affecting Soldiers and units.
   (2) KD assignments. Experiences at the colonel level are primarily staff assignments at the operational and strategic
level. Currently, commands make up only 26 percent of colonel-level positions; all are considered key developmental.
Corps and higher staff DCS, G–4 positions as well as Joint assignments are viewed as key for career enhancement, as
well as important to the Army.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments.
   (a) Brigade Commander
   (b) Corps DCS, G–4
   (c) AMC Logistics Staff Officer
   (d) DCS, G–4 Logistics Staff Officer
   (e) Joint Staff Officer
   (f) DCS, G–3/5/7/G–8 Staff Officer
   (g) ESC/TSC Support Operations Officer/Chief of Staff
   (h) DA IG
   (i) COCOM Log Staff Officer
   (4) Self-development. Colonels should continue to expand their professional reading program, participate in civilian
professional logistics organizations, become a certified professional logistician, conduct research and write articles for
professional logistics publications, and obtain a post-graduate degree in a logistics discipline. The following is a list of
courses and fellowships that select colonels will have an opportunity to attend in conjunction with the Senior Service
College program.
   (a) LOGTECH Executive Course
   (b) SSC - MIT Logistics Fellowship
   (c) SSC - OSD Corporate Fellowship
   (d) Joint Course - JPME
   (5) Desired experience. Colonels will serve primarily in key staff and/or Joint positions in expeditionary sustainment
commands, theater sustainment commands, and division, corps, and higher staffs. Select colonels will have the
opportunity to command brigades. Successful brigade command will provide an opportunity to compete for brigadier
general. Former brigade commanders are given the opportunity to serve as deputy commanding officers, chiefs of staff
and support operation officers of expeditionary sustainment commands, and deputy commandant at the Ordnance,
Transportation and Quartermaster Schools. In addition, former brigade commanders can serve as executive officers for
general officers to the commanding generals of the logistics ACOMs and Army DCS, G–4.

35–5. Warrant officer development
While warrant officers are a critical part of the Logistics Corps, they are not members of the Logistics branch.
Logistics warrant officers remain members of the three historical branches (OM, OD, and TC). Refer to the other
branch sections of this chapter for a detailed description of warrant officers’ professional development and career
management information.
35–6. Logistics Branch Reserve Component officers
   a. General. RC Logistics branch officer qualifications and development parallel those of their Active Army counter-
parts as described in paragraphs 35–3 and 35–4 above. Life-cycle development and utilization also parallel the Active
Army as shown in figure 35–2, below. Training and development of RC Logistics branch officers may be more
challenging than for their Active Army counterparts, due to several constraints, such as time to train, state and Federal
missions, geographical location, decentralized officer management, and ongoing transformation of units. With the
incorporation of the Logistics branch, RC officers must recognize these challenges in order to overcome them, and
become equally capable as their Active Army counterparts. The AGR officers will be managed like their Active Army
counterparts whenever possible.
   b. Logistics branch qualification and development. The RC officers will be inducted or appointed into the Logistic
branch upon completion of a logistics (Ordnance, Quartermaster, or Transportation) RC CCC. Officers will hold 90A
as their primary AOC and a secondary AOC. This policy applies to the following officers; AGR, TPU, M–Day, IMA,
and IRR. As is the case with Active Army officers, there will be no lieutenants (nor non-CCC graduates) in the
Logistics branch.
   (1) Captain. Captains are either company commanders or staff officers. Officers will have Logistics branch assign-
ments according to organizational structures within their geographical location/state boundaries. Officers should take
full advantage of the Battle Command Knowledge System-LOGNet and the Sustainment Knowledge Net (SKN) to
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            313

keep skills current. Officers are encouraged to take additional training courses when resources permit. If able, officers
may attend Active duty courses such as TLog or CLC3, but the following courses are also available in 2-week
increments:
   (a) Support Operations Course (SOC). This course further develops multifunctional logistics skills normally associ-
ated with assignment to a support operations section. The course generally focuses on training captains, majors, and
senior NCOs in multifunctional support operations at the tactical level.
   (b) Reserve Component Theater Sustainment Course (RC–TSC) (formerly RC Multifunctional Combat Service
Support Course (RCMCSS). The course provides multifunctional logistics education to officers, warrant officers and
senior noncommissioned officers that are currently or pending an assignment to operational level or higher sustainment
organizations.
   (c) Associate TLog Studies Program. This course (skill identifier producing) specializes in logistics planning at the
theater level. Phase 1 and 5 are resident only (2-week courses). All others will become dL in FY 2009.
   (2) Major. Majors are primarily staff officers, serving in positions at all levels. They must demonstrate their abilities
to manage assets in multifunctional organizations and organize various logistics missions. They build on their skills and
experiences from their captain years, have assignments of greater complexity, and prepare themselves to be battalion
commanders.
   (3) Lieutenant colonel and colonel. Lieutenant colonels and colonels are in the refinement stages of an RC officer’s
career. Officers will be expected to mentor junior officers on the importance of maintaining Logistics branch profi-
ciency through multiple experiences and encourage officers to obtain additional multifunctional training when appropri-
ate. Focus is also placed on an officer successfully completing lieutenant colonel or colonel-level command as well as
serving in senior logistics officer staff positions. Officers are to complete the PCC at Fort Lee, VA, when selected for
lieutenant colonel- or colonel-level command. Officers are encouraged to complete SSC, the same as their Active Army
counterparts.
   c. Branch transfer. Officers may branch transfer into the Logistics branch at any rank from captain through colonel.
The following rules apply:
   (1) Captains who have not yet attended a RC CCC. Officers who choose to transfer into the Logistics branch prior
to attending a RC CCC need only attend a logistics (Ordnance, Quartermaster, or Transportation) RC CCC. These
courses provide the requisite functional and multifunctional training for Logistics branch officers.
   (2) Captains and above who have already completed a RC CCC other than logistics. Officers who desire to branch
transfer after attendance at a non-logistics RC CCC must complete the following two requirements below in any order.
   (a) Hold a functional logistics area of concentration from the Ordnance, Quartermaster, or Transportation branches,
by completion of appropriate online or resident branch transition courses.
   (b) Attend one of the following multifunctional logistics competence courses; SOC, RC–TSC (formerly RCMCSS),
TLog, ATLog, or CLC3.
   (3) It is not the intent to have officers that desire a branch transfer to change branches twice; they must simply
complete the appropriate transition course that awards a logistics area of concentration as one of the prerequisites and
complete one of the multifunctional logistics competence course to transfer into the Logistics branch. There is no
branch transfer into the Ordnance, Quartermaster or Transportation branches at major or above; the only branch
available is the Logistics branch
   (4) To apply for the designation of Logistics branch, USAR and ARNG officers should forward applications in
accordance with published command guidance to their state Adjutant General, AHRC–St. Louis, Army Reserve Active
Duty Management Directorate (ARADMD) or the USAR Command, as appropriate.

35–7. Introduction to the Transportation branch
   a. Purpose. The Transportation branch provides the transportation capabilities that are essential for a CONUS-based
power projection Army in support of the National Military Strategy and the physical capabilities necessary to affect
agile maneuver and movement of forces and materiel at tactical, operational, and strategic levels. The Transportation
branch consists of officers, WOs, enlisted, and civilian personnel responsible for the worldwide movement of units,
personnel, equipment, and supplies in peace and war. The Transportation branch moves critical supplies rapidly, under
positive control, through an integrated, transportation-based global distribution system, leveraging emerging tech-
nologies. It provides movement control, in-transit visibility, and directs distribution to deployed forces in a dynamically
fluid, nonlinear battlefield. The current operating environment demands focused logistics that is responsive, flexible,
and precise. Focused logistics uses information, logistics, and transportation technologies to provide rapid crisis
response, capable of tracking and shifting assets even while en route, and delivering sustainment at the tactical,
operational, and strategic levels of operations. The Transportation branch is the “Spearhead of Logistics" because
“Nothing Happens until Something Moves.”
   b. Proponent information. The Commanding General, U.S. Army Transportation Center and School (USATC&S) is
the proponent for the Transportation branch and the contact office is the Office of the Chief of Transportation (OCOT),
Fort Eustis, VA.
   c. Functions. Functions performed by the Transportation branch include—
   (1) Planning, operating, scheduling, coordinating, supervising, and evaluating all methods of transportation for the
effective movement of units, personnel, equipment, and supplies in a transportation-based, Joint-global defense, and
commercial deployment and distribution systems.
   (2) Synchronizing all elements of the logistics distribution system to deliver the “right things” to the “right place” at
the “right time” to support the geographic combatant commander.
   (3) Commanding all types of transportation, movement control, marine, terminal and rail organizations tasked with
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                              315

planning and executing personnel and cargo movement, or other logistics distribution requirements within a geographic
area.
   (4) Recommending priorities, coordinating tasks, documenting cargo and/or personnel to be transported, allocating
resources, and determining the mode(s) necessary for the optimum utilization of assets and timely mission
accomplishment.
   (5) Planning, executing, tracking, and controlling movements of units, supplies, and sustainment from the source to
the combatant.
   (6) Planning and providing theater port opening terminal services for all modes of transportation and stevedoring
services at fixed ports, unimproved ports, bare-beach sites, and during joint-logistics-over-the-shore (JLOTS)
operations.
   (7) Providing highway, rail, marine, and terminal support for Army and joint operations, as well as supporting all
types of Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, Multinational (JIIM) operating environments.
   (8) Providing DOD worldwide, single agency management for military traffic, land transportation, and common-user
ocean terminals.
   (9) Developing transportation concepts and doctrine, unit organizations and the requirements to support acquisition
of transportation systems for the Army.
   (10) Providing training and professional development for DOD, Army, and civilian personnel in transportation and
deployment methods.
   (11) Providing supply and maintenance support for marine and rail equipment.
   (12) Providing management and utilization of assets in support of terminal clearance, theaterl motor transport
services and operational mobility, truck terminal/trailer transfer points, drive-away, retrograde, container and inter-
modal operations.
   (13) Playing a key role in the development, procurement, and life-cycle management of transportation-related
equipment, systems, and personnel.
35–8. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for the 21st century. These leaders must be: competent in their
core proficiencies, broad enough to operate across the spectrum of conflict, able to operate in JIIM environments and
leverage other capabilities in achieving their objective, culturally astute and able to use this awareness and understand-
ing to conduct operations innovatively, courageous enough to see and exploit opportunities in the challenges and
complexities of the operational environment, and grounded in Army Values and warrior ethos. Further explanation of
these characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of a transportation officer. Transportation branch officers and WOs may routinely
work at any of the three levels of war; tactical, operational, and strategic. This is not limited to a specific grade; for
example, a lieutenant may operate an Arrival/Departure Airfield Control Group (A/DACG), which can be a Joint
operation at both operational and strategic levels. Transportation officers will find themselves working in Joint
environments or participating in Joint operations far more frequently than other branches.
   c. Competencies and actions. The six core competencies of the Transportation branch are strategic deployment,
movement control, terminal operations, water transport, highway transport and rail transport. Transportation officers
must be technically proficient with employment of transportation and mission-unique equipment, personnel, and
systems. Transportation officers must understand transportation, supply, and maintenance automated systems. In
addition to working independently, Transportation officers often work in an environment where there is little time
available for problem analysis, but sound and timely decisions are crucial. Mission success requires the proper balance
between technical know-how and the ability to understand and apply the appropriate tactical expertise at the right
moment. Hence, the ability to operate under stress, make decisions, and act under primitive field conditions is critical
to success.
   d. Unique skills. Transportation officer skills are found in one AOC. The Transportation branch has three different
MOSs within the WO technical fields; marine operations, marine maintenance, and deployment/distribution operations.
   (1) Transportation (AOC 88A). Officers command, plan, procure, direct, control, coordinate, or manage transporta-
tion organizations and related equipment, as well as organizations engaged in transportation-related services. This
requires general knowledge of transportation organizations and doctrine concerning traffic management, marine and
terminal operations, and motor/rail transport units. Officers also serve in positions requiring specialized transportation
knowledge as well as functional experience at higher levels of operations and organizations engaged in transportation-
related services with the unique capability to plan, coordinate and synchronize the rapid deployment, sustainment/
distribution management and redeployment of forces in any area of operations. Traffic management officers command,
plan, procure, coordinate, and control the movement of personnel and military freight worldwide by military or
commercial transport. Marine and terminal operations officers command, direct, control, coordinate, manage, or serve
in positions in water transport, marine maintenance, marine terminal, or inland terminal units or organizations. Duties
encompass the command, control, or management of fixed ports, unimproved ports, and bare-beach facilities; air, rail,
316                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

motor, and inland waterway terminal operations; JLOTS operations; and marine maintenance and salvage operations.
Motor/rail transport officers command, direct, control, coordinate, manage, or serve in positions in motor (truck), rail,
truck terminal, or trailer transfer units or organizations. Duties encompass command, control, management, and
utilization of motor assets in support of terminal clearance, theater motor transport services and operational mobility,
truck terminal/trailer transfer points, area support, drive-away, retrograde, container and intermodal operations. Trans-
portation officers serve in Joint assignments, manage transportation personnel life-cycle functions, develop doctrine,
organizations and equipment, and instruct transportation skills at Service schools, Service colleges, pre-commissioning
and commissioning programs, and CTCs. Transportation officers assist USAR and ARNG transportation organizations.
Examples of Transportation duty positions are:
   (a) Transportation officer.
   (b) Transportation Plans officer.
   (c) Air Movements officer.
   (d) Division/Corps transportation officer.
   (e) Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) commander/staff officer.
   (f) Passenger movement officer.
   (g) Terminal unit commander/XO/staff officer.
   (h) Inland cargo transfer company commander/platoon leader/XO.
   (i) Watercraft and causeway unit commander/platoon leader/XO.
   (j) Seaport operations company commander/platoon leader/XO.
   (k) Floating craft maintenance company commander.
   (l) Motor (truck) transport commander/staff officer/platoon leader/XO.
   (m) Rail operations commander/staff officer/platoon leader/XO.
   (2) Marine deck WO (MOS 880A). This MOS has two distinct skill levels of technical training and professional
credentialing; MOS 880A1 and 880A2. Officers within this MOS command and operate Army watercraft and
watercraft detachments; serve aboard Army watercraft as the commanding officer, master, navigator, cargo officer or
deck watch officer; serve as an Army harbormaster or port operations officer; serve on a battalion-level staff or higher
as an operations officer; or as a Service school instructor.
   (3) Marine engineering WO (MOS 881A). This MOS has two distinct skill levels of technical training and
professional credentials; MOS 881A1 and 881A2. Officers in this MOS command watercraft maintenance detachments
and maintain Army watercraft, serve as chief engineer, assistant engineer, or engineering watch officer; or may serve
on a battalion-level staff or higher as a maintenance officer or as a Service school instructor.
   (4) Mobility WO (MOS 882A). The skills and knowledge necessary to qualify for this specialty requires technical
expertise to plan, organize, and supervise the movement, deployment, and redeployment of Army personnel and
equipment. They must also be able to coordinate deployment and redeployment with Joint, Army, and commercial
agencies as well as provide technical expertise and guidance on the implementation and use of transportation
automation systems. Mobility officers coordinate and conduct training on unit deployment and redeployment opera-
tions. They advise and assist commanders and staffs on deployment movement, sustainment, maneuver, and redeploy-
ment operations. Officers in this MOS may serve at company level or higher, or as a Service school instructor.
   (5) Other key officer skills.
   (a) Junior leadership (company grade). Junior Transportation officers work in an extremely fluid and dynamic
environment with a wide variety of personnel and equipment. Since they often work independently with minimum
guidance, supervision or support, creative thinking, and problem solving are critical skills. Officers will encounter
information that varies in completeness and ambiguity. Therefore, it is imperative that Transportation officers can
communicate effectively in both written and verbal forms. Officers should also develop excellent supervisory skills to
ensure proper execution of all assigned tasks and missions. Transportation officers must be tactically proficient and
must attain a mastery of troop leading procedures, unit defense operations, and tactical convoy operations.
   (b) Senior leadership (field grade). Even though envisioning may be considered a conceptual skill, it is essentially a
group process and is a talent that all senior Transportation officers need for professional development. Envisioning and
innovation contribute to the operational success of missions and assigned tasks by a process that includes establishing
purpose, vision, values, goals, and objectives. Senior Transportation officers should focus on other conceptual skills,
such as critical and moral reasoning, systems understanding, and analysis. The senior Transportation officer’s job
becomes much more difficult because they must not only have a mastery of technical skills, they must also be able to
mentor junior leaders in these skills. Their technical skills become more complex because they are involved in
resourcing, allocating, integrating, and synchronizing transportation equipment, personnel, and technologies, which
culminate in expert managerial abilities.
   (6) Unique knowledge. Transportation branch officers must possess an expert knowledge of transportation and
multifunctional logistics support systems, personnel, equipment, and operations. This knowledge includes practical
experience in transportation and multifunctional logistics operations and the employment of those systems. Specifically,
Transportation officers must strive to possess and maintain a comprehensive understanding of the following:
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                          317

   (a) Power projection of forces and sustainment.
   (b) Battlefield distribution.
   (c) Movement control.
   (d) JLOTS operations.
   (e) Inter- and intra-theater transportation operations.
   (f) Emerging transportation technologies.
   (g) Transportation automated systems:
   1. Automated Air Loading Planning System (AALPS).
   2. Automated Movement Flow Tracking System (AMFT).
   3. Cargo Movement Operation System (CMOS).
   4. Computerized Movements Planning and Status System (COMPASS).
   5. Enhanced Logistics Intra-theater Support Tool (ELIST).
   6. Global Transportation Network (GTN).
   7. Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS–A).
   8. Integrated Booking System (IBS).
   9. Integrated Computerized Deployment System (ICODES).
   10. Battle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3).
   11. Joint Flow and Analysis System for Transportation (JFAST).
   12. Joint Force Requirements Generator II (JFRG II).
   13. Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES).
   14. Mobilization Movement Control System (MOBCON).
   15. Transportation Coordinators’ Automated Information for Movement System II (TC–AIMS II)
   16. Worldwide Port System (WPS).
   17. Movement Tracking System (MTS).
   18. Single Mobility System
   19. Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES).
   (h) Roles and functions of the SDDC.
   (i) Roles and functions of the U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM).
   (j) Roles and functions of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).
   (k) Army maintenance and supply systems and automation.
   (l) Distribution management.
   (7) Unique attributes. Everything begins with the warrior ethos. warrior ethos is the foundation for our total
commitment to victory in peace and war. It is the conviction that military Service is much more than just another job.
It defines who officers are and what officers do. Officers require a demonstrated mastery of branch-specific skills, and
grounding in the seven Army Values in order to successfully lead Soldiers as the Army transforms. All officers must
be physically and mentally fit, maintain and display self-control, remain calm under pressure, and adhere to published
standards and regulations.
35–9. Critical officer developmental assignments
   a. Officer development. Officers may use the Transportation branch training and development model (see fig 35–3)
as a guideline for maintaining functional expertise throughout their career. Logistics branch developmental model is at
figure 35–1 and discussed in paragraph 35–4. All Transportation branch positions are open to male and female officers
with the exception of the ranger regiment movement control officer, which is specific to male officers. The purpose of
leader development is to ensure that the officer has acquired the necessary skills and experience, the breadth and depth
of knowledge, and attributes that are required to grow officers who are the centerpiece of a campaign quality Army
with a Joint expeditionary mindset.
   b. Broadening experience. Officers should also seek opportunities that expose them to experiences outside of their
core competencies to gain a wider range of knowledge and skills. These broadening experiences should enhance an
officer’s ability to perform in an ever changing, complex environment across the spectrum of conflict at the tactical,
operational, and strategic levels.
35–10. Active Army Transportation Developmental Model
   a. Lieutenant. After completing the Transportation BOLC III, officers are normally assigned at the company level to
gain leadership experience and to enhance technical and tactical competence. The focus of lieutenants should be on
acquiring and refining troop leading procedures, technical skills, training and administrative skills. Prior to promotion
to captain, lieutenants should possess an excellent knowledge of the Transportation branch’s purpose, mission, and core
competencies. This includes practical experience in Transportation operations, activities, and missions. Special training
necessary to support an officer’s follow-on assignment may be scheduled after BOLC III. Lieutenants should expect to
318                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

serve as a platoon leader, detachment commander, or as an XO for a period of time that allows the officer to gain
depth of skills and experience. In all assignments, lieutenants should concentrate on learning the basics of how the
Army works, how to lead Soldiers, and how to maintain a motivated and positive outlook. Officers should expect to
serve in progressive positions to develop leadership, technical skills and, when appropriate, to complement this with
staff experience at the battalion and brigade level. BOLC III certifies lieutenants as the subject matter experts for unit
movement and deployment requirements (Unit Movement Officer). Typical Transportation lieutenant duty positions
include:
   (1) Transportation unit platoon leader.
   (2) Transportation unit XO.
   (3) Detachment commander.
   (4) Battalion transportation staff officer.
   b. Captain. Captains must be proficient in all transportation core competencies in order to be an effective leader at
the company and battalion level. Captains should aggressively prepare for and seek company-level command. Captains
should continue to gain an in-depth understanding of all aspects of transportation operations as well as multifunctional
logistics operations in order to serve in various staff positions at all levels such as—
   (1) Transportation staff officer.
   (2) Movement control officer.
   (3) Terminal operations officer.
   (4) Service school instructor.
   (5) Combat training center observer controller/trainers (OC/T).
   c. Major. Majors should aggressively seek the skills and experience that will best prepare them for the duties at the
lieutenant colonel level. Majors must exercise continuous self-development efforts to fully master all aspects of
transportation operations and multifunctional logistics to include Joint and multinational operations. This includes
honing transportation skills already gained at the company-grade level. The Transportation major may further expand
his tactical and technical skills by serving in staff assignments at Division level and higher. The Division Transporta-
tion Officer position is considered a key developmental experience. Each officer should have sufficient experience and
participate in a capstone event in these KD assignments in order to develop an understanding of transportation and
logistics operations. There is no substitute for preparing a Transportation officer for future command and for building
his transportation and logistics skills. The SAMS graduate Transportation officer utilization, when served in conjunc-
tion with at least 12 months service in a battalion or brigade S3/XO/SPO position is also considered a key developmen-
tal experience. Transportation competencies reside in the following assignments:
   (1) Battalion/Group/Brigade XO.
   (2) Battalion/Group/Brigade S3
   (3) Division/Brigade/Battalion Transportation Officer
   (4) Army Service Component Command (ASCC) DCS, G–4 plans/air movements officer.
   (5) Movement Control Team commander.
   (6) SDDC company commander
   d. Lieutenant colonel. The objective in lieutenant colonel assignments is to give officers the opportunity to make a
greater contribution to the Army. While the majority of positions at this level are multifunctional, officers will be
called upon to fill transportation staff or command assignments, such as the following:
   (1) Commander of a battalion.
   (2) SDDC transportation staff officer.
   (3) HQDA/ACOM transportation staff officer.
   (4) Sustainment command/sustainment brigade transportation staff officer.
   (5) U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) staff officer.
   e. Colonel. Critical Transportation competencies are found in the following assignments.
   (1) Commander of a brigade.
   (2) Chief of Staff.
   (3) Distribution Manager.
   (4) SDDC transportation staff officer.
   (5) USTRANSCOM staff officer.
   (6) ESC/TSC staff officer

35–11. Warrant officer development
   a. Critical WO developmental assignments. Transportation branch WOs manage the operation and maintenance of
U.S. Army watercraft and deployment/distribution measures in both tactical and peacetime environments. They support
Army missions by planning, coordinating, and directing Army units during ocean, JLOTS, coastal, harbor and inland
water (CHI) missions as well as strategic, operational, and tactical movement control missions worldwide. Mastery of
the following skills relative to each officer’s leadership stage is critical for successful performance. Specific schooling
and operational assignments will best educate and prepare WOs for competitive positions of greater responsibility and
promotion. Figure 35-4, below, shows the career development models of the marine deck officer (880A) and the
marine engineering officer (881A).

   (3) Mobility officer (MOS 882A). Serve as a mobility officer at the movement control battalion, corps, ESC/TSC, or
in a senior supervisory, advisory, or staff position.
   e. CW5. Individuals must complete the WOSSC as soon as possible, but should be completed not later than 1 year
after promotion to CW5. Serve in the most senior supervisory, advisory, and staff positions. Marine officer specialty
(MOSs 880A and 881A) must maintain A2 certification as outlined in AR 56–9, chapter 5.
35–12. Transportation Branch Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. A significant portion of Transportation assets resides in the RC. Transportation
branch RC officers serve in the same roles and missions as their Active Army counterparts. The unique nature of the
RC Soldier’s role as a “citizen Soldier” poses a challenge for their professional development. However, RC Transporta-
tion officers are expected to follow Active Army officer developmental patterns as closely as possible.
   b. Branch development opportunities. Officers are professionally developed through a succession of schooling and
assignments. Generally, education and self-development requirements parallel those identified for Active Army offi-
cers. See figure 35–5, for the RC Transportation life-cycle model. Recommended RC Transportation officer profes-
sional development by grade is as follows:
                                 Figure 35–5. The RC Transportation Developmental Model

   (1) Lieutenant. The Transportation BOLC III is the starting point for newly accessed RC Transportation officers. RC
officers should complete BOLC III by their third year (USAR) or 18 months (ARNG) of service. Officers should
obtain assignments to troop units at the company level as a platoon leader or XO for a period of time that allows the
officer to gain depth of skills and expertise. If there is a limited leadership opportunity available within the Transporta-
tion competencies in an officer’s initial assignment, the officer should strive to seek to increase logistics knowledge
within the Quartermaster or Ordnance competencies and pursue a Transportation-related position when available as a
follow-on assignment. For self-development, lieutenants should master transportation core competencies and tasks,
expand their professional readings, and support the Transportation Regimental Association and other military and
civilian transportation professional organizations.
   (2) Captain.
   (a) Complete the Reserve Component Captain Career Course (Transportation). Additionally, it is recommended to
complete the Support Operations Course (SOC) to prepare captains for the transition into the Logistics branch. Prior to
enrolling in ILE, USAR officers contact their career managers at AHRC to ensure they have met educational
requirements to attend ILE. In order to be best prepared for the duties of a major, RC captains should successfully
serve in one of the following branch-preferred positions for a period of time that allows the officer to gain breadth and
depth of skills and experience:
   1. Company commander.
   2. Battalion/brigade staff officer.
   (b) The RC captains should gain an in-depth understanding of transportation operations as well as multifunctional
logistics operations. They also must become proficient in Transportation core competencies in order to serve at the
company and battalion level. For self-development, captains should expand their knowledge through professional
readings, support the Transportation Regimental Association and other military and civilian transportation professional
and social organizations, attend seminars and conferences, and participate in community activities.
   (3) Majors should complete ILE.
   (a) In order to be best prepared for transportation duties at the lieutenant colonel level, it is recommended that RC
majors serve in one of the following positions:
   1. General transportation. This includes division transportation officer, battalion/group/brigade XO and/or battalion/
group/brigade S3.
   2. Movement control. This Includes division movement control officer, movement control team commander, battal-
ion/TMCA XO, and battalion/TMCA S3.
   3. Marine and terminal operations. This includes battalion/group/brigade XO, battalion/group S–3, and SDDC
company commander.
   4. Highway/rail transportation. This includes battalion/group/brigade XO, battalion/group/brigade S3.
   (b) For self-development, officers should obtain a master’s degree and devote time to a professional reading
program to broaden their warfighting and logistics perspective. Additionally, they should conduct research and write
articles for professional military publications, and support the Transportation Regimental Association and other military
and civilian transportation professional organizations.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel. The RC lieutenant colonels should be assigned to a battalion/brigade-level command and/or
senior staff. For self-development, officers should obtain a master’s degree and devote time to a professional reading
program to broaden their warfighting and logistics perspective. Additionally, they should conduct research and write
articles for professional, military publications, and support the Transportation Regimental Association and other
military and civilian transportation professional organizations. In order to be best prepared for the duties of colonel, RC
lieutenant colonels should serve in one of the following senior-level assignments:
   (a) Commander of a battalion.
   (b) SDDC transportation staff officer.
   (c) Movement Control Agency (MCA) division chief.
   (d) HQDA/ACOM transportation staff officer.
   (e) Service school staff/faculty.
   (f) USTRANSCOM, transportation staff officer.
   (g) Theater Sustainment Command (TSC) staff officer.
   (h) Expeditionary Sustainment Command (ESC) staff officer.
   (5) Colonel. The RC officers selected for colonel are advised to seek assignments of greater responsibility in the
branch. Officers selected for promotion to colonel should apply for the SSC-level AWC Distance Education Course, if
not selected for the resident course. The RC Transportation colonels contribute to the branch by serving in critical
assignments to include the following:
   (a) Colonel-level command.
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             323

  (g) USTRANSCOM transportation staff officer.
  (h) Service school staff/faculty.
  (i) ESC/TSC staff.
  c. Branch transfer officers. Officers who wish to branch transfer at the rank of captain-colonel who have already
completed a non-logistics CCC must transfer into the Logistics branch (see para 35–6). Officers who wish to hold the
Transportation AOC within the Logistics branch must take the Senior Transportation Officer Qualification Correspond-
ence Course (STOQCC).
  d. Warrant officer professional development. Specific schooling and operational assignments which will best prepare
an RC WO and make them more competitive for positions of greater responsibility and promotion. These mirror those
in the Active Duty. The RC WO developmental models are at figure 35–6.

35–13. Introduction to the Ordnance Branch
   a. Purpose. If the Army shoots it, drives it, loads it, communicates with it, or it explodes, then the Ordnance branch
arms it, recovers it, repairs it, welds it, and renders it safe. The Ordnance branch consists of 107,000 Soldiers with 34
enlisted MOSs, 9 WO specialties and 2 officer AOCs. Ordnance Soldiers serve in every unit in the Army.
   b. Proponent information. The Office of the Chief of Ordnance serves as the proponent for the Personnel Develop-
ment System for Ordnance officers, warrant officers, Soldiers, and related civilian occupational series, and their
associated life-cycle management functions. The contact office is the Ordnance Personnel Proponency Office, QC&S,
Fort Lee, VA, 804–765–7384/7385.
   c. Functions. The Ordnance branch core competencies are maintenance, ammunition management, and explosives
ordnance disposal (EOD). The Ordnance branch is responsible for providing expertise in materiel maintenance of
combat firepower systems, ground mobility materiel, mobile electric power generation equipment, mobile environmen-
tal conditioning equipment, armament and electronics, air defense systems, EOD, and munitions management. The
Ordnance branch also provides functional area expertise to support combat developments, materiel systems develop-
ment, force development, and training development.
   d. History and background. Ordnance branch officers are logisticians performing the sustainment warfighting
functions of maintenance and munitions management, and EOD. The Ordnance branch has armed and maintained the
Army since 1812. The Ordnance Regimental spirit lives on with our motto: Service to the Line, on the Line, On Time.
“Sustainment determines the depth and endurance of Army Operation and is essential to retaining and exploiting the
initiative.” Ordnance officers serve at all levels of the Army sustaining the life-cycle of the Army’s materiel from
cradle to grave and protecting the Army’s forces through EOD operations.
35–14. Ordnance officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army Values
and the warrior ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the spectrum of
conflict. They must be able to operate in JIIM environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving
their objectives. Our officers must be culturally astute and able to use their awareness and understanding to conduct
operations innovatively and courageously to exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the operational
environment. Further explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this
publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of an Ordnance officer. Lieutenants assessed into the Ordnance branch will develop
functional branch skills defined by their area of concentration (AOC) for the first 3–4 years of their career. All
Ordnance AOCs and skill identifiers are open to male and female officers. There are two AOCs for Ordnance officers.
Upon graduation of the Combined Logistics Captain Career Course (CLC3), Ordnance officers will hold a primary
AOC 90A with a secondary AOC of 91A. (See chapter 35–4 for an explanation of Logistics branch officers).
Notwithstanding this, these officers will maintain their Ordnance Regimental affiliation, and may continue to serve in
Ordnance functional assignments throughout their career. The EOD (AOC 89E) officers may continue to serve in AOC
89E throughout their career, or rotate between AOC’s 90A, 91A, and 89E.
   (1) Materiel Maintenance and Munitions Management Officer (AOC 91A). Officers working in this AOC manage
Ordnance Soldiers and the Army maintenance process that ensures weapon systems are operational, ready, and
available. Officers are responsible for integrated maintenance support of Army conventional weapon systems, small
arms, artillery, fire control equipment, missile systems and their associated ground support equipment; electronics;
track and wheel vehicles; and engineer and power generation equipment. Maintenance functions include metalworking,
fabrication, welding, inspection, test, service, calibration, repair, overhaul, and reclamation. Officers must develop a
comprehensive knowledge of maintenance management techniques and integrated logistics support. Officers must be
technically competent in production control and quality assurance techniques. The technical sophistication of today’s
Army weapon systems; the high dollar cost of production, fielding and maintaining; and their tactical importance
require officers with the highest managerial and leadership skills. Officers also participate in the management of the
Army’s munitions inventory. These officers lead, manage, plan, and direct ammunition supply, storage, transportation,
maintenance, surveillance, inspection, stock control, safety, and security, including maintenance of associated test and
handling equipment. The increasing technical sophistication of the various munitions in the Army’s inventory, along
with the rapid expenditures of ammunition across the force, requires officers to be closely involved in managing the
precious ammunition commodity that the Army uses and trusts these officers to provide for the fight.
   (2) Explosive Ordnance Disposal (AOC 89E). Officers must volunteer to become qualified for EOD. Only Ordnance
officers are eligible to apply for EOD. There are two opportunities to enter into the EOD field: after completion of
Ordnance Basic Officer Leader Course III (BOLC III) or CLC3. Procedures for volunteering are located in DA Pam
351–4 and AR 611–105. Officers must complete an intense two-phased EOD course prior to being awarded this
designation. EOD Phase I is conducted at Redstone Arsenal, AL, and EOD Phase II is at the Joint EOD course at Eglin
                                              DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                          325

Air Force Base, FL. EOD officers provide a unique and critical service to the Army, U.S. federal agencies, and local
law enforcement and operate within the full spectrum of joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational (JIIM)
operations. EOD officers plan, develop, and integrate EOD operations for all types of contingency operations. These
officers advise, integrate, and execute the “render safe” operations of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and
explosive ordnance disposal (CBRNE) functions stemming from threats posed by unexploded ordnance (UXO),
improvised explosive devices (IED), and weapons of mass destruction (WMD). These officers lead, manage, plan, and
direct activities and organizations concerned with identification, location, rendering safe, handling, removal, and
disposal of U.S. and foreign unexploded conventional, nuclear, and chemical munitions and IEDs. Additionally, EOD
officers provide support/protection to the President of the United States, senior American officials, military and foreign
dignitaries, and support intelligence activities through analysis of foreign munitions, technical and biometric exploita-
tion of IEDs, and perform the forensic analysis of post-blast explosive materials.
35–15. Ordnance officer development
   a. Officer Development Model. The Officer Development Model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental and
Multinational (JIIM) experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation at the 4th or 7th year develops both specific and broad functional competencies.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive for training and assignments
that will broaden and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These broadening opportunities are
outside one’s normal branch or functional area career development, and are joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and
multinational in nature.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (6) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   b. Ordnance lieutenant development. Ordnance lieutenants lead Soldiers in platoons and sections in semi-autono-
mous activities in the fight or in support of the fight.
   (1) Education. During the second lieutenant years, Ordnance lieutenants are required to complete Ordnance BOLC
III and complete a bachelor’s degree. Upon graduation from Ordnance BOLC III, officers should expect to serve at the
company level in order to execute Ordnance competencies, such as field and sustainment maintenance operations,
workload management, use of Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS), requisition, stock control,
and flow of repair parts and ammunition, and if EOD, dispose of and render safe unexploded ordnance.
   (2) Assignment. Lieutenants will serve in one or more of the following positions: Typical positions may include, but
are not limited to, platoon leader, maintenance control officer, company executive officer, ammunition control officer,
EOD Operations officer, Assistant S–4, or operations officer. Lieutenants may also gain staff experience at battalion
level. Because all initial assignments are important, all officers should be primarily concerned with manner of
performance, development of professional attributes, enthusiasm for the job, and demonstration of potential.
   (3) Self-development. Lieutenants must focus on acquiring and refining troop-leading skills, Ordnance com-
petencies, communication, management, and technical and tactical skills.
   (4) Desired experience. Lieutenants should strive to become technical and tactical experts by training with the WOs
and senior enlisted Soldiers in their units. Lieutenants must learn the intricacies of how to best lead and take care of
troops to support their commands and manage the maintenance process, such as manage work order flow, common
equipment failures and repair, repair parts management, and tracking work orders and parts status through automated
systems. Before promotion to captain, officers should possess an excellent knowledge of the Ordnance competencies
and have basic knowledge of other logistics competencies.
   c. Ordnance captain development.
   (1) Education. Upon graduation of the Combined Logistics Captain Career Course (CLC3), Ordnance officers will
be inducted Logistics branch. (See chapter 35–4 for an explanation of Logistics branch.)
   (2) KD assignments. Company command is the only key developmental experience recognized at the captain level.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Along with command, captains continue to gain an in-depth
understanding of the multiple aspects of logistical operations and are more involved with battalion and brigade-level
staff operations. Ordnance captains positions include Transition Team Maintenance Mentor, maintenance staff officer,
ammunition supply officer, munitions materiel management officer, EOD operations officer, or observer/controller at
Army or Joint training centers.
   (4) Self-development. All Ordnance officers should seek opportunities available to them within all Ordnance
competencies. For example, officers who have worked ammunition should seek opportunities in maintenance positions.
326                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   (5) Desired experience throughout this period, the officer continues to develop leadership, tactical, technical, and
management skills. This foundation of knowledge is required to effectively serve as a leader at the company and
battalion level. Captains gain a working knowledge of command principles, battalion-level staff operations, and
logistical operations at the battalion to brigade levels.
   d. Ordnance major development. Ordnance majors continue development efforts through ILE and key developmen-
tal assignments encompassing all aspects of multifunctional logistics as well as functional Ordnance areas. Majors
desiring to command Ordnance functional battalion-level troop units should have previous functional assignment
experience.
   (1) Education. Ordnance majors continue development efforts through ILE and key developmental assignments
encompassing all aspects of multifunctional logistics as well as functional Ordnance areas. Though not required, majors
desiring to command Ordnance functional battalion-level troop units should have previous Ordnance branch or
functional assignment experience. Ordnance majors should also seek assignments in JIIM organizations toward joint
service qualification.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Although there is no one particular KD job in a specific logistics unit that is
considered “most important” or a “must have” for promotion selection, the type of unit in which you have your key
developmental experiences will, in part, influence the type of unit that you may be most suited to command and may
dictate your competitiveness within that command category. OD major key developmental assignments include the
following positions:
   (a) Ammunition Battalion Executive Officer
   (b) Ammunition Battalion Operations Officer (S3)
   (c) EOD Battalion Executive Officer
   (d) EOD Brigade and Battalion Operation Officer (S3)
   (e) Transition Team Senior Mentor.
   (f) Brigade Logistics Support team Chief.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Ordnance officers should seek assignments to gain experience at
the corps level or higher and in JIIM organizations. Positions include: Transition Team Senior Mentor, Senior
Observer/Controller at Army and Joint Training Centers, XO or primary staff officer in a maintenance, ammunition, or
EOD battalion or group, and Corps or JIIM level ammunition officer.
   (4) Self-development. Officers should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their warfighting
perspective and should include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training.
   (5) Desired experience. Field grade officers should strive to. become an expert in all aspects of logistics and the
application of Ordnance competencies to include application within the context of JIIM operations.
   e. Lieutenant colonel development. The majority of LTC positions are designated multifunctional. However, officers
serving in primary AOC 89E and/or secondary AOC 91A may be assigned to functional Ordnance command and staff
positions. As with majors, Ordnance lieutenant colonels should also seek assignments JIIM organizations toward joint
service qualification.
   (1) Education. OD lieutenant colonels should continue to seek educational opportunities that enhance battalion
command potential, and multifunctional, functional and joint service experience. Selected OD lieutenant colonels will
attend Senior Service College (SSC), senior professional military education and leader development training that
prepare senior leaders to assume strategic leadership responsibilities in military or national security organizations. OD
lieutenant colonels selected for CSL Battalion Command/Key Billet positions will attend applicable Pre-Command
Courses.
   (2) Key developmental assignments. Successful command of any CSL logistics, multifunctional, or functional
maintenance, ammunition or EOD battalion.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. Ordnance officers should seek assignments and experience at the
corps level or higher, and in JIIM organizations. Positions include: Transition Team Senior Mentor, Senior Observer/
Controller at Army and Joint Training Centers, primary staff officer for maintenance, ammunition, or EOD at the corps
level or higher.
   (4) Self-development. Officers should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden their warfighting
perspective and should include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training. Officers should
submit articles to professional publications.
   (5) Desired experience. These assignments have increased responsibility and require mature, skilled, and well-
grounded officers. Field grade officers should strive to become an expert in all aspects of logistics and the application
of Ordnance competencies.
   f. Ordnance colonel development. The majority of colonel positions are designated multifunctional and joint duty.
However, officers holding primary AOC 89E and/or secondary AOC 91A/D may be assigned to functional Ordnance
command and staff positions. Ordnance colonels should continue to seek assignments in JIIM organizations toward
joint service qualification.
   (1) Education. Selected OD colonels will attend Senior Service College (SSC), senior professional military educa-
tion and leader development training to prepare senior leaders to assume strategic leadership responsibilities in military
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                              327

or national security organizations. OD colonels selected for CSL Brigade level Command/Key Billet positions will
attend applicable Pre-Command Courses.
   (2) KD assignments. Successful CSL designated OD Colonel Command/Key Billet selection is the most critical
colonel key developmental assignment.
   (3) Developmental and broadening assignments. In addition to multifunctional logistics positions, Ordnance colonels
can serve in key staff positions at Army, joint, and senior-level headquarters, such as USA Tank-Automotive and
Armaments Command and Army Materiel Command.
   (4) Self-development. Self-development opportunities include nonresident SSC completion for those not selected for
resident course attendance. Other educational opportunities include: graduate degree, Joint Forces Staff College (Joint
Professional Military Education Level II), and International Society of Logistics Engineers (SOLE) Certified Profes-
sional Logistician Program.
   (5) Desired experience. Colonels will serve primarily in key staff and/or joint positions in expeditionary sustainment
commands, theater sustainment commands, and division, corps, and higher staffs. Select colonels will have the
opportunity to command brigades. Successful completion of brigade command will provide an opportunity to serve in
positions of greater responsibility. Former brigade commanders are given the opportunity to serve as deputy command-
ing officers, chiefs of staff and support operation officers of expeditionary sustainment commands, deputy commandant
at the Ordnance, Transportation and Quartermaster Schools. In addition, former brigade commanders can serve as
executive officers for general officers to the commanding generals of the logistics ACOMs and Army DCS, G–4.

35–16. Ordnance warrant officer development
   a. Unique knowledge and skills of an Ordnance warrant officer. Ordnance branch requires WOs who are skilled
technicians in their specialty. Every WO learns and trains to be a well-rounded logistician while gaining expertise in
their specialty through progressive levels of assignments. Ordnance WOs must meet certain standards in terms of
professional development and operational assignments to evolve as a well-rounded senior WO within their specialty.
Meeting these standards ensures the WO has acquired the skills, knowledge, and attributes to remain proficient in their
specialty and serve at all levels within the Army. The Warrant Officer Education System requires specific training
designed to prepare WOs to serve in positions of greater responsibility at all levels in the Army. Ordnance branch
requires WOs to be skilled technicians in their specialty. The WO developmental model is shown at figure 35–8 and
figure 35–9.

   b. Ordnance Warrant Officer Development Model. The Warrant Officer Development Model is focused more on the
quality and range of experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) W01/CW2. Throughout a warrant officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain operational assignment
experience. Warrant officers should continue their self-development, professional reading and pursuit of education
goals.
   (3) CW3/CW4. At this point in a warrant officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain a broaden
                                              DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           329

understanding of their AOC/MOS. Nominative assignment should be sought. Warrant officers should continue their
self-development, professional reading and pursuit of the next civil education goals.
   (4) CW5. Capstone achievement for all AOC/MOSs. Once an officer has received his or her functional AOC
capstone designation it is then that they should strive to get training and assignments that will give them the additional
skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. This training and assignments are outside one’s normal career path and
are nominative or joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational in nature. Lifelong learning, supported by
both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop both joint and expeditionary com-
petencies. Flexible timelines enable warrant officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring warrant
officers have adequate time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   c. Warrant officer one (WO1) development.
   (1) Education. After completing the WOCS, the WO1s attend their MOS WOBC. Appointment to WO1 is contin-
gent upon successfully completing the WOBC for the officer’s respective MOS. Although not a requirement for
promotion, all officers in the grade of WO1 and CW2 should set as a goal the completion of an associate’s degree.
   (2) Assignment. Junior-level tactical and technical experts who should expect to serve at the TOE platoon, company,
and battalion level, with some brigade and higher level support positions in the following type units: forward support

35–17. Ordnance Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. RC Ordnance officer development objectives and qualifications basically parallel
those planned for their Active Army counterparts, with the difference being the RC TIS/TIG requirements. Junior
officers must develop a strong foundation through assignments in their branch before specialization begins.
   b. KD assignments. Even though RC officers are limited by geographical considerations, they should strive for an
initial assignment within the Ordnance competencies of ammunition, maintenance, and, when possible, EOD.
   (1) Lieutenant. At the rank of lieutenant, the officer should concentrate on developing leadership abilities and
communicative, management, technical, and tactical skills. This is the stage where officers develop their basic
foundation for the rest of their careers. If there is a limited leadership opportunity available within the Ordnance
competencies in an officer’s initial assignment, the officer should strive to seek to increase logistics knowledge within
the Transportation or Quartermaster competencies and pursue an Ordnance-related position when available as a follow
on assignment. In all assignments, lieutenants should concentrate on learning the basics of how the Army works, how
to lead Soldiers, and how to maintain a motivated and positive outlook.
   (a) During the second lieutenant years, RC officers are required to complete Ordnance BOLC III and complete a
bachelor’s degree. Second lieutenants should strive to become technical and tactical experts by training with the WOs
and senior enlisted Soldiers in their units. Second lieutenants must learn the intricacies of how to best lead and take
care of troops to support their commands and manage the maintenance process, such as manage work order flow,
common equipment failures and repair, repair parts management, and tracking work orders and parts status through
automated systems.
   (b) During the first lieutenant years, the focus is on acquiring and refining troop-leading skills, Ordnance com-
petencies, coordination abilities, and increasing logistics and administrative skills. Typical positions may include, but
are not limited to, platoon leader, maintenance control officer, and company XO or detachment commander. Within 2
years of consideration for promotion to captain, RC officers should enroll and begin the RC CCC (Ordnance) and
332                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

continue to hone troop leading procedures. Because all initial assignments are important, an officer should be primarily
concerned with manner of performance, development of professional attributes, enthusiasm for the job, and demon-
strate potential. Before promotion to captain, officers should possess an excellent knowledge of the Ordnance com-
petencies and have basic knowledge of other logistics competencies.
   (c) Branch transfer. Lieutenants that have completed other than Ordnance BOLC III must take the Ordnance Officer
Branch Qualification Course, available on line on the Army distributed learning Web site. Student assistance; students
need to go to the Army Training Support Center (ATSC)/TRADOC Educational Data System-Redesign (TREDS–R)
Web site at Fort Eustis, VA, at https://www.aimsrdl.atsc.army.mil/secured/accp_top.htm, which gives them the ability
to access their active and history data and update their personal data, thus, ensuring they receive all materials for the
course.
   (2) Captain. Emphasis begins at the rank of captain on achieving KD assignments, such as the privilege of
commanding troops. Throughout this period, the officer continues to develop leadership, tactical, technical, and
management skills. This foundation of knowledge is required to effectively serve as a leader at the company and
battalion level. Captains gain a working knowledge of command principles, battalion-level staff operations, and
logistical operations at the battalion to brigade levels.
   (a) For promotion to the rank of captain, a bachelor’s degree is required. Officers will complete the RC CCC
(Ordnance). Additionally, it is recommended they complete the Support Operations Course (SOC) to prepare captains
for the transition into the Logistics branch. Prior to enrolling in ILE, officers must complete the combined arms
exercise (CAX). The CAX prepares officers for staff duties at the battalion or higher levels.
   (b) Captains should seek the responsibility of commanding troops. When not in command, typically captains will
occupy assignments as battalion staff officers, battalion-level primary staff officers, training division staff officers,
JFHQ staff officers, or school instructors.
   (c) Captains should continue to gain an in-depth understanding of logistics operations and become proficient in other
Ordnance competencies, if they have not the opportunity to do so. The Associate Theater Logistics (ATLog) Studies
Program, advanced maintenance or supply courses, Reserve Component Theater Sustainment Course, Support Opera-
tions Course Phase I and II, or an advanced degree in engineering, physical science, business, or logistics management
all contribute to the Ordnance officer’s professional development. However, job performance, completion of KD
assignment requirements, and logistics experience are required to prepare the officer for advancement to the next grade.
   (3) Major. At the rank of major, an officer is focused on developing upper level staff skills, completing KD
assignments, and successfully completing the ILE course. Majors must complete at least 50 percent of ILE before they
will be considered eligible for promotion to lieutenant colonel. Majors should also seek higher logistics education
programs, such as ATLog Studies Program, and the Reserve Component Theater Sustainment Course. Majors should
seek multifunctional logistics battalion XO, S3, materiel management officer, support operations officer, materiel
officer, and brigade S4 positions. Majors should continue self-development efforts to become expert in Ordnance
competencies and other logistics competencies and understanding of Joint and combined operations. Self-development
should include correspondence courses, civilian education, and institutional training. Officers should devote time to a
professional reading program to broaden their warfighting perspective.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel. At the rank of lieutenant colonel, an officer’s should focus on successfully completing
lieutenant colonel-level command and/or serving in key multifunctional logistics headquarters staff positions. Educa-
tional opportunities include the ATLog Studies Program, and the Reserve Component Theater Sustainment Course.
Lieutenant colonel career objectives:
   (a) Complete a pre-command course (PCC) when selected for battalion command.
   (b) Key assignments include battalion commander of a multifunctional logistics, ammunition, or EOD battalion; key
staff in sustainment brigades; maintenance division chief at USAR command headquarters; Joint Staff in a state
command; director for maintenance at area readiness support groups; deputy assistant chief of staff materiel; materiel
maintenance officer; plans officer at a materiel management center; or maintenance evaluation team leader at a training
division.
   (c) Officers should complete resident RC or advanced distributed learning (ADL) ILE. Officers should further their
military education by enrolling in courses like the RC National Security Course.
   (5) Colonel. At the rank of colonel, officers should have a broad background in multifunctional logistics with highly
developed skills in materiel management. Colonel career objectives include the following: successfully complete
colonel-level command of a group or activity — if selected and serve on a general staff. Officers must attend the
Senior Service College (SSC) or enroll in the AWC Distance Education Course. Completion of 50 percent of ILE is a
requirement for promotion to colonel.
   (6) Branch transfer. Officers who wish to branch transfer at the rank of captain through colonel must transfer into
the Logistics branch. Officers who wish to hold an Ordnance AOC within the Logistics branch must take the Ordnance
Officer Branch Qualification Course, available online on the Army Distributed Learning Web site. Officers (CPT
through COL) desiring to branch transfer into Logistics branch with a secondary specialty in the Quartermaster Corps
must successfully complete the Quartermaster Reserve Component Captain Career Course (RC CCC) Phase 2 and a
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                           333

logistics RC CCC phase 4, Support Operations Course, Reserve Component Theater Sustainment Course, or Theater
Logistics Studies Program. Branch transfer is not open to lieutenants.
35–18. Ordnance Reserve Component warrant officers
   a. General career development. The RC WO development objectives and qualifications basically parallel those of
the Active Army, with the difference being the RC TIS and TIG requirements.

   b. KD assignments. The RC WOs, like their Active Army counterparts, are assigned to positions requiring their
unique military occupational skills and grade.
   c. Reserve Component warrant officer development. The RC WO development objectives and qualifications basi-
cally parallel those of the Active Army, with the difference being the RC time in service and time in grade
requirements. RC WOs, like their Active Army counterparts, are assigned to positions requiring their unique military
occupational skills and grade. Refer to the previous paragraphs concerning WO development for information on
appropriate assignments for each WO grade and figures 35–10 and 35–11.

35–19. Introduction to the Quartermaster Branch
   a. Purpose. Quartermasters have a proud legacy of sustaining Soldiers since 1775 and are the Army’s logistics
warriors who provide supply and service support to America’s forces anywhere in the world at anytime. Quartermasters
play key roles in generating and sustaining combat ready units. Combat readiness is achieved with logistical readiness;
the timely delivery of serviceable materiel and sufficient resources with the systems to sustain operations on a fluid
battlefield is critical to generating capabilities to fight and win the joint fight. The officers, warrant officers, and
enlisted Soldiers of the Quartermaster branch sustain military operations by providing timely supply support, field
services, aerial delivery support, materiel, and distribution management. They are responsible for doctrine, training, and
professional development of Active Army, Reserve Component (RC), civilian personnel, other Services and allies in
U.S. Army Quartermaster skill areas. Quartermasters, combined with logistics warriors from Ordnance and Transporta-
tion, are the key to sustaining Soldiers, directing logistics plans and operations across the entire operational spectrum of
conflict.

35–20. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess base characteristics that will enable
them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army Values and the
warrior ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the entire operational
spectrum of conflict. They must be able to operate in Joint Interagency, Intergovernmental, Multinational (JIIM)
environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving their objectives. Quartermaster officers must be
culturally astute and able to use their awareness and understanding to conduct operations innovatively and
courageously to exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the operational environment. Further
explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of a Quartermaster officer. Quartermaster officers must be highly qualified,
tactically and operationally oriented professionals who provide seamless logistical support in combat and other
missions. Quartermaster officers must be warrior logisticians skilled in war-fighting tactics, techniques, and procedures;
possess strong Army Values; and be technically competent in Quartermaster functions. They must be strong leaders
with the skills and attributes necessary to assure success in a dynamic, complex and often hostile environment.
Quartermaster officers are builders of leaders and teams focused on the profession of military logistics. A Quartermas-
ter officer is a lifelong learner dedicated to obtaining and building throughout a career on the unique skills and
knowledge of supply distribution, fuel, water, subsistence, aerial delivery, field services, and mortuary affairs. These
functions set the foundation for the Quartermaster officer to build upon as they move from functional assignments to
multifunctional assignments. Every officer learns and trains to be a well-rounded logistician, gaining expertise and
experience in diverse specialties and skills. This section describes the skills, knowledge, and attributes required by the
Quartermaster officer in order to successfully transition the Quartermaster officer to the Logistics branch after the
Combined Logistics Captain Career Course (CLC3). All Quartermaster officer AOCs and the skill identifiers are open
to male and female officers.
   c. Unique skills. Quartermaster officers will serve in one of two AOCs and two skill identifiers (SI). Officers gain
and develop these skills through multiple operational assignments and continuous professional study and self-develop-
ment. Quartermaster officers often work in an environment where time available for problem analysis is seriously
constrained but where sound timely decisions are urgent. Information gained in this environment will vary in its
completeness and ambiguity. An ability to operate under stress, make decisions, and act in austere field conditions is
critical to mission success. Quartermaster officers are functional, supply-oriented logisticians capable of developing
their skills and experiences in the diverse profession of multifunctional military logistics. They support victory by
living the Army Values and enforcing high standards of training, physical fitness, and discipline. They are war-fighters
extremely well versed in doctrine. However, they are also adaptable to changing environments and can update logistics
estimates and apply non-text book solutions to unique situations during full-spectrum operations. The dynamics
associated with training and operational missions require a sense of ingenuity, foresight, stamina and sustained physical
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            337

endurance. These standards require officers to know and routinely execute drills and operate within established
Standard Operating Procedures. Officers must meet certain requirements in terms of schooling and operational
assignments to be proficient at each grade. These requirements are met through developmental assignments demonstrat-
ing the officer has the required skills, knowledge, and attributes in order to remain competitive for promotion. Each
officer, with support from mentors, should develop career goals and clearly articulate those goals to their assignments
officer at Army Human Resources Command (AHRC). Always remember that an officer is his or her own best career
manager. By actively participating in the management of career decisions, officers will improve the likelihood of a
successful career. Officers may use the Quartermaster branch training and development model (figure 35–13) as a
guideline for maintaining functional expertise throughout their career.
   (1) Quartermaster, Supply and Materiel Management (AOC 92A). The officer commands, directs, plans and imple-
ments multifunctional areas of materiel management and their integration into the overall DOD logistics system as well
as support interface between the Army in the field, wholesale logistics and industry. Command, direct and/or exercises

including search, recovery, tentative identification and evacuation of deceased personnel, collection, and disposition of
personal effects of decedents.
35–21. Officer development
   a. Officer Development Model. The Officer Development Model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation at the 4th or 7th year develops both specific and broad functional competencies.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive for training and assignments
that will broaden and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These broadening opportunities are
outside one’s normal branch or functional area career development, and are JIIM in nature.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (6) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   b. Lieutenant development. All officers accessed into the Quartermaster Corps are designated AOC 92A, Quarter-
master, Supply and Materiel Management. Selected officers receive additional entry level training as a mortuary affairs
officer (skill identifier 4V) and/or aerial delivery and materiel officer (skill identifier R9). By regulation, only QM
officers possessing skill identifier R9 may fill parachute rigger positions.
   (1) Education. To prepare newly commissioned Quartermaster officers to meet the challenge of their duties,
lieutenants begin their formal military officer professional development training by attending the Basic Officer Leader
Course (BOLC) II and III. The BOLC II students receive common core training designed to further develop them into
competent small unit leaders with a common warfighting focus and warrior ethos. The BOLC III, conducted at Fort
Lee, VA consists of Quartermaster Branch specific technical and tactical training in AOC 92A. The BOLC III
functional training prepares Quartermaster lieutenants to function as platoon leaders capable of performing common
Soldier skills and entry level technical tasks in technical supply, distribution, and materiel management; petroleum and
water operations; subsistence management; general material management; and field services.
   (2) Self-development. The Quartermaster Corps needs officers trained to perform duties in a wide range of areas.
Accordingly, newly commissioned QM officers should actively pursue civilian and military professional development
opportunities that enhance base level common core and functional logistics expertise. Officer Candidate School
graduates must complete baccalaureate degree requirements prior to promotion to captain. Upon BOLC III completion,
selected QM lieutenants may attend mortuary affairs officer (skill identifier 4V), aerial delivery and materiel officer
(skill identifier R9) / Sling Load Certification functional courses. Others will have the opportunity to attend career
enhancing Army training such as Airborne (skill identifier 5P), Ranger (skill identifier 5R or 5S), Air Assault (skill
identifier 2B), and Pathfinder (skill identifier 5Q). QM officers must possess the airborne identifier prior to attending
the aerial delivery and materiel officer course (ADMOC).

35–23. Warrant officer development
   a. Unique knowledge and skills of a Quartermaster warrant officer. Quartermaster warrant officers are expert
technicians and war-fighters who are technically proficient able to manage and maintain Army property accounting
systems, supply accounting systems, airdrop support systems, food service programs, petroleum, and water systems.
They are self-aware and adaptive Quartermaster technical experts, leaders, trainers, and advisors who must maintain the
proper balance between their technical skills and the ability to understand and apply appropriate tactical skills at the
right moment. Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, Quartermaster WOs
administer, manage, maintain, operate, and integrate Quartermaster systems and equipment across all levels within the
Army. Quartermaster WOs are innovative integrators of emerging logistical technologies, dynamic teachers, confident

   c. Warrant Officer Development Model. The Warrant Officer Development Model is focused more on the quality
and range of experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) W1/CW2. Throughout a warrant officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain operational assignment
experience. The WOs should continue their self-development, professional reading and pursuit of education goals.
   (3) CW3/CW4. At this point in a warrant officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain a broaden
344                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

understanding of their AOC/MOS. Nominative assignment should be sought. WOs should continue their self-develop-
ment, professional reading and pursuit of the next civil education goals.
   (4) CW5. Capstone achievement for all MOSs. Once a warrant officer has received his or her functional AOC
capstone designation it is then that they should strive to get training and assignments that will give them the additional
skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. This training and assignments are outside one’s normal career path and
are nominative or joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational in nature. Lifelong learning, supported by
both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop both joint and expeditionary com-
petencies. Flexible time lines enable warrant officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring warrant
officers have adequate time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   d. Warrant officer one development. The WOs must meet certain professional developmental standards in terms of
schooling and operational assignments to evolve as a well-rounded senior/master WO within their specialty. Meeting
these standards ensures the WO has acquired the skills, knowledge, and attributes to remain proficient in their specialty
and serve at all levels within the Army. For a WO to be considered fully trained in the Quartermaster branch, they
should be tactically and technically proficient, be physically fit, and be of the highest moral and ethical character.
Recognizing that various assignments require different strengths, techniques, and backgrounds, a warrant officer’s most
important assignment is the current one and therefore should focus on an outstanding performance in that job
assignment. Quartermaster branch requires WOs who are skilled technicians in their specialty. Every WO learns and
trains to be a well-rounded logistician while gaining expertise in their specialty through progressive levels of assign-
ments. All Quartermaster warrant officer MOSs are open to male and female Soldiers. Quartermaster WO life-cycle
development and utilization are listed at figure 35–14 for MOSs 920A, 920B, 921A and 922A and figure 35–15 for
MOS 923A, below.

developing officership skills. Upon successful completion of WOBC, the WO is certified in their MOS and given an
initial operational assignment commensurate with their rank. The WO1s should begin work on the prerequisite course
for the Warrant Officer Advanced Course. This is an MOS-immaterial course administered by the Distributive
Education Section of the Warrant Officer Career Center. Successful completion of this course is a requirement prior to
attendance to the resident Quartermaster Warrant Officer Advanced Course.
   (2) Assignment. The WO1s can expect junior level assignments within their specialty which are typically at the
battalion level. These assignments give the junior Quartermaster WO a solid base of experience, depth, and breadth on
systems and processes that ultimately prepares them for assignments at the brigade and higher levels.
   (3) Self-development. Self-development should include correspondence courses, institutional training, and civilian
education. The WO1s should devote time to a professional reading program to broaden both their war-fighting
perspective and technical comprehension. Civilian education objectives should include working towards obtaining an
associates degree. The WO1s who do not possess an associate degree are strongly encouraged to pursue this
educational goal.
   (4) Desired experience. The WO1s are entry level warrant officers who should possess basic level tactical and
technical experience. Successive functional expertise will be gained with progressive assignments within their specialty.

Degree Program with the Florida Institute of Technology (FIT). Quartermaster WOs also have the opportunity to
participate in the Training with Industry (TWI) Program. The TWI program provides warrant officers an opportunity to
spend up to 12 months with a civilian industry that provides training in industrial procedures and practices. The
training is designed to enhance knowledge, experience, and perspectives in management and operational techniques.
The TWI program is very competitive and requires the WO to coordinate with the Quartermaster WO career manager
at the Human Resources Command.
   (5) Desired experience. The CW4s serve as senior technical and tactical experts who are expected to perform their
primary technical and MOS immaterial duties at various levels within the Army.
   h. CW5 development.
   (1) Education. After completion of all required warrant officer technical and MOS immaterial training, there are no
additional military educational requirements for Quartermaster CW5s. However, CW5s are encouraged to continue with
self-development by pursuing civilian education objectives by working towards completing a baccalaureate degree in a
logistics-related field (such as logistics or business management). The CW5s who have not completed a baccalaureate
degree are strongly encouraged to complete this educational goal and pursue graduate level education.

serve in Army command or higher level positions. The CW5s provide leader development, mentorship, advice, and
counsel to NCOs, WOs, and branch officers. CW5s have special mentorship responsibilities for other WOs at all levels
and specialties and provide essential advice to commanders on Quartermaster technical and WO issues. The CW5s
should sharpen their knowledge of personnel force-integration functions for doctrine, training and personnel as pertains
to Quartermaster functions. In addition, CW5s should become familiar with the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory
basis for the force projection Army and the capabilities that must be sustained through management of doctrinal,
organizational, and materiel change; become familiar with Army organizational roles, function, and missions, especially
at the Army command and Army Secretariat/staff levels; and with the force management processes, from the determi-
nation of force requirements through researching of requirements and the assessment of their utilization in order to
accomplish Army functions and missions in a joint/combined environment.

35–24. Reserve Component officers
   a. General career development. The Quartermaster RC officer plays an important role in the Quartermaster combat
service support mission. The RC comprises the majority of units and personnel in the Quartermaster branch. The RC
Quartermaster officer development objectives and qualifications basically parallel those planned for their Active Army
counterparts
   b. Branch preferred assignments and development opportunities. Even though RC officers are limited by geographi-
cal considerations, they should strive for Quartermaster assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as
their Active Army counterparts. Reserve officers commissioned into the Quartermaster branch are designated AOC
92A, Quartermaster, Supply and Materiel Management, by the Commander, Army Human Resource Command-St.
Louis (AHRC–St. Louis) or The Adjutant General (TAG) of the state to which assigned for Army National Guard
officers. RC Quartermaster officers may attend specialized courses relating to various Quartermaster AOCs, such as the
Air Delivery and Materiel Officer Course skill identifier R9, Advanced Petroleum/Water Management AOC 92F, or the
Mortuary Affairs Course for skill identifier (SI) 4V. Upon promotion to captain, some RC Quartermaster officers may
be awarded a 92F AOC or R9 SI, respectively, by the Commander, Army Human Resource Command-St. Louis
(AHRC–St. Louis), or by being assigned to a troop program unit (TPU) position in one of these AOCs upon
completing the Supply and Service Management Officers Course (SSMO), Combined Logistics Captain Career Course
(CLC3) or the Reserve Component Captain Career Course (Quartermaster). However, the vast majority of RC
Quartermaster officers are awarded AOC 92A.
   c. Professional development. Professional development for RC officers is divided into phases from the grade of LT
to COL (see fig 35–16, below). These phases are described below.
   (1) Lieutenant. The initial development of a Quartermaster officer include establishment of basic leadership skills in
the areas of communication, management, technical and tactical knowledge, and troop-leading experience. Officers
must complete Quartermaster Basic Officer Leader Course within 2 years of initial appointment or completion of
350                                         DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

college if commissioned early. Typical assignment positions may include, but are not limited to, platoon leader, supply
and service officer, company executive officer or petroleum officer. If there is a limited leadership opportunity
available within the Quartermaster competencies in an officer’s initial assignment, the officer should strive to seek to
increase logistics knowledge within the Transportation or Ordnance competencies and pursue a Quartermaster-related
position when available as a follow-on assignment. LTs should strive to become technical and tactical experts by
training with the WOs and senior enlisted Soldiers in their units. Within 2 years of consideration for promotion to
captain, RC officers should enroll and begin the Reserve Component Captain Career Course (Quartermaster) and
continue to hone troop leading procedures. Because all initial assignments are important, an officer should be primarily
concerned with manner of performance, development of professional attributes, enthusiasm for the job and demonstra-
tion of potential. Before promotion to captain, officers should possess an excellent knowledge of Quartermaster
competencies and have basic knowledge of other logistics competencies.
   (2) Captain. During this phase, an officer requires completion of educational requirements as well as successful
command or time in troop leadership positions. Throughout this phase, the officer continues to develop leadership,
tactical, technical, communication, and management skills. The RC officers must attend CLC3 or the Reserve
Component Captain Career Course (Quartermaster) prior to consideration for promotion to the grade of major.
Additionally, it is recommended to complete the Support Operations Course (SOC) to prepare captains for the
transition into the Logistics branch. Prior to enrolling in ILE, officers must complete the Combined Arms Exercise
(CAX). CAX prepares officers for staff duties at the battalion or higher levels.
   (3) Major. At the grade of major, focus is on the development of upper-level staff skills and branch competencies.
Majors must complete at least 50 percent of ILE before they will be considered eligible for promotion to LTC.
Quartermaster branch training should be continued through developmental assignments, such as battalion/brigade/group
XO/S3, support operations officer, or Quartermaster staff officer at a sustainment brigade or sustainment command. In
addition to these objectives, officers should further develop their Quartermaster education. The Associate Logistics
Executive Development Course, other U.S. Army Logistics Management College courses, and an advanced degree all
contribute to the professional development of a RC Quartermaster officer.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel and colonel. This is the utilization stage in a RC officer’s career. Emphasis is placed on an
officer successfully completing LTC- and COL-level commands as well as serving in key Quartermaster or multifunc-
tional/logistical staff positions at the Division, Corps, HQDA, DOD or joint staff levels. Officers should complete a
pre-command course when selected for LTC or COL command. In addition, all officers should strive to complete their
military education-level requirements. For LTCs, completion of ILE is required for promotion to COL. Upon promo-
tion to LTC, the Chief, Army Reserve, and the Chief, National Guard Bureau, select RC officers for participation in the
U.S. Army War College Distance Education program. Except through an established resident program, completion of
the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Course is the only other means by which an Army officer can receive
credit for Senior Service College (SSC) training.
   d. Branch transfer. Officers who wish to branch transfer at the rank of CPT through COL who have already
completed a non-logistics CCC must transfer into the Logistics branch. Officers who wish to hold a Quartermaster area
of concentration within the Logistics branch must complete the Supply and Service Management Officers Course
(SSMO). As RC officers are allowed 2 weeks annual duty training, the Quartermaster Proponent will allow the QM
BOLC III course as an alternate transition course; exceptions may be granted if the officer has previously attended the
Support Operations Course (Phase I & II), RC Theater Sustainment Course and TLog Studies Program.
   e. Constructive credit. The OQMG will approve QM designation for RC captains and above who have demonstrated
sufficient past experience necessary to serve as a Quartermaster officer. Additionally, Chief, OQMG will provide
constructive credit to RC captains and above in lieu of attending the SSMO course provided they complete one of the
following courses:
   (1) Joint Course on Logistics
   (2) Support Operations Course (phase I and II)
   (3) Reserve Component Theater Sustainment Course (Reserve Component Multifunctional Combat Service Support
Course)
   (4) Theater Logistics Program Studies Course (Associate/Logistics Executive Development Course)

                                 Figure 35–16. The RC Quartermaster Developmental Chart
   f. Reserve Component warrant officer education. Military education requirements for Reserve Component Quarter-
master warrant officers differ from Active Army requirements as shown below.
   (1) Army National Guard warrant officers complete the WOAC prior to promotion to CW3. Army Reserve warrant
officers not listed on the Active Duty promotion list must complete WOAC prior to selection to CW3.
   (2) Army National Guard warrant officers must complete WOSC prior to promotion to CW4. Army Reserve warrant
officers must complete WOSC prior to selection to CW4.
   (3) Army National Guard warrant officers must complete WOSSC prior to promotion to CW5. Army Reserve
warrant officers must complete WOSSC prior to promotion to CW5.
   g. Reserve Component warrant officer development. The RC WO development objectives and qualifications basi-
cally parallel those planned for their Active Army counterparts. Junior WOs must develop a strong foundation through
assignment in their branch. Even though geographical considerations limit some RC WOs, all should strive for QM
assignments that yield the same developmental opportunities as their Active Army counterparts. The RC life-cycle
development model for QM WOs is at figure 35–17.

Adjutant General Branch
36–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. The purpose of the Adjutant General (AG) branch is to provide manpower, Human Resources (HR) and
band support to commanders at all echelons to enhance the readiness and operational capabilities of the total force and
ensure success across the full spectrum of military operations. The AG branch is an accession branch that is aligned
with the force sustainment functional category. The AG officers manage functions from the HR life-cycle that include
personnel procurement, training, professional development, distribution, sustainment, retirement or separation, to help
ensure a quality force and direct the use of Army bands to support friendly forces at home and abroad.
   b. Proponent information. The proponent for the Adjutant General’s Branch is the Commandant, Adjutant General’s
School, ATTN: Personnel and Leader Development Division, 10000 Hampton Parkway, Fort Jackson, SC 29207–7025.
Personnel developers can be reached at 803–751–8445 or DSN 734–8445.
   c. Functions. HR support includes 10 core competencies (FM 1–0, Human Resources Support, 21 Feb 07). These
competencies are unique and directly ensure Army readiness.
   (1) Personnel Readiness Management (PRM) - distribute Soldiers and Army civilians to commands based on current
Army Manning Guidance.
   (2) Personnel Accountability and Strength Reporting (PASR) - account for personnel and report unit strength data.
   (3) Personnel Information Management (PIM) - collect, process, store, and provide personnel information.
   (4) Reception, Replacement, Return to Duty (RTD), Rest and Recuperation (R&R), and Redeployment (R5) Opera-
tions - track and coordinate movement of Soldiers during these activities.
   (5) Casualty Operations - record, report, verify, and process casualty information.
                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            353

   (6) Essential Personnel Services (EPS) - provide services that update personnel status and supports readiness and
quality of life.
   (7) Postal Operations - provide postal services for authorized personnel and activities in deployed locations and
overseas.
   (8) Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) - promote fitness, build morale and cohesion, enhance quality of life,
and support to Soldiers, civilians, and their Family.
   (9) HR Planning and Staff Operations - formulate, integrate and execute HR plans to meet the unit mission and
commander’s intent.
   (10) Band Operations - provide music throughout the full spectrum of military operations to instill in our forces the
will to fight and win, foster the support of our citizens, and promote our national interests at home and abroad.
36–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for the 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army
Values and the warrior ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the
spectrum of conflict. They must be able to operate in Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM)
environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in achieving their objectives. Our officers must be culturally
astute and able to use their awareness and understanding to conduct operations innovatively and courageously to
exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the operational environment. Further explanation of these
characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of an AG officer. The AG officers must comprehend the organization, structure, and
doctrine of the warfighting Army as it evolves. In addition, they must—
   (1) Exhibit capacity and capability to understand, articulate, and solve complex concepts.
   (2) Possess the necessary technical and operational expertise in order to advise the commander and staff on the
human dimension of readiness within the operational and sustainment constructs in support of full spectrum operations.
   (3) Possess the highest standards of discretion, integrity, and professional ethics.
   (4) Possess good interpersonal and communications (verbal and written) skills.
   (5) Apply decision making theory in military organizations to optimize the Military Decision Making Process
(MDMP).
   (6) Think creatively and apply critical reasoning skills.
   (7) Must understand, manage, and use automated HR systems and common software applications.
   (8) Band Officers (42C and 420C) must have advanced knowledge of musical performance, conducting techniques,
contemporary entertainment media, military ceremonial practices and extensive training in music styles and practices.
   c. Areas of concentration. Duty positions associated in the AG branch require thoroughly trained and properly
developed officers to provide the knowledge of military HR operations, its systems, relationships, and interfaces. The
AG officer may serve in one of the areas of concentration (AOC) or skills described below:
   (1) Human Resources Officer (AOC 42B) identifies company grade HR officers.
   (2) Army Band Officer (AOC 42C) identifies all Army band company and field grade officers.
   (3) Senior Human Resources Officer (AOC 42H) identifies non-band field grade HR officers.
   (4) Human Resources Technician (MOS 420A) identifies HR warrant officers of all grades.
   (5) Army Band Warrant Officer (MOS 420C) identifies Army band warrant officers.
   (6) Postal Operations (SI 4J). Officers who hold this skill identifier formulate policies for and direct the activities of
units engaged in postal operations. Individuals must complete the Joint Service Postal Operations Course and/or the
Postal Supervisor’s Course. This skill identifier is only awarded to HR officers.
36–3. Officer development
   a. Officer Development Model. The Officer Development Model is focused more on the quality and range of
experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation at the 4th or 7th year develops both specific and broad functional competencies.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive for training and assignments
that will broaden and develop the skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These broadening opportunities are
outside one’s normal branch or functional area career development, and are joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and
multinational in nature.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
354                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   (6) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   (7) All HR officers should seek membership and certification in HR associations like the Society of Human
Resource Management or the International Public Management Association for Human Resources.

36–4. Warrant officer development
   a. Warrant Officer Development Model. The Warrant Officer Development Model is focused more on the quality
and range of experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry warrant officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) W1/CW2. Throughout a warrant officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain operational assignment
experience. The WOs should continue their self-development, professional reading and pursuit of education goals.
   (3) CW3/CW4. At this point in a WO career, the model highlights the need to gain a broad understanding of their
AOC/MOS. Nominative assignments should be sought. WOs should continue their self-development, professional
reading and pursuit of the next civil education goals.
   (4) CW5. Capstone achievement for all AOC/MOS. Once an officer has received his or her functional AOC
capstone designation it is then that they should strive to get training and assignments that will give them the additional
skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. This training and assignments are outside one’s normal career path and
are nominative or joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational (JIIM) in nature. Lifelong learning, sup-
ported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop both joint and expeditionary
competencies. Flexible time lines enable warrant officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring
warrant officers have adequate time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   (5) All HR warrant officers should seek membership and certification in HR associations like the Society of Human
Resource Management or the International Public Management Association for Human Resources.
   b. WO1/CW2 (420A/420C) development.
   (1) Education: The 420As-WO1/CW2s will successfully complete the Human Resources (HR) Technician Warrant
Officer Basic Course (WOBC) and prerequisite studies for the Warrant Officer Advance Course (WOAC). The 420Cs-

Financial Management Branch
Merger of branch code (BC) 44 (Finance) and functional area (FA) 45 (Comptroller) to BC 36 (Financial Management)
On 1 October 2008, the Army merged branch code 44 (Finance) and functional area 45 (Comptroller) into a single
officer area of concentration (AOC) branch code 36 (Financial Management). Branch code (BC) 36 officers are
referred to as Financial Managers (BC 36A).
37–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. Financial managers analyze the commander’s tasks and priorities to ensure that proper financial
resources are available to accomplish the mission and to provide recommendations to the commander on the best
allocation of scarce resources. Additionally, Financial managers support commanders by ensuring they have the ability
to sustain operations through their support to the procurement process. These capabilities are executed through properly
sized modular Financial Management (FM) structures or embedded FM personnel, providing the ability to deploy the
right mixture of FM assets based on METT–TC (FM 1–06).
   b. Proponent Information. Proponent for the Financial Management Branch is the Commandant, Financial Manage-
ment School, ATTN: Personnel Development Division, 10000 Hampton Parkway, Fort Jackson, SC 29207–7025.
Personnel Developers can be reached at 803–751–8669 or DSN 734–8669.
   c. Functions. FM encompasses the two core functions of Finance Operations and Resource Management. These
functions are distinct but mutually supportive. Finance Operations sustain the Army, Joint, and combined operations by
providing timely commercial vendor and contractual payments, providing various pay and disbursing services, and
implementing FM policies and guidance prescribed by national FM providers. Resource Management analyzes the
commander’s tasks and priorities, identifying the resource requirements that will enable the commander to accomplish
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                          363

the mission. The Financial manager is a critical enabler at all levels of the Army’s chain of command and across the
entire spectrum of operations to ensure the stewardship and efficient allocation of resources.
37–2. Officer characteristics required
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for the 21st century. These leaders must be: proficient in their
core competencies; broad enough to operate across the spectrum of conflict; able to operate in JIIM environments and
leverage other capabilities in achieving their objective; culturally astute and able to use this awareness and understand-
ing to conduct operations innovatively; courageous enough to see and exploit opportunities in the challenges and
complexities of the operational environment; and grounded in Army Values and warrior ethos. Further explanation of
these characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of a Financial Management officer. For entry into the Financial Management
Branch, an officer should have a baccalaureate degree with a minimum of six academic (semester) hours of accounting
or finance. Degrees specializing in finance, accounting, banking, business, economics, mathematics, computer sciences
or information systems are most beneficial in supporting the Financial Management Branch mission. Financial
management has six core competencies which include: fund the force; banking and disbursing; cost management and
accounting support; financial management; management internal controls; military pay support. To support these core
competencies FM officers must possess:
   (1) Fundamental skills in automated accounting systems that enable a Financial Manager to rapidly learn and
understand the many interrelated systems used for FM.
   (2) A basic proficiency of stand-alone and networked computers and practical experience with current business
office software.
   (3) Ability to articulate and put into operation FM outputs to senior-level decision makers.
   (4) A knowledge base of the Department of Defense military resource management process and manpower
management.
   (5) Familiarity with generally accepted accounting principles.
   (6) Comfortable with mathematical functions and evolving financial management information systems.
   (7) Be well versed on the application of the Military Decision Making Process.
   (8) An understanding of how to influence the funding cycle from Congress to local Program Budget Advisory
Council (PBAC) at installations.
   c. Unique attributes.
   (1) Analytical. Financial managers at all levels will analyze financial and management reports, operational flow, and
performance management indicators to determine quality of mission support. Systematic and scientific thought
processes are the underpinning of successful FM planning.
   (2) Financial managers maintain the highest standards of discretion, judgment, integrity, and professional ethics.
Financial managers are trusted stewards of public funds and must be comfortable being pecuniarily liable for entrusted
funds. They must use critical/conceptual thinking, and problem solving, to create solutions to surmount complex
financial management issues.
37–3. Officer development
   a. Officer Development Model. The Officer Life-cycle Development Model (figure 37–1) is focused more on the
quality and range of experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain JIIM experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation at the 4th and 7th year develops both specific and broad functional competencies.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation they should strive to get training and assignments
that will give them the additional skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These training opportunities and
assignments may be joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational in nature.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, and statesmanship, and so forth.
   (6) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   b. Lieutenant development.
   (1) Education. Completion of the Financial Management Basic Officer Leader Course (FMBOLC) will prepare the
officer for key developmental assignments.
   (2) Assignment.
   (a) FM Detachment Disbursing Officer.

leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental and
Multinational (JIIM) experience and exposure.
   (3) Functional designation at the 4th or 7th year develops both specific and broad functional competencies.
   (4) Once an officer has received his or her functional designation it is then that they should strive to get training and
assignments that will give them the additional skills necessary to lead the Army of the future. These training and
assignments are outside one’s normal career path and are joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational in
nature.
   (5) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (6) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.

Chapter 39
Judge Advocate General’s Corps
39–1. Unique features of The Judge Advocate General’s Corps
   a. Purpose. The mission of The Judge Advocate General’s Corps (JAGC) is to provide proactive legal support on all
issues affecting the Army and the Joint Force, and deliver quality legal services to Soldiers, retirees, and their Families.
This legal support encompasses the six core legal disciplines: administrative and civil law, military justice, international
and operational law, contract and fiscal law, legal assistance and claims.
   b. Proponent information. The Judge Advocate General is the branch proponent of The Judge Advocate General’s
Corps as administered through the Office of Personnel, Plans, and Training (PP&TO) at OTJAG–PT (ATTN: Chief,
PPTO), Office of The Judge Advocate General, 2200 Army Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310–2200.
   c. Functions. The JAGC is a special branch of the Army (10 USC 3064) whose duties and functions are discussed in
AR 27–1 and FM 27–100.
   (1) The JAGC consists of the following:
   (a) General officers serving as The Judge Advocate General (TJAG); The Deputy Judge Advocate General (DJAG);
Assistant Judge Advocate General for Military Law and Operations (AJAG/MLO); the Commander, U.S. Army Legal
Services Agency (USALSA); the Commander, The Judge Advocate General’s Legal Center and School (TJAGLCS),
Joint Chiefs of Staff Legal Counsel when assigned from the U.S. Army JAGC, Chief Judge, U.S. Army Court of
Criminal Appeals (Reserve Component), Assistant Judge Advocate General for Military Law and Operations (AJAG/
MLO) (Reserve Component), and Special Assistant to The Judge Advocate General ARNG.
   (b) Commissioned officers with PMOS 27A or 27B who are:
   1. in the Regular Army and appointed in the JAGC; or
   2. members of the USAR and assigned to the JAGC; or
   3. members of the ARNGUS and assigned to the JAGC.
   (c) warrant officers with PMOS 270A who are certified as legal administrators and are:
   1. in the AA and appointed in the JAGC; or
   2. members of the USAR and assigned to the JAGC; or
   3. members of the ARNGUS and assigned to the JAGC.
   (d) enlisted Soldiers with the MOS 27D who are:
   1. in the Regular Army and are assigned to the JAGC; or
   2. members of the USAR and assigned to the JAGC; or
   3. members of the ARNGUS and assigned to the JAGC.
   (e) Other members of the Army assigned to the JAGC.
   (2) TJAG is the military legal advisor to the Secretary of the Army and all officers and agencies of the Department
of the Army. Under TJAG’s authority to direct members of the JAGC in the performance of their duties (10 USC 3037
and AR 27–1) and to assign judge advocates (Article 6, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), codified at 10 USC
806; AR 614–100), TJAG recruits, selects, determines qualifications, assigns and provides legal education for members
of the JAGC. TJAG assigns all staff judge advocates (SJAs) and has final authority over all JAGC assignments.
TJAG’s frequent inspection of military legal offices in accordance with Article 6, UCMJ (10 USC 806), offers a unique
opportunity to mentor JAGC leaders directly and to monitor how junior officers are developed. In the Office of The
Judge Advocate General (OTJAG), the Personnel, Plans, and Training Office (HQDA (DAJA–PT)) manages the JAGC
under the supervision of TJAG, and represents TJAG in all Judge Advocate personnel proponent matters in coordina-
tion with TJAGLCS. The Chief Warrant Officer of the Corps represents TJAG in all warrant officer personnel
proponent matters in coordination with TJAGLCS. The Command Sergeant Major of the Corps represents TJAG in all
enlisted personnel proponent matters in coordination with TJAGLCS. Personnel policies are published annually by
TJAG in publication JAG Pub 1–1.
   (3) Judge advocates are attorneys who perform their duties under commanders of their assigned or attached
commands or under other supervisory judge advocates, such as the SJA; Chief, Trial Judiciary; or the Chief, Trial
Defense Service.
   (a) The JAGC officers include both judge advocates and warrant officer legal administrators in the AA, the USAR,
and the ARNGUS. All JAGC officers receive technical legal supervision from TJAG and from the SJAs of their higher
headquarters.
370                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

   (b) Only judge advocates assigned to the U.S. Army Trial Defense Service authorized to perform the functions of
defense counsel, or made available as an individual defense counsel, may provide advice and assistance to Soldiers
suspected, accused or convicted of violations of the UCMJ on matters relating to those violations or suspected
violations.
   (4) As much as possible, JAGC officers perform only professional legal duties for which they are trained. They
should not perform any nonlegal duties, such as officer of the day, inventory officer, range officer, casualty notification
officer, casualty assistance officer, or any other duties that would interfere with or pose a conflict of interest with their
primary assigned legal duties. For RC judge advocates assigned to legal support organizations, there are circumstances
where they must perform nonlegal duties in supporting the unit’s mission.
   (5) To ensure a diverse assignment pattern for judge advocates, TJAG has been delegated waiver authority to the
force stabilization requirements set forth in chapter one, section 9 of this regulation (see also AR 600–35).
   (6) TJAG ensures that the numbers of authorized JAGC billets, by grade, will be sufficient to meet TJAG’s statutory
responsibility to provide quality legal services to the Army. Officers desiring more information on the JAGC
authorizations or inventory should contact the Personnel, Plans and Training Office, OTJAG, 2200 Army Pentagon,
Washington, DC 20310–2200.
   (7) The JAGC branch consists of two areas of concentration with eight JAGC- specific skill identifiers and one
warrant officer MOS. Judge advocates are classified as either 27A (Judge Advocate) or 27B (Military Judge). The eight
JAGC specific skill identifiers are as follows: 3D (Government Contract Law Specialist), 3F (Patent Law Specialist),
3G (Claims/ Litigation Specialist), 3N (International Law Specialist), and 3I1, 3I2, 3I3, and 3I4 (Specialist in Military
Justice). Warrant officers in the JAGC are officers classified as 270A (Legal Administrators). These officers may hold
skill identifiers as follows: 3R (Force Management), 6M (Mobilization/Demobilization Operations), 6P (Master Fitness
Trainer), and 7Q (Training Development).
   (8) In support of 3I1, 3I2, 3I3, and 3I4 (Specialist in Military Justice), the JAGC developed four, separate, graduated
skill identifiers that allows the JAGC to better train and challenge judge advocates throughout their careers to improve
their military justice proficiency. In addition to establishing basic (and in some cases continuing) training requirements,
these skill identifiers require progressive experience in military justice and litigation.
   (a) 3I1/Code 3I - Basic Military Justice Practitioner.
   (b) 3I2/Code 3M - Senior Military Justice Practitioner.
   (c) 3I3/Code 3P - Expert Military Justice Practitioner.
   (d) 3I4/Code 3T - Master Military Justice Practitioner
39–2. Officer characteristics required (Active Army, USAR, ARNGUS)
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for the 21st century. Our leaders must be grounded in Army
Values and the warrior ethos, competent in their core proficiencies, and broadly experienced to operate across the
spectrum of conflict. They must be able to operate in JIIM environments and leverage capabilities beyond the Army in
achieving their objectives. Our officers must be culturally astute and able to use their awareness and understanding to
conduct operations innovatively and courageously to exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the
operational environment. Further explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in FM 3–0 and in chapter 3 of
this publication. Judge advocates can leverage their training and educational background to help the command in this
full-spectrum operational environment. The JAGC officers must be focused on leadership, not only within the legal
offices, but also the impact of legal operations on the command. Leadership training is required to be integrated into
courses of instruction at TJAGLCS. The JAGC officers must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy
worldwide at all times. Regardless of assignment, all JAGC officers must be deployable, with their units or as
individuals, to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of operations, from kinetic to counterinsurgency, to
stability and reconstruction. The JAGC officers must prepare themselves and their Families for this challenging life-
cycle function.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of a judge advocate. Judge advocates must have the education, training, and
experience equal or similar to that required of other members of the legal profession (10 USC 3065(e)) to include
receiving a juris doctorate from an American Bar Association accredited school law school. TJAG certifies that judge
advocates may practice law in the JAGC and this certification is required to maintain the appointment as a judge
advocate. Under the provisions of AR 27–1, judge advocates must be admitted to practice and have membership in
good standing (as defined by the pertinent licensing authority) of the licensing authority of at least one jurisdiction.
Attorney conduct is bound by the state rules of conduct in the state in which the attorney is licensed to practice law
and AR 27–26.
   (1) Judge advocates are required to maintain their good standing with their licensing authority and provide proof of
good standing when considered for primary zone of a promotion board or first time consideration for school selection
board.
   (2) Judge advocates must self-certify to TJAG their good standing status every other year in odd numbered years.
   c. Unique requirements for judge advocates.
                                              DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             371

   (1) Officers in the JAGC develop themselves through progressively challenging assignments and by continuing their
military and professional education.
   (2) Continuing professional education for judge advocates. All judge advocates participate in continuing legal
education throughout their careers. This training is required by many licensing states; it also keeps officers abreast of
current legal developments. Continuing legal education consists of training conducted by SJAs, military judges, and
regional and senior defense counsel; civilian training; and training provided at TJAGLCS. As judge advocates develop
professionally and become eligible for more senior assignments as military judges, SJAs, and deputy SJAs, they attend
specialized training, which is part of their overall development. Senior judge advocates may also be offered the
opportunity for specialized management training.
39–3. Active Army judge advocate development
   a. Officer Development Model. The Judge Advocate Development Model is focused more on the quality and range
of experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress. See figure 39–1, below, for Judge
Advocate Active Army developmental model. All assignments are made in the best interests of the Army. The
objective of the JAGC career developmental model is to build an expert, flexible force by balancing the needs of the
Army, professional development, personal and Family needs, and personal preferences in every assignment. TJAG’s
goals are to develop every officer professionally, ensure diversity of assignments, and provide opportunities for
management, leadership and education. There is no single path to success in the JAGC. Sustained superior performance
in a variety of assignments that develop and display each officer’s skills as an attorney, manager, and leader are the
guarantors of success. The JAGC needs specialists as well as generalists. The JAGC recognizes the need to develop
skilled practitioners in other critical specialty areas of the law. The JAGC also recognizes its obligation to distributed
talented officers fairly throughout the Corps: between TDA and TOE units, between CONUS and OCONUS com-
mands, between the National Capital Region and the field, and between instructors who educate the Army and the legal
advisors supporting commanders in day-to-day operations. The JAGC’s career development, assignment, schooling,
and promotion practices reflect these concerns.
   (1) Initial entry officers gain branch technical and tactical skills to develop a warrior ethos and gain important
leadership experience in company grade assignments.
   (2) Throughout an officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental and
Multinational (JIIM) experience and exposure.
   (3) Lifelong learning, supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop
both joint and expeditionary competencies. Expeditionary competencies are those needed by officers in an expedition-
ary force — regional knowledge, cultural awareness, foreign language, diplomacy, statesmanship, and so forth.
   (4) Flexible time lines enable officers to serve longer in developmental assignments ensuring officers have adequate
time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and cohesion.
   (5) The goal is to maintain a healthy, upwardly mobile career path for JAGC officers. Fair, candid, and open
personnel management is critical to meeting the JAGC’s mission. Personnel management will be effective only when
interest in professional development is shared among the JAGC leadership, supervisors, and individual members of the
corps.
   (6) Judge advocates will compete within their CF for promotion to all grades.
   b. Judge advocate career.
   (1) Becoming a judge advocate.
   (a) Judge advocates will continue to be accessed into the branch primarily by direct commissioning.
   (b) Applications for appointment as a judge advocate come primarily from law school students, ROTC officers
attending law school on an educational delay, active members of the civilian bar, and Active Duty commissioned
officers seeking participation in the Funded Legal Education Program (FLEP). On occasion, officers transfer to the
JAGC from other branches in the Army. To be appointed, a person must have earned a law degree from a law school
accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA) and must be admitted to practice and have membership in good
standing (as defined by the pertinent bar) of at least one licensing authority.
   (c) Judge advocates commissioned directly from civilian life enter Active Duty as Active Army officers. They are
awarded 18 months constructive credit for promotion for the time spent in law school. Officers who do not qualify for
appointment as captains are appointed as first lieutenants and are usually eligible for promotion to the grade of captain
upon completion of initial entry training.
   (d) The FLEP, authorized by 10 USC 2004 and AR 27–1, allows a small number of Active Duty officers to attend
law school at Government expense. The program is available to officers with not less than 2 years or more than 6 years
of total AFS at the time law school begins. Officers are detailed to the JAGC but remain in their basic branch until
later appointed in or assigned to the JAGC in the grade in which they are serving.
   (2) Company grade development.
   (a) Education. New judge advocates attend the 12.5-week Judge Advocate Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC III),
the Direct Commissioned officer Pre-Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC–DCO), and the BOLC II en route to their
first duty stations, although a few are assigned in a delayed schooling status to installations before the basic course (see
372                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

JAG PUB 1–1 and paragraph 39–8c, below, of this pamphlet for more information on BOLC III, BOLC–DCO, and
BOLC II).
   (b) Assignment. Pre-graduate course assignments are key developmental milestones for new JAs. This initial
assignment is normally the time when JAs develop basic technical skills and learn about the Army. New judge
advocates are rotated through a variety of duties in many of the legal specialties in which judge advocates are expected
to practice. The first JAGC assignment is not normally in the state in which a judge advocate is licensed, attended law
school or performed on-the-job training (if a FLEP officer). These may include, but are not limited to, legal assistance
officer, claims judge advocate, administrative law attorney, labor counselor, contract/fiscal law attorney, operational
law judge advocate, environmental law attorney, appellate attorney, instructor, JTF judge advocate, SF battalion judge
advocate, trial counsel at a BCT or support brigade, and defense counsel. In these early assignments, some officers will
have the opportunity to supervise other attorneys, Soldiers, and civilians. Many officers serve as defense counsel before
the graduate course, although first assignment judge advocates are not normally assigned to the U.S. Army Trial
Defense Service directly from the Judge Advocate Officer Basic Course.
   (c) Self-development.
   1. Judge advocates must continue to ensure they attend applicable short courses at TJAGLCS to include Criminal
Law Advocacy Course (CLAC), legal assistance courses, contract and fiscal law courses, and any other course to better
assist the JA in performing their mission.
   2. Judge advocates must complete Judge Advocate Tactical Staff Officer Course (JATSOC) within their first
assignment cycle. This online course JATSOC consists of approximately 20 hours of online, self-paced instruction and
includes eight lessons: Army Doctrine, the Military Decision Making Process, Symbology, Army Organizations,
Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield, Joint Operations, Military Briefings, and Brigade Combat Team Staff. Judge
advocates must complete the course within 24 months of enrollment.
   3. Captains should also dedicate time to professional reading to gain a historical perspective on tactical, legal and
leadership challenges.
   (d) Desired experience. This broad base of experience produces a flexible judge advocate who can deploy in support
of combat operations and provides the judge advocate with a foundation for the Judge Advocate Graduate Course.
   (3) Major development.
   (a) Education. The centerpiece of junior officer professional development is attendance at the 10-month Judge
Advocate Graduate Course. Judge advocates are selected to attend the yearlong Judge Advocate Graduate Course upon
selection for promotion to major or earlier if the officer’s career time line allows earlier attendance (senior captains).
The Judge Advocate Graduate Course educates career judge advocates in all areas of military law, legal communica-
tions, and management. The course prepares officers for middle and senior grade positions and also provides an
opportunity to develop specialized knowledge and skills. The Judge Advocate Graduate Course is accredited by the
ABA as a graduate legal education program and is statutorily empowered to award the only graduate law degree (L.
LM.) in military law in the United States. Officers incur a 2-year Active Duty Service obligation upon completion of
the Graduate Course and normally serve a 2-year utilization tour. The Judge Advocate Graduate Course fulfills the role
of the CCC and the Branch Specific ILE Qualification Course required of basic branch officers. The course serves as
the AOWC portion of the MEL ILE requirement. Upon graduation from the Graduate Course, judge advocates must
complete ILE either in residence at Fort Leavenworth or at a satellite location. After completion of the Graduate
Course and ILE, the judge advocate will be JPME I qualified.
   (b) Key, developmental, and broadening assignments. Following the graduate course, officers are assigned to field
grade positions. Some judge advocates partially specialize but continue to be generalists. Some focus on their
specialties (for example, military justice, contract and fiscal law, and so forth). Judge advocates also get significant
opportunities for leadership and management. Judge advocate majors can expect to serve as brigade judge advocates at
a BCT or support brigade, senior defense counsel, branch and division chiefs in large legal offices, deputy staff judge
advocates, OICs of branch offices, CJAs of non-GCMCA commands, instructors at TJAGLCS, Command and General
Staff College or at West Point, or as staff and trial attorneys in the litigating divisions in Washington, DC, other
defense and Government agencies, or in the OTJAG.
   (c) Self-development. Judge advocate majors must continue to professionally grow as an attorney and as an officer.
This includes attending CLEs within the licensing jurisdiction or at TJAGLCS to ensure the judge advocate grows
academically. Majors should also dedicate time to professional reading to gain a historical perspective on tactical, legal
and leadership challenges.
   (d) Desired experience. As a major in the JAGC, TJAG expects these officers to be the trusted command counsel at
a BCT, to be mid-level leadership position, to be exposed a higher level of legal expertise within the Army, other
services and governmental agencies, to be practitioners in specialized areas, and to be instructors at various institutions
within Department of Defense.
   (4) Lieutenant colonel development.
   (a) Education. Judge advocates will have the opportunity as a senior major or lieutenant colonel to apply for
advanced civil schooling to obtain their L.LM. in areas like constitutional law, tax, criminal law, international law and
health services.
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             373

   (b) Assignment. Lieutenant colonels have the opportunity to serve in more specialized assignments and in senior
leadership positions. Judge advocate lieutenant colonels have their first opportunity to serve as military judges, regional
defense counsel, or SJAs. They also serve as branch and division chiefs in the largest offices; the Office of the Judge
Advocate, U.S. Army Europe; or the National Capital Region.
   (c) Self-development. Judge advocate lieutenant colonels must continue to professionally grow as an attorney and as
an officer. This includes attending CLEs within the licensing jurisdiction or at TJAGLCS to ensure the judge advocate
grows academically. Lieutenant colonels should also dedicate time to professional reading to gain a historical perspec-
tive on tactical, legal, operational and leadership challenges.
   (d) Desired experience. A lieutenant colonel in the JAGC has been assigned in highly complex practice areas and
has had an opportunity to lead our junior officers. LTCs have served as advisors to senior leaders and been exposed to
the highest levels of DA, DOD and the legislative processes.
   (5) Colonel development.
   (a) Education. Most officers nearing promotion to colonel become eligible for selection to attend resident senior
service college (SSC) or the Army War College Distance Education Program. The JAGC has numerous officers attend
the U.S. Army War College, ICAF, National War College, Naval War College and the Department of Justice
Fellowship each year.
   (b) Assignment. Judge advocate colonels are senior trial and appellate military judges; SJAs at major installations,
divisions, corps, ASCCs, ACOMs, DRUs, or combatant commands; and division chiefs in the OTJAG and the U.S.
Army Legal Services Agency.
   (c) Self-development. Judge advocate colonels must continue to professionally grow as an attorney and as an officer.
This includes attending CLEs within the licensing jurisdiction or at TJAGLCS to ensure the judge advocate grows
academically. Colonels should also dedicate time to professional reading to gain a historical perspective on tactical,
legal, operational and leadership challenges. Staff judge advocate positions require military education level (MEL) ILE
and attendance at the Staff Judge Advocate Course at TJAGLCS. The MEL ILE is obtained by completing an Army
ILE course or equivalent. Lieutenant colonel SJAs and colonels serving as division and corps, SJAs will normally be
assigned for a 2-year tour. Colonels otherwise serving as SJAs will normally be assigned for a 2- or 3-year tour.
   (d) Desired experience. Colonels comprise the senior leadership of the JAGC and are the senior counsel to the
leaders of the Army and DOD. These senior judge advocates occupy leadership positions on corps staff and higher that
require a thorough knowledge of strategy and the art and science of developing and using instruments of national
power. Current operations mandate our senior judge advocates who advise the Army’s senior flag officers be
thoroughly versed and familiar with strategic thinking. Judge advocates at all levels, from the JCS down through the
brigade, assist in, advise on, and review the preparation and execution of plans crucial to success in all operations.
Legal expertise is listed as a necessary capability for military forces for the successful execution of counterinsurgency
operations (FM 3.24 Counterinsurgency).
   (6) Judge advocate positions. Assignments in CONUS are normally a maximum of 3 years; however, the need to
staff all legal offices properly and to develop the careers of all judge advocates effectively can require shorter or longer
tours. Tour lengths for overseas assignments are outlined in AR 614–30.
   (7) Joint assignments. After selection for promotion to major, judge advocates may be considered for JDAs in Joint
organizations worldwide, including the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Joint Staff and the combatant
commands. Joint experience is important to the Army. Due to the limited number of Joint assignments available, judge
advocates are not precluded from advancing into senior leadership positions because they are not titled “Joint
Qualified” (see 10 USC 619a(b)(3)(C)). Based on the breadth of JAGC assignments, from lieutenant to colonel, judge
advocates become masters of handling joint operations. Judge advocates serving in nominative positions as either legal
advisors or SJAs will normally be assigned for 3-year tours.
   (8) Trial Defense Services assignments. TDS assignments are considered a part of a normal career development in
the JAGC. TDS will normally be assigned to TDS for 18 months. Regional defense counsel and senior defense counsel
will normally be assigned for a two year tour.
   (9) Brigade judge advocate. Majors-level JAs assigned to a BCT must be prepared to operate under the command
and control of a higher headquarters with which they have a habitual relationship. The BCT includes a brigade judge
advocate (BJA), a trial counsel (TC), and a senior paralegal NCO. The BJA serves a critical role to providing expert
and timely legal advice to brigade staff.
   (10) Military judges. Military judge positions require completion of the Military Judge Course at TJAGLCS in
addition to the Judge Advocate Officer Graduate or Advanced Course. Officers selected for military judge positions
will be scheduled to attend the next scheduled Military Judge Course, unless already certified as a military judge.
   (11) TJAGLCS. TJAGLCS is the home of the regiment and is the cornerstone of the JAGC’s training and education.
Because the health of the JAGC is contingent on an intellectually vibrant educational institution that is in touch with
the field’s needs, the assignment of quality, experienced officers and noncommissioned officers to the TJAGLCS
faculty and staff is a high priority.
   (12) Other assignments. Judge advocates may be assigned to organizations and duties beyond those indicated above.
These assignments may include duty with the Department of Justice, the Department of State, and the White House.
374                                          DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

The spectrum of possible assignments is large, and these assignments can be characterized as highly responsible and
important, requiring mature, skilled and well-grounded officers. Assignments contained in subparagraphs 39–3a(5),
above, and this paragraph are collectively known as JIIM assignments. Judge advocates do not serve in branch/FA
generalist assignments.
   (13) Other Army training for judge advocates. Judge advocates are both officers and lawyers. Therefore, they
participate in officer training programs including the BOLC, ILE, the Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course,
and Senior Service College (SSC). The JAGC officers often attend other specialized military training such as airborne
and air assault training.
   (14) Advanced civilian schooling. TJAG selects a limited number of judge advocates annually to attend civilian
institutions for one year at Government expense to obtain advanced legal education in specialized areas. This schooling
supplements TJAGLCS graduate course training.

   a. Unique knowledge and skills of a legal administrator. As strategic and tactical planners, legal administrators
anticipate changes in the military climate, instituting changes to ensure the JAGC can support the Army’s continually
evolving missions.
   (1) Leadership role. Legal administrators must be highly motivated, possessing tact, initiative, integrity, and mature
judgment. Legal administrators are leaders, mentors, trainers, and technical and war fighting experts within their
organizations. Legal administrators serve as the Chief of the Administration or Operations Division. Legal administra-
tors are principal members of the legal leadership team who take an active role in the preparing, planning, and
managing process of military legal operations in both garrison and operational environments.
   (2) Expertise. Legal administrators must have education, training, and experience in legal operations, human

resources, budget, security, project management, information and knowledge management, military justice and the
other core legal disciplines (administrative and civil law, international and operational law, claims, military justice,
legal assistance, contract and fiscal law, and legal assistance) and apply their knowledge and expertise in any
environment. Legal administrators are the system administrators and technical experts for all JAGC specific applica-
tions, hardware, and facilities. (See DA Pam 611–21 for additional information duties and responsibilities.)
   (a) Military justice. Legal administrators play a key role in assisting the SJA and the Chief of Military Justice with
managing and executing pre-trial processing, case management, production of expert witnesses, post-trial processing
and budgets of courts-martial.
   (b) Operational law. Legal administrators assist the SJA and chief of operational law with planning, organizing, and
executing office participation in contingency operations, including manning personnel documents, training all attorneys,
paralegal specialists and NCOs in the execution of operational law missions.
   (c) Administrative and civil law. At legal offices within headquarters exercising general court-martial jurisdiction, or
at any level, a legal administrator serves as the Chief of the Administration Division. In this capacity, they supervise
office personnel, manage human resources, office budgets, facilities, and equipment required to support legal services
in both garrison and deployed environments.
   (d) Information technology. Within information management systems, legal administrators are responsible for the
protection of attorney-client information. Legal administrators are also responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of
the electronic Judge Advocate Warfighter System (e-JAWS) and provide the primary training for judge advocates and
paralegals in hardware and software applications necessary for remote operations or deployment. Legal administrators
are a SJA’s operational law technologist.
   b. Certification. TJAG certifies that legal administrators may perform legal administrator duties in the JAGC and
this certification is required to maintain the appointment with a PMOS 270A. See DA Pam 611–21.
39–5. Active Army legal administrator, warrant officer development
   a. Warrant Officer Development Model. The Legal Administrator Warrant Officer Development model is focused
more on the quality and range of experience, rather than the specific gates or assignments required to progress. See
figure 39–2, below for JAGC Active Army Warrant Officer Development model. All assignments are made in the best
interests of the Army. The objective of the JAGC career developmental model is to build an expert, flexible force by
balancing the needs of the Army, professional development, personal and Family needs, and personal preferences in
every assignment. TJAG’s goals are to develop every warrant officer professionally, ensure diversity of assignments,
and provide opportunities for management, leadership and education. There is no single path to success in the JAGC.
Sustained superior performance in a variety of assignments that develop and display each officer’s skills as a Soldier,
manager, and leader are the guarantors of success. The JAGC relies on legal administrators as experts and systems
managers for the duration of their career. Designed to provide career long continuity to legal office operations they can
also serve in key positions within the JAGC such as OTJAG, TJAGLCS, and the U.S. Army Legal Services Agency
(USALSA). This provides opportunities for acquiring and developing additional skills in project and knowledge
management, JAGC specific software application development, force management, and training development.
   (1) Legal administrators are accessed from the JAGC enlisted corps (27D) through a board process. Soldiers serving
in MOS 27D with between 5 and 12 years of service who have excelled in a variety of JAGC positions are candidates
for accession. The Army’s goal is to access these Soldiers between five and eight years of Service in order to maximize
the amount of time they can serve prior to retirement. A waiver from the Army DCS, G–1 is required for Soldiers with
a date of rank over 12 years.
   (2) After successful completion of the WOCS and before attendance at the Legal Administrator Warrant Officer
Basic Course (WOBC), WO1s will be assigned to the OSJA at their duty station or first legal administrator assignment,
where they will be paired with an experienced legal administrator to help mentor the individual for WOBC and future
duty as a legal administrator (currently only available to Regular Army warrant officers).
   b. Utilization.
   (1) WO1/CW2. Should be utilized in operational assignments to develop and gain valuable experience in operational
management of legal offices. The first assignment should allow the legal administrator an opportunity to both develop
his technical skills as well as his officer proficiencies. Legal administrators should continue their self-development,
professional reading and pursuit of educational goals.
   (2) CW3/CW4 At this point in a warrant officer’s career, the model highlights the need to gain a broader
understanding of their AOC/MOS. Nominative assignment should be sought. WOs should continue their self-develop-
ment, professional reading and pursuit of the next civil educational goals. Senior legal administrators should continue
to be utilized in operational assignments, as well as, positions of greater responsibility to continue to expand their
knowledge and skills. The officer should seek assignments that will increase their value to the JAGC and the Army.
Legal administrators should continue their self-development, professional reading, and pursuit of the next civil
educational goals. Senior legal administrators should serve as role models and mentors for junior warrant officers, by
assisting them in developing their skills. This is also a time to develop more specific skills and experiences to qualify
for senior positions.

   (3) CW5 Capstone achievement for all legal administrators. Once a legal administrator has attained this grade they
should be assigned to nominative or joint, interagency, intergovernmental, or special assignments. Lifelong learning,
supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop both joint and expedition-
ary competencies. Senior legal administrators should serve as role models and mentors for junior warrant officers, by
assisting them in developing their skills. At this level, full utilization of their skills, abilities and talents at the most
challenging assignments. Flexible timelines enable warrant officers to serve longer in developmental assignments
ensuring warrant officers have adequate time to gain skills and experience and also support unit readiness and
cohesion.
   c. Length of tour. Warrant officers will ordinarily complete the minimum months assigned on station as prescribed
in AR 614–30 before being reassigned; however mission requirements may require earlier departure from an assign-
ment. Reassignments are based on the need to maintain an overseas rotational base, satisfy requirements for special
qualifications, and provide for career progression.
   d. Promotion time line. Regular Army WO1 will be promoted to CW2 after 2 years in grade on the recommendation
of the first lieutenant colonel (lieutenant colonel/O–5) in the chain of command. All other warrant officers, CW2
through CW5, will normally be considered for promotion to the next higher grade by a DA promotion board, first
below-the-zone after 3 years in grade and then in-the-zone after 4 years in grade. DA publishes zones of consideration
prior to each promotion board. Warrant officers upon promotion to CW2 are commissioned and appointed into the
Regular Army.
   e. Assignments. General. The Chief Warrant Officer of the Corps (CWOC) manages the assignments of Regular
Army legal administrators in coordination with the JAGC’s Personnel, Plans, and Training Office (PP&TO).
   f. Legal Administrators Course. All legal administrators (Regular Army, USAR, and ARNG), should attend the

                               Figure 39–2. The AA Legal Administrator Development Model
39–6. Reserve Component judge advocate development
   a. General. Judge advocates serve in both RCs, the USAR and the ARNG. The Judge Advocate General exercises
technical supervision of USAR JAGC officers not on the Active Duty list. The Personnel, Plans, and Training Office
assists TJAG by developing policy and providing technical assistance in the career management of USAR judge
advocate officers. TJAG, with the assistance of the National Guard Special Advisor to TJAG, through the Chief,
National Guard Bureau, also provides technical assistance to the respective State Adjutants General for the career
management of ARNG judge advocates. In general, qualifications and professional development are similar to Active
Army judge advocates. All judge advocate assignments are made upon the recommendation of TJAG (Article 6,
UCMJ, and 10 USC 806).
   b. Reserve Component judge advocate career development.
   (1) Professional development objectives are as follows:
   (a) Development of officers with the professional attributes and capabilities to meet the mobilization and warfight-
ing needs of the Army, and in the case of ARNG judge advocates, to meet the additional civil and defense needs of the
states and territories.
   (b) Development of officers in the numbers and skills to meet the functional requirements of the Army in partial or
total mobilization, and in the case of ARNG judge advocates, to meet the additional requirements of the states and
territories.
   (c) Development of officers with technical, managerial and administrative skills to serve in positions of increasing
responsibility in the JAGC.
   (2) Company grade.
   (a) Assignments. Company grade JAGC assignments should allow the officer an opportunity to learn to be both a
military lawyer and an officer. An officer at this stage of his or her career should be exposed to a wide variety of
experiences. The Army understands that at the same time the judge advocate is learning his or her military craft, he or
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                          379

she is engaged in a full-time civilian career; however, high standards of participation and performance are still
required.
   1. Company grade judge advocates assigned to units should be assigned to junior positions, including OPLAW
judge advocate/trial counsel for a BCT/support brigade, legal support organization (LSO) team member or assistant
team chief, defense counsel, and various junior positions (legal assistance, administrative and civil law, trial counsel,
OPLAW) within staff and command judge advocate offices and sections. Assignment of judge advocates with less than
4 years of experience to positions where they are the sole or senior judge advocate is not advised.
   2. On rare occasions, company grade judge advocates are assigned to DIMA positions. The DIMA assignments are
with Active Duty divisions or installation legal offices. The DIMA judge advocate supervisors should not only provide
training in military legal requirements of the position, but they should also ensure that junior officers are exposed to
Soldier experiences. When possible, supervisory judge advocates should arrange to pair up new judge advocates with a
platoon leader of a local line unit for a 1- or 2-day orientation on life as a Soldier. Supervisors should counsel junior
officers on both their legal abilities and their Soldier abilities. Junior judge advocates in DIMA positions should be
encouraged to drill, at least part of the year with a troop program unit in their home area.
   3. Non-JAGC assignments are discouraged for all JAGC officers, but exceptions will be approved on rare occasions.
In some cases, non-JAGC assignments can be beneficial to both the JAGC and the Soldier. These assignments may
broaden the individual’s perspective concerning the mission of the Army and enhance an officer’s ability to perform at
a higher level position later in his or her career. TJAG approves request for assignment to non-JAGC positions. Such
assignments are for a period not to exceed 3 years.
   4. Company grade officers should not be assigned to the IRR except in unusual circumstances. Appointment of new
judge advocates should be tied to an authorization in a unit or a DIMA position. It is generally unacceptable for
company grade judge advocates to spend 2 or more years in the IRR.
   (b) Education.
   1. The Judge Advocate Basic Officer Leader Course (also known as the BOLC III). Part of the judge advocate
officer IET, this course provides an introduction to the military, JAGC orientation, and training in military law. The
BOLC III is 12 and one-half weeks long, consisting of two phases. Phase 1 is 2 weeks long and is conducted at Fort
Lee, VA. It provides an introduction to the military, customs, and courtesies of the Service, a few basic military skills,
and an introduction to military leadership. Phase 2 is 10 and one-half weeks long and is conducted at TJAGLCS in
Charlottesville, VA. This phase concentrates on providing new officers a foundation in military law. Officers must
complete BOLC III to become certified to practice as a judge advocate and to qualify for promotion to captain.
   2. BOLC Direct Commissioned Officers Course (BOLC–DCO). Part of the judge advocate officer IET, this course
provides a basic foundation in leadership and military skills necessary to succeed in today’s operational Army.
BOLC–DCO is a 4-week course taught by the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command at two installations, Fort Sill,
OK, and Fort Benning, GA, immediately upon completion of BOLC III.
   3. BOLC II. Currently optional for RC judge advocates, BOLC II is part of the Active Army judge advocate officer
IET. In FY 09, BOLC II becomes a part of the RC judge advocate’s IET. It is a rigorous, branch-immaterial course,
physically and mentally challenging, intended to build on the leadership and military skills acquired in the DCO,
ROTC, the USMA, or Officer Candidate School.
   (3) Majors.
   (a) Assignments. Judge advocates usually have at least 7 years commissioned Service when promoted to major. This
is a mid-level grade with opportunities to supervise other judge advocates. Judge advocate majors should serve as role
models and mentors for junior officers, assisting them in developing their skills. This is also a time to develop more
specific skills and experiences to qualify for senior JAGC positions. RC JAGC majors should seek assignments as
division-level deputy SJAs, LSO team chiefs, brigade-level command judge advocates, senior defense counsel, and
general officer command (GOCOM) staff or command judge advocates or section chiefs. These assignments should
follow developmental unit or DIMA experiences relating to the type of law practiced by the unit.
   (b) Education.
   1. The JAGC Officer Advanced Course. The JAOAC is designed to provide a working knowledge of the duties and
responsibilities of field grade JAGC officers. This course is the nonresident version of the JAGC. This course serves as
branch qualification for officers to serve in field grade JAGC positions. Completion of the course is a prerequisite for
promotion to major. The JAOAC consists of 2 legal subject phases. Phase I is a correspondence phase. Phase II is a 2-
week resident phase taught at TJAGLCS. This course should be taken between the 2d and 5th years of commissioned
Service.
   2. Intermediate-level education (formerly Command and General Staff College). ILE is the means by which the
Army ensures universal MEL ILE/JPME 1 among majors in the active Army and RCs. The purpose of this qualifica-
tion is to develop familiarity with employment of multiservice and multinational forces used in Joint and combined
arms operations; to develop basic knowledge of the Joint operations planning process; and to create awareness of DOD
requirements as well as individual Service capabilities, problems and needs. While some RC judge advocates may be
selected to attend ILE in residence at Fort Leavenworth, KS, most will complete the requirement through a combina-
tion of distance education and two-week tours of Active Duty for training through TASS.

   (4) Lieutenant colonels assignments. Judge advocates usually have at least 14 years of commissioned Service when
promoted to lieutenant colonel. This is the beginning of senior level assignment and performance expectations. Officers
at this level should have the legal expertise, Soldier skills, and confidence to deal effectively with senior Army
commanders. Lieutenant colonels should serve as role models and mentors for junior officers, counseling and assisting
them in developing their skills and careers. The JAGC officers should be competing for principal tenured JAGC
positions, such as division SJA, GOCOM SJA (lieutenant colonel), regional defense counsel, or military judge
(lieutenant colonel). The degree to which a judge advocate is competitive for these assignments is a function of prior
developmental assignments. Developmental assignments for division SJA and GOCOM SJA (lieutenant colonel) may
include the following:
   (a) Unit officers. Deputy or section chief within an SJA office, LSO team chief, brigade-level command judge
advocate, regional defense counsel, and military judge (lieutenant colonel).
   (b) DIMA. SJA or deputy SJA and TJAGLCS professor or staff.
   (5) Colonel.
   (a) Assignments. Judge advocates usually have at least 18 years of commissioned Service when promoted to
colonel. For all but a handful of JAGC officers, this is their most senior level of Service to the Army. Development of
the officer is no longer a major professional objective. This is a period of full utilization of the officer’s talents,
experience, and training. At this level, officers should perform effectively with senior Army commanders. Colonels
lead, discipline, teach, and develop the field grade JAGC officers under their technical and command supervision. At
this level, JAGC officers, through training and experience, have prepared themselves for maximum use of their skills,
abilities and talents as regional readiness command (RRC) and regional readiness sustainment command (RRSC) staff
judge advocates, legal service organization/mobilization support organization (LSO/MSO) commanders, state judge
advocates, and senior military judges. TJAG approves all colonel assignments. Prior assignments that offer the
experience necessary to succeed at some of these assignments are listed below.
   1. To succeed as an RRC/RRSC SJA or state judge advocate, officers should serve in the following:
   a. Unit officers. Division SJA, GOCOM SJA, LSO commander, or military judge.
   b. DIMA. Major command SJA (lieutenant colonel or colonel) or deputy SJA (lieutenant colonel), or TJAGLCS
professor or staff (lieutenant colonel).
   2. To succeed as an LSO/MSO commander, officers should serve in the following:
   a. Unit officers. Division SJA, GOCOM SJA, RRC/RRSC SJA, LSO section chief, or military judge.
   b. DIMA. SJA or deputy SJA of a major command.
   3. To succeed as a senior military judge, officers should serve in the following:
   a. Unit officers. Military judge (lieutenant colonel), LSO commander, regional defense counsel, or RRC/RRSC SJA.
   b. DIMA. USACCA (lieutenant colonel or colonel), TDS (lieutenant colonel or colonel), or TJAGLCS instructor in
criminal law (lieutenant colonel or colonel).
   (b) Education.
   1. Senior Service College (SSC). The AWC is a SSC designed to prepare officers for duty as commanders and staff
officers at the highest levels of the Army. The course is not a prerequisite for promotion, but enhances any officer’s
ability to perform at the highest level. The AWC Distance Education Course is a 2-year distance education program
consisting of home study and two 2-week resident phases at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. Selection for this course
is by a centralized board convened by AHRC. This is the only distance education course that the Army recognizes as
MEL SSC producing. Completion of the course should occur between the 21st and 26th YOS.
   2. Continuing legal education (CLE). Each year TJAGLCS offers specialized continuing legal education courses at
Charlottesville, Virginia, and at over 35 locations around the world. Taught by TJAGLCS faculty, these courses
provide an essential update in a particular field of law. RC judge advocates are required to attend this training to
maintain their basic professional competence as military lawyers. Individuals may apply for TJAGLCS resident CLE
training that varies in length from 3 days to 3 weeks. These courses provide practice oriented continuing legal
education for military attorneys. TJAGLCS also provides weekend, on-site CLE training at 20 CONUS Army locations
and at selected OCONUS Army sites. Judge advocates should plan for attendance at one CLE course each year.
   (c) The Military Judge Course. The purpose of the Military Judge Course is to provide military attorneys with
advanced schooling to qualify them to perform duties as military judges at courts-martial. This is a 3-week course
taught at TJAGLCS. The Chief Trial Judge, U.S. Army Trial Judiciary, selects Army officers for attendance.

                            Figure 39–3. The RC Judge Advocate Life-cycle Development Model
39–7. Reserve Component legal administrator (WO) development
   a. General. Legal administrators serve in both RCs, the USAR and the ARNG. The Judge Advocate General
exercises technical supervision of USAR JAGC warrant officers not on the Active Duty list. The Chief Warrant Officer
of the Corps (CWOC) in coordination with Personnel, Plans, and Training Office assists TJAG by developing policy
and providing technical assistance in the career management of USAR warrant officers. TJAG, with the assistance of
the National Guard Special Advisor to TJAG, through the Chief, National Guard Bureau, also provides technical
assistance to the respective State Adjutants General for the career management of ARNG legal administrators. In
general, qualifications and professional development are similar to Active Army legal administrators (see paragraph
39–5).
   b. RC legal administrator career development.
   (1) Professional development objectives are as follows:
   (a) Development of warrant officer legal administrators with the professional attributes and capabilities to meet the
mobilization and warfighting needs of the Army, and in the case of ARNG warrant officer legal administrators, to meet
the additional civil and defense needs of the states and territories.
   (b) Development of warrant officer legal administrators in the numbers and skills to meet the functional require-
ments of the Army in partial or total mobilization, and in the case of ARNG warrant officer legal administrators, to
meet the additional requirements of the states and territories.
   (c) Development of warrant officer legal administrators with technical, managerial and administrative skills to serve
in positions of increasing responsibility in the JAGC.
   (2) Utilization (see JAGC Warrant Officer (RC - AGR/TPU) Life-cycle Development and Utilization Model)
   (a) WO1/CW2. Legal administrators should be utilized in operational assignments to develop and gain valuable
experience in operational management of legal offices. Legal administrators should continue their self-development,
professional reading, and pursuit of educational goals. The first assignment should allow the legal administrator an
382                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

opportunity to both develop his or her technical skills as well as how to be an officer. The Army understands that at the
same time the warrant officer is learning his or her military craft, he or she is engaged in a full-time civilian career;
however, high standards of participation and performance are still required.
   (b) CW3/CW4. Senior legal administrators should continue to be utilized in operational assignments, as well as,
positions of greater responsibility to continue to expand their knowledge and skills. The officer should seek assign-
ments that will increase their value to the JAGC and the Army. Legal administrators should continue their self-
development, professional reading, and pursuit of the next civil educational goals. Senior legal administrators should
serve as role models and mentors for junior warrant officers, by assisting them in developing their skills. This is also a
time to develop more specific skills and experiences to qualify for senior positions.
   (3) CW5. Capstone achievement for all legal administrators. Once a legal administrator has attained this grade they
should be assigned to nominative, joint, interagency, intergovernmental, or special assignments. Lifelong learning,
supported by both civilian and military education, provides critical opportunities to develop both joint and expedition-
ary competencies. Senior legal administrators should serve as role models and mentors for junior warrant officers, by
assisting them in developing their skills. At this level, full utilization of their skills, abilities and talents at the most
challenging assignments.
   c. Promotion time line. The USAR and ARNG legal administrators must complete all prerequisite levels of military
education applicable to legal administrators prior to selection to the next higher grade. For USAR warrant officer
promotions, see AR 135–55. Also, for USAR warrant officers (CW2–CW4) with a DOR earlier than 1 January 2005,
see Reference Memorandums, HQ, DAAR–HR, dtd, 8 October 03, subject: Army Reserve Warrant Officer Professional
Development Education (PDE) Management Improvements For ARNG warrant officer promotions, and
AHRC–OPW–S, dtd, 9 April 2004, subject: Implementation of the Chief, Army Reserve (OCAR) New Warrant Officer
Professional Development Plan For ARNG promotions see NGR 600–101.

Chaplain Corps
40–1. Unique features of Chaplain Corps
   a. Unique purpose of the Chaplain Corps. The Chaplain Corps is a special branch of the Army whose mission is to
provide for the comprehensive religious support to the Soldiers, Family Members, and authorized Civilians across the
spectrum of operations.
   b. Unique functions performed by the Chaplain Corps. Chaplains provide the religious, spiritual, moral and ethical
support to the Army in any contingency. As religious leaders, they provide the Army community the opportunity to
participate in worship and religious educational opportunities and to receive the pastoral care and spiritual enrichment it
seeks. Chaplains preserve and perpetuate the faith-based values that often serve as the bedrock of our units and
communities. As special staff officers, they coordinate religious support activities to support the commander’s opera-
tional plans and objectives in war and peace. Similarly, they provide commanders with professional advice on the
impact of religion on military operations.
   c. Unique features of work in the Chaplain Corps. Chaplains serve on the personal and special staff of the
commander and assist in ensuring that the policies and leadership practices of the command are in keeping with strict
moral, ethical and humanitarian standards. The chaplain advises the commander and staff on matters pertaining to
religion, morals and morale as affected by religion. The senior chaplain assigned to a unit or headquarters is normally
designated the Command or Staff Chaplain. The chaplain is responsible to the commander for all chaplain related
activities within the command. The chaplain exercises staff and technical supervision of the activities of the other
chaplains assigned to the headquarters. He or she provides staff supervision for the activities of chaplains in subordi-
nate commands and provides commanders and staff with advice, information, recommendations, programming, funding
data and plans concerning religious activities, unit morale, chaplain and chaplain assistant personnel matters.
                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                             385

   (1) The Chaplain branch encompasses two areas of concentration (AOCs): Command and Unit Chaplain (56A); and
Clinical Ministries Supervisor (56D).
   (a) The Command and Unit Chaplain (56A) serves as a religious leader with staff functions for unit of assignment
and to units requiring area religious coverage. The duties of chaplains are those, which normally pertain to the clergy
profession and those, which are prescribed by law, regulations and distinctive conditions and circumstances of the
Department of the Army.
   (b) The Clinical Ministries Supervisor (56D) applies to two types of supervisors who offer specialized supervision in
the areas of Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) and Approved Supervisors for Family Life Chaplaincy.
   (2) The Chaplain branch incorporates seven additional skill identifiers (ASIs):
   (a) Chaplain Educator/Trainer in Ethics or World Religions (7E).
   (b) Chaplaincy Resources Manager (corps and installation) (7F).
   (c) Marriage and Family Specialist (7K).
   (d) Chaplaincy Resource Manager (HQDA, HQ IMA, Region, ACOM, DRU, ASCC, USACHCS) (7M).
   (e) Hospital Ministries Chaplain (7R).
   (f) Combat Medical Ministry (7S)
   (g) Force Management (3R).
40–2. Officer characteristics required
Chaplain officers are fully qualified members of the clergy of a religious organization. Entry-level requirements are
established by public law, Department of Defense instruction, Army regulations, and proponent policy. Chaplains are
required to possess an accredited baccalaureate degree of not less than 120 semester hours; have completed a master’s
degree consisting of 72 semester hours (minimum) of graduate professional study from an accredited institution in
theology or approved subjects (normally validated by the possession of a Master of Divinity degree, an equivalent
degree or 72 semester hours); and be certified by a qualified religious organization which has met all the administrative
requirements established by the Armed Forces Chaplains Board.
   a. Competencies and actions common to all. The Army must have officers who can effectively apply the three core
dimensions of leadership: leads, develops, achieves. (For additional discussion of these leadership dimensions, see FM
6–22, fig 2–3.) How the leader leads: The leader must be able to extend influence, lead by example, and clearly
communicate. How the leader develops: The leader must be prepared and through positive environments develops those
around. How the leader achieves: The leader brings all these things together and achieves results. The leadership
framework describes a leader of character and competence who acts to achieve excellence across the spectrum of
operations from total war, to operations other than war, to disaster relief, and in times of peace.
   b. Unique skills. In addition to the competencies required by all officers, the chaplain must also fully comprehend
how to integrate religious support to the organization, structure and doctrine of the warfighting Army as it serves the
nation in the 21st century. The chaplain provides this support in the follow areas:
   (1) Plan and execute the commander’s master religious plan/ commander’s religious program in support of the unit’s
mission.
   (2) Assess the impact of indigenous religious beliefs and practices on the unit’s mission.
   (3) Provide religious services of worship, including funerals and memorial services that occur in field and garrison.
   (4) Provide specific Essential Elements of Religious Services that normally take place apart from formal religious
services.
   (5) Provide ministry to marriages and Families.
   (6) Offer pastoral care through counseling and advising.
   (7) Teach classes on moral leadership, suicide awareness and religious education.
   (8) Render pastoral care in a hospital setting.
   (9) Render pastoral care in a confinement facility.
   (10) Design and implement Unit Ministry Team training.
   c. Unique knowledge. Chaplains must remain up-to-date on Army organization, structure and doctrine. They also:
   (1) Possess expert knowledge of distinctive faith groups in order to perform and provide for the religious needs of
the Army’s Soldiers and Families.
   (2) Remain current on developments in the civilian religious community for possible application to their area of
expertise, as it relates to Religious Leader Liaison (RLL) duties.
   (3) Understand the elements of suicide awareness and prevention.
   (4) Know the characteristics of healthy marriage and Family relationships.
   (5) Possess the knowledge of the dynamics of ethical decision-making.
   (6) Assess the religious needs, prepare the commander’s master religious plan, implement and evaluate the com-
mander’s religious program.
   d. Unique attributes. Chaplains must possess the highest standards of discretion, integrity and professional ethics. In
386                                        DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

addition, they will provide religious support in a religiously pluralistic setting and ensure the free exercise of religion
by following the six Chaplaincy values (SACRED):
   (1) Spirituality: Seek to know God and yourself at the deepest level.
   (2) Accountability: Hold yourself and others to the moral and spiritual high ground in every area of life.
   (3) Compassion: Love in word and deed.
   (4) Religious leadership: Model spiritual truths wisely and courageously.
   (5) Excellence: Do your best for God’s glory.
   (6) Diversity: Respect the differences of others.
40–3. Critical officer developmental assignments
Chaplain professional development provides skills, knowledge and experience enabling them to provide religious,
spiritual and moral leadership and to perform staff officer functions in the Army. This is a comprehensive system that
assigns chaplains according to the needs of the Army, and identifies and provides the training required to prepare and
sustain chaplains for serving in these assignments.
   a. Branch qualification. Upon completion of Chaplain Basic Officer Leader Course (CHBOLC), chaplain officers
are eligible for worldwide deployment in their specialty. There are no by-grade standards for Active Army chaplains.
   b. Chaplain Officer Education System (OES) and branch development.
   (1) Newly commissioned chaplain. The Chaplain Basic Officer Leader Course (CHBOLC) provides initial entry
military training for newly commissioned chaplains. CHBOLC consists of twelve weeks of military training divided
into four modules: Chaplain’s Initial Military Training (CIMT), Phase I (Staff Officer Introduction), Phase II (Pastoral
Care Training), and Phase III (Ministry in a Combat Environment). Designed for first lieutenants, CHBOLC builds on
the professional ministerial knowledge and skills acquired in civilian institutions prior to commissioning as a chaplain.
CHBOLC equips chaplains with the knowledge and skills about the military necessary to perform their duties as staff
officers and to provide religious support at the battalion level. A non-combatant course, CHBOLC trains chaplains how
to conduct or provide religious support in today’s multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, and pluralistic Army, across the full
spectrum of military operations. During the first year of duty, the new chaplain is also required to complete the
Chaplain Professional Reinforcement Training (CPRT) program at the local level.
   (2) Captain. Chaplains (captains) are normally assigned to battalions. They may also serve as hospital chaplains,
confinement facility chaplains and installation chaplain resource managers. Chaplains attend their branch CCC to
acquire professional development in the Officer Education System. Captains selected for promotion are eligible to
enroll in the ILE course, which further prepares them to serve as staff officers at the Brigade and Division level of
competency. A select number of chaplain officers will be selected annually to attend Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE)
in order to prepare for ministry in the hospital setting. Chaplains become eligible once they have at least eighteen (18)
month time in service in the Active Army. A select number of chaplain (captains) may be offered to participate in the
Degree Completion Program to prepare for specialized assignments.
   (3) Major.
   (a) Chaplain (majors) generally serve as brigade or group chaplains, assistant division chaplains, depot chaplains,
service school instructors (or staff), Family life center directors, hospital chaplains, installation and regional chaplain
resource managers, installation chaplain training managers, and corps staff action officers.
   (b) All chaplain (majors) attend Intermediate Leader Education and complete the course within their first two years
in grade. Completion of ILE qualifies chaplain officers to serve in ILE coded positions.
   (c) Some majors will attend fully funded civilian schooling and CPE to prepare them for chaplain assignments
requiring additional skills through the awarding of an ASI (see 40–1).
   (4) Lieutenant colonel.
   (a) Chaplains (lieutenant colonels) serve as division staff chaplains, HQDA , ACOM, DRU, ASCC, and region staff
action officers, garrison and deputy garrison chaplains, CPE and Family life supervisors, and hospital chaplains.
   (b) A select number of lieutenant colonels and colonels will either attend Senior Service College (SSC) in residence,
or complete it through the U.S. Army War College Distance Education Program.
   (5) Colonel. Chaplain (colonels) serve primarily as corps, ACOM, DRU, and ASCC staff chaplains, CONUS Army
staff chaplains, joint or unified command staff chaplains, installation staff chaplains, HQDA directors, Region, and
medical center staff chaplains.
   (6) Reserve Component chaplains of all ranks (1LT through COL) may serve in positions similar to Active Army.
Army Reserve chaplains (colonels) serve at the Division and Regional Readiness Support Command levels. Army
National Guard chaplains (colonels) serve as Joint Force HQ chaplains.
   c. Branch/functional area generalist assignments. Chaplain officers do not normally serve in branch/functional area
generalist (formerly branch immaterial) assignments. These assignments will be made only as an exception to policy.
   d. Joint assignments. Joint experience is important to the Army and valuable to the officers who serve in those
billets, but few chaplains will have the opportunity to serve in a joint billet. It is not therefore, a requirement for
advancement to senior leadership.
                                            DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                              387

40–4. Assignment preferences and precedence
   a. Preferences. The Chaplain branch has diverse assignment opportunities, which allow for varied career develop-
ment paths. The goal of the professional development of Chaplain branch officers is to produce and sustain highly
qualified clergy and staff officers. Assignments in the Chaplain branch, which meet the needs of the Army, will be
made to develop the chaplain’s ability to achieve that goal. Requests from officers for assignments that do not
contribute to achieving that goal will likely be rejected.
   b. Precedence. Assignment to developmental positions will have precedence, although there is flexibility on the
sequence of assignments. Some chaplain officer billets will be designated as requiring advanced education, either
military or civilian. Officers assigned to those jobs must complete the required courses prior to reporting to their duty
assignments.
   c. Reserve Component. Reserve Component assignments are managed on a volunteer and position vacancy basis
under the guidance of senior supervisory chaplains at all echelons.
40–5. Duration of critical officer life-cycle assignments
Assignment duration. Most assignments for chaplain officers will be 24 to 36 months in length. OCONUS locations
will continue to require specific tour lengths.
40–6. Requirements, authorizations and inventory
   a. Goal. The goal is to maintain a healthy, viable career path for chaplain officers.
   b. OPMS III implementation. The number of authorized chaplain billets, by grade, will vary as force structure
decisions are made and actions to implement them are taken. Officers desiring more information on Chaplain branch
authorizations or inventory are encouraged to contact the branch office.
40–7. Key officer life-cycle initiatives for the Chaplain Corps
   a. Structure. Chaplain officers serve at all echelons worldwide.
   b. Acquire. Direct commissioning is the primary means of accessioning chaplain officers.
   c. Distribute. The Chief of Chaplains, as proponent of the branch, manages all chaplain officer personnel
assignments.
   d. Deploy. Chaplain branch officers must remain personally and professionally prepared to deploy worldwide at all
times. Whether assigned to mobile TOE units with high levels of readiness or fixed site TDA organizations, all
Chaplain Corps officers must be deployable to accomplish missions across the full spectrum of conflict. Chaplains may
deploy tomorrow with their units to deter potential adversaries and to protect national interests; or as individuals to
support joint and multinational operations other than war such as humanitarian and peace keeping missions. Chaplain
Corps officers must prepare themselves and their Families for this most challenging life-cycle function.
   e. Sustain. Chaplain officers will compete within the Chaplain Corps for promotion to all grades.
   f. Develop. Chaplain branch incorporates a professional officer development career plan offering diversity for
schooling and assignment. As chaplain officers progress through their careers, in addition to advanced military
schooling opportunities, they become eligible for additional civilian training, which prepares them for specialty
positions (see 40–3).
   g. Separate. Chaplain officers will separate from the Army in the same manner as all other officers.
40–8. Chaplain Corps Reserve Component officers
The chaplain RC officer is an integral part of the Army Chaplaincy. The Reserve Components, made up of the ARNG
and the USAR, provide almost one half of the uniformed force structure in the U.S. Army Chaplaincy. Branch
qualifications and standards are the same for the ARNG and USAR chaplains as they are for the Active Army
chaplains.
   a. General career development. Developmental patterns and objectives are the same for the Reserve Components
with the following exceptions:
   (1) Chaplain candidates are RC officers of the Staff Specialist Branch with the 00A56 (Chaplain Candidate
Program) designation. Chaplain candidates are seminary students who are working to establish their academic and
ecclesiastical credentials, in order to seek an appointment as an Army chaplain. Their training parallels much of the
Chaplain Basic Officer Leader Course, while providing annual ministry practicum experiences or monthly unit training.
These ministry practicum include ministry at various installations, in Army medical centers, in the disciplinary
barracks, or in a troop unit. Candidates can enter RC or AA chaplain assignments upon completing their academic and
ecclesiastical credentials and receiving an endorsement from their religious organization.
   (2) The Chaplain Officer Basic Course for Reserve Chaplains is the same as the course provided AA chaplains,
except CHBOLC Phase II instruction may be taken through a correspondence method for RC officers. Reserve
Component promotion to captain requires completion of all phases of CHBOLC.
   (3) The Chaplain Officer Education System for RC Chaplains following CHBOLC is similar to the AA chaplaincy.

   b. Branch qualification and development opportunities. Even though Reserve Component officers are limited by
geographical considerations, they should strive for chaplain assignments that yield the same developmental opportuni-
ties as their Active Army counterparts.

Army Medical Department
41–1. The Army Medical Department description
The Army Medical Department (AMEDD) is a special branch of the Army whose mission is to provide health services
for the Army and, as directed, for other agencies, organizations and military Services. Six separate officer Corps or
branches provide the leadership and professional expertise necessary to accomplish the broad Soldier support functions
implicit to the mission. Specific information on AMEDD officer professional and career development may be found in
detail in DA Pam 600–4.
41–2. Personnel Management
The key to the distinctive personnel management system of the AMEDD is the six individual Corps, each with a
defined mission; some with missions provided for by statute. The separate nature of the many disciplines that combine
to make the total health care delivery system dictates some diversity in approach to the management of the personnel
within that system. The AMEDD capitalizes upon the diversity of its Corps and is committed to developing and
selecting the very best qualified officers from its entire Corps for key leadership positions. The Surgeon General is
responsible for AMEDD officer career management within the general policies established by the Deputy Chief of
Staff, G–1. The Director of Personnel, Office of The Surgeon General, and the Commander, AHRC, manage AMEDD
officers with the advice and assistance of the six AMEDD Corps chiefs and professional consultants.

Chapter 42
Army Acquisition Corps
42–1. Introduction
   a. Purpose. The Army Acquisition Corps (AAC) is responsible for equipping and sustaining the world’s most
capable, powerful and respected Army. Our first responsibility is to the Soldier who protects and preserves our Nation.
We strive to meet the needs of the Soldier throughout the full spectrum of operations by incorporating technical
solutions to respond to the rapidly evolving threat environment. We ensure the production of the highest quality
capabilities, providing the right product to the right place, at the right time-ensuring the Army is equipped for the 21st
century. Our next responsibility is to our Partners - Army, Joint, industry, international, and academia. We work with
our partners to develop, acquire, deliver and sustain weapons systems and capabilities to our Soldiers. We work closely
with our partners to continually improve Army capabilities and to ensure their interoperability. Our final responsibility
is to the American public. We must be good stewards of the taxpayers’ dollars and work to continuously achieve the
highest levels of effectiveness and efficiency in our business decisions. The AAC consists of commissioned officers,
noncommissioned officers and Department of the Army civilians. Commissioned officers in the AAC are designated as
functional area 51 officers.
   b. Proponent information. The proponent for the Active Army and the United States Army Reserve is the United
States Army Acquisition Support Center (USAASC). The USAASC Web site is located at http://asc.army.mil. The
proponent for the Army National Guard is the National Guard Bureau Acquisition Career Management Office
(NGB–PRAC–ACMO). The AAC officers are strongly encouraged to establish and maintain dialogue with the
proponent for professional development advice and information as well as for opportunities that impact the AAC.
Officers are also encouraged to maintain a dialogue with their respective assignment officer. Each officer is his or her
own best career manager. Maintaining an open dialogue optimizes the opportunities for enhanced professional develop-
ment training, education, and experience.
   c. Functions. Unique functions performed by the Army acquisition workforce are based in statute and cannot be
performed by non-acquisition personnel. Applicable statute is contained in the Defense Acquisition Workforce Im-
provement Act (DAWIA), consisting of 10 USC Sections 1701–1764 and further referenced in the Department of
Defense Instruction (DODI) 5000 series. FA 51 officers effectively and efficiently develop, acquire, field, test and
evaluate and sustain materiel by leveraging domestic, organic, commercial and foreign technologies, and capabilities to
meet the Army’s current and future mission requirements. Acquisition officers are primarily responsible for the “M”
domain in doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leader development, personnel and facilities (DOTML–PF).
   d. Career specialization. Army officers can receive training, experience and certification in five of the DOD
Acquisition Career Fields (ACFs): Program Management (ACF A); Contracting (ACF C); Systems Planning, Research,
Development and Engineering-Science and Technology Management (ACF S); Information Technology (ACF R); and,
Testing & Evaluation (ACF T). An officer is expected to develop functional expertise in a minimum of two ACFs and
broaden their individual experience and knowledge through several different and unique assignments. Officers are not
single-tracked into one of the above ACFs, but are expected and encouraged to seek experience in several through
coordination with their assignment officer.
   (1) Program Management (ACF A) encompasses management of materiel systems development and fielding. These
systems and products may include but are not limited to weapons systems, individual equipment, information technol-
ogy or command and control capabilities. Duties within the ACF A span across the life-cycle of systems development.
The life-cycle includes: planning and refining the initial requirements; development and maturation of technology
through a disciplined engineering process; producing and deploying the materiel capability; and supporting the fielded
capability in the operational force. Throughout this life-cycle, officers manage the efforts of the government and its
partners. ACF A positions include specific program management assignments where officers are responsible for writing
requirements and defining system requirements involving cost, schedule and performance.
   (2) Contracting and Industrial Management (ACF C) assignments focus on officers leading teams that provide
contracting support worldwide to expeditionary operations throughout the entire spectrum of military operations. These
officers will lead contingency contracting teams, contracting efforts for installations, military construction and weapon
systems procurement offices. They execute contract awards and contract administration management and industrial
management/ oversight at contractor facilities worldwide. Officers coordinate with warfighters and program managers
for requirement determination. These officers are responsible for making determinations on contracts awards and
developing contracting support plans. Assignments with a contracting focus may include contracting support to the
warfighter; contract support planning at all levels of Army operations; Systems and Service contracting in major buying
commands, Program Executive Offices (PEOs), and Life Cycle Management Commands (LCMCs); or, military
construction in the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Assignments with an industrial management
focus may include: full spectrum contract surveillance CONUS and OCONUS and executive plant manager liaison to
contractor Lead Systems Integrator (LSIs). Duties may include working with specific developmental programs or

terms and conditions; obligating funds; awarding contracts; leading contractual action post award; monitoring perform-
ance and production; and program management front-line support in plant).
   (3) Systems Planning, Research, Development and Engineering-Science and Technology Management
(SPRDE–STM) (ACF S) assignments focus on linking the laboratories, the field Army, and Soldiers together to find
technological or technology based solutions for the challenges faced by warfighters. SPRDE–STM officers spiral
technologies into existing platforms to provide real-time solutions to current operational challenges, and work on long
term technology development programs to develop the future force to ensure technological overmatch in the future.
SPRDE–STM officers maintain awareness of advances in emerging technologies from Army and Joint labs, academia,
and the worldwide industrial base; evaluate such technologies for applicability to solving warfighting problems; and
inform combatant commanders of technological issues in operational terms. SPRDE–STM officers translate the
operational requirements of warfighters into the technical language of the scientists and engineers working in the labs
and vice-versa. SPRDE–STM officers prepare technology support plans and integrate into all aspects of the warfighting
planning process as necessary. SPRDE–STM officers may, on occasion, directly participate in tactical combat opera-
tions down to the squad/fire team level in order to gain first-hand knowledge of warfighter technology requirements.
SPRDE–STM officers may field new and/or experimental technologies directly from laboratories to units in combat to
meet short-term needs, or may conduct technology transfer/hand-off from laboratories to traditional acquisition
programs.
   (4) Information and Technology (ACF R) assignments focus on research, engineering, and systems integration of
information technology; participation in mission analysis and concept development; evaluation of competing technolog-
ical approaches to battlefield systems integration; and post-deployment software support. Officers provide leadership
and management in the acquisition of software engineering solutions, simulations and modeling, information network
projects, computer systems, technical and systems architectures, and systems integration projects. Officers are expected
to maintain awareness of advances in emerging information technologies, evaluate and assess competing technological
approaches, and manage cost, schedule, and performance.
   (5) Test and Evaluation (ACF T) assignments focus will center on leading teams which validate the design,
documentation, and execution of experiments and tests under conditions ranging from highly controlled to realistic
free-play exercises in an operational environment. Officers will coordinate with the warfighter and program offices,
schedule all resources for the test, design automated data processing support plans and instrumentation, and conduct or
control the test to achieve test objectives. They produce the test report, evaluate test data and assess the performance,
utility, military suitability and effectiveness of systems under test. Officers can expect to perform these duties CONUS
and OCONUS, at installations, test centers, program offices, and during deployments while providing acquisition
support across the entire spectrum of military operations.
42–2. Officer characteristics required.
   a. Characteristics required of all officers. All officers are expected to possess the base characteristics that will
enable them to develop into agile and adaptive leaders for the 21st century. These leaders must be: competent in their
core proficiencies; broad enough to operate across the spectrum of conflict, able to operate in Joint, Interagency,
Intergovernmental and Multinational (JIIM) environments and leverage other capabilities in achieving their objective,
culturally astute and able to use this awareness and understanding to conduct operations innovatively; courageous
enough to see and exploit opportunities in the challenges and complexities of the operational environment; and
grounded in Army Values and the warrior ethos. Further explanation of these characteristics can be referenced in FM
3–0 and in chapter 3 of this publication.
   b. Unique knowledge and skills of an Acquisition Corps officer. In order to be assigned to a lieutenant colonel
(LTC) position or higher, the acquisition certification for Acquisition Corps Membership must be met. While these
requirements do not need to be met at time of accession, they must be met within 24 months of assignment to a LTC
or higher position. The work performed by FA 51 officers requires an in-depth knowledge and synergy of business,
technology and military operations which cannot be duplicated by other branches or functional areas (FAs). Acquisition
officers oversee and manage contracts and programs worth billions of dollars, and supervise the technical development
efforts and purchases which satisfy warfighter requirements in the rapidly changing operational environment. FA 51
officers of all grades operate at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels throughout the JIIM environment. An
understanding of military operations is critical; accompanied by the ability to lead a diverse workforce which includes
civilians, other Services, elements of the federal government, civilian industry, and partner nations. FA 51 officers must
find and exploit opportunities to quickly provide mature materiel capabilities which satisfy warfighter needs while
conducting themselves beyond reproach. Acquisition support to operations includes finding and purchasing capabilities
and services during civil support operations such as fires and floods, or rapidly developing and fielding an urgent
operational need to deployed forces.
42–3. Officer development
The three domains of leader development: Professional Military Education (PME) (institutional training), assignments,
and self-development, define and engage a continuous cycle of education, training, selection, experience, assessment,
feedback, reinforcement, and evaluation which helps to encourage officer development throughout career progression.
392                                           DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010

Officers should balance assignments in order to gain a breadth and depth of operational and staff experience across all
echelons of command and types of units.
   a. Officer Development Model. The foundation of the FA 51 officer professional development is the experience,
education and training required to obtain DAWIA certification. All acquisition officers can expect to have ample
opportunities to serve in diverse assignments and receive the training required to attain DAWIA Certification. Officers
are expected to achieve certification in at least two ACFs (one of the two shall be in contracting or program
management) with a minimum of Level II certification in one ACF required prior to selection to LTC. Professional
military schooling, acquisition unique training and a strong manner of performance help officers to be competitive for
subsequent positions with increasing responsibilities and challenges. All functional area YG 94 and junior officers
should complete the common core Intermediate Level Education (ILE) and the follow-on Acquisition Intermediate
Qualification Course (IQC) no later than their 15th year of AFCS. Officers should meet the statutory and Professional
Military Education (PME) requirements prior to selection to lieutenant colonel (LTC). More information can be found
at: http://asc.army.mil/career/military.cfmb.
   (1) Officer Accession Process. Officers are normally accessed into FA 51 at their 6th or 7th year of service. For
Active Army officers this is prior to their cohort year group’s respective Functional Designation Board (FDB).
Foundational to accession as a FA 51 officer is demonstrated outstanding performance in the appropriate key
developmental (KD) position in the grade of captain (CPT) as outlined in the officer’s basic branch of this DA
Pamphlet. Additionally, officers may follow the AHRC guidelines for Branch and/or functional designation (FD)
transfers. Active Army FA 51 officers are centrally managed by the Acquisition Management Branch (AMB) at AHRC
(located under Force Sustainment Division); AMB handles all future assignments for FA 51 officers regardless of basic
branch for active officers. USAR FA 51 officers are centrally managed by the Acquisition Career Management Office
(ACMO) at AHRC-St Louis (located under Force Sustainment Division); ACMO handles all FA 51 assignments for
officers regardless of basic branch for USAR officers. The ARNG FA 51 officers are managed by state Human
Resource Offices in coordination with the National Guard Bureau Acquisition Career Management Office. In addition,
Reserve Component officers may dual track between their basic branch and FA 51 positions based on the needs of the
Army Reserve. Newly accessed officers will normally complete their current tour in their basic branch prior to being
trained and assigned to their first acquisition assignment.
   (2) FA 51 officers serve in a variety of JIIM positions at OSD, Joint Commands, Combatant Commands and
International assignments. These positions provide exposure to experiences outside the officer’s functional area and are
considered broadening assignments. Broadening assignments develop a wider range of knowledge and skills, augment
understanding of the full spectrum of Army missions, promote practical application of training, increase cross cultural
exposure, and expand officer awareness of other governmental agencies, units or environments. Broadening assign-
ments enhance an officer’s ability to perform in an ever changing, complex environment across the spectrum of conflict
at the tactical, operational and strategic levels.
   (3) Certification. Officers are required to obtain a professional certification in accordance with statute and DOD
directives/ instructions. Certification levels are assigned to each acquisition position: Level I (CPT/ MAJ); Level II
(MAJ); Level III (LTC/COL). The different levels of certification build upon acquisition skills/ competencies gained at
each level which include education, training (institutional) and experience against established criteria. Certification
levels are reflected on the officer’s official Officer Record Brief. Information on current certification requirements can
be located in the Defense Acquisition University (DAU) catalog at http://www.dau.mil.
   (4) Professional/self-development requirements. The tool used to track and maintain self-development requirements
is an Individual Development Plan (IDP). An IDP is a five-year living document between the officer and his/her rater
that outlines specific objectives and training that an officer will accomplish during the course of their current
assignment. Officers at all ranks are required to complete 80 Continuous Learning Points (CLPs) every two years in
order to maintain their proficiency and professional development. All active component FA 51 officers may apply for
the opportunity to attend a fully-funded ACS or a training with industry program after their first acquisition assign-
ment. Selection to ACS or TWI is contingent upon the needs of the Army, the officer’s promotion potential, their
potential for academic success, and their career time line.
   (5) Regionalization for Active Army officers. Under the regionalization concept the Director of Acquisition Man-
agement (DACM) appoints a senior regional acquisition official (SRAO) to each established region (for example.
National Capital Region, Huntsville, AL). The SRAO has the responsibility to standardize professional development
and increase the diversification of the officers within that region by allowing the officer the ability and time to grow
into positions of increased responsibility. The SRAO coordinates and works with acquisition leaders to ensure solid
rotation plans to further develop our junior and field grade officers. Officers are expected to rotate between several
ACFs in order to receive the diversity of experience required to become successful FA 51 leaders. Majors within one
year of their primary zone of consideration for lieutenant colonel will not be considered for regionalization; any
assignment to a region that an officer is assigned too will terminate one year prior to their primary zone of
consideration for LTC.
   (6) Acquisition Corps Membership: Selection for membership is not tied to accession into the FA 51 career field
within the Acquisition Corps. Acquisition Corps membership shall be made in accordance with criteria and procedures
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            393

established by the Secretary of Defense. Only officers who meet all of the following requirements may be considered
for Acquisition Corps Membership:
   (a) Has received a baccalaureate degree at an accredited educational institution authorized to grant baccalaureate
degrees, with at least 24 semester credit hours (or the equivalent) of study from an accredited institution of higher
education from among the following disciplines: accounting, business finance, law, contracts, purchasing, economics,
industrial management, marketing, quantitative methods, and organization and management or equivalent training; or,
at least 24 semester credit hours (or the equivalent) from an accredited institution of higher education in one of the five
ACFs and 12 semester credit hours (or the equivalent) from such an institution from among the disciplines listed
above.
   (b) The officer must be in the grade of major or above and have at least four years of experience in an acquisition
position in the Department of Defense or in a comparable position in industry or government.
   (c) The officer must be a minimum of DAWIA Level II certified in one of the five ACFs.
   (7) Critical Acquisition Positions (CAPs): Per 10 USC, Chapter 87 § 1733 a critical acquisition position may be
filled only by a member of the Acquisition Corps. All FA 51 LTC and higher positions are designated as CAPs unless
waived by appropriate authority; the statutory tenure for all CAPs is 3 years.
   (8) Captain/major development. Officers are generally expected to attend the Army Acquisition Basic Course
(AABC), Army Acquisition Intermediate Contracting Course (AAICC) and Army Intermediate Contracting Lab (AICL)
en route to their first acquisition assignment (USAR and ARNG officers may attend these courses (in lieu of DAU
equivalent courses) as determined by their career manager).
   (9) Newly trained captains and majors will be assigned to a position which is designed to develop their functional
understanding of one of the five Acquisition Career Fields. The majority of these officers will either be placed in a
contracting or program management assignment. Most assignments for Active Army, USAR, and ARNG FA 51
officers will be between 24–48 months in length as reflected below. OCONUS locations will continue to require
specific tour lengths. Although many acquisition officers will find themselves assigned to regional assignments, some
acquisition experiences may result from non-regional tours, which are typically 24–36 months in length.
   (10) Diversification is the key feature of an FA 51 officer’s development. The goal is to expose officers to multiple
acquisition career fields in order to grow agile and adaptive leaders who are prepared to lead highly complex,
multifunctional organizations and provide acquisition expertise throughout the full range of military operations. For
increased competitiveness for promotion to LTC, officers should have a minimum military education level (MEL) ILE.
For FA 51 officers, MEL ILE is awarded after successful completion of ILE and IQC. An additional goal for FA 51
officers is to obtain a master’s degree in an appropriate technical, engineering, business or management field. Officers
must complete or have completed the minimum number of business hours required for Acquisition Corps Membership
and any specific requirement for specific ACF assignments.
   (11) The assignment experience required to attain the goal of certification in multiple Acquisition ACFs prior to
promotion to lieutenant colonel (LTC) requires careful planning and attention to an officer’s qualifications and
expertise. Captains are considered developed as a result of their basic branch experience prior to accession into FA 51.
   (a) Key developmental positions for majors are Contracting Team Lead, Administrative Contracting Officer, or
Assistant Product/Project Manager in a Program Executive Office or a Direct Reporting Program Management Office.
   (b) Professional development of majors will be broadened through acquisition assignments within the Department of
Defense, Corps of Engineers, Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), TRADOC or HQ DA. FA 51 officer’s
career and assignment planning should include the use of the FA 51 life-cycle model, direct coordination with their
rater and senior rater, and coordination with their AMB assignments officer at AHRC or respective Reserve Compo-
nent career manager
   b. Lieutenant colonel development. The career development goal for a lieutenant colonel is to complete multiple
acquisition career field certifications through training and experience at the CAP level culminating with selection to an
acquisition Central Selection List-Key Billet (CSL–KB): Contingency Contracting Battalion Commander, DCMA
Director Product Manager or Test Center Director. LTC positions are considered Critical Acquisition Positions (CAPs)
and officers assigned to such position must meet Corps Membership status and DAWIA Level III certification. In order
to compete for CSL–KB selection, an officer must be a member of the Acquisition Corps. All FA 51 non CSL–KB
LTC positions are considered career broadening. FA 51 officers compete for Senior Service College (SSC) (MEL SSC)
along with other branches/functional areas. SSC is the final major military educational program available to prepare
officers for the positions of greatest responsibility in the Department of Defense.
   c. Colonel development. The career development goal for a colonel is to serve in a FA 51 CSL–Key Billet:
Contingency Contracting Brigade Commander, DCMA Director, Project Manager, and Test Center Director. Colonels
successfully completing a CSL assignment are assigned to senior leadership positions with significant and strategic
importance to the future of the Army and DOD.

42–4. Army Acquisition Corps Reserve Component officers
Upon mobilization officers assigned to acquisition positions must be qualified to perform as Army acquisition officers.
The ARNG and USAR contribute to our workforce in day-to-day operations, during contingencies, and in times of
mobilization. Differences in the detailed execution of career management for Active Army officers and Reserve
Component officers will exist. The RC officers ordinarily acquire their acquisition expertise in their civilian careers,
either in the Government or industry, or through extended periods of Active Duty. Active Duty training opportunities
will increase the certification and experience of traditional Troop Program Unit and Individual Mobilization Aug-
mentee FA 51 Soldiers. Granting equivalent credit based on civilian experience, coupled with recurring education
under the DOD financed DAU consortium of schools/courses, will allow the ARNG/USAR to maintain the profes-
sional acquisition workforce needed to support the total Army and meet the legal requirements of DAWIA. Eligible
ARNG/USAR officers may compete for CSL–KB selection at the lieutenant colonel and colonel level along with
Active Army officers and Army Acquisition Corps civilians (ARNG uses the Acquisition Career Record Brief in place
of the ORB for centrally selected boards). These ARNG/USAR officers will be primarily slated to programs that
support their respective components. The ultimate goal is to create an integrated Army Acquisition Corps, ensuring the
standardization of education, training, and experiences to better integrate all components.

Section II
Terms
Area of concentration
Identifies a requirement and an officer possessing a requisite area of expertise (subdivision) within a branch or
functional area. An officer may possess and serve in more than one area of concentration.
Branch
A branch is a grouping of officers that comprises an arm or Service of the Army in which, as a minimum, officers are
commissioned, assigned, developed and promoted through their company grade years. Officers are accessed into a
single basic branch and will hold that branch designation, which is later augmented between the 5th and 6th YOS with a
functional area. An accession branch admits officers upon commissioning; a non-accession branch admits experienced
officers from the accession branches. With the exception of Special Forces, all other branches are accession branches.
Special Forces recruits officers with a minimum of 3 years experience. (See chap 15 for further discussion.) Officers
will serve their first 8 to 12 years developing the leadership and tactical skills associated with their branch. They will
continue to wear their branch insignia throughout their military Service. All career branches are in the operations CF.
Branch/functional area generalist position
An 01A or 02A-coded position that may be filled by any officer, regardless of branch or functional area designation.
This is an umbrella term used to collectively describe two subset categories defined as officer generalist and combat
arms generalist positions. (Note: Previously termed immaterial positions.)
Captain Career Course
This course is the second major branch school officers attend before company-level command. It combines the
instruction formerly taught in the branch Officer Advanced Course and the Combined Arms and Services Staff School
(CAS3). The branch phase consists of 18-weeks of branch specific technical and tactical training with integrated
common core instruction. The 6-week TDY staff process phase at Fort Leavenworth prepares officers to function as
staff officers at battalion, brigade and division level.
Career field
A specific grouping of functionally related officer, WO, enlisted and civilian positions into management categories
having a common mission area. CFs consist of officer branches and FAs, WO and enlisted military occupational
specialties and civilian occupational series. There are four CFs: operations, information operations, institutional support
and operational support. (The term CF in lower case is also a generic term commonly used by military and civilian
personnel when referring to their branch, FA, military occupational specialty or civilian occupational series.)
Career field coordinators
The senior Army leaders responsible for the oversight of the branch and FA proponents who collectively comprise their
CFs. CF coordinators are responsible to integrate, consolidate, and report professional development, force structure, and
personnel policy issues to HQDA.
Career field designation
The process whereby officers are assigned a CF. Immediately after selection for promotion to major, an officer’s file is
reviewed by a formal Career Field Designation Board. Designation is based on factors including officer preference,
rater and senior rater recommendations, education, training, and unique skills or attributes.
Combat arms generalist position
A duty position requiring a broad understanding of combined arms doctrine, training and force structure. A combat
arms generalist position is not identified with one specific branch or FA, but is limited to officers whose branches are
Infantry, Armor, Field Artillery, Air Defense Artillery, Aviation, Special Forces, and Corps of Engineers; and who are
currently managed in the operations CF. These positions are documented in TAADS with code 02A. (Note: Previously
termed combat arms immaterial positions.)
Functional area
A FA is a grouping of officers by technical specialty or skill, which usually requires significant education, training and
                                             DA PAM 600–3 • 1 February 2010                                            429

experience. An officer receives his or her FA between the 5th and 6th YOS. Individual preference, academic back-
ground, manner of performance, training and experience, and needs of the Army are all considered during the
designation process.
Officer generalist position
A duty position requiring a broad understanding of Army leadership, doctrine, policy, force structure and management.
An officer generalist position is not identified with or limited to one specific branch or FA, but indicates that any
officer may be assigned to the position. For example, both Armor Branch officers in the operations CF and FA 45
Comptrollers in the institutional support CF are eligible to serve in officer generalist positions. These positions are
documented in The Army Authorization Document System with code 01A. (Note: Previously termed branch immaterial
positions.)
Skill
Identifies a requirement and an officer possessing specialized skills to perform duties of a specific position that may
require significant education, training, and experience. A skill can be related to more than one branch or FA. An officer
may have more than one skill.
Special branches
A grouping of branches and officers primarily concerned with providing combat Service support and/or administration
to the Army as a whole but managed separately from combat Service support branches. Special branches include Army
Medical Department, Chaplain Corps, and Judge Advocate General’s Corps.
Strategic human resource management
A broader, more holistic perspective on personnel management that extends beyond the fundamental life-cycle
functions. Strategic human resource management (SHRM) focuses on the long term vision of OPMS and links
fundamental personnel management decisions to the desired end state. SHRM links character and leader development,
the new officer Evaluation Reporting System (DA Form 67–9) and the personnel life-cycle management functions
addressed in OPMS XXI. While the initial focus of SHRM is on officer personnel, SHRM will encompass the total
force of officers, warrant officers, enlisted and civilian personnel.
