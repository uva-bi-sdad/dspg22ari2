Evaluation and Selection Systems

1


System Facts
• Purpose of Evaluations:	Identify our Army’s best performers and those with the greatest potential
– Selection and Separation Boards and assignment managers are the audience
– Requires candor and courage; frank and accurate assessment
– Leaders must guard against “word inflation”…words matter most
– Allows for field impact on selection of future leaders

• Both OER and NCOER are assessment tools …do not counsel on assessments
– OER is a forced distribution system
• Senior Rater top box restricted to <50%
• Rater left most box restricted to <50%

– OER Rater narrative focus on performance
– OER SR narrative focus on quantifiable potential
– NCOER SR bullets focus on excellence, performance & quantifiable potential

• Selection & Promotion system is based on Army requirements
– Use the top box and quantified narratives to identify your best
– Cannot predict selection board results on Top Box/Most Qualified or Highly Qualified labels as selection boards decide based on a series of reports (the Whole File Concept)

• Commander is overall care-taker of all personnel systems




Army Evaluation Reporting System


• Who receives evaluation reports?
– Officers - Warrant Officer One through Brigadier General
– NCOs - Sergeant through Command Sergeant Major.
• Two different Evaluation form series for two different
populations.
– Officer Evaluation Reporting System:
• Broader comparison, more of a generalist
• Doctrine Based, Tactical, Broadening – Strategic
– Noncommissioned Officer Evaluation Reporting System:
• Highlights Strengths and Uniqueness of the NCO Corps.
• Assess technical competence in MOS and Doctrine
• Responsible for individual training	(Teach others the tra








	


Secondary effects of Eval System:
• Maintain discipline
• Promote leader development/professionalism by linking performance to missions and doctrine (assessed by field leaders)
• Provide feedback to rated individuals


Rating Roles:
• RATER – Performance & Counseling
• Met Standards? Yes / No
• Narrow, more specific
• SENIOR RATER – Potential & Mentorship
– Capstone evaluation, spread of quality
– Broader, more general
• REVIEWER – adherence to policy & intent
– On OER: When required
– On NCOER: Separate individual

The System’s Components:
(as approved by CSA/SECARMY)
• Rating relationship that exists between Rater and Rated Soldier (w/oversight by Senior Rater)
• Counseling documented on support and counseling forms.
• Final assessment documented on evaluation form.








	


• WO1 reports moved to restricted section of AMHRR after selection to CW3.
• LT reports moved to restricted section of AMHRR at promotion to CPT.
• Officer Records Brief lists duty positions

Strengthening the Rating Chain



Develop regulatory guidance to strengthen rating chain accountability
• Revised policy strengthens accountability within the rating chain to maintain relationships that provide rated officers with leaders who have first-hand knowledge of their responsibilities, performance and potential.

• Requires approval of rating schemes / one level up (up to 3-Star HQ)

• Intermediate Raters limited to special branches and dual supervisor situations

• Supplementary Review: When there are no uniformed Army designated rating officials for the Rated Officer, an Army Officer within the organization will be designated as a Uniformed Army Advisor and perform a supplementary review.
> The Uniformed Army Advisor will be an U.S. Army officer, normally senior to
the senior rater, within the organization.
> The Uniformed Army Advisor will monitor evaluation practices, provide assistance and advice to rating officials (as required) on matters pertaining to Army evaluations.
* Applies in Joint Environments
* Applies where DoD and DA Civilians serve as Rater and Senior Rater
* Applies in multi-national environments


Unclassified


New OER (DA Form 67-10 / Supplementary Review)

* In instances when there are no uniformed Army designated rating officials for the Rated Officer, an Army Officer within the organization will be designated as a Uniformed Army Advisor (UAA) and perform a supplementary review (IAW 623-3).

* The UAA will be an U.S. Army officer SENIOR to the rated officer within the organization. The UAA will monitor evaluation practices, provide assistance and advice to rating officials (as required) on matters pertaining to Army evaluations.

Role of the Senior Rater & keys to success

• Senior Rater is the “owner” of the Evaluation and is responsible for timely completion
• Mentor/Develop your subordinates
– Support Form – tool available to aid in defining/guiding goals and objective throughout rating period, provides feedback to rated individual -not a lot of space but should be catalyst of conversation

• Understand how our Evaluation Systems works
– Fairly and accurately assess subordinates -participate in counseling
– Senior Rater Narrative is key: Exclusive vs. Strong Narrative to describe subordinate
– Quantify potential…identify your best
– Be Careful… What you don’t say is just as damaging as what you do say

• Verify/Certify your subordinates on how to assess – ask them to bring their counselings and
assessment s with them to their counseling

• Understand how to manage your Senior Rater profile - develop your rating philosophy
• Anticipate and project “next” Evaluation
> Current thru date on file plus 12 months or known changes of rater
> Complete the record dates for those being considered by a board

• Monitor when reports are required, that they’re submitted on time, and unit rating schemes are current and accurate (Leader responsibility)
– Use Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) and Evaluation Entry System (EES)

Role of the Rater


• Raters must read, understand, and assess performance based on ADRP 6-22 Leadership Attributes and Competencies
• Ensure rating schemes are published and understood
• Provide Support Form and Counsel those you rate (mandatory)
• Develop a “Rating Philosophy” and communicate it to rated officers
• Advocate Officer to the Senior Rater
• Recommend future Operational and Broadening Assignments on field grade form
• Clearly and concisely communicate rated officer’s most significant achievements
• Focus on narrative comments; selection board members use the rater’s assessment in
their file deliberations


• Anticipate and project future evaluations – When & Why?
• Keep senior rating officials informed of upcoming evaluations
• Track evaluations from submission to HRC thru completion

Developing a Rating Philosophy



• Mission: Identify your best


• Counseling – ensure counseling is accomplished. Those that can improve will


• Decide how to assess (particularly) Excels based on performance and Most Qualified Based upon Potential

• Write well – quantify and qualify in narrative; correspond comments with box check as the system allows. Use the narrative to paint the picture


• Plan ahead, think series of reports (number of times you will rate an officer)

Evaluation Narrative


• Selection boards should understand what input the Rating Chain is providing without having to guess
• Raters focus on specifics to quantify and qualify performance
• Senior raters need to amplify their potential box checks by using the narrative to clearly send the appropriate message to selection boards. Focus on potential (3 to 5 years; command, assignment, schooling and promotion)
• Cannot mention Box Check in the narrative
• Be careful with your narrative:
- What is not said can have the same impact as what is said
- Don’t say the same thing for all your people (Boards can easily detect repeated verbiage)
- Avoid using the same verbiage year to year for the same officer (modified cut and paste)
- Accurately and fairly assess all officers regardless of branch and functional area

- Don’t be afraid of Referred Reports

Senior Rater Misfire warning for 67-10-1/2 with Most Qualified indication.

CONDITION: Senior Rater is making a "Most Qualified" indication on the 67-10-1/2 Form (WO1-LTC) in the Evaluation Entry System (EES). The system (EES) calculates an indication of MOST QUALIFIED will result in a MISFIRE:

MISFIRE DEFINITION = (#Most Qual/Total #reports is equal to or greater than 50%)




 “YOUR SELECTION OF “MOST QUALIFED” MAY RESULT IN A DOCUMENTED "MISFIRE" AS YOUR SENIOR RATER PROFILE DOES NOT SUPPORT. YOUR SENIOR RATER PROFILE IS ACCURATE AS OF (SYSTEM DATE TIME=NOW). IF EVALUATION REPORTS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED BY ALTERNATE METHODS (e.g. MAIL, SIPR OR NIPR) AND THE RATED OFFICER’S NAME WITH THE MOST RECENT THRU DATE IS NOT INCLUDED ON YOUR PROFILE, HRC HAS NOT RECEIVED OR PROCESSED THAT EVALUATION. ONCE RECEIVED AND SUCCESSFULLY PROCESSED, THE RATED OFFICERS NAME WILL BE INCLUDED IN YOUR PROFILE AND YOUR MOST QUALIFIED BOX CHECK MAY BECOME AVAILABLE. BY SUBMITTING THIS REPORT, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS EVALUATION WILL RECEIVE A HQDA LABEL OF “HIGHLY QUALIFIED” AND DOCUMENTED AS AN “OFFICIAL MISFIRE” AND NOTICE MAY BE PLACED IN YOUR AMHRR. YOUR PROFILE WILL INCREMENT IN THE MOST QUALIFIED TOTAL AS INDICATED ON THE FORM AND WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE HIGHLY QUALIFIED TOTALS.
IF YOU HAVE OTHER EVALUATIONS TO PROCESS (MAIL OR ELECTRONIC) THAT WOULD ALLOW THIS REPORT TO PROCESS WITH THIS BOX CHECK, PROCESS THOSE FIRST.”

 Purpose of Evaluations: Identify our Army’s best performers and those with the greatest potential. They help:
Maintain discipline
Promote leader development/professionalism by linking performance to missions and doctrine
(assessed by field leaders)
Provide feedback to rated individuals **counseling is critical

Leader must know how the system works, know when reports are due and have a rating philosophy

NARRATIVES - THEY ARE THE KEY to the system 99.008% of all Officers have at least one DA67-9 Center of Mass report and we expect use of Highly Qualified to remain consistent.

10	OERs:
- “Highly Qualified” ratings will be the norm
- Small populations/immature profile are common in any profile system
- Label never shows down-turn in performance.
