Clearly connects this quality to success in leadership.\n                Code is always paired with specific qualities.","Deliberate, continuous, and progressive process, founded in Army Values,\n                that grows others into competent, committed, professional leaders of character.","Assesses three dimensions of organizational trust: ability,\n                benevolence, and integrity. Encapsulates trust in the broader organization of the Army, not in a particular individual. Other terms\n                include culture of trust includes indoctrination.","Differences in team members in areas such as background, religion, race,\n                socioeconomic status, or areas of expertise. Includes diversity in skill and background.","If paired with a code, it talks about\n                that other code in a bad way. If on its own, it describes a negative quality or behavior like over drinking.","Describe what it means to be a successful team or how team success may be measured.","Common and clear goals and vision\n                that members of a team identify with and uphold. This is on a smaller level, for example your unit knows exactly what your expected\n                outcome is.","Actions or processes that encourage members to work together.","Individuals are dependable, reliable, and make\n                every effort to keep their promises.","Measures agreeableness, trust, skepticism and suspicion; the extent an individual is\n                easy or difficult to get along with. Includes cohesion.","Having an effect or influence on another person or organization.","Measures a person’s ability to analyze and process information, astuteness or obtuseness. For innovation, use this &amp; adaptability\n                Includes efficiency in skill.","This makes any positive quality negative. It must also be selected with a positive quality.\n                For example, if a passage described poor communication, you would select this and then communication.","Assesses the ability\n                to alter one's course, and perceived cognitive flexibility. For innovation, use this &amp; intellectual efficiency.","Measures a person’s tendency to prefer working in teams and make people work together better.","Measures a person’s level of identification with the military and their strength of desire to serve their country.","Exchange of information between individuals. Includes verbal and non-verbal.","Having honest and strong moral principles."],["Leaders can display character by completing tasks on time and modeling standards for performance, personal appearance, \n              physical fitness, and ethics. They can also display character by modeling sound judgement and reasoning, determination,\n              persistence, and patience","Leader development is a continuous lifelong learning process beginning with pre-appointment\n              training and education.","We all have an important job to do, necessary to the unit’s missions. Soldiers throughout the\n              Army perform the duties of medics, infantrymen, cooks, truck drivers, mechanics, legal clerks, aviators, and other occupations.\n              We bring fuel to the tanks, scout for the enemy, listen to the enemy’s signals, and close in and defeat the enemy. \n              We defend against air attacks, ensure Soldiers are paid accordingly, and process awards to recognize other Soldier’s \n              accomplishments. As important as individual Soldier tasks are, we all know that these efforts support a team and that the \n              whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Every team has a leader, and that leader is responsible for what the team does \n              or fails to do. That is why obeying orders is the critical essence of discipline.","Variation in upbringing, culture, \n              religious belief, and tradition is reflected among those who choose to serve in the Army. Such diversity provides many \n              benefits for a force globally engaged around the world. Good leaders value this diversity of outlook and experience and \n              must treat all individuals with the inherent dignity and respect due every person.","Misunderstands or fails to perceive\n              nonverbal cues. Ideas not well organized or easily understandable. Speaks without considering listener interest.\n              Information dissemination is inconsistent or untimely.","High performance teams demonstrate mental agility (see ADRP 6-22)\n              in their willingness to approach problems from different viewpoints and to hold and work on opposing ideas until identifying \n              the best solution","Shared vision exists when members of the team have a common understanding of the following: The overall \n              mission or objective. Goals and sub-goals of the mission. Strategies for reaching those goals. Team members’ strengths and weaknesses. \n              Values and preferences of the team as a whole and among the individual members. The roles each member will play and want. \n              The big picture (such as how this particular mission contributes to a larger purpose).","The team-building approach addresses\n              the interaction and relationships among team members essential to collaboration and critical to high performance.\n              It accelerates collaboration by allowing the team members to further develop qualities of shared vision, trust, competence, \n              and confidence among team members. It is a streamlined approach designed to break through barriers and boundaries that stagnate\n              team development.","The general responsibilities of a Soldier are as follows: Obey the lawful orders of NCOs and Officers. \n              Treat others with dignity and respect. Complete each task to the very best degree possible and not just to standard. \n              Maintain a military appearance. Maintain individual physical fitness standards and readiness. Maintain individual equipment \n              and clothing to standard.","Exemplifies a positive attitude and expectations for a productive work environment. \n              Conveys a priority for development within the organization. Encourages innovative, critical, and creative thought. \n              Leverages lessons learned to improve organization.","Projects self-confidence and inspires confidence in others.\n              Models composure, an outward calm, and control over emotions in adverse situations. Manages personal stress, and remains \n              supportive of stress in others.","Demonstrates expert-level proficiency with technical aspects of job. Demonstrates understanding \n              of joint, cultural and geopolitical knowledge. Conveys knowledge of technical, technological, and tactical systems to\n              subordinates and others.","Communication frequency was negatively related to both ROI and sales growth, contrary to what had \n              been hypothesized. Smith et al. (1994) suggested that perhaps communication frequency is indicative of high levels of conflict \n              in the group, and that the time spent on group maintenance detracts from performance.","Models a flexible mindset and anticipates\n              changing conditions. Engages in multiple approaches when assessing, conceptualizing, and evaluating a course of action.","The success of\n              the U.S. Army is related directly to the quality of the professional relationships between its Soldiers, NCOs, and officers. \n              The relationship between an individual Soldier, team, squad, and platoon with their NCO/officer is the cornerstone of our Army. \n              When that bond forms, it can have the single most important impact on unit effectiveness and efficiency. Conversely, if that bond is broken,\n              it can have a devastating impact on morale, esprit de corps, readiness, and mission accomplishment.","The pride, esprit, and ethos\n              required of Soldiers as members of the Profession of Arms may require them to sacrifice themselves willingly to preserve the Nation,\n              accomplish the mission, or protect the lives of fellow Soldiers.","The questioning creates dialogue, which improves awareness and\n              leads to a higher degree of actionable understanding. Through the dialogue, the team develops shared understanding and trust. \n              When coaching a team exercise: Frame initial questions to clarify the task and the situation. There will often be disagreements on both.\n              Find common ground. Try to get the team to come to agreement on one issue. Build to another agreement. When there is disagreement,\n              try to get at the specifics of what is disagreed upon, before building to said Agreement.","Character is comprised of a person’s\n              moral and ethical qualities, helps determine what is right, and gives a leader motivation to do what is appropriate, regardless of \n              the circumstances or consequences. It determines who people are, how they act, helps determine right from wrong, and choose what is right."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>Code<\/th>\n      <th>Type<\/th>\n      <th>Definition<\/th>\n      <th>Examples<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":18,"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[10,18,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>Below, we highlight noteworthy findings from our analysis with a deeper examination of several converging and diverging themes from across multiple documents.</p>
</div>
<div id="negative-qualities-vs.-negation-of-positive-qualities" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Negative Qualities vs. Negation of Positive Qualities</em></h3>
<p>One difficult and reoccurring issue to code was how to handle qualities that could positively or negatively impact team performance depending on the amount and quality of the quality. For example, the excerpt on the left highlights a situation in which too much communication was associated with negative team outcomes (i.e., communication was seen as a ‘negative quality’ for a group to possess). The excerpt on the right highlights the opposite case, instances where too little (or a lack of) communication and/or poor-quality communication is associated with negative team performance. Taken together, we see that communication is a crucial element in determining team success, but that there is an important contextual element to understanding exactly how communication affects success. For example, if someone is a poor communicator and a team is suffering for it, simply instructing the individual to communicate more is unlikely to resolve the issue. In fact, it could make the situation worse.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="diversity-in-background-vs.-diversity-in-skill" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Diversity in Background vs. Diversity in Skill</em></h3>
<p>An interesting and important point of divergence between the Army and non-Army literature focused on the use of the word ‘diversity.’ In the excerpt on the left, from a non-Army document, we see evidence for how diversity in individual skill sets can contribute to better team performance. However, Army document references diversity as it relates to individuals’ background, upbringing, and culture noting how divergent backgrounds could make team building more complicated and negatively impact team performance.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
</div>
<div id="adaptability-vs.-intellectual-efficiency" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Adaptability vs. Intellectual Efficiency</em></h3>
<p>The following excerpts were all taken from Army documents. The excerpts on the left were coded as 'Adaptability' while the excerpts on the right were coded as 'Intellectual Efficiency.' Distinguishing between these two codes proved difficult during the qualitative analysis because, as is highlighted in the underlined segments, the Army defines both qualities using similar language. Ultimately, we refined our coding scheme to distinguish between the two through the use of language such as that highlighted in yellow. We determined that to be ‘adaptable’ one must be able to think critically, while ‘intellectual efficiency’ rests on a person's ability to analyze and process information to include efficiency in skill. Efficiency in skill includes experiences, training, education, and so on (as highlighted in the top right excerpt), which are not necessarily required in order to be adaptable. Intellectual efficiency includes reasoning and brain power, while adaptability making quick decisions and flexibility thinking, which is crucial for a Soldier to thrive in a 'high operational tempo.’</p>
