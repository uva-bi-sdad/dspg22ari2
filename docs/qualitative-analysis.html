Clearly connects this quality to success in leadership.\\n                Code is always paired with specific qualities.","4":"Leaders can display character by completing tasks on time and modeling standards for performance, personal appearance, \\n              physical fitness, and ethics. They can also display character by modeling sound judgement and reasoning, determination,\\n              persistence, and patience"},{"1":"Leader development","2":"A Priori","3":"Deliberate, continuous, and progressive process, founded in Army Values,\\n                that grows others into competent, committed, professional leaders of character.","4":"Leader development is a continuous lifelong learning process beginning with pre-appointment\\n              training and education."},{"1":"Organizational Trust","2":"A Priori","3":"Assesses three dimensions of organizational trust: ability,\\n                benevolence, and integrity. Encapsulates trust in the broader organization of the Army, not in a particular individual. Other terms\\n                include culture of trust includes indoctrination.","4":"We all have an important job to do, necessary to the unit’s missions. Soldiers throughout the\\n              Army perform the duties of medics, infantrymen, cooks, truck drivers, mechanics, legal clerks, aviators, and other occupations.\\n              We bring fuel to the tanks, scout for the enemy, listen to the enemy’s signals, and close in and defeat the enemy. \\n              We defend against air attacks, ensure Soldiers are paid accordingly, and process awards to recognize other Soldier’s \\n              accomplishments. As important as individual Soldier tasks are, we all know that these efforts support a team and that the \\n              whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Every team has a leader, and that leader is responsible for what the team does \\n              or fails to do. That is why obeying orders is the critical essence of discipline."},{"1":"Diversity in Team","2":"Emergent","3":"Differences in team members in areas such as background, religion, race,\\n                socioeconomic status, or areas of expertise. Includes diversity in skill and background.","4":"Variation in upbringing, culture, \\n              religious belief, and tradition is reflected among those who choose to serve in the Army. Such diversity provides many \\n              benefits for a force globally engaged around the world. Good leaders value this diversity of outlook and experience and \\n              must treat all individuals with the inherent dignity and respect due every person."},{"1":"Negative Qualities","2":"Emergent","3":"If paired with a code, it talks about\\n                that other code in a bad way. If on its own, it describes a negative quality or behavior like over drinking.","4":"Misunderstands or fails to perceive\\n              nonverbal cues. Ideas not well organized or easily understandable. Speaks without considering listener interest.\\n              Information dissemination is inconsistent or untimely."},{"1":"Team Succes","2":"A Priori","3":"Describe what it means to be a successful team or how team success may be measured.","4":"High performance teams demonstrate mental agility (see ADRP 6-22)\\n              in their willingness to approach problems from different viewpoints and to hold and work on opposing ideas until identifying \\n              the best solution"},{"1":"Shared Vision","2":"Emergent","3":"Common and clear goals and vision\\n                that members of a team identify with and uphold. This is on a smaller level, for example your unit knows exactly what your expected\\n                outcome is.","4":"Shared vision exists when members of the team have a common understanding of the following: The overall \\n              mission or objective. Goals and sub-goals of the mission. Strategies for reaching those goals. Team members’ strengths and weaknesses. \\n              Values and preferences of the team as a whole and among the individual members. The roles each member will play and want. \\n              The big picture (such as how this particular mission contributes to a larger purpose)."},{"1":"Team Building","2":"A Priori","3":"Actions or processes that encourage members to work together.","4":"The team-building approach addresses\\n              the interaction and relationships among team members essential to collaboration and critical to high performance.\\n              It accelerates collaboration by allowing the team members to further develop qualities of shared vision, trust, competence, \\n              and confidence among team members. It is a streamlined approach designed to break through barriers and boundaries that stagnate\\n              team development."},{"1":"Responsibility","2":"A Priori","3":"Individuals are dependable, reliable, and make\\n                every effort to keep their promises.","4":"The general responsibilities of a Soldier are as follows: Obey the lawful orders of NCOs and Officers. \\n              Treat others with dignity and respect. Complete each task to the very best degree possible and not just to standard. \\n              Maintain a military appearance. Maintain individual physical fitness standards and readiness. Maintain individual equipment \\n              and clothing to standard."},{"1":"Cooperation","2":"Emergent","3":"Measures agreeableness, trust, skepticism and suspicion; the extent an individual is\\n                easy or difficult to get along with. Includes cohesion.","4":"Exemplifies a positive attitude and expectations for a productive work environment. \\n              Conveys a priority for development within the organization. Encourages innovative, critical, and creative thought. \\n              Leverages lessons learned to improve organization."},{"1":"Influence","2":"Emergent","3":"Having an effect or influence on another person or organization.","4":"Projects self-confidence and inspires confidence in others.\\n              Models composure, an outward calm, and control over emotions in adverse situations. Manages personal stress, and remains \\n              supportive of stress in others."},{"1":"Intellectual Effciency","2":"A Priori","3":"Measures a person’s ability to analyze and process information, astuteness or obtuseness. For innovation, use this & adaptability\\n                Includes efficiency in skill.","4":"Demonstrates expert-level proficiency with technical aspects of job. Demonstrates understanding \\n              of joint, cultural and geopolitical knowledge. Conveys knowledge of technical, technological, and tactical systems to\\n              subordinates and others."},{"1":"Negation of Positive Qualities","2":"Emergent","3":"This makes any positive quality negative. It must also be selected with a positive quality.\\n                For example, if a passage described poor communication, you would select this and then communication.","4":"Communication frequency was negatively related to both ROI and sales growth, contrary to what had \\n              been hypothesized. Smith et al. (1994) suggested that perhaps communication frequency is indicative of high levels of conflict \\n              in the group, and that the time spent on group maintenance detracts from performance."},{"1":"Adaptability","2":"A Priori","3":"Assesses the ability\\n                to alter one's course, and perceived cognitive flexibility. For innovation, use this & intellectual efficiency.","4":"Models a flexible mindset and anticipates\\n              changing conditions. Engages in multiple approaches when assessing, conceptualizing, and evaluating a course of action."},{"1":"Team Orientation","2":"A Priori","3":"Measures a person’s tendency to prefer working in teams and make people work together better.","4":"The success of\\n              the U.S. Army is related directly to the quality of the professional relationships between its Soldiers, NCOs, and officers. \\n              The relationship between an individual Soldier, team, squad, and platoon with their NCO/officer is the cornerstone of our Army. \\n              When that bond forms, it can have the single most important impact on unit effectiveness and efficiency. Conversely, if that bond is broken,\\n              it can have a devastating impact on morale, esprit de corps, readiness, and mission accomplishment."},{"1":"Commitment to Serve","2":"A Priori","3":"Measures a person’s level of identification with the military and their strength of desire to serve their country.","4":"The pride, esprit, and ethos\\n              required of Soldiers as members of the Profession of Arms may require them to sacrifice themselves willingly to preserve the Nation,\\n              accomplish the mission, or protect the lives of fellow Soldiers."},{"1":"Communication","2":"A Priori","3":"Exchange of information between individuals. Includes verbal and non-verbal.","4":"The questioning creates dialogue, which improves awareness and\\n              leads to a higher degree of actionable understanding. Through the dialogue, the team develops shared understanding and trust. \\n              When coaching a team exercise: Frame initial questions to clarify the task and the situation. There will often be disagreements on both.\\n              Find common ground. Try to get the team to come to agreement on one issue. Build to another agreement. When there is disagreement,\\n              try to get at the specifics of what is disagreed upon, before building to said Agreement."},{"1":"Integrity","2":"Emergent","3":"Having honest and strong moral principles.","4":"Character is comprised of a person’s\\n              moral and ethical qualities, helps determine what is right, and gives a leader motivation to do what is appropriate, regardless of \\n              the circumstances or consequences. It determines who people are, how they act, helps determine right from wrong, and choose what is right."}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[3]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}

<p>Above this is complete list of the all the codes used along with examples. To look more in depth at the themes, patterns, convergences, similarities, and differences lets examine more specific instances within the documents to highlight key findings.</p>
</div>
<div id="negative-qualities-vs.-negation-of-positive-qualities" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Negative Qualities vs. Negation of Positive Qualities</em></h3>
<p><img src="www/negationVSnegative.png" /> The excerpt on the left shows communication as a negative quality to possess in a team, while the excerpt on the right shows communication as a negation of a positive quality in a team. This shows the difference in qualities not desired in teams compared to the effects of the absence of desired qualities in teams. For example, if someone is a poor communicator, they lack a quality that would help the team succeed. In turn, communication is seen as a poor quality to possess because it can cause high levels of group conflict. In terms of the Army's goals, that can lead to lack in efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="diversity-in-background-vs.-diversity-in-skill" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Diversity in Background vs. Diversity in Skill</em></h3>
<div class="figure">
<img src="www/diversityINteams.png" />

</div>
<p>The excerpt on the left is from a non-Army document and the one on the right is from an Army handbook. The non-Army document is talking about diversity in teams in terms of individual skill and how this can contribute to overall better team performance. The Army quotes are referring to diversity in teams in terms of individual background, upbringing, and culture. An interesting note is that the top quote from the Army handbook see diversity in background as a possible downfall to team performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="adaptability-vs.-intellectual-efficiency" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Adaptability vs. Intellectual Efficiency</em></h3>
<div class="figure">
<img src="www/adaptabilityVSintellect.png" />

</div>
<p>The excerpt on the left was coded as 'Adaptability' and the excerpt on the right was coded as 'Intellectual Efficiency' and all excerpts were taken from Army documents. During in depth reading of these documents, a debate among these two codes emerged: What is the difference between intellectual efficiency and adaptability. Underlined in the excerpts is the same wording used to describe two different codes. In order to be adaptable one must be able to think critically. However, the highlighted text shows the key distinction between the two. Intellectual efficiency is a person's ability to analyze and process information. This also includes efficiency in skill. As mentioned in the top right Army excerpt efficiency is skill includes experiences, training, education, and so on. These are things not necessarily required in order to be adaptable. Intellectual efficiency includes reasoning and brain power. While, adaptability focuses on quick responses and flexibility of the mind in order to thrive in a 'high operational tempo'.</p>
