#**Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)**
The project used document analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify characteristics of individual Soldiers that contribute to or influence unit performance. NLP validated the themes identified by the coders using qualitative analysis and highlight the degree to which specific themes (e.g., adaptability, commitment to serve) are associated with different word clusters.

#**Overview**  
Using qualitative analysis and a thematic approach, we interpreted Army and non-Army documents to give meaning to our phenomena of interest (individual contributions to unit performance) and triangulated for credibility. We tagged the documents with codes related to our research question using a software called Dedoose. The goal was to reach a saturation of themes to a point where we no longer found new emergent themes. Having reached saturation, we reformulated our codes and had secondary coders test them for relative agreement. We identified 18 major interrelated themes that inform the way individuals can contribute to unit performance, such as the way people communicate, a focus on personal integrity, and building a shared vision across team members. We noted several differences in the themes emphasized by Army documents compared to academic literature. We further triangulated our findings using NLP to build a topic model and word co-occurrence map, which we compared against our qualitative analysis results. The findings from the NLP converged on the themes we identified through coding, demonstrating that these themes appeared many times throughout all the documents. Our results will inform and contextualize future quantitative modeling of Army performance.

# **Data**   
A corpus of 10 documents – eight Army publications and two from academic literature – regarding an individual's role in team performance was created.

# **Method**

###*Document Analysis*  
Document analysis is a “form of qualitative research in which documents are interpreted by the researcher to give voice and meaning around an assessment topic" (Bowen, 2009)

###*Natural Language Processing*  
Natural language processing (NLP) "strives to build machines that understand and respond to text data much the same way humans do" (IBM, 2022).

All NLP for this project was run on a corpus of the 10 documents on which document analysis was conducted. The documents were cleaned by removing stop words (e.g., the, and, of) and lemmatizing each word. Lemmatizing transforms each word to a common base word (e.g., running, runs to run).

  
####*Co-occurrence*
Co-occurrence visualizes word pairs that occur together most frequently in the corpus.

####*Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)*  
TF-IDF is a text classification method that reflects the importance of a word to a document in a corpus of documents.  
  
####*Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)*  
LDA is a Bayesian topic model that discovers the topics in a corpus of documents and the concurrent probability that they will occur.
