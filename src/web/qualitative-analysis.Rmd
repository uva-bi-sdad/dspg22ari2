```



Above this is complete list of the all the codes used along with examples. To look more in depth at the themes, patterns, convergences, similarities, and differences lets examine more specific instances within the documents to highlight key findings.

###*Negative Qualities vs. Negation of Positive Qualities*

The excerpt on the left shows communication as a negative quality to possess in a team, while the excerpt on the right shows communication as a negation of a positive quality in a team. This shows the difference in qualities not desired in teams compared to the effects of the absence of desired qualities in teams. For example, if someone is a poor communicator, they lack a quality that would help the team succeed. In turn, communication is seen as a poor quality to possess because it can cause high levels of group conflict. In terms of the Army's goals, that can lead to lack in efficiency. 


###*Diversity in Background vs. Diversity in Skill*

The excerpt on the left is from a non-Army document and the one on the right is from an Army handbook. The non-Army document is talking about diversity in teams in terms of individual skill and how this can contribute to overall better team performance. The Army quotes are referring to diversity in teams in terms of individual background, upbringing, and culture. An interesting note is that the top quote from the Army handbook see diversity in background as a possible downfall to team performance. 

###*Adaptability vs. Intellectual Efficiency*
![](www/adaptabilityVSintellect.png)

The excerpt on the left was coded as 'Adaptability' and the excerpt on the right was coded as 'Intellectual Efficiency' and all excerpts were taken from Army documents. During in depth reading of these documents, a debate among these two codes emerged: What is the difference between intellectual efficiency and adaptability. Underlined in the excerpts is the same wording used to describe two different codes. In order to be adaptable one must be able to think critically. However, the highlighted text shows the key distinction between the two. Intellectual efficiency is a person's ability to analyze and process information. This also includes efficiency in skill. As mentioned in the top right Army excerpt efficiency is skill includes experiences, training, education, and so on. These are things not necessarily required in order to be adaptable. Intellectual efficiency includes reasoning and brain power. While, adaptability focuses on quick responses and flexibility of the mind in order to thrive in a 'high operational tempo'.
